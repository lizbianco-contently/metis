Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct an \nhour of morning business with the first 30 minutes under the control of \nthe Democratic leader and the second 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Hutchison or her designee. Following morning business, the \nSenate will then begin consideration of H.R. 2989, the Transportation, \nTreasury, and general government appropriations bill. I have had some \ndiscussions with the Democratic leadership regarding some of the \npossible amendments. I will be talking to Senator Shelby, who will be \nmanaging that bill, regarding his expectations. We do anticipate \namendments over the course of today's session. Rollcall votes will \noccur. We are willing to remain in session into the evening, if \nnecessary, to complete the bill today or tonight.\n  The Transportation appropriations bill is one of the six remaining \nappropriations bills the Senate must consider before we adjourn this \nyear. It will continue to take a great deal of cooperation on both \nsides of the aisle to complete action on these bills in a timely \nfashion. I hope we can work together. I am confident we will be able to \nwork together in this fashion so that we can complete these bills in an \nexpedited way.\n  On another matter, last week, by a large bipartisan vote, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee reported the nomination of Mike \nLeavitt to Administrator of the EPA. Chairman Inhofe came to the floor \nyesterday to try to reach an agreement to debate the nomination and \nthen proceed to a vote. There was an objection from my Democratic \ncolleagues. I have read that several Democratic Senators have placed a \nhold on the nomination, and I therefore want to put the Senate on \nnotice: This nomination is for the Cabinet of the President of the \nUnited States. I believe it is irresponsible to allow a vacancy to \ncontinue in that position. That position clearly speaks to very \nimportant concerns that are before the American people.\n  Thus, we will move forward on this nomination. If it is necessary, I \nwill file cloture to allow the Senate to work its will on this nominee. \nIf Senators want to vote against the nomination, we will give them that \nopportunity. They will have that opportunity. Therefore, if we are \nunable to consider this nomination under some sort of reasonable time \nlimitation, I will move to proceed to its consideration and file the \nnecessary motion.\n  I thank my colleagues and I hope all Members will reconsider the \nobjections they have put forward.\n  Each morning, I comment on a range of bills that we will address \nbefore we adjourn. We made real headway with the anti-spam legislation \nyesterday, coming back to appropriations shortly this morning. We still \nhave fair credit reporting on which we are making progress, but we need \nto get that to the floor. I think we will be able to do that under a \nshort time agreement. We have the issue surrounding the CARE Act which \nI mentioned when we closed last night. We have the Internet moratorium \nwhich we need to address this week or next week. I am confident we will \nbe able to do so.\n\n[[Page S13068]]\n\n  There is another bill at the desk I hope we can work on over the \ncourse of today or tomorrow, the Syria Accountability Act. Another \nissue we have been working on in a bipartisan way and I want to address \nbefore we adjourn is the issue of gun liability.\n  One final comment has to do with an entirely different issue, and \nthat is the progress being made in Sudan. Secretary Powell has made \nstatements, after a recent visit there, that real progress is being \nmade in terms of peace in a country that has been in a civil war for \nthe last 20 years. Over 2 million people have died in Sudan, and over 5 \nmillion people have been displaced from their homes as a product of \nthis civil war.\n\n  I go to southern Sudan each year as part of medical mission works. I \nwas just there about 5 or 6 weeks ago. I want to share my optimistic \nview, based on that recent visit working in hospitals and with patients \nand with civilians in southern Sudan, that this peace act is making \nreal progress. I think the United States has played a major role in \nfacilitating the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13068-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the update of the majority \nleader this morning. I commend him for coming back to the \nappropriations bills. No one cares more about that than the President \npro tempore. There is a lot of interest on both sides of the aisle in \nworking diligently to try to finish the appropriations bills this week \nand next week.\n  I am a little concerned about the longer list of other items the \nmajority leader mentioned, even though I recognize many of us share his \ndesire to bring up these bills at some point soon. I hope we can reach \nagreement on the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the next day or so, so we \ncan accommodate its consideration. The Internet tax bill is something I \nthink we ought to be able to work through as well.\n  He didn't mention but there is still a possibility that we could \nreach some agreement on asbestos or on class action as we work over the \nnext couple of weeks. I have indicated, in the most heartfelt way, that \nwe would like to negotiate and work with him to find ways to address \nthose issues. He didn't mention them, but I know they are priorities of \nhis as well.\n  We have a lot of work to do in a very short period of time. But I \nthink it is important, first and foremost, to try to finish these \nappropriations bills in a way that will allow us to conference each \nbill and then work to try to resolve our differences with the House.\n  I still have, unfortunately, grave reservations about the way we have \nconducted our conferences. I read more about what happens in conference \nas the Democratic leader than I get from even my Democratic Members who \nare supposed to be conferees. We can't conduct business that way. I am \nconcerned about that. It will affect, of course, our ability to go to \nconference on future bills, even if we are able to pass them here.\n  We are off to a good start today on appropriations. I hope we can \ndeal with Transportation, the District of Columbia, other bills that \ndeserve our consideration.\n  I think we will receive a fairly expeditious review and debate so we \ncan move these bills on. I thank the majority leader for his update. I \nlook forward to working with him throughout the day.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am a little hesitant to add to my list of \nthings to do after what we just heard. But as my colleague, Senator \nDaschle, mentioned, on the class action legislation I think we made \nheadway yesterday. With that vote yesterday, a lot of people have come \nforward and said this is something we can do. Asbestos is something we \nare working on diligently as well.\n  I wish to add one other thing, and that is Healthy Forests. We are \nvery close on that as well. It is an important issue to the American \npeople. I think that, too, is one we can complete before we adjourn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13068-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am speaking today on what I \nthink is an extremely important issue that is getting a considerable \namount of attention today, and that is the prescription drug benefit as \npart of the Medicare Program, which is also being considered in \nconference at this very moment.\n  As the minority leader has said, very often it is possible to read \nmore about what is going on in the conference on Medicare than it is to \nfind out this kind of information here. I might point out, as a matter \nof personal interest, one of the major reasons Nebraska has a \nunicameral legislature is that they wanted to do away with the \nconference committee system. At times, that certainly appeals to me \nback here.\n  I come to the floor today to discuss this critically important issue \nthat is now being considered in the prescription drug bill, and that is \nretaining retiree health benefits. If this problem is not addressed--\nand from some of the information I am receiving through various \nsources, it may be under consideration at this moment--but if it is not \naddressed and solved, my colleagues and I will be forced to choose \nbetween the impossible--the haves and the have-nots--those who have \ncoverage as retirees, with benefits being provided by a former \nemployer, and want to keep it, and those who don't have the coverage \nand need it.\n  It will be a war between seniors. It is an impossible decision that \nshould not have to be made. Our first priority should be first to do no \nharm. Usually, we are faced with decisions between children and \nseniors, between this group and that group--a group typically seeking \nadditional help. It is always a double-edged sword, but it is an \nimpossible decision that this Senate and this Congress should not and \nmust not make.\n  I know this issue is also important to the conferees. They have been \ngrappling with trying to make sure that those who have coverage keep it \nwhile those who need coverage get it. News reports today suggest they \nare close to reaching some sort of deal on how to entice employers to \ncontinue to provide retiree benefits. I commend them for their work in \ntrying to get that done and addressing that issue. I hope they are \nsuccessful in being able to accomplish it.\n  Employer-sponsored retiree health benefits are the single greatest \nsource of coverage for retirees, providing drug coverage for one in \nthree Medicare beneficiaries. Retiree coverage is declining, though, \nand it is declining dramatically. Just 34 percent of all large firms--\n200 or more workers--offered retiree benefits in 2002. That is down \nfrom 68 percent of all large firms in 1988. In a little more than 10 \nyears, the number has been cut in half. But there are still those who \npresently receive the benefits, and we cannot ignore the fact that they \ndo have those benefits.\n  Drug costs continue to constitute 40 to 60 percent of employers' \nretiree health care costs, and steep price increases are prompting \nemployers to eliminate drug benefits, cap their contributions, or drop \nretiree coverage altogether. The spiraling costs relating to \nprescription drugs continue to threaten the continued provision of \nthose benefits.\n  Due to budget constraints, the Senate and House bills use the \ndefinition of out-of-pocket costs that would not\n\n[[Page S13069]]\n\nallow employer contributions to count for meeting the catastrophic cap \non beneficiary spending.\n  This means, in understandable terms, that retirees with employer-\nprovided coverage will get less of a benefit than other seniors. In \nfact, under the Senate bill, retirees would need closer to $10,000 in \ndrug costs before the stop-loss protection would apply, well after the \n$5,800 cap that applies to all other beneficiaries. And employers that \nchoose to wrap around the Medicare benefit would be subject to a gap in \ncoverage that doesn't end.\n  As a result, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated slightly \nmore than one-third of retirees will lose their employer coverage, \nmaking more than 4 million Medicare beneficiaries worse off at a time \nwhen we are trying to make them better off.\n  Although Congress may claim this formula will save money for \nMedicare, any provision that encourages employers to drop their retiree \nbenefits will only end up costing the Federal Government more and hurt \nmillions of seniors in the process. Seniors who have retiree benefits \nhave worked a lifetime and have made wage concessions over the years \nwith the expectation that they would have retiree benefits in exchange. \nTo change the rules of the game at this point and give them less than \nthe other Medicare beneficiaries is, in a word, unfair.\n  Congress must now enact a drug benefit that recognizes employers that \nare doing the right thing, continuing to provide their retirees these \nvery important benefits, because to do otherwise will further threaten \nretiree coverage and will drive millions more seniors to Medicare for \nthe coverage they used to get from their employers. This is a choice \nthat might be put before us, but this is not a choice we should make. \nWe should not have to decide between Lee and George and Mary and John. \nThese are not decisions that this Congress should be forced to make. \nThere are solutions.\n  I am encouraged when I hear the conferees are looking at these \nsolutions, but I encourage, in the most dramatic way possible, that \nthey not only continue to work, but they find solutions that are \nworkable, because without that the choice is an impossible one and I \nthink threatens whether or not this body will pass a Medicare plan that \nprovides prescription drugs for retirees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13069-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRISONERS OF WAR PROTECTION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a brave Nevadan by the name of LTC Jeffrey \nTice was in the first Iraq war. He was flying an F-16 when it was hit \nby enemy fire. The plane went down. He was initially captured by Iraqi \ntroops who were roaming the desert. He was, shortly thereafter, taken \nto the Iraqi authorities, which began 46 days of terror. He was held in \ncaptivity and tortured by the Iraqis for these 46 days.\n  During the time he was there, he endured brutalities that are \ndifficult to describe. They intended to break his spirit and his body. \nFor example, he was forced to play Russian roulette. You know that \nRussian roulette only is a valid game when the revolver has bullets in \nthe chamber. And, of course, he was forced to play Russian roulette \nwith a loaded weapon. With the same pistol, he was beaten about the \nhead. Among other things, his jaw was dislocated, his eardrum was \npunctured, and on other occasions he was beaten on the head. His legs \nwere beaten with a wooden plank until he could not walk. He had an \nelectric wire tied around his head. The shocks received were so severe \nthat his body curled up in a fetal position violently, with every \nmuscle in his body contracting in pain.\n  These are only some of the things the Iraqi regime did to Colonel \nTice. They did not break his spirit, but they did harm his body. Today, \nthese many years later, he still suffers physical problems as a result \nof the torture. Not only does he have physical problems, he still \nsuffers pain as a result of the torture.\n  In 1996, we passed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which \nallowed State Department-designated terrorist states, including Iraq, \nto be held liable for personal injuries suffered by torture victims, \nincluding American POWs. In November of 2002, President Bush signed the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Act, which included a provision designed to \nensure that Americans could collect court-ordered damages from the \nfrozen assets of terrorist states. During this time, 17 gulf war POWs \nand their families sued the Republic of Iraq. Saddam Hussein was also \nsued, as well as the Iraqi Intelligence Service.\n  They filed these actions to seek justice for themselves--like Colonel \nTice, those people who were brutalized--and to prevent future torture \nof others. In July, Judge Richard Roberts of the Federal district court \nruled against Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service, \nand found them liable for the torture of these POWs. In his opinion, \nJudge Roberts said, among other things, the importance of his decision \nwas to deter the future torture of American POWs.\n  His judgment was correct. It was appropriate. But the State \nDepartment and Justice Department have refused to honor it. Earlier \nthis year, the President confiscated the $1.7 billion in Iraqi assets \nthat have been held in private banks since 1990. The money was sent \nback to Baghdad for use in the reconstruction, a move which effectively \nblocked the efforts of tortured POWs to collect judgments in their \nfavor. The administration has continued to spend this money knowing \nfull well this judgment is pending.\n  At the same time, the Department of Justice asked Judge Roberts to \nallow it to intervene in the case, stating its intention to have the \njudgment erased. Judge Roberts, in his wisdom, declined to allow this.\n  These brave POWs made great sacrifices to protect the freedoms we \nhave, the ability we have to salute the flag and to do things we take \nfor granted. They now need our help.\n  I am pleased to report the Senate took action last week to uphold the \nrights of the POWs and all Americans to be free from torture, hostage-\ntaking, and acts of terrorism committed by foreign dictators and \ntyrants. My amendment, which was accepted as part of the supplemental \nIraqi budget request, makes perfectly clear the longstanding intent of \nCongress that those who torture and abuse U.S. citizens can and should \nbe held accountable.\n  Saddam Hussein was a tyrant who committed despicable acts. He \ncommitted atrocities against his own people and against Americans. In \nfact, as we speak, many believe he is behind the continuing attacks \nthat are taking place in Iraq today.\n  Now, in a real irony--or, perhaps better stated, an unreal irony--our \nJustice Department is trying to shield Saddam and his former regime \nfrom the accountability American law demands. My amendment, which was \naccepted, would have protected the rights of private citizens, \nincluding three brave Nevadans who were captured, taken hostage, and \nused as human shields by Saddam Hussein during his first gulf war. All \nof these brave heroes who were tortured at the hands of Saddam Hussein \nare merely seeking to hold Iraq accountable for its crimes and deter \nthe torture of any American citizen by a terrorist state in the future.\n\n  The civilized world cannot let such crimes go unpunished. The \nperpetrators must be held to account. I hope the conferees and the \nPresident will accept this amendment in the conference and not let the \ncurrent system go forward.\n  Justice must prevail, and if these people are not allowed to go \nforward with the judgment they have obtained and the protection they \ndemand, it would not be a good day for American justice.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is a personal privilege for me to rise \ntoday to recognize the contributions and many accomplishments of Mr. \nPeter Dorn, a valued and long time professional staff member of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. Pete will be leaving our staff \nthis month after 33 years of dedicated service to our Nation.\n  Pete Dorn is the epitome of the professional staffer and he has \nserved the Senate and the Intelligence Committee in an outstanding \nexemplary manner since he joined the committee's staff in 1991. From \nadvising, if not educating Members, as their professional liaison to \ndrafting legislation or conducting special investigations and projects \nto implementing and improving the intelligence budget, he and his work \nwill be sorely missed.\n  Pete Dorn's service to our country is quite a pedigree. In 1971, \nfollowing his graduation from the State University of New York, Pete \nbegan serving his country as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He \nspent 6 years in the infantry and special operations arena before \ntransferring to Marine Corps Intelligence. It was a perfect military \noccupational and operational fit. For the rest of his Marine career, he \nhoned his skills as an intelligence analyst and staff officer serving \nthe Pacific Joint Intelligence Center, the Overseas Military Air \nGroups, the Commander of the Pacific Fleet, Headquarters, Marine Corps \nand the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Program staff.\n  He could not have been better prepared to continue his service in \nintelligence work and he did so as he continued his career in the White \nHouse as a budget and legislative analyst at the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. He then served as program and budget analyst at \nthe Director of Central Intelligence's Crime and Counter-narcotics \nCenter.\n  In 1991, Pete's budgeting, intelligence and military experience made \nhim a prime candidate for a professional staff position on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. He has served us as a budget monitor \nand as a staff liaison to Senator Richard Shelby and to myself and \ncurrently, Senator Saxby Chambliss. Pete also serves the committee as \nstaff director for research and analysis.\n  As in the case of many staff members and for that matter, Senators \nand Members of Congress as well, the laundry list of positions and \ntitles does not tell the real story. The real story regarding Pete Dorn \nis that he is truly a patriot, has made a real difference in \nintelligence work, budgeting and legislation and as a consequence \nhelped make our country a safer Nation. After 9/11, it was Pete Dorn \nwho helped me to realize that although the Intelligence Community \npossessed great collection assets, we had a long way to go in terms of \nour analytical capability. It is our analytical product that is then \nturned over to the decision makers that contained mixed and delayed \nreporting. It has been my goal as chairman to see that this is changed. \nIn this regard Pete Dorn has been my adviser. Personally, he has made a \ndifference in my life and how I look at public service. He believes the \nrole of intelligence is absolutely crucial to our national security, \nand when he sees things that should be corrected or a miscarriage of \njustice or something awry in his family--i.e., the intelligence \ncommunity--he will not stop until he does everything possible to set \nthings right.\n\n  The case of our ``captured and whereabouts unknown'' gulf war Navy \npilot, CAPT Scott Speicher, is a classic example. We will not rest \nuntil the fate of this pilot is known. The person who did not rest and \nwho pressed for better intelligence and honest answers was Pete Dorn--\nnot only for Scott Speicher and his family but for every warfighter who \nwears the uniform.\n  We now have legislation that changes the way we handle our prisoners \nof war and those missing in action. The credit for that legislation \ngoes to Pete Dorn.\n  There are many other examples I could outline, some classified and \nsome not. Simply said, Pete Dorn's perseverance and commitment to our \ncountry and fellowman has been remarkable. Thank you, Pete, for putting \nup with and educating me, from a new member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee to my current position as chairman. Thank you for your \nfriendship and advice.\n  Vice Chairman Rockefeller and the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, both past and present, who have enjoyed and benefited from \ntheir association with Pete extend their personal thanks for his \nexceptional dedication, his loyalty, his integrity, and his \ndistinguished service. We wish all the best to Pete and his wife \nKathleen, and to the entire Dorn family.\n  So, thanks again, Pete. And, from one marine to another, well done, \nand Semper Fi.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 23 minutes 47 seconds.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13070-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13070-S13071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I wish to talk about jobs. I am a \nformer mayor. As mayor, I learned a long time ago that the best welfare \nprogram is a job; the best housing program is a job; access to health \ncare comes through a job. With jobs and with work, there is a sense of \ndignity and a sense of worth.\n  People would often ask me as a mayor, What are you doing for kids? My \nresponse would be, One of the best things I could do for kids was to \nmake sure that mom and dad had a job. Jobs are fundamentally important.\n  The reality is that the American economy over the last few years has \ntaken some very big hits. A lot of people have found themselves out of \nwork. When you are out of work, the anxiety level rises, the sense of \nsecurity in your family is challenged. It hurts, and it hurts a lot. \nCertainly the recession that began before President Bush was elected--\nthe recession began just as he took office--had an impact on jobs. \nAmerica took that terrible blow of terrorism on September 11, which \nshook the foundations of the economy. You can't have economic security \nwithout national security; People are in fear. There was a great loss \nto the economic activity, certainly in New York and Washington and \nthroughout this country. The impact of 9/11 cannot be underestimated.\n  On top of that, we faced corporate America acting in a way that upset \na lot of us, as it should have. Scandals within Enron and WorldCom \nundermined the trust, undermined the confidence that the average \nAmerican had in our economic system, in the market. The stock market, \nby the way, I don't think is a valuer of the economy; it is an \nindicator of confidence in the economy or lack thereof.\n  The fact is, Americans were not very confident when they looked at \nthe corporate greed and the excess and the manipulation and a few folks \nat the top making money and folks at the bottom being hurt. That is a \nbad thing.\n  In this Congress, before I got here, we acted on that. I praise the \nfolks who stepped forward. But the reality was a great undermining of \nconfidence in the economy and the economy suffered and Americans \nsuffered.\n  Then this President stepped forward and said the way to change what \nhas happened in the economy is to cut taxes. Goodness gracious, there \nwere a lot of folks--my colleagues on the other side, they were just \noutraged. Cutting taxes, how can you do that? How can you cut taxes at \na time of economic need? How can you cut taxes at a time the economy is \nsuffering? It will just plunge us further into debt.\n  The President's commonsense perspective, and one that I share, is \nthat the things we do should put money in the pockets of moms and dads. \nThen they spend that money. If they spend that money on a good or on a \nservice, the person who is producing that good or providing that \nservice has a job. So by cutting taxes, having moms and dads spend \nmoney, is better than the Government spending money. It is better than \ncreating another program.\n  This President thought we had to do those things to incur business \ninvestment. The last tax cut we passed--Madam President, I was sitting \nin that chair when the budget was passed, when we first got in office \nthis year. We passed it by a 50-to-50 vote, and the Vice President had \nto come and step\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\nforward. We passed that tax cut and in that we provided things such as \nbonus depreciation, providing incentives for business to make \nexpenditures. When they make expenditures and capital expenditures, \nthey are going to grow jobs.\n\n  There were many who said, How can you cut taxes at a time when we are \nin economic distress? The reality is, we do it because that is the way \nyou grow jobs, and we are seeing that. We are seeing it in the data \nthat is coming out. I will talk a little bit about that. But I want to \nstep back and say the reason I am so passionate about this is not \nbecause it is part of a political party's platform, not because it is \nan ideological statement; it is because I have seen it work.\n  I was mayor of a capital city. I got elected in 1993. When I was \nelected, the city was economically dying. It was not doing well. One of \nthe ways to value that is the value of taxable property. In downtown \nSt. Paul, it was over $700 million. When I got elected to office in \n1993, took office in 1994, the value of taxable property was $300 \nmillion. It had lost half the value of property. I realized we had to \ndo those things to grow jobs, so what did we do?\n  We kept the lid on taxes. I made a commitment, saying we were not \ngoing to raise taxes in the city of St. Paul. You know, we didn't raise \ntaxes in the 8 years I was in office--zero increase in the tax levee. \nWe also cut three-quarters of the licenses to do business.\n  There were those who were saying, You are giving these benefits to \nbusiness. Why are you doing that? I did it because I believed if you \ndid those things that keep a lid on taxes, you would encourage \ninvestment. I believed if you kept a lid on those things that were \nincreasing the cost of doing business, you would grow investment.\n  By the time I left office there were 18,000 more jobs in my city. The \nfact is, by cutting taxes, by stimulating those things that generate \ninvestment, you grow jobs.\n  There may be folks who argue about that, but it is like the economist \nI described. Economists, sometimes, are those folks who see something \nworking in reality and they tell you why it can't work in theory.\n  Cutting taxes works in reality. You cut taxes, it works. My \ncolleague, the Senator from Idaho, quietly mouths: ``You know, it works \nin theory, too.'' And it does. I have seen it work in reality. This is \nnot about theory or ideology for me. This is not imagining what could \nbe or should be or might be. This is about what is.\n  The reality is we are seeing it today. We are seeing us coming out of \nthat long slide--not fast enough for me; We have to grow jobs at a \nfaster rate. But we see us coming out of the slide. We see it in the \ndata coming out. Consumption in the third quarter topped 12 percent at \nan annual rate, translating to 6 percent growth in gross domestic \nproduct in the last quarter. You have to contrast that with the first \nquarter of 2003. The growth was 1.4 percent. Tax cuts are making a \ndifference. Tax cuts are taking hold. Jobs are growing. Jobless claims \ncontinue to fall to their lowest level since last February. Production \nin our plants and factories grew in the third quarter at a 3.5 percent \nannual rate. Contrast that to the negative growth in industrial \nproduction in the second quarter at 3.2 percent.\n\n  Homebuilders started building over 1.9 million new homes on an annual \nbasis, according to the last report. Inflation is well under control at \nan annual rate of 2.3 percent. I believe that is about a 37-year low.\n  Finally, we are getting consumer confidence. That is what it is \nabout. No one jumps a sinking ship. No one invests in something they \nthink will fail. On the other hand, if they have a sense there is hope \nand optimism, people invest. It is about hope and optimism.\n  That is what tax cuts have done. They have generated a sense of hope \nand a sense of optimism. More importantly, they have put money in \npeople's pockets. They have encouraged investment. Sixty-four percent \nof Americans, according to most recent surveys, predict the economy \nwill be stronger a year from now. That is up from 55 percent last \nFebruary. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say the economy is stronger \nthan it was 3 years ago.\n  We have a way to go in order to move this economy forward. But the \nway you change the economy is not doing it like a racetrack and racing \naround the bends in fast turns. You grow an economy in many ways. But \nyou see the results. It is kind of like turning an ocean liner around \nin the middle of the ocean; you have to get it moving in the right \ndirection.\n  The President's tax cuts have the economy moving in the right \ndirection. The economy is moving in the right direction. Americans know \nthat. Americans understand that. Let us stay that course. Let us \ncontinue to do that which generates investment, generates hope, and \nthat grows jobs. It is the path we are on. It is the path the President \nset forth, which I support. It is the right path not just in theory but \nin reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I simply say to my friend from Minnesota, \nbefore he gets too excited about the economy doing so well, that that \nexplanation should be given to the 3 million people who have lost jobs \nduring this administration. This is the first President since Herbert \nHoover who has had a net job loss during his tenure in office. I hope \nthere is a turnaround. But before we come here and start giving \nspeeches about how great the economy is, we need to explain that the \neconomy is losing jobs on a monthly basis. We are not losing as many as \nwe did, that is true, but we are still losing jobs. People need to \nwork.\n  This is the worst job creation record of any modern President. It is \nthe weakest economic growth under any President in 50 years. If there \nis a recovery, it is certainly jobless. Poverty is increasing. Real \nincome is falling. We have a record deficit. No one seems to mention \nthat.\n  There were cheers from the Department of Commerce this year that the \ndeficit--when you add in the surplus of Social Security--is only about \n$500 billion. They were cheering about that. There is a record deficit. \nThere is a record debt increase. We are going to have to increase it \nagain before this next summer is out. It is the worst fiscal reversal \nin history.\n  Keep in mind that during the last years of the Clinton \nadministration, we were actually spending less Government money than we \nwere taking in. There has been about a $3 trillion loss in market value \nin the stock market.\n  I think the time is a little premature to start coming here and \ngiving cheerleading speeches about the greatness of the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Madam President. I think we will have a \ndiscussion about forestry. I see my colleagues from Idaho and \nMississippi.\n  I will take just a few minutes because I think in recent days there \nhas really been the suggestion that in some ways Senate Democrats don't \nwant to move ahead on this forestry issue. Senator Daschle, in \nparticular, in my view, has been very constructive on this issue and \nwants to have the Senate vote on this legislation.\n  I wish to make it clear that I think it is urgent we vote on this \nbill before the Senate adjourns for this year. I happen to believe \nthere are 60 votes for the Senate compromise that has been worked out. \nI think it is important to address the concerns of all the Members.\n  I really hope this isn't left to just the political season, which \ngets awfully silly sometimes in the course of a Presidential election \nseason next year. I think the Senate must vote on it this year. \nSenators know that this issue sort of makes Middle East politics look \nnoncontroversial. This is a very difficult and contentious subject. But \nI think the Senate has come together around an important compromise.\n  I wish to take a few minutes this morning to outline how the Senate \nbill would differ from what has been done in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  First, the Senate compromise authorizes $760 million for hazardous \nfuel reduction projects. The House bill does not authorize any \nadditional money for these projects.\n  The Senate compromise--I want to emphasize this to my Democratic \ncolleagues--does not rely on commercial logging to get these projects \ndone. The House bill does. I think this is unfortunate.\n\n  The Senate compromise protects our rural communities. The House bill \ndoes not.\n  The Senate compromise directs that 50 percent of the funding be spent \ninside what is known as the wildland-urban interface. The House bill is \nsilent with respect to directing these funds.\n  The Senate compromise protects old growth and large trees and \nrequires projects that thin--not clear-cut--our forests. Again, that is \nin contrast to the House bill. The House bill does not protect old \ngrowth and large trees, and it doesn't limit how the projects can be \nexecuted.\n  Fourth, the Senate compromise keeps the current standard of judicial \nreview of these projects and rejects the House of Representatives \nstandard which is not as balanced. The House bill would actually change \nthe outcome of lawsuits, in my view, regrettably, by robbing the \njudiciary of an independent ability to weigh all of the evidence put \nbefore them with respect to forestry matters.\n  Finally, the Senate compromise keeps the public in the process. \nRegrettably, the House bill does not. The Senate compromise allows the \npublic to actually propose what is known as a NEPA alternative.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act is an extraordinarily important \nstatute. It has been of great importance to a lot of Members of the \nSenate. Look back to people such as the late Scoop Jackson who were so \ninvolved in this issue. The Senate compromise clearly allows the \npublic, through a public process, to propose NEPA alternatives. In my \nview, the House bill pushes the public out of the process by, in \neffect, predetermining these alternatives in the NEPA area.\n\n  Talking for a few minutes about the compromise, in particular the \nvalue of having the first ever statutory protection of old growth, \npreserving the public's right to participate, while streamlining the \nappeals process to get at some of the abuses we have seen, strikes the \nright balance. With respect, for example, to this question of making \nsure citizens can be involved in appealing matters relating to a forest \nresale, it is critical those rights be protected.\n  I also do not think there ought to be a constitutional right to a 5-\nyear delay on every timber sale. The Senate compromise which we put \ntogether strikes that appropriate balance.\n  As we get ready to vote, some very creative work has been done. Folks \nhave asked, How do we know the old-growth protection is actually going \nto get put in place? We say, for example, for the old-forest plans that \nin effect the Forest Service would have to go back and revise those \nplans to make sure the old growth is protected before the overall \nprojects with respect to thinning go forward. We create for the first \ntime in these old-forest plans an actual incentive for the Forest \nService to get busy, get going, and protect the old growth while \nallowing the thinning to go forward. The compromise makes it less \nlikely that old growth will be harvested under current law because \nunder the compromise we mandated the retention of the large trees and \nfocused the hazardous fuels reduction programs authorized by the bill \non thinning the small trees.\n  Several of my colleagues want to talk on this, but I make it clear, \nagain, Senator Daschle has said publicly, privately, in every \nconceivable forum, he wants this legislation to move forward \nexpeditiously. Let us address the concerns of all Senators. This is a \nmatter Senators feel strongly about. Let us vote on this legislation \nthis year. The fires we have seen in the west are not natural. They are \ninfernos coming about as a result of years and years of neglect. The \ncompromise we have crafted reflects a balanced approach. We are not \nstripping the American people of their rights to be heard with respect \nto forestry policy. Quite the contrary. We protect all of those avenues \nof public participation.\n  I know we are going to hear from our colleagues who have been \ninvolved in the compromise. I thank Senator Craig and Senator Cochran, \nin particular, for working with myself and Senator Feinstein for many \nmonths. A number of Senators have already come out for this proposal, \nincluding, of course, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, but also \nSenator Dayton and Senator Johnson. We have a host of Democratic \nSenators. We can get 60 votes on this legislation and see it passed \nfrom this body. We want to have it done this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his explanation and \nhis evaluation of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, H.R. 1904, that \nwe want to get before the Senate. He is so right in all of his \ncomments. We have worked together in a very bipartisan way.\n  I come to the floor today as a frustrated Senator over the current \nsituation. I chair the forestry subcommittee of Energy. My colleague \nfrom Oregon is the ranking member. Yet the ranking member of the full \nEnergy Committee came to the floor and objected to proceeding on this \nlegislation. I am frustrated as to why the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, would object now that we have crafted this bipartisan \nbalance. I am perplexed, when you evaluate the record of full \nbipartisan participation, why we will not allow this to go forward \nunder the normal course.\n  On June 26, the Agriculture Committee held a full hearing on H.R. \n1904. Many of our colleagues attended. I am not a member of the \nAgriculture Committee, but I attended that hearing. Those Members \ncritically in need of this legislation for our states and our forests \nattended that hearing. Then the Energy Committee the Senator from New \nMexico is on, on July 22, held hearings on this issue and on the impact \nof fires, insects, and disease on our forests. The committee also \nconsidered S. 1314, the Collaborative Forest Health Act. Senator \nBingaman's bill, H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, was \nalso considered at that time. There has been full consideration in both \nthe Agriculture Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee of this legislation.\n  Two Senators who have engaged in the hearings full time, Senator \nWyden of Oregon and Senator Feinstein of California, worked in a very \nbipartisan way with the chairman of the full Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Cochran, who I understand will speak in a few moments.\n  Why, therefore, is there an objection? More importantly, why are we \nnow calling for hearings on an amendment? I don't know that has ever \nbeen done\n\n[[Page S13073]]\n\nonce a bill is marked up and left the full committee. Are we going to \nrevert backward now, and every time an amendment is offered, some \nSenator is going to stand up and say: you cannot go further; you have \nto have a hearing on that amendment?\n  The Senator from New Mexico and others know exactly what is in this \nlegislation. We have worked extremely hard to bring all parties into \nit. The staff of the Senator from New Mexico was involved in some of \nthe negotiations and then decided not to attend the rest of them as \nthey went forward. It has not been a private process. It has been most \nopen and most public with the Senators from the Republican side and the \nSenators from the Democrat side and their staffs working \ncollaboratively and cooperatively together to get where we are today. \nWe heard a very clear explanation from the Senator from Oregon of the \nkind of process we went through and the product we have produced.\n  Is this now the handbook of the environmental community playing its \ncard? I hope not. I hope that is not the process in the end. It is \nalmost like the forest vernacular of the appeals process. You stay \ninvolved just long enough and just before the decision comes about, you \nask for an appeal. No more appeals. The process has worked its will. \nAll parties have been involved. All amendments have been worked. Now it \nis time to come to the Senate and debate it and if the Senator from New \nMexico has amendments, offer them up. Let's debate them. Let's talk \nabout them.\n\n  What is so critically important for the health of America's forests \nis that we move forward with a process that begins to allow an active \nmanagement approach we think this legislation has very skillfully \ncrafted. We still have to work out our differences between the House \nand the Senate. I am supportive of the Senate bill. I will work in a \nconference, if I am a part of that conference, to try to get the \nSenate's bill to work its will and to become part of our forest \nmanagement law. That is what is critical. That is what is important.\n  Clearly, it is time we move forward. It is now not time to stall. \nThere would be all kinds of reasons to argue if these bills had never \nhad hearings, if these bills had never been allowed to be amended in \ncommittee, if these bills had never been allowed to do a full markup, \nbut all of that has happened. Why are we in the fifth inning in an \nappeals approach suggesting we hold more hearings on an amendment that \ncan be effectively debated on the floor of the Senate? It is a critical \nissue for my State and for the public forests of this country.\n  I hope in a bipartisan way we can bring this legislation to the \nfloor, have a thorough debate and an amendment process, and move it on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I believe we need to do something for \nhealthy forests. I know how hard the Senator from Oregon has worked on \nthis, along with others. I applaud and commend them for working.\n  Nevada, of course, is a State very large in area and we have had some \ndevastating fires in the last several years. Something needs to be done \nabout it.\n  In response to my friend from Idaho, who I have the greatest respect \nfor, he did not mention by name the Senator from New Mexico, but he is \ntalking about Senator Bingaman, speaking in not a favorable light about \nmy friend, the junior Senator from New Mexico. I have served with Jeff \nBingaman. We were elected to Congress the same year. He is a man of \nintellect. He is Harvard educated, and he has a fine legal mind. \nCertainly he is not anyone, by virtue of his record, which would be \neasily obtainable, to go whatever way the environmental community wants \nhim to go.\n\n  I can speak from experience. I have issues where I believe the \nSenator from New Mexico should have followed what I felt was the right \nway, and the environmental community supported it, and he did not go \nthat way.\n  All I am saying is Senator Bingaman is one of the finest Senators we \nhave in this body. He has some problems with this legislation, some of \nwhich are based upon the fact he is the ranking member and former \nchairman of the committee which some believe should be the authorizing \ncommittee and not the Agriculture Committee. I do not take a position \non that because I do not know which committee should be involved. But \nas the ranking member of that committee, Senator Bingaman has some \nconcerns and there are some questions he has asked. I do not think that \nis out of line in any way.\n  So without belaboring the point--and I certainly know Senator \nBingaman can defend himself, but he is not here--I want to simply say \nhe is one of the fairest people, one of the people who understands \nSenate procedure and rules as much as anyone I know, who is also \ninterested in doing something about the forest fires sweeping the west.\n  New Mexico has had them. We know one fire which got so much attention \nwas a manmade fire when a Forest Service burn got out of control and \nnearly wiped out one of the defense installations there in Los Alamos.\n  I would hope everyone understands Senator Bingaman is trying to come \nforward with what he believes are some serious questions about the way \nthis legislation has moved.

Madam President, at the request of the majority leader, \nI ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, in consultation with the minority leader, the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act, under the following limitations: That any amendments \noffered must be relevant to the underlying measure, and that any \nsecond-degree amendment be relevant to the first-degree amendment to \nwhich it is offered. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of any amendments, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate proceed to a vote on passage, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would ask \nthat the distinguished Senator from Mississippi modify his request and \njust simply allow the bill to come to the floor at a time to be agreed \nupon by the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, that the bill just come to the floor, period, with no \nrestrictions on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator accept that modification?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am not able to accept it on behalf of \nthe majority leader. I made this request at the majority leader's \nrequest. This was written by the majority leader, so I am unable to \nmake that modification.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, \nwhich is a bill that has been reported by the Agriculture Committee, is \na comprehensive strategy to improve forest health on both public and \nprivate lands. The bill empowers Federal land managers to implement, in \nconsultation with local communities, scientifically supported \nmanagement practices on Federal forests. It establishes new \nconservation programs to improve water quality and regenerate privately \nowned forests.\n  This bill will reduce the amount of time and expense required to \nconduct hazardous fuel projects, but it also mandates rigorous \nenvironmental analysis before any such projects are undertaken.\n  Over the past few years, many lives have been lost and homes and \ncommunities destroyed by forest fires that could have been prevented. \nInstead of managing our national forests, the U.S. Forest Service has \nbeen forced to spend\n\n[[Page S13074]]\n\ninordinate amounts of time and effort fighting lawsuits. This has \ncaused months and sometimes years of delays in fuel reduction projects. \nOur forests have continued to suffer, and they have continued to burn.\n  I will offer an amendment to title I of the bill, if and when it is \npresented to the Senate, which contains several modifications to the \ncommittee bill. This amendment embodies recommendations made by a \nbipartisan group of Senators who are committed to getting this \nlegislation passed and signed by the President.\n  The amendment establishes a predecisional administrative review \nprocess. It allows an additional analysis under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \ngive priority to communities and watersheds in hazardous fuel reduction \nprojects. It contains new language protecting old-growth stands. It \nencourages the courts to expedite the judicial review process.\n  The committee bill authorizes grant programs to encourage utilization \nof certain forest waste material. It provides financial and technical \nassistance to private forest land owners to encourage better management \ntechniques to protect water quality.\n  It also authorizes funding for the U.S. Forest Service, land grant \ninstitutions, and 1890 institutions to plan, promote, and conduct the \ngathering of information about insects that have caused severe damage \nto forest ecosystems. Also included in the bill is the Healthy Forest \nReserve Program, which is a private forest land conservation initiative \nto support the restoration of declining forest ecosystem types that are \ncritical to the recovery of threatened, endangered, and other sensitive \nspecies.\n  Two titles were added to the House-passed bill by our committee. One \nwould establish a public land corps to provide opportunities to young \npeople for employment and, at the same time, provide a cost-effective \nand efficient means to implement rehabilitation and enhancement \nprojects in local communities. The other title will promote investment \nin forest-resource-dependent communities.\n  In essence, this legislation will provide new legal authority to help \nus manage the Nation's forests in a safer and more effective manner.\n  I urge the Senate to support this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of the time allocated to me \nunder the order to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I believe the \nminority has 9 minutes left. I would like to respond to the remarks of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, would that be acceptable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nis left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side; 9 minutes remaining on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Fine. If there is time remaining, I am happy to let the \nSenator stay on this subject.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and, Madam President, \nask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  First, I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee. I think he knows I agree with so much of what he just \npreviously said.\n  I want to emphasize, on this side of the aisle we believe there are \n60 votes to move forward on this legislation. We want to work \nconstructively to get this done. The minority leader, Senator Daschle, \nhas emphasized again and again how important it is to move forward with \nthis legislation. We do want to address the concerns of the Members. We \nknow a lot of Senators feel strongly about this issue. But it is \nabsolutely imperative--absolutely imperative--Madam President and \ncolleagues, that this bill get out of the Senate this year. That is my \ngoal. I am going to put every ounce of my energy and strength into it.\n  The reason I think the Senate ought to move forward with this \nlegislation is the bipartisan compromise that has been discussed by the \nchairman of the committee steers, in my view, a narrow path through 20 \nmillion acres of highly vulnerable forest land that lies close to \nhighly vulnerable communities and their drinking water sources.\n  I have already outlined this morning the five or six major ways in \nwhich this compromise differs from what has been considered in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  For example, under this legislation that has been crafted in a \nbipartisan way by a group of nine Senators, we have authorized an \nincrease of 80 percent in funding for thinning projects. There has been \ntremendous concern all across the country that without adequate funding \nfor thinning projects, the only people who would have the resources to \ndo the work would be the large commercial logging companies. In our \ndiscussions among Senators, we said: There is a better way to proceed.\n  That is why we came up with a funding proposal that sends a \nresponsible message all across the country that this is not some sort \nof giveaway to big timber companies; this is something that represents \nresponsible forestry. On provision after provision with respect to this \ncompromise, we see those kinds of efforts to ensure that we strike a \nresponsible balance.\n  We have to make sure we protect our rural communities. The House \nlegislation doesn't do that. The Senate compromise directs 50 percent \nof the funding to be spent inside the wildland and urban interface; the \nHouse bill is silent with respect to those funds. Again, we see an \neffort on the part of Senator Cochran, chairman of the committee, and \nthe nine Senators who worked together on this legislation, to strike a \nreasonable compromise.\n  The old-growth provisions are the first statutory protection ever for \nthese trees that the American people feel so strongly about. There is a \nconcrete incentive to get the old-growth protection in place. Under \nsomething for which I commend the chairman that is genuinely creative, \nwe stipulate that the old forest plans actually have to be revised to \nprotect the old growth in order for the thinning work to be done. So we \nhave something which strikes a genuine balance, and it is done in a \ncreative way.\n  I said earlier that forestry issues are about as contentious as \nMiddle Eastern politics. It is very difficult to find the common \nground. We have done that in this area. This compromise ensures that \nthe public will be involved in every single aspect of the debate with \nrespect to forestry. That is something on which Senator Feinstein and I \ninsisted. We have worked on this legislation for many months with \nSenator Domenici, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. I hope we will move quickly and do it in a fashion that \naddresses the concerns of all Senators.\n  There have been a number who have come to Chairman Cochran and me \nwith ideas and suggestions. We want to hear from them. But we want this \nbill passed this year by the Senate. Senator Daschle has communicated \nthat again and again and has been extremely constructive. Nobody is \ninterested in an obstructionist kind of approach. This has to get done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have taken the floor to talk about \nobstructionism of the other side of the aisle with respect to judges. \nThat has been a main point of contention on my part, that it is \nsomething that is doing damage to our judiciary and to the Senate.\n  Today I want to talk about another aspect of that obstructionism. \nThat is the tone and substance of the debate occurring on judges that \nare being put up, particularly for the circuit court.\n  Yesterday we experienced something in the Judiciary Committee that I \nfind beneath the dignity of the Senate and raises serious concerns \nabout how we are going to attract good people to put their names before \nthe Senate for confirmation to judicial office. I have behind me a copy \nfrom a Web site that\n\n[[Page S13075]]\n\ndisplayed this cartoon that was the topic of discussion at yesterday's \nJudiciary Committee hearing on the supreme court justice of California, \nJanice Rogers Brown.\n  She had a hearing yesterday before the committee and was greeted with \nthis cartoon that was displayed on a Web site. The Web site of \nblackcommentator.com. The cartoon has President Bush and Justice Rogers \nBrown walking into a room and the President is saying:\n\n       Welcome to the Federal bench, Ms. Clarence--I mean Ms. \n     Rogers Brown, you'll fit right in.\n\n  And then in the background are Justice Thomas, Colin Powell, and \nCondoleeza Rice. The bottom says:\n\n       News item: Bush nominates Clarence-like conservative to the \n     bench.\n\n  On the Web site, it says:\n\n       This cartoon can be found in the following commentary: A \n     female Clarence Thomas for the DC Federal Court? A statement \n     by People for the American Way and the NAACP.\n\n  I don't know from this Web site and I don't know from any other \ncommentary I have seen what the relationship between this cartoon is \nand the People for the American Way and the NAACP, but I think it \nbehooves both of those organizations to clarify their position on this \ncartoon which can be found in the following commentary by these two \norganizations.\n  The stereotyping that goes on in this cartoon and the blatant racism \nthat is displayed is overwhelming. To look at the depiction of Justice \nBrown, the picture speaks for itself.\n  Let me show you a picture of what Justice Brown looks like. I would \nsuggest the cartoon does not at all comport with what Justice Brown \nlooks like. It is a purely slanderous depiction, stereotyping at its \nworst. That is the tone and substance of the debate we have now \ndegraded ourselves into as a result of the obstructionism that is \noccurring for extreme political purposes in the Senate.\n  Justice Brown was asked about this at her hearing yesterday. I quote \nwhat she said:\n\n       The first thing that happened was I talked to my judicial \n     assistant yesterday. Her voice sounded very strange, and I \n     said to her, ``What's wrong? What's happening?''\n       And I realized she sounded strange, because she was choking \n     back tears. When I asked her what was wrong, she really \n     started to cry. She's a very composed, very calm woman. And \n     she started to cry.\n       And she said, ``Oh judge, these horrible things--you \n     haven't seen what they've done.''\n       I, of course, was not there to comfort her. I've been here \n     meeting with anybody who would meet with me.\n       But while I've been having those meetings, people have said \n     to me: ``Well, you know, it's not personal, it's just \n     politics, it's not personal.''\n       And I just want to say to you that it is personal, it's \n     very personal--to the nominees, and to the people who care \n     about them.\n\n  She speaks not only for herself but she speaks to the hatchet job \nbeing done on Attorney General Pryor, being done to Judge Pickering, \nthat was done to Miguel Estrada, is in the process of being done to \nCarolyn Kuhl and God knows how many more nominees who are being \nslandered and dragged through the mud, people of stellar reputations, a \nsupreme court justice in California, reelected with 76 percent of the \nvote, a stellar educational record, and she is being treated in such a \ndemeaning and degrading fashion.\n  We had the attorney general of the State of Alabama who was \nquestioned on his deeply held beliefs because he happens to be a \nconservative Catholic. Where are we going, folks? What are we turning \nthis process into, that we will demean and degrade and tear down people \nfor some extreme ideological agenda who have served this country, \nserved their States, served their communities?\n  This is wrong. We should stop this.\n  If we don't stop it, it will go on and it will expand and grow like a \ncancer. That side is doing it now. If they keep it up, one day we may \nbe doing it to them because, of course, we have to get them back for \nwhat they did to us. This is wrong. It has never been done before.\n  Stop this insanity of degrading people, of coarsening the debate, of \ncreating a chilling effect on those who would like to be Federal \njudges. It is wrong and it must stop now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my understanding is that on the Democratic \nside we have 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I \ndon't understand what he is talking about, ``the degradation.'' That \nmay be something I am not aware of relative to judicial nominees.\n  I don't know the exact count, but I do know that during this \nPresident's tenure of office we have approved 174 judges or thereabout. \nWe have only had problems with three of them. It seems to me that is a \npretty good record.\n  We have worked hard to approve the President's judges. They have not \nall been people we would have selected if we had a Democratic \nPresident. But we have a Republican President; we have recognized that \nhe has the ability to choose those nominees he believes are \nappropriate. As a result of that, we have given him nearly carte \nblanche to send us judges. Three have not been approved.\n  So the record of 173 sounds like a pretty good record. I hope we will \nlet the certainty of the process go forward. It seems to me it is a \npretty good process that has worked for more than 200 years. President \nBush is getting virtually every one of his nominees. I don't think it \nwould be a good system if we simply said you can have whoever you want. \nWe have a duty to advise and consent the President on his nominations.\n  I yield the time left under the Democrat control to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in response to the comments the \nSenator from Idaho made earlier this morning on the Healthy Forests \nlegislation, the history of that legislation is that the bill did get \nreferred to the Agriculture Committee. I thought that was a mistake, \nsince the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has always had primary \njurisdiction over most of the issues dealt with in that bill. But a \nbill was reported out of that committee.\n  Following that, a group of Senators--the Senator from Idaho \nincluded--got together on a bipartisan basis to develop their own \nalternative, or their own proposal. That is what is intended to be \nbrought to the Senate floor. My staff, the staff of the Democratic side \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was not included in \nthose negotiations. I complained about that. They were told they could \nobserve but not participate in a meaningful way. They did that to some \nextent.\n  I believe it is important that we have a full opportunity for \namendment to this bill. I do not object to the bill coming up. I do not \nobject to us proceeding with an agreement to limit what we do to the \namendments related to that bill. I think that would be an appropriate \nway to proceed. It is an important issue. We ought to deal with it \nbefore Congress adjourns this fall.\n  I will have several amendments. I think there are problems with the \nbill as I understand it. I also have a great many questions I would \nlike to have answers to about the meaning of some of the language in \nthe bill. Those are legitimate issues. I believe we can have a full and \nfair debate and a full and fair opportunity for Senators to offer \namendments.\n  I know the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid, did suggest we \nproceed to bring the bill up. There would be no objection to that. \nCertainly, I think that would be an appropriate way to proceed. With \nthat, I appreciate the chance to explain my own point of view and \nposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13075-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13075-S13076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COSPONSORSHIP--S. 877\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1899.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe Transportation, Treasury, and general government appropriations \nbill for the fiscal year 2004.\n  The reorganization of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year \nsubstantially changed the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. While the \njurisdiction of this subcommittee is not as wholly different as the new \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, the bill before the \nSenate is quite different from the bill the Senate has considered in \nthe past.\n  For the first time, programs outside the Department of Transportation \nhave to directly compete against certain Transportation programs. This \nbill is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. Despite being $300 \nmillion below the President's request, I believe we have included \nadequate resources to meet our responsibilities in a balanced and \nresponsible manner.\n  The goal of the subcommittee is to allocate scarce resources to the \nadministration and our Members' highest priorities, to glean out \nsavings where possible, and to apply those savings to programs that \nsave lives, improve America's competitiveness, and programs that create \njobs. I am pleased to report that the bill before the Senate does just \nthat.\n  I wish to provide a brief overview of the highlights of the bill. The \nbudget request proposes an 8-percent raise. I am proud to report that \nthe bill rejects the proposal and has included a historically high \n$33.8 billion for highway infrastructure investment.\n  It will come as no surprise to anybody that my highest priority for \nthe Transportation portion of this bill is to provide adequate \ninvestment in our highway system. Highway investment creates jobs \nthrough infrastructure development, fuels economic growth by reducing \nthe transportation costs associated with American goods and services, \nand improves the quality of life of our citizens and enhances their \nability to move around this country easily.\n  The bill before us also includes $20 million for AMBER Alert grants \nto expand and improve the Nation's ability to quickly recover missing \nchildren. We know the alert system has worked in Texas. This investment \nwill provide additional infrastructure across the country to notify the \npublic to immediately begin looking for missing children and suspects.\n  While many of Treasury's law enforcement functions were transferred \nto the Department of Homeland Security, Treasury continues its \nimportant responsibility for combating terrorist financing and other \nfinancial crimes both domestically and abroad. The bill includes \nfunding to establish the Office of Terrorist and Financial Crimes.\n  We have also included additional resources to support Treasury's \npolicy responsibilities pertaining to counterterrorist financing and \nfinancial crimes. I believe these are essential functions in our \nNation's war against this fight on terrorism.\n  The bill includes an additional $20 million for the HIDA Program. \nOver the years, the HIDA Program has been effective in coordinating \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement to disrupt drug trafficking. \nWe have also included language to, once again, make the National Youth \nAntidrug Media Campaign an effective investment for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  While a few of my colleagues may disagree with the direction the bill \nproposes to take in regard to the media campaign, there are many more \nwho believe a more stringent approach is necessary. I believe this bill \nstrikes the appropriate balance between responsible congressional \noversight of the campaign and allowing it to move forward in an attempt \nto effect change among our Nation's youth. Further delay in the \ncourthouse construction process would only hamper the effort to meet \nthe growing caseload demands on the Federal judiciary.\n  The bill includes $500 million to fund the Help America Vote Act. \nThis funding, in addition to the $830 million appropriated in fiscal \nyear 2003, will allow more than $1.3 billion to be distributed to \nStates in fiscal year 2004. I am pleased the administration has finally \nsent up its nominations for the commissioner of the Election Assistance \nCommission.\n  It is my understanding the Rules Committee plans to hold a hearing on \nthese nominees next Tuesday. I believe it is important that the Senate \nexpedite this process so the resources we appropriate can be \ndistributed to the States in a reasonable manner.\n  The recommendation also includes funding to continue the student and \nparent mock elections. I know many of my colleagues are very interested \nin this important program and truly believe in the merits of this \nvaluable hands-on civic lesson. That is precisely why we have included \nthe money.\n  The bill retains the so-called pay parity provision for Federal \nemployees and uniform personnel and sets the adjustment at 4.1 percent.\n  Finally, the bill includes $1.3 billion for Amtrak. I reiterate what \nI said during the committee consideration. I am deeply concerned about \nthe offsets that have been included in this bill to pay for the \nadditional $400 million above the budget request. We are barely keeping \nup with the demand for transit, highway, and airport infrastructure \ninvestment and maintenance. Amtrak, on the other hand, can hardly keep \nup passenger demand for its current routes. That is not just rhetoric. \nAmtrak provides roughly the same number of passenger trips as it did 20 \nyears ago, while all other modes of transportation have more than \ntripled.\n  I hope we can move this legislation quickly through the Senate and \ninto the conference with the House. I look forward to working with the \nSenator from Washington, the former chairman of the committee, and also \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, and \nwith interested Members, to consider and pass this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate \namendments to H.R. 2989, the Department of Transportation, Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. This is \nthe first time that the Senate will debate an appropriations bill that \ncombines these critically important Government functions.\n  As my colleagues know, at the beginning of this year, the \nAppropriations Committee combined the Transportation Subcommittee with \nthe former Treasury, Postal and General Government Subcommittee. We \nwere particularly fortunate to have Senator Shelby as our chairman, \nespecially since he is perhaps the only Senator who has chaired both \nthe Transportation Subcommittee and Treasury Postal Subcommittee at \ndifferent times.\n  Ever since the Senate adopted this year's final budget resolution, I \nhave worried that the Appropriations Committee would not have \nsufficient resources to meet our needs and to make the investments we \nmust make to improve our country. Today it is clear that my concerns \nwere well-founded, not only with this appropriations bill, but with \nothers the Senate has debated this year. However, despite the limited\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\nallocation that was granted to our subcommittee, I think this bill is \nwell-balanced in meeting the needs of many of the competing Government \nfunctions that we are required to fund.\n  I would like to highlight a few elements of the bill, starting with \nfunding for America's highways.\n  I am especially proud that this bill proposes a highway obligation \nceiling of $33.84 billion. That is real progress. It is almost $4.6 \nbillion more than the administration recommended, and it is $2.25 \nbillion more than fiscal year 2003. Just in the area of highway \nfunding, our subcommittee has over the past 3 years has funded the \nFederal-aid Highway Program at $13 billion more than the levels \nrecommended by the Bush administration. I have always recognized the \ncritical importance of highway funding, and that is why, when I chaired \nthe subcommittee, the bill we reported out restored every penny of the \n$8.6 billion cut that was proposed in the Bush administration's budget \nfor that year. This year, under Senator Shelby's leadership, we are \ncontinuing our progress in addressing America's deteriorating highway \ninfrastructure. Again this year, we propose a historically high level \nof highway funding of $33.84 billion. In addition, our bill increases \nfunding for highway safety activities at the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration to try to reverse a disturbing increase in \nhighway fatalities, especially deaths associated with drunk driving.\n  For the Federal Aviation Administration, the bill proposes \nappropriations and obligation ceilings of just under $14 billion. That \nis roughly a half a billion dollar increase over the level approved for \nfiscal year 2003. I also want to note that our half a billion dollar \nincrease includes a $100 million increase in the airport grants \nprogram.\n  I want to take a moment to make some observations about Amtrak. The \nbill before us includes $1.346 billion for Amtrak. Let me put that \nnumber in context. It is $454 million below the level requested by \nAmtrak's board of directors and its president, David Gunn. It is $454 \nmillion below the level that the Amtrak board says it needed to make \nprogress on the railroad's deferred capital needs while operating the \nentire national system. And it is $454 million below the level assumed \nin the Senate-passed budget resolution.\n\n  The Bush administration's budget for fiscal year 2004 singled out \nAmtrak for a 14 percent cut in funding down to the level of $900 \nmillion. Amtrak's president has made it quite clear in testimony before \nseveral committees that adoption of the administration's proposed level \nof $900 million will mean certain bankruptcy of the railroad. It will \nmean the end of service to the thousands of daily Amtrak riders and the \nten of thousands of mass transit riders whose commuter rail systems \ndepend on continued Amtrak service. The level of funding recommended by \nthe Appropriations Committee of $1.346 billion will be barely enough to \nenable Amtrak to operate all of its services for fiscal year 2004. This \nfact has been confirmed in testimony by the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General before the Senate Commerce Committee. \nThe increase above last year is directed to accommodate the \nnondiscretionary cost increases that will burden the railroad in fiscal \nyear 2004, including cost increases associated with mandated pay raises \nfor employees under contract: and, automatic increases in debt service \npayments associated with debt that the railroad has already taken on.\n  There is no question that the level of Amtrak funding in the bill is \nmore than some Senators would like and less than other Senators would \nlike. In my view, as the ranking member of this subcommittee, I do not \nbelieve that there are other areas in this bill where other Amtrak \nresources can be found. I believe the level of funding in this bill \nwill allow the authorizing committees to continue to work on reform \nlegislation and hopefully address the long-term financial needs of the \nrailroad, including its sizable backlog of critical capital \ninvestments.\n  I would like to mention a few other funding highlights concerning the \nIRS and GSA. For the IRS, the bill before us includes $10.35 billion, \nincluding very sizable amounts to help the IRS move forward in \nmodernizing its information technology infrastructure. For the General \nServices Administration, the bill includes appropriations as well \nfunding limitations in excess of $6.4 billion. The subcommittee was \nable to make progress on the construction on a limited number of new \ncourthouses. We followed the recommendations of the Judicial \nConference, even though these courthouses were not funded in the \nPresident's budget and were largely unfunded in the House-passed bill.\n  So, in conclusion, I stand in strong support of this bill. While \noverall it does not have as many resources as I think are needed to \naddress all of our transportation infrastructure, transportation \nsafety, drug prevention, election reform, and other needs, I think it \ndoes an outstanding job addressing these competing needs in a balanced \nway, under the funded ceiling that was given to the subcommittee due to \nthe budget resolution.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shelby for the very cooperative and \ncollegial approach that he always brings to this process. When it comes \nto allocating funds for Members' priority projects, whether it is for \nhighways, mass transit or Federal building construction, Senator Shelby \nand I work together to meet Senators' highest priority requests. The \nprocess was balanced and fair, without regard to political affiliation \nor geography, and I continue to be indebted to him for the fair-\nmindedness that he consistently brings to this process.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and help our country make \nimportant progress in transportation, safety and critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President this bill includes many projects that are \nimportant for my State of California, and I wish to take a minute to \nhighlight those projects.\n  For the Bay Area, $113.75 million in new funding is included for \ntransportation improvements. The projects include $100 million for the \nBART extension to the San Francisco International Airport and $4 \nmillion for upgrades to the Muni System.\n  In addition, the bill includes: $3 million for AC Transit-CalWorks \nJob Center. This funding will continue successful Job Access programs \nand expand those services further for CalWorks recipients; $750,000 for \nthe City of Palo Alto Intermodal Transit Center. These new funds will \ngo toward the planning and design of a new regional intermodal transit \ncenter in Palo Alto.\n  There is $1 million for Oyster Point Ferry Vessel. Funding will be \nused to build a ferry vessel to serve a new ferry route between San \nMateo County and downtown San Francisco. This route will serve over \n2,000 passenger trips daily.\n  There is $1 million for the Zero Emissions Bus--ZEB--Program. The \nSanta Clara Valley Transportation Authority will use this funding to \nmove away from using clean diesel technology to even cleaner Fuel Cell \ntechnology.\n  There is $4 million for the Silicon Valley Rapid Transit Corridor. \nThese funds will be used to extend the BART system to Santa Clara \nCounty.\n  For the Sacramento region, $5.5 million in new funding is included to \nimprove transportation. Most of these funds--$4 million--will be used \nfor job access to help under-served communities get to work. The \nremaining funds will be used to improve the Intelligent Transportation \nSystem.\n  For the residents of Los Angeles, $12.1 million is included to \nimprove a variety of transportation projects, including $5 million for \nLA Eastside Corridor Light Rail. The new funds will be used to develop \na six-mile, nine-station light rail system running through Little \nTokyo, Boyle Heights, and East Los Angeles.\n  There is $2 million for Alameda Corridor East. This funding will be \nused to help reduce traffic congestion for residents and businesses in \nthe Alameda Corridor East and improve the shipment of goods from the \nports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n  There is $3 million for the MTA Bus Program. These new funds will be \nused by MTA to make bus service in Los Angeles County more efficient. \nImprovements will be made to Metro Rapid Bus facilities and new \ntechnology will be utilized to upgrade traffic signals for more \nefficient bus service.\n  There is $2.1 million for LA Metrolink San Bernardino Line: Platform \nAddition and Extensions. These funds will be used to improve commuter \naccess and safety. The project\n\n[[Page S13078]]\n\nconsists of constructing new platforms, extending current platforms, \nand improving pedestrian access.\n  For transportation projects in San Diego and the surrounding \ncommunities, $113 million is included. The new funding includes $65 \nmillion for the extension of the San Diego Trolley's Blue Line from the \nMission San Diego Station to an Orange Line connection near Baltimore \nDrive in La Mesa. The approximately 5.9-mile line will run adjacent to \nInterstate 8 and add four new stations.\n  This extension will increase the efficiency of San Diego's public \ntransportation, while reducing congestion and providing an \nenvironmentally-friendly alternative for commuters.\n  The new funds also provide $48 million for the North County Transit \nDistrict's Oceanside-Escondido Rail Project. This project will convert \n22 miles of freight rail corridor into a light rail system running east \nfrom Oceanside to Escondido.\n  During our current time of economic uncertainty, all of these \nprojects will help strengthen California's economy by improving \ninfrastructure and creating new jobs. These improvements will move \nproducts and people more efficiently, while also promoting a cleaner \nand healthier environment.\n  In addition to the various transportation projects, this bill \nincludes $50 million for a new Federal courthouse in downtown Los \nAngeles. The Los Angeles area is experiencing an increase in cases that \nis stretching the existing courthouse beyond its limits.\n  Currently, the Los Angeles court complex operates out of two separate \nbuildings located several blocks apart, which causes delays, security \nconcerns and general confusion. The two buildings cannot accommodate \nexpected growth and high security trials--making them inadequate to \nhandle modern judicial needs.\n  The need for a new Los Angeles Courthouse is great. In order for the \ncourts to effectively serve the public and provide adequate security, \nwe need to provide them with the resources to get the job done. The \nconstruction of this courthouse is a step in the right direction.\n  I thank Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Murray for their support \nto help improve California's transportation system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have concerns regarding this bill, the \nTransportation, Treasury, and general government appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2004, as reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. While the bill appears to contain fewer earmarks than in \nprevious years, it still contains far too many earmarks and provisions \nto change current policies.\n  The need for efficient and safe transportation in America has never \nbeen greater. Today, we as a Nation transport more people and goods \nthan ever before. As our Nation's dependence on international trade \ngrows, so does our Nation's dependence on a transportation system that \ncan keep goods moving not only at our borders, but across the Nation. \nOn top of our commercial needs, Americans in general are more mobile \nthan ever before. Due to this reality, the safety and security of our \nhighways, airways, railways, and waterways must be a national priority. \nAnd as legislators, it is our duty to ensure that important \ntransportation programs are fully funded. The measure before the Senate \ntakes important steps towards achieving that goal.\n  At the same time, however, I am troubled by many provisions in H.R. \n2989, the fiscal year 2004 Transportation, Treasury, and general \ngovernment appropriations bill as amended by Senate text in S. 1589. \nOnce again, I find myself in familiar territory, rising in opposition \nto another appropriations bill that needlessly earmarks the hard-earned \nmoney of American taxpayers. While the bill in total is $300 million \nbelow the President's budget request, the transportation title of the \nbill alone contains over $7.5 billion in objectionable funding \nprovisions that are either above the President's request for specific \nprograms, locality-specific earmarks by appropriators, or both.\n  The bill earmarks all intelligent transportation funds ($125 million) \nfor 54 specific projects, including an intelligent transportation \nsystem for the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and a Weather Research \nInstitute in North Dakota. The administration did not request any of \nthe projects earmarked.\n  The bill further would provide $1.3 billion for new fixed guideway \nsystems. Under this funding, the bill alters the President's request by \nincreasing or decreasing funding for 14 projects with full funding \ngrant agreements already in place and earmarks funding for an \nadditional 25 projects. The changes in funding levels for projects with \ngrants agreements will have a significant impact on those projects, \ncausing construction delays and cost overruns. The additional earmarks \nmay very well affect the ability of other projects to receive full \nfunding grant agreements in the future, because the earmarks are \noutside of the Federal Transit Administration's FTA review process and \nfund projects that are not ready or do not meet FTA's standards.\n  The bill provides $18.4 million for the disposal of obsolete vessels \nin the National Defense Reserve Fleet of the Maritime Administration, \n$7 million above the President's request. While there is no question \nthat these federally owned obsolete vessels pose serious environmental \nrisks to the waters in which they are now moored, I cannot support \nfunding above the President's request. The ship disposal program \ndeveloped by the administration has taken into account not only the \nneed to expedite disposal of these vessels, but also the limitations of \nthe disposal market and other conditions for disposal. I do not believe \nthe same can be said for the appropriators.\n  Further, the bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nin what I have been told is a drafting error, increases the \nadministrative ``take-down'' authorized in the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act to finance motor carrier safety programs and motor \ncarrier safety research from .45 percent to 2.55 percent and decreases \nthe administrative ``take-down'' authorized in TEA-21 to administer \nFederal highway programs from 2.65 to 1.05 percent. As I understand it, \nthe Committee intended to increase both ``take-downs'' in order to make \nadditional funds available for earmarks. Not only is this authorizing \nlanguage in an appropriations bill, such a change was not requested by \nthe administration.\n  The Senate bill also contains a provision to direct the Secretary of \nTransportation to enter into an agreement with the State of Nevada and \nthe State of Arizona or both to provide a method of funding for \nconstruction of a Hoover Dam bypass bridge from funds allocated for the \nFederal Lands Highway Program. While this clearly is authorizing \nlanguage in an appropriations bill, what is really odd, is the language \nis already law, as it was contained in the Consolidated Appropriations \nResolution for fiscal year 2003.\n  The bill would appropriate over $1.3 billion for Amtrak, $446 million \nabove the President's request and nearly $300 million above Amtrak's \nfiscal year 2003 appropriation. Repayment of Amtrak's $105 million loan \nfrom DOT, made in 2001 to avoid Amtrak's threatened shut-down, would be \npostponed for a second year. The appropriations bill also renews \nconditions on Amtrak's funding adopted last year, conditions I believe \nare the reason Amtrak has a $200 million carry-over from fiscal year \n2003 for next year.\n  While I commend David Gunn, Amtrak's president, for his efforts to \nget Amtrak's costs under better control and exposing the costly \nmistakes made by his predecessor, I cannot support an appropriation for \nAmtrak above the President's request without real reform. Mr. Gunn \nrefuses to make any changes to Amtrak's routes, many of which lose \n$200, $300, or even $400 for every passenger they carry. And while \nAmtrak is touting record ridership for fiscal year 2003, my colleagues \nneed to realize that Amtrak still accounts for less than 1 percent of \nintercity travel. Amtrak's record ridership amounted to an increase of \n276,632 passengers--about 15 percent of daily airline boardings. And \nthe harsh reality is that to attract this small number of additional \nriders, Amtrak slashed fares; and through July 2003, revenues were down \n$85 million compared to 2002. If Amtrak thought it would make up price \ncuts with the fares received from additional riders, it \nseriously miscalculated.\n\n  The report that accompanies the bill earmarks $1 million for the city \nof Crowley, LA's Historic Parkerson Avenue Redevelopment project. This \nis in\n\n[[Page S13079]]\n\naddition to $500,000 given to the project 2 years ago. I'm sure that \nCrowley is a lovely community. But there are thousands of small towns \njust like Crowley that are equally deserving of redevelopment. What \nmakes Crowley more deserving of a Federal grant than every other small \ntown in America?\n  The report also contains a provision earmarking $250,000 for a \ntowboat display in Oklahoma. A retired towboat will be sandblasted, \ncleaned, painted and refurbished with a classroom area. Do you really \nthink taxpayers would want their hard-earned dollars spent on this \ndisplay? Is next year's appropriations bill going to contain funding to \npromote tourism so taxpayers all across America will know that they can \ncome see a new towboat display in Oklahoma? While I say that \nsarcastically, one has to wonder how taxpayers are going to know that \nthey have paid for and should visit such a display in Oklahoma.\n  The report sets an all-time record for the amount of airport specific \nearmarks for the Airport Improvement Program by listing 241 airports. \nIn the final appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 there were 164, \nin fiscal year 2002 there were 101, and in fiscal year 2001 there were \n158.\n  There is also an unauthorized transfer of $100 million from the FAA's \nmodernization account to the Airport Improvement Program. This transfer \nof $100 million is then set aside for--surprise, surprise--\ndiscretionary grants that can be used to fund projects at the 241 \nairports that are listed. So we are taking money from the program that \nfunds air traffic control modernization--such as newer and better \nradars--to fund the 241 airport earmarks.\n  The bill appropriates $52 million for the airport and airway trust \nfund for the essential air service program. This is not authorized and \nwas not requested by the President. The trust fund was specifically \nestablished to fund the capital and operating expenses of the Federal \nAviation Administration, FAA, not to subsidize airline service.\n  In addition to the Transportation funding, the bill contains \nappropriations for Treasury and general government. I do want to \nacknowledge that the appropriators seem to have kept parochial spending \nto a minimum in the Treasury and general government appropriations \ntitles of the bill. However, I have identified approximately $283 \nmillion in locality-specific earmarks in these titles.\n  While the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not \nseem extravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the expense of numerous programs that \nhave undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. It is my \nview that the officials who run these programs should be the ones who \ndecide how best to spend the appropriated funds. After all, they know \nwhat their most pressing needs are.\n  For example, the Treasury and general government titles include the \nfollowing earmarks or special treatment: Language urging the IRS to \nmake no staffing reductions at the Martinsburg National Computing \nCenter and the programmed level at the Administrative Services Center \nin Beckley, WV; $350,000 to continue the Upper Great Plains Native \nAmerican Telehealth Program at the University of North Dakota; $2.025 \nmillion to acquire land in Anchorage, AK, to build a new regional \narchives and records facility for the National Archives and Records \nAdministration; $500,000 for the Ruffner Mountain Educational Facility \nin Alabama; $500,000 for the Saenger Theatre Restoration Project in \nAlabama; $500,000 for the State of Alaska to assist in preparation for \nits statehood celebration; and $500,000 for the State of Hawaii to \nassist in preparation for its statehood celebration. There are more \nprojects on the list that I have compiled, which will be available on \nmy Senate Web site.\n  In closing, I am encouraged that the appropriators have begun to curb \ntheir appetite for earmarking in this bill, however there are still \nhundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary earmarks that severely \nrestrict the authority granted the agencies charged with carrying out \nthe policy goals established by Congress. In addition, there are \nnumerous statutory provisions that infringe on the jurisdiction of the \nauthorizing committees, and circumvent the authorizing process. Both \nthe authorizing committees and appropriations committee must renew \ntheir commitment to work through the long established legislative \nprocess of authorizing programs and then appropriating funds \naccordingly. We can and must do better in providing oversight and \nestablishing policies that grant the administration the funding and \nflexibility it needs to move our nation forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Craig, on behalf of \nother colleagues, including Senator Enzi from Wyoming--and I will send \nthe list to the desk in a few moments--\n\n[[Page S13080]]\n\nhas offered an amendment this morning that deals with a recognized \ncontroversial subject but, nonetheless, a very important subject. It \ndeals with the right of the American people to travel freely. It deals \nwith the issue of travel to Cuba. I want to describe to you why this \namendment, which is bipartisan--three Democrats and three Republicans \nare offering this amendment and the second-degree amendment--is \nimportant and exactly what the amendment does.\n  First, what does the amendment do? This amendment is identical to an \namendment that was passed by the House of Representatives--identical. \nIt is the same wording, and the House of Representatives very simply \nsaid the Office of Foreign Asset Control shall not use funds in this \nbill to enforce the travel ban with respect to Cuba. Let me explain why \nthat is important.\n  The travel ban with respect to the country of Cuba is unique and \ndifferent than other travel circumstances or restrictions that exist. \nWe have over the years indicated that the best approach for dealing \nwith Communist countries is engagement.\n  We have a great debate in the Congress about how do we deal with \nCommunist China. We say: Engage them in trade and travel; engage them; \nengagement is constructive. The same is true with Vietnam, a Communist \ncountry. Engagement through travel and trade inevitably will lead them \ntoward a more open society, democratic reforms, and market systems. So \nwe have said engagement is constructive, and engagement with China and \nVietnam is something that has been a part of the philosophy of this \nCongress and Presidents for some long while now. Frankly, it has been \nconstructive. I think it has produced results.\n  The different issue here is with respect to Cuba. We have had an \nembargo on Cuba for 40 years, through Republican and Democratic \nPresidents. We slapped an embargo on trade and travel in Cuba. Now we \nhave lifted the veil just a bit with respect to trade, and we are able \nto sell some food in the Cuban marketplace, and the Cubans are required \nto pay cash for that food. For the first time in 42 years, we are \nactually selling food in Cuba. Twenty-two train car loads of dried peas \nleft North Dakota farms to go to Cuba, paid for with cash. That makes \nsense. It doesn't make sense to have an embargo on food. I never felt \nit made any sense for anybody to slap an embargo on food. Food should \nnot be used as a weapon in foreign policy. So we have opened the \nrestrictions just a bit.\n  The other issue is travel in Cuba. As the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues know, we have a restriction on travel. We do not allow the \nAmerican people, except by a specific license, to travel in Cuba. \nCurrently, American citizens are banned from traveling in Cuba. That is \ndifferent than virtually anywhere else in the world. It just applies to \nCuba.\n  What is the result of that ban? The result is we don't have the kind \nof engagement with Cuba we have with China and with Vietnam, leading \nthem toward democratic reforms, undermining their governments, \nundermining the Communist government with the movement and the flow of \ngoods and communications and travelers from a great democracy such as \nthis country.\n  Here is the result of what is now happening with the travel ban. I \nhave described this previously. Let me say again, this is a policy that \ncannot be defended. It just does not make any sense.\n\n  This is a woman named Joan Slote. I have mentioned Joan Slote. She is \na wonderful woman. She is retired, in her midseventies. As you can see \nby the photograph here, Joan Slote is wearing a bicycle helmet. She is \nwearing her bicycling outfit. She is a senior olympian. She bicycles \naround the world. She loves to do it and is apparently very good at it. \nShe went bicycling in Cuba. She answered an advertisement by a Canadian \ncycling magazine and joined a group of people to bicycle in Cuba. She \ndidn't know it was illegal for an American to travel in Cuba. She \ndidn't know our policy to punish Fidel Castro is actually restricting \nthe rights of the American citizen. So she went bicycling in Cuba and \nshe came back from Cuba and got a letter from the Department of the \nTreasury, an organization called OFAC, Office of Foreign Assets \nControl.\n  By the way, that is the organization that is supposed to be tracking \nterrorists. This is the organization that is supposed to be taking \napart all these streams of money moving back and forth across the world \nto track down terrorists, but they have some people down there at \nTreasury who were, in fact, tracking people such as Joan Slote who rode \na bicycle in Cuba with a bicycle club.\n  So Joan was in Europe, bicycling in Europe, and she got notice that \nher son had brain cancer, had a brain tumor. She rushed back, \napparently packed very quickly from her apartment, and went down to \nvisit with her son, to spend time with her son, who was very ill. Her \nson subsequently died from this brain tumor.\n  In the middle of all of this, a letter had shown up at her place, \nalthough she was gone, saying: You are being fined by the Federal \nGovernment for traveling in Cuba. You are being fined $7,636. She \ndidn't get that letter. It was sent to her but she didn't receive it \nbecause she was gone.\n  Then she got a notice from the Department of the Treasury, Office of \nForeign Asset Control, the organization that is supposed to be tracking \nterrorists. She got a notice saying, you better pay up or you are in \nbig trouble. She has gotten subsequent notices from a collection \nagency. She has gotten notices that they are going to attach her Social \nSecurity check and garnish her Social Security payments.\n  In fact, interestingly enough, she finally settled for a $1,900 fine. \nThat is after I shamed OFAC, saying, How dare you go after these old \nladies? She settled for $1,900.\n  After she sent them the check, a month and a half after she sent them \nthe check, she got a letter from them saying they were going to attach \nher Social Security payments because they had no record of her payment. \nThey couldn't even keep that straight.\n  The point is this: She represents a lot of people. She represents \npeople from this country who have traveled in Cuba, not knowing it was \nillegal to do so. We have had the Office of Foreign Assets Control down \nat Treasury busy with their green eyeshades trying to track down \npersons who travel in Cuba to see if they can slap them around with a \nfine.\n  Kevin Allen, from Washington State, his dad had been a minister in \nCuba who moved to this country and died and he asked that his ashes be \ndeposited on the grounds of the church where he ministered in Cuba. So \nKevin Allen left Washington State with his deceased father's ashes to \ntake them to Cuba. He was a Pentecostal minister in prerevolutionary \nCuba.\n\n  OFAC decided they should fine this fellow $20,000 for taking his \ndeceased father's ashes to be buried on the grounds of his former \nchurch.\n  Marilyn Meister is a 72-year-old Wisconsin retired schoolteacher. She \ntook a trip to Cuba. She took it with some Canadians. She said it was \nwonderful until she encountered a customs agent on the way home. She \nsaid he ``flew into a rage . . . and made me feel like a horrible \ncriminal'' when he found out I had been in Cuba. They tried to fine her \n$7,500.\n  Donna Schutz, a 64-year-old retired social worker from Chicago, went \nto Cuba with a group from Toronto--a $7,650 fine from the Department of \nthe Treasury.\n  I mentioned Joan Slote's case.\n  One of the more interesting cases for me is Tom Warner, a 77-year-old \nWorld War II veteran. He posted on his Web site the schedule for the \nFebruary 2002 conference, the United States-Cuba Sister Cities \nAssociation in Havana. OFAC accused this 77-year-old World War II \nveteran of ``organizing, arranging, promoting and otherwise \nfacilitating the attendance of persons at the conference'' without a \nlicense. This veteran never even went to Cuba. He didn't attend the \nconference. The conference, incidentally, was licensed by OFAC but he \ndidn't go. All he did was give the information on his Web site.\n  He was given 20 days to tell OFAC everything he knew about the \nconference and the organizations that participated in it and now he has \nto hire a lawyer.\n  Aside from this, what are they doing down in Treasury? We have \norganizations such as the American Farm Bureau. They want to sell \nagricultural products into Cuba because it is now legal, in a very \nnarrow way, to do that.\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\nIt is legal because we in the Senate made it legal. We passed \nlegislation that made it legal to sell agricultural products into Cuba.\n  Last year they had an expo with farm groups going to Cuba. The result \nhas been very beneficial and very positive for American farmers and \nranchers.\n  This year they applied for a license to do the same thing, to go down \nto promote agricultural products grown in this country and raised in \nthis country to be sold in Cuba. They are now denied a license to go to \nCuba to promote those products.\n  There has been a new crackdown now on all of this just in the last \ncouple of weeks. This is the Web site for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They have been asked by the President to crack down on this. \nThey are going to use Department of Homeland Security intelligence and \ninvestigative resources. They are going to use Homeland Security \nintelligence and investigative resources to go track down people who \ntravel to Cuba.\n  Look, we are trying desperately to prevent another terrorist act from \noccurring in this country. God forbid it should happen. We want to find \nthose who are planning terrorist acts against this country and stop \nthem. That is what homeland security is.\n  Mr. President, 5.6 million containers come into this country every \nyear on container ships. Just 5 or 6 percent of them are now inspected; \n95 percent are not. We have so much to do in homeland security. All of \na sudden, now, the new mission on the Web site at Homeland Security is \ngoing to use intelligence and investigative resources to identify \ntravelers or businesses engaged in activities in Cuba.\n\n  There is an amendment that has passed the House on exactly the same \nappropriations bill. This amendment is a reasonable approach to deal \nwith this in the interim. It prohibits the use of funds by OFAC to \nenforce this travel ban with respect to this travel in Cuba. It will \navert these problems. It will allow the Department of Homeland Security \nto use the scarce resources it has to focus on protecting and securing \nour homeland.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with me that it is productive and \nconstructive to allow our farmers to promote agricultural goods in \nCuba. It is not constructive at all to decide to try to slap around \nFidel Castro by imposing limits on the right of American people to \ntravel.\n  I have no brief to offer, no positive brief, certainly, for the \nCastro regime in Cuba. The quicker it is gone the better. The quicker \nwe bring Democratic reforms to Cuba the better.\n  I have been to Cuba. I have met with the dissidents in Cuba. Those \ndissidents, in almost all cases, say they believe there would be a \nhastening of the day when there are Democratic reforms in Cuba and a \nnew government in Cuba, through trade and travel and engagement--just \nas our policies exist with respect to China, Vietnam, and other similar \ncountries. I hope one day we will have a policy of that type.\n  The Senators who have joined me are Senator Craig, Senator Enzi, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Hagel, and Senator Dodd--and let me also ask \nunanimous consent to have Senator Bingaman to be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me again point out I offered a first-degree \namendment. My colleague, Senator Craig, has offered a second-degree \namendment.\n  I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand here as cosponsor of the first-\ndegree amendment and offered the second-degree amendment to modify it \nslightly. But I certainly join with my colleague from North Dakota on \nthis issue, as do many of our colleagues, in recognizing the critical \nneed for change in our current policy. I, along with other Senators, \nincluding Senator Dorgan, have for about 4 years here in the Senate \nChamber worked to change our trade relationship with Cuba, a trade \nrelationship that is now bringing literally hundreds of millions of new \ndollars a year to our shores from Cuba for agricultural foodstuffs \ntrade and medical supplies, all of it done largely in cash, and \ncertainly no credit from the United States taxpayer because it is not \nallowed.\n  What we are offering today is a very clean amendment, which passed in \nthe House, to significantly disallow OFAC, which is the Office on \nForeign Assets Control, from utilizing resources for the purpose of \nenforcement of the Cuba travel ban.\n  What I think is important this morning is for my colleagues to \nunderstand what the mission of OFAC is. The Office of Foreign Assets \nControl of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces \neconomic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national \nsecurity goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, \ninternational narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities \nrelated to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  OFAC acts under Presidential wartime and national emergency powers as \nwell as authority granted by specific legislation to impose controls on \ntransactions and freezes foreign assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Many \nof the transactions are based on United Nations resolutions or United \nNations or other international mandates which are multilateral in scope \nand involve close cooperation with allied governments. That is a very \nsubstantial mission during a very critical time in our country when we \nare seeking out not only on our shores but other shores around the \nworld terrorists and those who traffic in narcotics.\n  Yet 10 percent of OFAC's budget is used to track down little old \ngrandmas from the west coast who, through a Canadian travel agency, \nchoose to bike in Cuba. Ten percent of their budget is on United States \ncitizens who seek to travel in Cuba--probably 99.999 percent of them \nfor recreational and vacation purposes only.\n  You talk about the wise expenditure of money. You talk about the \nappropriate allocation of public resources for the purpose of tracking \ndown terrorists and narcotics traffickers. OFAC, get your mission \nstraight. What are you doing? Why are you spending all of your money, \nor at least 10 percent of your money in that category? We suggest it is \nnot a wise expenditure of money. And the amendment would disallow them \nspending their money for these purposes.\n  My colleague has talked about the reality we face with the island of \nCuba off our shores. For over 40 years, the United States Government \nhas placed an embargo on Cuba and prohibited Americans from traveling \nto the island. For about 35 of those years, I supported them \naggressively and openly--at least in my years here in Congress--up \nuntil a few years ago when it was obvious that the embargo wasn't \nworking anymore, or that it was working very poorly, or that it was \npenalizing our producers from access to an available cash market. I am \ntalking about agricultural goods and medical supplies. I began to work \nto change that. That policy did change, and now in a very smooth way \nthere is work and there are negotiations with Cuba on those issues.\n\n  I am from Idaho. Ernest Hemingway once made his home in Idaho as well \nas in Cuba. Ernest Hemingway died in Idaho. His legacy remains there. \nOur State is very proud of this citizen and his great literary legacy. \nYet when professors from the University of Idaho chose to go Cuba for \nan exchange, to find out more about Ernest Hemingway and his works, \nOFAC said: No; well, maybe; well, possibly. Finally, after we \nintervened, they said OK. Upstanding citizens of the State of Idaho and \nprofessors at the university were denied the right to go there, to the \nhome of Ernest Hemingway where many of his works still remain. In fact, \nI understand the home has been preserved and is kind of a time capsule \nof Ernest Hemingway and his work because when he left Cuba and came \nback to the States and began to reside in Ketchum, ID, he literally \npacked a bag and walked away, and much is still there, including a \nnotebook lying open on his desk with a pen and some of his personal \nhandwritings visible in the notebook. The Cuban Government didn't touch \nit; they left it alone.\n  None of us agrees with Fidel Castro. That is really not the issue \nhere. The issue is, Is our policy working or are we suggesting that \nOFAC is not spending its money at a critical time in our Nation's \nhistory for the purpose of tracking down terrorism or for the purpose \nof the interdiction of narcotics traffickers?\n\n[[Page S13082]]\n\n  In 40 years, you want to assess policy. We live in a dynamic world \nand times change. It is now time, in my opinion, to assess that policy \nwith Cuba. I have worked very closely with Cuban Americans in this \ncountry. We have made sure that we have worked with them to get it \nright when it comes to agricultural foodstuffs and medical supplies. We \nhave worked closely with them on this issue. The Cuban community is \nsplit. I don't disagree with their feelings and concerns as they relate \nto the issue of travel to Cuba. But many Cuban Americans who are United \nStates citizens now want to go to Cuba to visit and see what their \nhomeland was once like because Cuba itself, I am told, is a time \ncapsule of the 1950s. Much of the Cuban attitude and certainly their \nfiscal policies have stopped that country from growing and expanding.\n  Exchange, opening the door, turning on the lights, and allowing our \ncitizens the opportunity to travel there is the right way to change a \ncountry.\n  Historically, even during the coldest times of the cold war and \nexcept in the rarest of circumstances did we deny or totally embargo \nthe ability of U.S. citizens to travel to Communist countries because \nwe believed it critical that we engage and stay engaged and continue \ndialog. If Ronald Reagan were able to be involved in this debate today, \nmy guess is that he might suggest it was that dialog and that openness \nand that recognition on the part of the Soviet Union that they could no \nlonger continue in the direction they were going because we were simply \noverpowering them both militarily and economically, and the Soviet \nUnion crumbled. The Wall came tumbling down, and the rest is history. \nMost of us on this floor have had the wonderful opportunity to witness \nthat history. It was not isolation, it was engagement that changed and \nwrote that history.\n  I am suggesting that this simple move--this very clear move to allow \ntravel--to disallow our Government's aggressive enforcement and to \ndisallow this agency's spending of 10 percent of their resources for \nthis purpose is a step in that direction.\n  I hope our colleagues will join the Senator from North Dakota, \nmyself, others--and the Presiding Officer is a cosponsor--in this vote \nand that we begin to work with the administration to change that \nrelationship as it relates to engagement with the Cuban Government and \nwith the island of Cuba and, most importantly, its citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment that \nwould suspend the absurd restrictions against travel by United States \ncitizens in Cuba. When you stop and think about it, why should the U.S. \nGovernment restrict the freedom of U.S. citizens to \ntravel? Particularly we should end the restriction on travel to Cuba.\n\n  Over 25 colleagues of mine have cosponsored legislation that says we \nshould end the travel ban, something I very much agree with. When we \nhave the vote, not too far from now, it is my expectation and certainly \nmy hope the majority of my colleagues will agree it does not make sense \nfor the U.S. Government to restrict the travel of United States \ncitizens to Cuba.\n  Why do I say that? First, it limits one of our basic freedoms, the \nfreedom of United States citizens to travel. How ironic it is that \ndemocracy in the United States of America, which purports to be a \ncountry that encourages democracy around the world, basically restricts \nAmerican liberties. Why restrict American liberties in order to \nencourage democracies in other countries?\n  The administration's restriction of United States citizens' travel to \nCuba affects our ability to fight the war on terrorism. Why do I say \nthat? Because the Treasury Department must waste scarce and valuable \nresources to enforce these travel restrictions. It is maddening to me \nthe administration is trying to administer resources for that effort \ninstead of fighting terrorism, which is much more pernicious and where \nwe must spend much more.\n  Another reason it makes no sense to restrict United States citizens' \ntravel to Cuba is it makes it harder for Americans to establish \nbusiness relationships, to sell products to Cuba, to get to know the \nCuban people and put deals together. People in other countries can \ntravel to Cuba--the French, Germans, Canadians. Their governments say \nsure, great, we want our citizens to travel to Cuba. But we are \npreventing our American farmers, our ranchers, our American citizens \nfrom selling products to Cuba and getting to know the Cuban people. It \nmakes no sense. I believe we should lift the travel restrictions. It \nwould increase sales of American products to Cuba, increase contact \nwith Cuba, increase the ability of American citizens to develop \nrelationships with people in Cuba which inure to the benefit certainly \nof the United States and to the Cuban people.\n  I also add parenthetically that earlier this year the Treasury \nDepartment, under the guidance of the State Department, went an extra \nstep in pursuing their wrongheaded approach in restricting travel of \nUnited States citizens to Cuba by refusing to allow a license for a \nsecond United States agribusiness expedition in Cuba. The first \nexpedition was very successful, resulting in $92 million in sales. That \nis $92 million of agriculture sales forfeited because our own \nGovernment would not allow United States citizens to travel as farmers \nand ranchers and businessmen particularly to organize the expedition.\n  Worst of all, restricting American citizens from going to Cuba also \nhurts Cubans. The travel ban shelters the Castro regime and protects \nthem from American influence, limiting the opportunity for Cubans to \ninteract with Americans. The infamous arrests of 75 dissidents last \nspring is a case in point. They were arrested because they got, \nallegedly, too close to Americans. In other words, the arrests indicate \nthe Cuban Government fears increasing contacts between dissidents and \nAmerican citizens. More evidence and more contact between Americans and \nCuban citizens will help encourage democracy.\n  Our country has fallen into the mistaken belief that we should have \ncarrots and sticks with Cuba; that is, reward Cuba for doing good \nthings and punish Cuba for doing bad things. That gives Cuba veto power \nover United States foreign policy with respect to Cuba and puts the \npolicy in the hands of Castro and lets him decide what we Americans do \nor do not do, lets him decide whether we can allow American citizens to \ntravel to Cuba. It makes no sense whatever. Yet that is a policy this \nadministration encourages.\n\n  The long and short of this is--and I am repeating arguments others \nare making--coolly and calmly stand back and ask what is right, what \nmakes sense. Should the U.S. Government prevent American citizens from \ntraveling to Cuba? What will be accomplished by maintaining that \nrestriction? What is to be accomplished if we let American citizens \ntravel? One thing we certainly know, over the last 40 years restricting \nthe travel of American citizens to Cuba and the embargo we have against \ntrade in Cuba has not worked. It has not changed the Castro regime. \nFidel Castro is still president. It has not worked.\n  If something has not worked, why not try something else, try \nsomething that seems logical? What seems logical is to engage Cubans. \nCuba is a country. The United States is a country. Cuba is not a threat \nto the United States of America. Certainly Fidel Castro is in many \nrespects not anybody we look up to particularly when he has such a \nrepressionist regime, but it makes sense to engage Cuba. That will \nprobably accelerate the changes in Cuba if we want; that is, the \nchanges toward a more democratic system.\n  I have traveled to Cuba a couple of times. I was there recently with \ngood Montanans, farmers and ranchers. I was struck with the poverty \nthat exists in Cuba. The Castro dictatorship has decimated the Cuban \neconomy, which is all the more reason why if we were to let Americans \nvisit Cuba certainly with respect to food and agricultural products and \ntrade with Cuba, that would help the Cuban people as well as give the \nUnited States farmers and ranchers another business opportunity.\n  It is time for a change. I understand the politics of this issue. We \nall know the politics. We also know politics are probably wrong. The \nreasons why the U.S. Government still has this travel ban are for \npolitical reasons that are not right. It is an opportunity for the \nUnited States and Congress to go on\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\nthe right course, the right direction, and put those political \nconsiderations aside and not be held hostage by the political interests \nbut, rather, allow American citizens to travel to Cuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am fortunate in that I represent the least \npopulous State in the United States; the advantage allows me the \nopportunity to meet almost everybody in the State. It has given me an \nopportunity to talk to the entire Cuban community in my State. As a \nresult, since I first got here, I have been working to try and make a \ndifference in our Cuban policy.\n  The first difficulty I knew of this policy concerned a constituent \nwho had been visiting his family in Cuba on the one trip allowed per \nyear. While he and his family were on the plane returning to the \nStates, his father died in Cuba. He was not allowed to go back for \nanother year.\n  Now, we have made some changes and I hope we can keep making \nincremental changes. That is all we are talking about--small, \nincremental changes, ones that make some common sense.\n  I am appalled at how Cubans are being treated by their government. We \nhave seen this kind of treatment in other countries at other times. It \nbrings to mind some of the escapes we saw from East Germany before the \nwall came down.\n  I just finished reading a book called ``The Secret Empire'' by Mr. \nTaubman. It goes into how Eisenhower established the CIA, had the U2 \nprogram and then the satellite program. It brings back a lot of \nmemories of events that happened during our life, part of which is \nCuba, with the Cuban missile crisis and some of the other events that \nhappened after that.\n  We have had a policy in place now for 40 years. For 40 years we have \nsaid: Sanctions. And for 40 years it has not worked.\n  When I was growing up, my dad often said, ``If you keep on doing what \nyou have already been doing, you will wind up with what you already \ngot.'' That is kind of where we are on the Cuban situation. We keep on \ndoing what we have always been doing and we wind up with exactly what \nwe have always had.\n  Fidel Castro is not interested in helping the side I am working on. \nHe does not really want United States participation there. He keeps \nthrowing out little roadblocks to keep it from happening. Fidel Castro \ndoes not like the amendments we have offered even though he may appear \nsometimes to be on that same side.\n  For instance, with visas, he is now offering open visas. Of course, \nhe knows we are not going to give visas, so that really does not allow \nany people into the country.\n  He keeps violating human rights. All of that is to keep his people in \ncontact with a free democracy, the United States, to keep our people \nfrom talking to the people in Cuba.\n  The people in Cuba can already get everything they need. They get it \nfrom other countries. Unilateral actions have not worked. That is what \nwe are talking about here, a unilateral action: The United States, \nstanding by itself, saying, Don't do anything with Cuba. Meanwhile, all \nthe other countries provide everything that is needed there. They are \nabout to learn something about providing it on credit, which we are not \ndoing. We are requiring cash on the few inroads we have made.\n  But we keep going in the wrong direction. The Transportation bill \nfunds an organization that takes it in that wrong direction. We have \nhad people-to-people trips to Cuba. There is a fellow in Wyoming who \nhad conducted some of these people-to-people trips to Cuba. The word \nis, they are limited on where they can stay and who they can talk to, \nso they are getting a very biased view.\n  I visited with him. I asked: How limited are you? He said: We aren't \nlimited; we cannot stay in the homes of individuals, but there is some \nselection on hotels. What we do during the daytime we have freedom to \ndo. The only freedom we are lacking is that people are afraid to talk \nto us because of the regime. That does add a degree of difficulty.\n  I thank Senator Lugar, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for holding a hearing on the Cuba situation. That is another \none of those firsts that is allowing us to make a little bit of \nprogress. I think incrementally we will keep making progress.\n  The amendment before us is just incremental progress. It is not a \ndrastic change in policy. It is something the House has already \napproved. I hope my colleagues will join us in approving the second-\ndegree amendment and the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \nfriend from North Dakota.\n  I am a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation that was introduced \nearlier this year that would allow travel between the United States and \nCuba.\n  Current policy with regard to Cuba, as enforced by the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Foreign Assets Control, permits travel to Cuba \nonly with permission in the form of a license from the Treasury office \nfor certain reasons such as to visits relatives, or for journalism, \nreligious, or humanitarian purposes.\n  According to Treasury documents, between 1996 and 2003, about one-\nthird of Cuba travel cases opened for investigation were referred for \ncivil penalty enforcement action. Typical penalty assessments for \nunauthorized travel range from $3,000 to $7,500.\n  For 40 years, the United States has maintained an isolationist \nposition toward Cuba, and the current regime has remained throughout \nthat time. I believe that permitting travel to Cuba would help \ndemonstrate to Cuban citizens what a democracy is all about.\n  Mr. President, it is time to lift the travel restrictions to Cuba.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend my friend from North Dakota and \nmy friend from Idaho for their amendments to prohibit the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Foreign Assets Control from wasting taxpayer \nfunds to enforce the ban on travel by American citizens to Cuba.\n  Today, any American who wants to travel to Iran, North Korea, Syria, \nVietnam, to just about anywhere, can do so as long as that country \ngives them a visa. As far as the U.S. Government is concerned, \nAmericans can visit any of those countries.\n  Cuba, on the other hand, a country that poses about as much threat to \nthe United States as a flea does to a buffalo, is off limits.\n  Of all the ridiculous, anachronistic, and self-defeating policies, \nthis has got to be near the top of the list. OFAC is spending scarce \nfunds to prosecute harmless, law-abiding, upstanding American citizens \nwho want nothing more than to experience another culture, and in doing \nso, leave a bit of America behind.\n  For 40 years, administration after administration, and Congress after \nCongress, has stuck by this failed policy. Yet Fidel Castro is as \nfirmly in control today as he was half a century ago.\n  The Dorgan and Craig amendments would inject some sense into our \npolicy toward Cuba, and they would protect one of the most fundamental \nrights that most Americans take for granted--the right to travel \nfreely.\n  A few years ago, I traveled to Cuba with Senator Jack Reed. We were \nable to go there because we are Members of Congress.\n  I came face to face with the absurdity of the current policy because \nI wanted my wife Marcelle to accompany me. A few days before we were to \nleave, I got a call from the State Department saying that they were not \nsure they could approve her travel to Cuba.\n  I cannot speak for other Senators, but I suspect that like me, they \nwould not react too kindly to a policy that gives the Government the \nauthority to prevent their wife, or other members of their family, from \ntraveling with them to a country with which we are not at war and \nwhich, according to the Defense Department and the vast majority of the \nAmerican public, poses no threat to our security.\n  I wonder how many Senators realize that if they wanted to take a \nfamily member with them to Cuba, they would probably be prohibited from \ndoing so.\n  Over a decade has passed since the collapse of the former Soviet \nUnion. The Russians long ago cut their $3 billion subsidy to Cuba. We \nnow give millions of dollars in aid to Russia.\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\n  Americans can travel to North Korea. There are no restrictions on the \nright of Americans to travel there. Which country poses a greater \nthreat to the United States? The answer is obvious.\n  Americans can travel to Iran, and they can spend money there. The \nsame goes for Syria.\n  Our policy is hypocritical, inconsistent, and contrary to our values \nas a nation that believes in the free flow of people and ideas. It is \nbeneath us. It is impossible for anyone to make a rationale argument \nthat an American should be able to travel freely to North Korea, or \nIran, but not to Cuba. It can't be done.\n  We have been stuck with this misguided policy for years, even though \nvirtually everyone knows, and says privately, that it makes absolutely \nno sense and is beneath the dignity of a great country.\n  It not only helps strengthen Fidel Castro's grip on Cuba, it hands a \nhuge advantage to our European competitors who are building \nrelationships and establishing future investments in a post-Castro \nCuba.\n  When that will happen is anybody's guess. President Castro is no \ndemocrat, and he is not going to become one. Human rights are \nsystematically denied in Cuba. That is beyond dispute. But it is time \nwe pursued a policy that is in our national interest, that helps pave \nthe way for the day when Castro is gone, and which stops punishing \nAmerican citizens.\n  Those who want to prevent Americans from traveling to Cuba, who \noppose this bill, will argue that spending U.S. dollars there helps \nprop up the Castro government.\n  To some extent that is true. The same can be said of spending dollars \nin Sudan, Syria, or any country. The Cuban Government does control the \nformal economy. It also runs schools and hospitals, maintains roads, \nand, like the U.S. Government, is responsible for a whole range of \nsocial services. Any money that goes into the Cuban economy also \nsupports those programs, which benefit ordinary Cubans.\n  There is also an informal economy in Cuba, because few Cubans can \nsurvive on their meager salaries. So the income from tourism also fuels \nthat informal sector, and it goes into the pockets of ordinary Cubans.\n  As much as we want to see a democratic Cuba, President Castro's grip \non power is not going to be weakened by keeping Americans from \ntraveling to Cuba. History has proven that.\n  Let's inject some maturity into our relations with Cuba. Let's have a \nlittle more faith in the power of our ideas. Let's have the courage to \nadmit that the cold war is over. Let's get the Government out of the \nbusiness of telling our wives, our children, and our constituents where \nthey can travel and spend their own money in a country that poses no \nthreat to us.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Dorgan's amendment prohibits the implementation \nof travel restrictions on Americans who wish to visit Cuba.\n  We all agree on the goal of peaceful change toward democracy and a \nfree market economy in Cuba. I'd like to ask my colleagues how \nrestricting the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba advances that \ngoal?\n  My mother was an immigrant from Lithuania, and as a Member of \nCongress I traveled to Lithuania when it was still under Communist \ndomination. The Communist government kept me out for days, but \neventually even they let me into the country.\n  During the cold war, Americans were able to travel to Soviet bloc \ncountries, and if they were kept out, it was by the Communists, not by \ntheir own Government.\n  I believe that interaction between Americans and ordinary Cubans can \nonly advance change in Cuba.\n  The more Americans go to Cuba, the more ordinary Cubans will interact \nwith them. I believe Castro has more to fear from American tourists \ntransmitting American ideas to Cubans than from our sanctions regime. \nAn army of tourists could be the most effective force for change we \ncould muster.\n  In fact, our sanctions policy has done more to motivate ordinary \nCubans to rally around their leader than it has to weaken the Castro \nregime. Restricting the rights of Americans to travel to Cuba undercuts \nour shared goal of bringing change to Cuba.\n  I support Senator Dorgan's amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it as well.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba. I and many of my \ncolleagues have been trying for the last five years to restore American \ncitizens' right to travel where they choose, including to the island of \nCuba, if that is their desire.\n  The broad cross-section of bipartisan cosponsors of this amendment \nare in agreement that the time has come to lift the very archaic, \ncounterproductive, and ill-conceived ban on Americans traveling to \nCuba. Not only does this ban hinder rather than help our effort to \nspread democracy, it unnecessarily abridges the rights of ordinary \nAmericans. The United States was founded on the principles of liberty \nand freedom. Yet when it comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these \nrights with no greater rationale than political and rhetorical gain.\n  Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of \nwater might as well be an entire ocean. We have made a land ripe for \nAmerican influence, forbidden territory. Look, there is no doubt in my \nmind that Fidel Castro does not want the light of freedom shone on his \nisland. He is a dictator and wants nothing more than to keep his people \nin the darkness. Sadly, U.S. policy has helped make his worker easier. \nWe have enabled the Cuban regime to be a closed system, with the Cuban \npeople having little contact with their closest neighbors.\n  Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of \nAmericans who might visit that island nation. Today Americans are free \nto travel to Iran, Sudan, Burma, Syria, and even to North Korea--but \nnot to Cuba. You can fly to North Korea; you can fly to Iran; you can \ntravel freely. It seems to me if you can go to those countries, you \nought not be denied the right to go to Cuba. If the Cubans want to stop \nAmericans from visiting that country, that ought to be their business. \nBut to say to an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where \nthey held American hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which \nhas declared us to be an enemy of theirs completely, but that you \ncannot travel 90 miles off our shore to Cuba, is a mistake.\n  To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be \n``the Great Satan.'' We hear it all the time. A little more than two \ndecades ago, Iran occupied our embassy and took innocent American \ndiplomats hostage. To this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American \nflag with the encouragement of some officials in that government. Those \nfew Americans who venture into such inhospitable surroundings often \nfind themselves pelted by rocks and accosted by the public.\n  Similarly, we do not ban travel to Sudan, a nation we attacked with \ncruise missiles a few short years ago, for its alleged support of \nterrorism; to Burma, a nation with one of the most oppressive regimes \nin the world today; to North Korea, whose soldiers have peered at \nAmerican servicemen through gun sights for decades; or Syria, which has \none of the most egregious human rights records and is one of the \nforemost sponsors of terrorism.\n  I totally agree with my colleagues that it borders on negligence when \n10 percent of the Treasury's Office on Foreign Assets Control budget is \ndevoted to tracking down and punishing grandmothers and grandfathers \nbecause they have visited Cuba. Don't we have more important programs \nto spend resources on? How about tracking down the financial resources \nthat continue to support terrorist groups like al-Qaida? We know that \nactivities of that organization and others like it are a direct threat \nto U.S. national security. We know that more government resources are \nneed to ensure that events like September 11, 2001 never again are \nrepeated against our citizens. Chasing down bikers who have visited \nCuba is doing nothing to ensure our citizens are protected against \nterrorist attacks.\n  It is time to get our priorities straight and end the inconsistency\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\nwith respect to U.S. travel restrictions to Cuba. We ban travel to \nCuba, a nation which is neither at war with the United States nor a \nsponsor of international terrorist activities.\n  Why do we ban travel? Ostensibly so that we can pressure Cuban \nauthorities into making the transition to a democratic form of \ngovernment.\n  I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values \nand ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. I \nfail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and \nfrom the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help \nbring about the change we all seek, serves our own interests.\n  The Cuban people are not currently permitted the freedom to travel \nenjoyed by many peoples around the world. However, because Fidel Castro \ndoes not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is not \njustification for adopting a similar principle in this country that \nsays Americans cannot travel freely. We have the Bill of Rights. We \nneed to treasure and respect the fundamental rights that we embrace as \nAmerican citizens. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to \nprohibit us from going there, then that is their business. But for us \nto say that citizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they \nlike is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on people.\n  If Americans can travel to North Korea, to the Sudan, to Iran, then I \ndo not understand the justification for saying that they cannot travel \nto Cuba.\n  I happen to believe that by allowing Americans to travel to Cuba, we \ncan begin to change the political climate and bring about the changes \nwe all seek in that country.\n  Today, every single country in the Western Hemisphere is a democracy, \nwith one exception: Cuba. American influence through person-to-person \nand cultural exchanges was a prime factor in this evolution from a \nhemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian or military regimes to \none where democracy is the rule. Our current policy toward Cuba blocks \nthese exchanges and prevents the United States from using our most \npotent weapon in our effort to combat totalitarian regimes, and that is \nour own people. They are the best ambassadors we have. Most \ntotalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their countries for \nthe very reasons I just mentioned. They are afraid the gospel of \nfreedom will motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, as they \nhave done in dozens of nations over the last half century. Isn't it \nironic that when it comes to Cuba we do the dictator's bidding for him \nin a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about America spreading \ndemocracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so.\n  Let me review for my colleagues who may travel to Cuba under current \ngovernment regulations and under what circumstances.\n  The following categories of people may travel to Cuba without \napplying to the Treasury Department for a specific license to travel. \nThey are deemed to be authorized to travel under so-called general \nlicense: Government officials, regularly employed journalists, \nprofessional researchers who are ``full time professionals who travel \nto Cuba to conduct professional research in their professional areas,'' \nCuban Americans who have relatives in Cuba who are ill--but only once a \nyear.\n  There are other categories of individuals who theoretically are \neligible to travel to Cuba as well, but they must apply for a license \nfrom the Department of the Treasury and prove they fit a category in \nwhich travel to Cuba is permissible. What are these categories? The \nfirst is so called freelance journalists, provided they can prove they \nare journalists; they must also submit their itinerary for the proposed \nresearch. The second is Cuban Americans who are unfortunate enough to \nhave more than one humanitarian emergency in a 12-month period and \ntherefore cannot travel under a general license. The third is students \nand faculty from U.S. academic institutions that are accredited by an \nappropriate national or regional educational accrediting association \nwho are participating in a ``structural education program.'' The fourth \nis members of U.S. religious organizations.\n  The fifth is individuals participating in public performances, \nclinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions and exhibitions. If \nthat isn't complicated enough--just because you think you may fall into \none of the above enumerated categories does not necessarily mean you \nwill actually be licensed by the U.S. Government to travel to Cuba.\n  Under current regulations, who decides whether a researcher's work is \nlegitimate? Who decides whether a freelance journalist is really \nconducting journalistic activities? Who decides whether or not a \nprofessor or student is participating in a ``structured educational \nprogram''?\n  Who decides whether a religious person is really going to conduct \nreligious activities? Government bureaucrats are making those decisions \nabout what I believe should be personal rights of American citizens.\n  It is truly unsettling, to put it mildly, when you think about it, \nand probably unconstitutional at its core. It is a real intrusion on \nthe fundamental rights of American citizens. It also says something \nabout what we as a government think about our own people.\n  Do we really believe that a journalist, a government official, a \nSenator, a Congressman, a baseball player, a ballerina, a college \nprofessor or minister is somehow superior to other citizens who do not \nfall into those categories; that only these categories of people are \n``good examples'' for the Cuban people to observe in order to \nunderstand American values?\n  I do not think so. I find such a notion insulting. There is no better \nway to communicate America's values and ideals than by unleashing \naverage American men and women to demonstrate by daily living what our \ngreat country stands for and the contrasts between what we stand for \nand what exists in Cuba today.\n  I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting \nAmericans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion and an end to the cold war, I do not think any excuse remains \ntoday to ban this kind of travel. This argument that dollars and \ntourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime \nseems to have survived more than 40 years despite the Draconian U.S. \nembargo during that entire period. The notion that allowing Americans \nto spend a few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and \ncomfort to the Cuban regime is without basis, in my view.\n  Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms \nof American citizens.\n  Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law which counteracts one \nof the basic premises of American foreign policy; namely, the spread of \ndemocracy. The time has come to allow Americans--average Americans--to \ntravel freely to Cuba.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment and restore \nAmerican citizens' rights to travel wherever they choose, including to \nthe island of Cuba.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nintroduced by Senators Dorgan and Craig that will suspend enforcement \nof the travel ban on Cuba.\n  As many of my colleagues know, in March of this year the Office of \nForeign Assets Control at the Department of Treasury published new \nregulations that would severely restrict licensed travel by United \nStates citizens to Cuba for educational activities. I think I would not \nbe incorrect to call this regulatory change another backward step in a \nCuba policy that has proven to be wrongheaded and counterproductive. We \nhave in place at this time a trade, investment, and travel ban with \nCuba that has been in place since the early 1960s that has had no \ntangible effect on the policies that have been implemented in that \ncountry. We now have proposed by the Department of Treasury a further \ntightening of these restrictions with no logical policy justification \nof which I am aware. We are talking about continuing the exact same \npolicy with Cuba that has been in place for over 40 years and then \nwondering why we have the exact same results--year after year after \nyear. I am afraid it makes no sense to me.\n  As a response, Senators Baucus and Enzi introduced legislation--of \nwhich I was an original cosponsor, S. 950--that was specifically \ndesigned to reverse this travel ban. The Dorgan-Craig\n\n[[Page S13086]]\n\namendment is a shortened version of this legislation. Having recently \npassed in the House, I believe it reflects a visible trend on both \nsides of the aisle in both the Senate and the House toward a very \nsimply proposition: the ongoing embargo with Cuba represents a \nsignificant foreign policy failure on the part of the U.S. Government \nin that it has only solidified the position of Castro and perpetuated \nthe power of his brutal regime. What we have seen is a vicious circle \nwhere our unwillingness to engage Cuba has led to an inability on our \npart to influence the direction and speed of that country's political \nand economic development. Given the prominent issues in the country and \nthe potential trajectories a post-Castro Cuba might take, this is not \nan exercise in theory. There are very real costs for the United States, \nin both the region and the world, if we do not work constructively and \npurposively toward a transition to a peaceful, democratic society and a \nfree market economy in Cuba.\n  No one in Congress approves of the policies or the politics used by \nCastro. I personally deplore the regime's repressive tactics and \nsupport the movement in the country that has attempted to increase \npolitical participation. As it stands now, the lack of freedom and \nopportunity in Cuba stands in direct contrast to the rest of Latin \nAmerica, and is a very real reflection of the inability of Castro to be \nin touch with the needs and desires of his people. Cuba now stands \npractically alone in Latin America in its ability to nurture the growth \nof democracy, establish the protection of individual human rights, and \ncreate a semblance of economic security.\n  But this is a question of how best to achieve the goals we all want. \nI am of the view that more, not less engagement will get us where we \nwant to go. I am of the view that our strongest lever and possibility \nfor change comes from intensive and ongoing interaction with the Cuban \npeople. This amendment is a small but important step in that direction. \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the Dorgan amendment \nto lift the Cuba travel ban.\n  Mr. President, a few months ago, Fidel Castro saw his opportunity to \ndeal with his internal critics once and for all. Seventy-five \ndissidents and independent journalists were rounded up, tried in \nkangaroo courts, and given sentences as high as 28 years in prison--for \na cumulative total of 1,454 years--simply for the crime of being \nindependent journalists, or economists, or democracy advocates.\n  Castro's actions were so galling, so blatant, that even some of his \nmost craven apologists expressed shock. The European Union which until \nthen had been happy to make a tidy profit at the expense of Cubans, \nimposed travel restrictions and other sanctions on the Castro \ndictatorship. Newspapers changed their position on sanctions. For \nexample, the Los Angeles Times wrote, ``After years of calling for \nliberalized relations with Cuba, this editorial page must now urge \nAmerican policymakers to hit the brakes. Before Congress even thinks \nabout loosening restrictions, it should demand that Castro free those \nrounded up and demonstrate that his nation is moving toward democracy \nand away from totalitarianism.''\n  Nothing has changed. Those dissidents are still rotting in Castro's \njails.\n  Nonetheless, today, the majority of the United States could decide to \nignore the pain and suffering of those 75 dissidents and turn the other \nway. They could decide to reward Castro by voting to lift the travel \nban and let American dollars finance Castro's instruments of \nrepression.\n  The appeasers keep saying that weakening the embargo by lifting the \ntravel ban will hasten Castro's demise. Whenever they say this, I \nalways ask: How?\n  The answer is always vague--something about how travel by Americans \nto Cuba will somehow transform Cuba and change Castro's ways. Well, I \nlook at Cuba today and see a lot of European and Canadian tourists that \nhave been going there for years--yet Cuba has not been transformed, and \nCastro has not changed one iota.\n  The fact is, American tourists cannot change Cuba any more than \nEuropeans or Canadians or Latin Americans have--because in Cuba you \ncannot do business with individual Cubans--you have to do business with \nCastro.\n  Castro practices tourist apartheid. He sets aside hotels, beaches, \nstores, restaurants, and hospitals for foreigners. Cubans are not \npermitted in those places. Anyone who believes that Americans drinking \nmojitos while sunning themselves on the beaches of Varadero is going to \nliberate the Cuban people doesn't understand the nature of tyranny.\n  Tourists even fund Castro's security apparatus when they stay in \nhotels owned by foreign investors. In Cuba, when a foreign investor \ncomes to town, they do not hire or pay Cuban workers directly--only the \nCastro regime can legally employ a Cuban citizen. They pay Castro in \nhard currency for each worker--often as much as $10,000 per employee. \nCastro then pays the workers in worthless Cuban pesos--the equivalent \nof $15 or $20 a month--and pockets the rest.\n  The result is that foreign businesses in Cuba are paying Castro \nhundreds of millions of dollars in direct cash subsidies--while the \nCuban people get nothing. These foreign investors have effectively \nreplaced the Soviet Union as the source of Castro's hard currency \nsubsidies.\n  Under these circumstances, American travel to Cuba cannot liberate \nthe Cuban people.\n  To the contrary, it would only help Castro prop up Cuba's teetering \neconomy and perpetuate his dictatorship. Under these conditions, \nAmerican dollars would do nothing to promote democracy or \nentrepreneurship of independence from the state. All it would do is \ndirectly subsidize the oppression of the Cuban people.\n  Fortunately, we have a President who is not going to allow that to \nhappen--who will veto this bill if presented to him with a lifting of \nthe travel ban.\n  One of these days Cuba will be free--and I want to be able to look \nthe Cuban people in the eye, and say to them that not one dime of the \nmoney used to repress, imprison and torture them came from legal \nAmerican investors. I want to be able to look them in the eye, and say \nour tourists did not come and rape their wives and daughters, who had \nto sell their bodies to foreign tourists to feed their families under \nCastro's regime. I want to be able to say that we did not subsidize \ntheir oppression.\n  The Cuban people will remember who supported them and who supported \nFidel Castro. Mr. President, this Senator chooses to stand with the \nCuban people, and to oppose the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would limit the funding of \nthe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n  There are about 135,000 Americans who go to Cuba every year. Some \nMembers of the Congress have been there. But why should we now open up \ntravel to Cuba and give additional cashflow to the Castro regime?\n  There is no rule of law there. Tourists have been frequently \ndetained, as in the case of American citizen Ron Shelton. I wish we had \na poster to show that.\n  It is unconscionable that after the recent crackdown and arrest by \nCastro of nearly 80 dissident human rights activists and opposition \nleaders that this comes up now at this time to sort of reward him for \nthat activity.\n  It is a cash-starved dictatorship, and no matter what anyone says, \nopening the doors for American tourism will feed that dictatorship and \ngive him the ability to select his successor without any participation \nof the Cubans in a democratic way.\n  We have always said we would restore relations with Cuba when they \nhad a change in their system and restored democracy to Cuba.\n  The Cuban regime is listed by the State Department as one of the \nseven nations responsible for sponsoring terrorism. The other six \nnations are Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. The Cuban \nregime was added to the list in 1982, and remains there because of \nCastro's personal support of revolutionary and terrorist groups.\n  Now, Canadians and Europeans have been traveling to Cuba for the last \n10 years, but those tourist dollars have not assisted the Cuban people, \nas my colleagues have reported. There still\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\nare great signs of problems for the average Cuban. But the Cuban regime \ncontinues to host numerous terrorist organizations as well as many \nfugitives from U.S. justice.\n  Castro provides safe haven and support to terrorists all over the \nworld. State Department officials have asserted Castro's government \n``has at least a limited developmental offensive biological warfare \nresearch and development effort.'' I do not see that this is the time \nto authorize sending tourism dollars to support a proterrorism regime.\n  In May of 2001, Castro visited Iran and met with Mohammad Khatami. At \nTehran University, Castro publicly praised Iran for its struggles \nagainst American imperialism and said his visit would strengthen the \nbonds between the two nations. Both of those countries are covered by \nthe current U.S. sanctions.\n  Castro publicly stated:\n\n       My visit to Iran for me and my nation is a great privilege. \n     I truly believe that the relations of the two countries will \n     be stronger after this trip.\n\n  He took Cuban tourism to Iran and thinks that is going to improve \nrelations between the two proterrorist nations. I do not believe we \nshould overlook the fact that he said:\n\n       Iran and Cuba, in cooperation with each other, can bring \n     America to its knees.\n\n  Let me repeat that. He said, in 2001:\n\n       Iran and Cuba, in cooperation with each other, can bring \n     America to its knees. The U.S. regime is very weak, and we \n     are witnessing this weakness from close up.\n\n  That is speaking as a Cuban close off our shores.\n  The administration has indicated to us on the Appropriations \nCommittee that it understood that ``amendments may be offered that \nwould weaken current sanctions against Cuba. The administration \nbelieves it is essential to maintain sanctions and travel restrictions \nto deny economic resources to the brutal Castro regime'' particularly \nwhen he has already stated his goal is to weaken the United States and \nto bring this Nation to its knees.\n  I am told that if the final version of this bill contains such a \nprovision, the President's senior advisers would recommend he veto the \nbill.\n  As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I bring to the floor \nthe message of the President of the United States, and I move to table \nthis amendment and ask for the yeas.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I advise all Members it is very likely that \nfollowing this vote--10 or 15 minutes after the finalization of this \nvote--there will be another vote. Everyone should be advised of that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I was going to say that. I emphasize, after we vote \non this motion to table, we believe there will be another motion to \ntable soon after 12:30.\n  Mr. President, I do move to table this amendment, the underlying \namendment, and that will take the second-degree amendment along with \nit, I understand. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1900.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) \nand the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), and the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n   I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

For the information of all Senators, I intend to make a \nmotion on the soon-to-be-offered amendment of Senator Feingold rather \nsoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1904\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1904.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 2003)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     adjustment shall be made under section 601(a) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) \n     (relating to cost of living adjustments for Members of \n     Congress) during fiscal year 2004.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on this \namendment to cancel the scheduled pay raise for Members, I want to note \nit is possible at some point the Senator may raise a point of order \nunder rule XVI that this amendment constitutes legislating on \nappropriations. That is a nondebatable question so I would like to take \nthis opportunity to make a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State your inquiry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is there a defense of germaneness available for this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  There it is. This amendment is germane to the underlying measure. In \nfact, it is clearly germane. As some may know, the pay raise provisions \nfor\n\n[[Page S13088]]\n\ngeneral scheduled Federal employees directly impact the automatic pay \nadjustment for Members. Without the provisions included in the \nunderlying bill, Members' pay would be less than it would be otherwise.\n  I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding. There is no \nlegitimate point of order that might be raised. This is the pay raise \nvote for the year. The amendment is germane to the underlying bill, and \nI wanted to make that crystal clear in the event some might try to \nportray this vote on this issue as a purely procedural vote.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would simply eliminate the \nroughly $3,400 pay raise for Members of Congress that is scheduled to \ngo into effect next January. Put simply, this is the wrong time for \nCongress to give itself a pay hike. Our economy is still recovering \nfrom the recent slowdown. The financial markets have been rocked, \nwiping out a large portion of the life savings and retirement accounts \nof many families. Thousands of workers were laid off and have not \nreturned to work, and families face increasing financial pressures. \nAfter finally balancing our budget, we are now facing record annual \ndeficits. CBO reports our deficit for the fiscal year that just ended \non September 30 was an all-time record $374 billion. If we do not count \nthe Social Security surpluses, and I do not think we should count them, \nthe deficit is nearly $530 billion.\n  For the current fiscal year, CBO projects a unified budget deficit of \n$480 billion. Without counting Social Security, the deficit is \nprojected to be $636 billion. Those figures do not include, of course, \nthe $87 billion in additional funding the President has requested for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Over the next 5 years, CBO projects the budget deficits to total $1.4 \ntrillion. Without using Social Security surpluses, the deficits are \nprojected to total $2.4 trillion. The budget spends all of the \nGovernment's general revenues and goes well beyond that, running \nthrough all of the Social Security trust fund balances. That is \nsomething we should do only to meet the most critical national \npriorities.\n  I submit a $3,400 pay raise for Members is not a critical national \npriority. No one can argue this pay raise is justified because Members \nhave not had a pay raise in a while. This is the fifth pay raise in as \nmany years.\n  On January 1, 2000, Members received a $4,600 pay raise. On January \n1, 2001, Members received a $3,800 pay raise. On January 1, 2002, \nMembers received a $4,900 pay raise. On January 1, 2003, Members \nreceived a $5,000 pay raise, and unless we stop it, on January 1, 2004, \nMembers will receive a $3,400 pay raise.\n\n  That will mean that as of next January, Members will have received \nfive consecutive pay hikes totaling over $21,000. Members will be \nreceiving an annual salary that is $21,000 higher than they did in 1999 \nbecause of automatic pay raises.\n  Now, $21,000 is more than the average annual Social Security benefit \nfor a retired worker and spouse. It is more than the average annual \nSocial Security benefit for a disabled worker, spouse, and child. It is \nmore than someone working minimum wage could make in a year and a half.\n  While Congress is receiving all of these pay raises, the rest of the \ncountry has not been so fortunate. The most recent employment report we \nhave from the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the number of unemployed \nis nearly 9 million people and the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent. \nThe number of long-term unemployed is over 2 million, the highest \nlevels in over a decade. I think that bears repeating. The number of \nlong-term unemployed is 2 million people.\n  So I ask, How can Congress give itself a $3,400 pay raise while \nnearly 9 million people are unemployed and 2 million have been out of \nwork for more than half of a year?\n  It was recently announced that Social Security recipients will be \nreceiving only the most modest cost-of-living adjustment. The average \nretiree will be receiving a COLA of about $19 per month or $228 per \nyear. I should add, half of the Social Security COLA will be eaten up \nby a hike in Medicare premiums. It will not be lost on the millions of \nretirees that while they are getting a COLA of $228 in 2004, Members of \nCongress will be giving themselves a pay hike of $3,400.\n  This automatic stealth pay raise system is just wrong. As I have \nnoted before in discussing this matter, it is an unusual thing to have \nthe power to raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of \nour constituents do not have that power. That this power is so unusual \nis a good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly and \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote in the Record. That is why this process of pay \nraises without accountability must end. I think it is wrong. I believe \nit may be unconstitutional.\n  The 27th amendment of the Constitution states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  I recognize some of my colleagues may want a pay raise, and I \ncertainly understand that feeling. I do not suppose there is anyone who \nis working today who would not want a pay raise. Two years ago, a \ncolleague said to me that Members deserved a pay increase because of \nall that we had been through. I strongly disagree with that assessment, \nbut I understood the sentiment.\n  I mention all of this because I firmly believe even those who favor a \npay hike should support an open and public vote on the increase. \nCertainly having a vote on the record for a pay hike is better than the \nstealth pay raise that takes place with no action. Standing up and \nmaking a case before the voters is far better than letting the pay \nraise take effect. I, for one, would be interested to hear someone \nexplain just why Congress should get a $3,400 pay raise in the face of \nrecord budget deficits, an economic downturn, and record unemployment. \nWho knows. Maybe somebody can actually make the case, but we really \nshould scrap the current stealth pay raise system, and I have \nintroduced legislation to stop this process.\n  The amendment I offer today does not go that far. All it does is stop \nthe pay raise that is scheduled to go into effect in January, the fifth \npay raise in 5 years. Let's stop this backdoor pay raise and then let's \nenact legislation to end this practice once and for all.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am in opposition to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will ask for the yeas and nays in a minute on my \nmotion. I think we should be clear about the issue before the Senate. \nThe issue really is whether the cost-of-living provision in this bill \nshould apply to Members as it does to others who work for the Federal \nGovernment. We have provided COLAs to military personnel, civil \nservants, Social Security beneficiaries, a whole list of other \ncategories of Federal service, Civil Service and Federal service. This \nis not a pay raise. It is an increase that is required by law.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Today, Senators regrettably voted to increase their \npay for the fifth year in a row. Next year, as a result of today's \naction, most of our salaries will be $3,400 higher than they are this \nyear.\n  While I have supported the congressional pay raise in the past, I \ncannot in good conscience support it this year. It simply sends the \nwrong signal to the millions of Americans who are unemployed, or who \nhave taken jobs that pay far less than their previous jobs in order to \nmake ends meet. There are millions of people out there who may not be \nunemployed, as the formal statistics count them, but they are surely \nunderemployed working part-time instead of full-time, taking a low-\npaying hourly job just to have some money coming in, or taking a new \njob that pays them substantially less than their last job. According to \nthe Labor Department, nearly 5 million people who want full-time jobs \nhave settled for part-time work, an increase of 30 percent in 3 years. \nIn September, despite the fact that the economy created 57,000 new \njobs, the percentage of the population with full-time jobs actually \ndeclined, and the number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more \nincreased.\n\n[[Page S13089]]\n\n  In fact, just today, on the very day that the pay increase passed the \nSenate, a cover story in the newspaper USA Today explained how millions \nof people across America are having to take what the paper called \n``survival jobs.''\n  A recent report in the Wall Street Journal said that more than 50 \npercent of Americans who took new jobs last year took a pay cut. Some \nof my colleagues may call these ``new jobs,'' arguing that it shows the \nPresident's three successive tax cuts are starting to work. I don't \nknow what economy they are looking at, but where I come from, when a \n$50,000 a year worker finds a new job that pays her $30,000, the \nstatistics may count this as a new job, but try telling this American \nthat tax cuts have made her ``better off.'' I don't think it's worth \nmortgaging our financial future by borrowing record amounts in order to \ncreate new jobs that pay Americans less than they made before. And I \ndon't think that we should be getting a pay raise when so many hard-\nworking Americans are getting pay cuts.\n  In conclusion, it's simply the wrong time for us to take this action, \nand I do not support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1905.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using funds to \n         go forward with its proposed cash balance regulation)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds made available in this Act may be \n     used by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate to \n     issue any rule or regulation which implements the proposed \n     amendments to Internal Revenue Service regulations set forth \n     in REG-209500-86 and REG-164464-02, filed December 10, 2002, \n     or any amendments reaching results similar to such proposed \n     amendments.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment has some history in the \nSenate and the House. I will try to enlighten Senators as to the \nbackground and what it is about. Hopefully, we can have support for the \namendment and adopt it.\n  Basically, it stops the Treasury Department from moving forward with \na regulation that would allow companies to convert from a traditional \ndefined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan in a way that would \nhurt older workers. We are not saying they can't promulgate a rule that \nwouldn't allow a company to go from a defined benefit plan to a cash \nbalance plan. We are just saying, they should not do it in a way that \nhurts older workers. Let me talk about that a little bit and what is \nbehind it.\n  I am not totally opposed to cash balance plans. Some designs can be \nvery good. Some can be a great deal better for younger workers, for \nexample, than an uninsured defined contribution plan. Some are not. I \nam not saying we should prohibit any cash balance plans from existing. \nHowever, we need to make sure employers put in place a fair and \nequitable manner for treating these.\n  I have been following this issue closely for several years. In the \nmid-1990s, a groundswell of companies started converting from \ntraditional defined benefit plans to hybrid plans, including cash \nbalance plans. A couple of years later, some older workers who were \nnearing retirement started looking at the effect of this conversion on \ntheir account. They were shocked to find they hadn't been accruing any \nbenefits for years. In other words, workers who were, say, in their \nforties or early fifties when the company converted from a defined \nbenefit plan to a cash balance plan, didn't really know how the \nconversion would affect them. Then after several years, these older \nworkers looked and found out they had been working for several years \nand their pension had not increased one penny, even though they had \nbeen working. Yet younger workers, age 20, 25, saw their pension plans \nincrease.\n  A lot of workers nearing retirement, thinking they were going to get \nwhat they had assumed was going to be their retirement and their \npension, all of a sudden found out their pension had been worn away \nover several years. It turned out that employers were freezing the \naccounts in the old plan, then they established a lower opening account \nbalance in the new plan which meant, simply, that the longer you were \nin the plan, the longer you were working without earning any new \nbenefits. That became a term called ``wearaway.'' In other words, your \npension benefits wore away.\n  Many people said: This is nothing less than age discrimination. In \nother words, I am working for the company. I have been there for 20 \nyears. They switch their pension program. A younger person gets more in \ntheir pension program than I get in mine.\n  A new 25-year-old employee would be getting more money contributed to \ntheir pension account, while a 45-year-old who had been loyal to the \ncompany for 20 years would not get anything. I was shocked and appalled \nto learn about this practice, and so were thousands of loyal, hard-\nworking Americans.\n  In 1999, I introduced a bill to make it illegal for corporations to \nwear away\n\n[[Page S13090]]\n\nthe benefits of older workers during these conversions. We raised the \nprofile of this issue. We raised it with Treasury. In September of \n1999, the Treasury Department issued a moratorium on conversions from \ndefined benefit plans to cash balance plans. The momentum against these \nunfair conversions was building as more and more companies changed, as \nmore and more workers found their pensions were worn away.\n  In April of 2000, we in the Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution without objection, stating that the wearing away of current \nbenefits during cash balance conversions is unfair and wrong--a \nunanimous sense-of-the-Senate resolution in April of 2000.\n  Well, now we go to 2001 and 2002, and not much is happening. That \nmoratorium stayed on, by the way, through 2000, 2001, and 2002. \nHowever, last December, Treasury issued a regulation that would turn \nthe clock back, undo the moratorium, allow more businesses to go \nforward with conversions in this wrong manner--the manner that would \nwear away the pensions of older workers.\n  Very soon after that, 191 members of the House of Representatives, \nand 26 Senators signed a bipartisan letter to President Bush asking \nthat we do not reopen the floodgates, that we withdraw this rule and \npromulgate a rule that is fair and equitable. Well, now, as you might \nimagine, during this period of time some of these workers who found \nthat their pensions had been worn away went to court. In August, a \ndistrict judge in East St. Louis, in the case of Cooper v. IBM--IBM was \none of the larger, well-known companies that engaged in this practice--\nruled in favor of the plaintiff on her age discrimination claim.\n  Now, on September 9--I am talking about last month, and this case was \ndecided in August--the House of Representatives voted 258 to 160--again \nbipartisan, with 65 Republicans voting for the amendment--saying that \nthe IRS should not issue a regulation that would overturn this ruling \nby the district judge in East St. Louis.\n  So now we are into October. I might just say that all of these have \nbeen positive steps. We had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in 2000. \nWe had the moratorium. Last December, the Treasury Department--I might \nadd, if I am not mistaken, I don't think there was a Secretary of the \nTreasury at that time in place--issued this rule to turn the clock \nback, and 196 members of the House and 26 Senators signed a letter to \nPresident Bush saying withdraw this rule and have one that is fair and \nequitable.\n  In August, there was the district court ruling. On September 9, last \nmonth, the House voted 250 to 196 that the IRS should not issue a \nregulation that would overturn this ruling. There have been a lot of \npositive steps, but this regulation is still hanging out there.\n  One other thing happened. Last January, Senator Durbin and I \nindicated that we might place a hold on the nomination of Mr. John Snow \nto be Secretary of the Treasury. Well, Mr. Snow was a very popular \nperson and we didn't have anything personally against him; I want to \nmake that clear. But we wanted to raise this issue. So Mr. Snow, a fine \ngentleman and outstanding business executive, someone who has gotten \nhigh accolades for his tenure in business as a business executive, met \nwith Senator Durbin and me in my office. He said on this critical issue \nhe would let fairness guide the regulatory process.\n  Mr. Snow had talked about what they had done at CSX, the company he \nhad been CEO of, and how they had, I believe, instituted a cash balance \nplan, and a choice between the old plan and the new plan, which sounded \nfair and reasonable to me--let the worker decide what they want, which \nmeans many younger workers would probably pick the cash balance plan, \nand older workers might stay with a defined benefit plan. Mr. Snow said \nhe would let fairness guide this regulatory process. That is the way we \nought to go.\n  The fairness ought to be in working with Congress to develop this new \nregulation. So I think the best way to ensure that we do this is to \nensure, No. 1, that Congress speaks on this issue; that Congress is \ninvolved in working with Treasury to make sure we come up with a fair \nand equitable rule dealing with pensions.\n  Secondly, I think the best way to make sure this happens, and to make \nsure that Congress is able to work and have a seat at the table is to \nadopt this amendment.\n  This regulation must be withdrawn. We need to work together to find a \nreasonable, bipartisan legislative solution to this complex problem. \nThis is an incredibly important issue to American workers. It is very \nimportant for them to know that we stand united behind them in this \nstruggle for fairness.\n  Mr. President, I spoke about this many times on the Senate floor. In \nterms of what distinguishes the American workplace in so many ways from \nothers around the world, we have always valued loyalty and productivity \nin the American workplace--loyalty and productivity. If you are hard \nworking and you are productive and you are loyal, U.S. companies have \nalways valued that--at least they used to. That is one of the reasons \ncompanies have offered defined benefit pension plans. The longer you \nwork and the more loyal you are to the company, you get a bigger \npension. It makes sense.\n\n  So the longer you work someplace, the better you do your job, the \nmore you learn about it, the more productive you are, that is what we \nvalue. We value that productivity and loyalty.\n  Now if companies are able to just break these promises at random, \nwhat kind of a signal does that send to U.S. workers? It tells workers \nthey are foolish to be loyal because their employer could just change \nthe rules of the game at any time and leave them out in the cold. It \ndestroys the kind of work ethic that we have come to value and that I \nbelieve built this country, which distinguishes us from other countries \naround the world. We value fairness when it comes to workers. A deal is \na deal.\n  I offer this analogy. Let's say I am offered a job. The employer says \nto me: OK, Senator Harkin, we are going to hire you and we are going to \nhave a 5-year job here for you to do. If you stay with us for 5 years \nand you work for 5 years, we will give you a $50,000 bonus. I think \nthat is a pretty good deal, so we shake hands, and I agree on that. So \nI worked at the company for 3 years, then my boss comes to me and says: \nHarkin, you know that deal we made where we said if you would work here \n5 years, you would get a $50,000 bonus? Well, you have been here for 3 \nyears and, guess what, the deal is off. Just like that, the deal is \noff. But I went to work for that company depending upon that.\n  That is what happens to a lot of people. They depend upon the kind of \npension program the company has. That is one of the things, when \ncompanies recruit workers out of college or vocational schools, people \nlook at what kind of pension program they have. Well, if after a \ncertain amount of time they say, sorry, it is off, you don't get any of \nthis, what does that say about loyalty and productivity?\n  I don't think that is the way we want to treat workers in this \ncountry where the employer holds all the cards and can change the deal \nanytime they want.\n  Again, I didn't have any stake--but, Harkin, you didn't contribute \nanything to that bonus. We said if you worked here 5 years, we would \ngive you a $50,000 bonus, but we paid you the salary we agreed upon, \ndid we not?\n  Yes.\n  You didn't put anything into that $50,000 bonus; that is something we \nwere going to give you. Now we reneged on it. You don't have anything \nto gripe about.\n  Wait a minute. I have given 3 years to this company. I worked hard. I \nwas productive because I wanted to get that bonus for 5 years, so it is \nnot true to say I didn't put anything into the bonus.\n  This is like saying you didn't put anything into the pension plan. \nThis is something the company offered you. Oh, yes, you did. You may \nhave put in 20 or 25 years of loyal, hard work and diligence. If you \nhad known 20 years ago they were going to pull the rug out from \nunderneath you, would you have stayed with that company or would you \nmaybe have gone someplace else?\n  Again, I hope people disabuse themselves of the idea that somehow a \npension is just what the company offers you and you don't have any \nstake in it. You have a big stake in it. It is what they promised you \nwhen you went to work there, and you went to work there relying upon \nthat promise.\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\n  I am not saying they can't change their pension programs. Times \nchange, conditions change, the workforce changes. I understand all \nthat. New kinds of pension programs come on the market dealing with \nexisting circumstances or what the future might be. That is fine, just \nas long as, No. 1, they treat workers fairly, and No. 2, that a deal is \na deal. It seems to me if you work for a company for 20 years and they \nwant to switch their pension plan, but you made a deal on one and you \nwant to stick with that one, they ought to at least let you continue to \nwork and retire under that plan. If you want to switch, it ought to be \nup to the worker.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is simply about saying \nto the Treasury Department they can't issue this proposed rule they \nhave come up with which, as I said, last month the House voted 258 to \n160 to say no to and which earlier this year 191 Members of the House \nand 26 Senators signed a letter to President Bush saying withdraw the \nrule.\n  That is what this amendment does. It simply says: Withdraw this rule; \nwork with Congress. Let's have something that is fair and equitable for \nour workers.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this amendment in \nfairness to American workers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the AARP \ndated October 23, 2003, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                           of Retired Persons,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2003.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: AARP supports your amendment to the \n     Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies \n     Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004 that would prohibit \n     the IRS from using funds to go forward with its proposed cash \n     balance regulations. The House passed a similar amendment on \n     September 9, 2003 by a strong bipartisan vote of 258-160.\n       This amendment would not change existing law. It is in \n     keeping with the court decision in Kathi Cooper, et al. v. \n     IBM Personal Pension Plan, et al. The court concluded that \n     cash balance pension plans discriminate against older \n     workers, cut older workers' benefits, and serve to lower the \n     costs and contribute to the profits of companies sponsoring \n     cash balance plans.\n       In September 1999, the IRS imposed a moratorium on \n     corporate plans that convert traditional defined benefit \n     plans to a cash balance formula in order to allow Congress \n     and others to review cash balance plans to make sure that the \n     conversions comply with current pension and age \n     discrimination laws. The moratorium suspended consideration \n     of approximately 300 pending applications submitted by \n     corporations to convert an existing plan to a cash balance \n     formula. The Treasury proposed regulations in December 2002 \n     that would lift the moratorium and allow corporations to \n     establish plans that the federal courts have ruled \n     discriminate against older workers.\n       AARP believes that Treasury should not act on regulations \n     that would encourage companies to change their pension plans \n     in a manner that is contrary to age discrimination laws and \n     the federal court ruling. Rather, Congress should review the \n     ruling and enact the pension reform measures necessary to \n     protect older workers.\n       AARP urges you to vote for this timely and important \n     amendment. AARP hopes that this amendment will send a strong \n     message that we value older workers and that we reaffirm \n     those older workers should not be subject to age \n     discrimination in their pension plans and their pension \n     benefits should be calculated fairly as directed by Congress \n     and the Federal courts.\n       Please let me know, or have your staff call Frank Toohey \n     (202-434-3760) of our Federal Affairs office if we can be of \n     further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael W. Naylor,\n                                             Director of Advocacy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Harkin \non this amendment to protect workers' retirement.\n  We know that for millions of American workers, their pension benefits \nare in danger. The continuing weak economy and rising health costs are \npressuring thousands of employers to reduce or terminate their \ntraditional defined benefit pension plans.\n  One way that companies are slashing costs is by converting \ntraditional pension plans to cash balance plans. Older employees are \nthe hardest hit by these conversions. According to the General \nAccounting Office, annual pension benefits of older employees can drop \nas much as 50 percent after a company converts to a cash balance plan.\n  Companies are doing it to save hundreds of millions of dollars in \npension costs. But those savings are being taken out of the retirement \nsecurity of American workers.\n  These proposed Treasury regulations would give companies legal \nprotection against claims of age discrimination by older employees. \nThousands of companies would have a strong incentive to convert to cash \nbalance plans. Millions of workers could lose huge chunks of the \npensions they have been promised.\n  Cash balance pension plans do have some advantages for some workers. \nIncreased portability of pensions is important. So is providing pension \nbenefits for parents, particularly women, who move in and out of the \nworkforce. We support greater benefits for younger workers, who are \nmore likely than ever to have several employers throughout their \ncareers. But Treasury can and must do more to protect the workers who \nare hurt by these conversions.\n  The Harkin amendment would halt Treasury's proposed regulations. \nWorkers should have choice about benefits under their pension plans, \nand they deserve protections when their company converts to a cash \nbalance plan. It is wrong to let companies freeze the benefits for \nolder workers, or reduce future benefits, when these workers have \nalready contributed so many years of service to their companies.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and do the right \nthing to protect the retirement of our Nation's workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the managers have no objection to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa. I urge the amendment be \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, we need to check something. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to say again the managers have no \nobjection to this amendment, and I urge the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If there is no \nfurther debate, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1905) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for \naccepting this amendment. Again, this amendment is going to send a \nstrong signal that both bodies want to work with the Treasury \nDepartment to establish a fair and equitable rule on pensions. I thank \nthe managers.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1917\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk and ask its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1917.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13092]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for implementing the 2003 \n       revision of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76)\n\n       On page 127, after line 23, insert the following:\n       Sec. 537. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement the revision to Office of Management and \n     Budget Circular A-76 made on May 29, 2003.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment concerns procedures for \ncontracting out. I ask that the cosponsors be Senators Landrieu, Reid, \nSarbanes, Lautenberg, Lieberman, Kennedy, Leahy, Akaka, and Byrd.\n  I rise to offer an amendment that does several things. First, it \nprotects the egregious abuses and unfair practices that are now into a \nnew procedure for contracting out the work of Federal employees. That \ncontracting out procedure is called an A-76, which is the circular that \ndescribes this methodology.\n  You need to know. I understand reform is necessary, but abuse is not \nnecessary. I must say I am very concerned that the White House is \npursuing a political agenda masquerading as management reform. In the \nadministration's plan for privatization, the costs are too great. It \ncosts money. It costs morale. It costs the integrity of the Civil \nService system.\n  When I say it costs money, do you know that when we were foraging \nfunds for veterans health care, the administration wanted to spend $75 \nmillion to figure out how to contract out the work being done at the \nVA? What jobs am I talking about? Radiologists, social workers, core \nessential medical personnel. The administration wants to spend $75 \nmillion, while we have veterans waiting in line to figure out how we \ncan contract out the health care we promised them. It costs too much.\n  Then it costs morale. The minute you hear you might be contracted \nout, you have to write a job description. Then you have to wait around \nto see if you are contracted out. Then, even if you win it, you might \nbe contracted out because you will again have to compete in 5 years. \nMorale in key agencies such as the National Institutes of Health is \ncompletely in disarray.\n  It also costs the integrity of the Civil Service system. Every \ndemocracy in the world has a civil service system that is absolutely \nindependent and has absolute integrity to carry out the core functions \nof government, regardless of what political party is in charge. That is \nwhy democracies have civil service, to administer the core functions of \ngovernment. That is why we always wanted to be sure that it wasn't \npatronage that determined who became an FBI agent, that it was not \ncrony politics that decided who got a Social Security check. We would \nhave an independent civil service that would administer these things.\n  That is not where we are going. We are heading to cronyism and \npolitical patronage. At the very time we are fighting a war against \nterrorism, I don't understand why the White House is spending its time \nfiguring out how we can undermine our Civil Service.\n  Make no mistake, I am not opposed to privatization. In some \ninstances, privatization works very well. In my own State of Maryland, \nin an agency called the Aeronautics and Space Agency, of which I am a \nranking member for funding, we have privatization.\n  Let's look at Goddard Space Agency in my own home State. We have \n3,000 Civil Service jobs and 9,000 private contractor jobs. Both are \ndoing an outstanding job, and I am proud of them.\n  What I am opposed to is that this new A-76 is inherently unfair to \nFederal employees. The deck is stacked against them to pursue an \nideology driven agenda, not a management reform agenda.\n  My amendment is simple. It throws out these new crony rules, these \nnew unfair rules which stack the deck against Federal employees, and \nasks that the administration go back to the drawing board to come up \nwith new guidelines for competition that are truly fair. Why is this \nimportant? OMB is pushing contracting out, even when it doesn't make \nsense, or even when it puts our Nation's security at risk, or the \nintegrity of medical research on the line, or even when it costs more \nto conduct competitions than it saves in the long run.\n\n  Did you hear what I said? Even when it doesn't make sense, even when \nit puts national security at risk, and in some instances now they have \nsome cockamamie scheme that could even put the integrity of medical \nresearch on the line. Hello. Where are we going? I think we need to go \nback to the drawing boards.\n  Let me say why this is unfair. Let me go through some very specific \nreasons. No. 1, it does not allow Federal employees to submit their own \nbest bids. The new rules create something called streamlined \ncompetitions. That is just a code word for employees not having a \nchance to come up with their own cost-saving ideas. I don't know how \nyou can call it competition if you don't even allow the employees to \nform a team and to come up with ideas on how to save money, as well as \nhow to save jobs.\n  No. 2, guess what, in all of this contracting out it does not even \nrequire contractors to show they are saving money. The old A-76 \nrequired contractors to show they would save the Government significant \nmoney, at least $10 million or 10 percent, whichever is less. This new \nA-76 has gotten rid of this requirement. Guess what. The competitions \nthemselves cost money. To do an evaluation on what should be contracted \nout by and large costs $8,000 an employee. So now Federal workers who \nmight be losing their jobs to contractors do not even do it to save the \ntaxpayer any money, let alone the integrity of the Civil Service.\n  It is also destabilizing. This is really a morale buster. Boy, you \ntalk about a morale buster; it is just to say: You know, every couple \nof years we are going to put you up for grabs. This new A-76 forces \nFederal workers to recompete every 5 years for their jobs, but it does \nnot require contractors to recompete every 5 years for the contract \nthat is won.\n  How will the Government attract and keep bright young workers if \ntheir jobs are at risk every 5 years? And if the Federal employees \nshould be up for bid every 5 years, why shouldn't the private sector \nbid every 5 years? If you want to destroy agencies such as NIH and VA, \njust do it this way.\n  Also, it provides an unfair advantage to contractors that provide \nlesser benefits. If a contractor saves money by shrinking wages and \neliminating health care, that is not improving Government efficiency. \nBut that gives them an unfair advantage when they bid. Their bids do \nnot show efficiency; they win contracts because they either eliminate \nor shrink health care.\n  That is not the way we should go. It is bad 46 million Americans do \nnot have health care, let alone now forcing Federal employees not to \nhave it.\n  To be sure everybody understands this, I would like to give three \nexamples. Let's take the National Institutes of Health. This is one of \nthe most beloved agencies in our country. If anything would ever happen \nto the National Institutes of Health, it would be devastating to the \nAmerican public. This is one of the agencies everyone loves. Why do we \nlove NIH? Because out there every day there are people working to find \ncures to save lives. So guess what. OMB took a look at NIH. Guess what \nthey wanted to contract out. OMB wants to contract out lots of things, \nbut one of the things they want to end is the NIH fire department. Why \ndo they have their own fire department? Because of all the research \ngoing on, we need not only brave first responders but those who are \nbest at handling chemical, biological, and radiological events.\n  In fact, the entire Capital region relies on them for emergencies and \nalso training others. We need our own fire department at NIH because \nthey know every building, they know every rack where the research is \ngoing on, and they know every mouse and what they have taken in tests \nto keep us alive.\n  How do you bid on a fire department? I don't know how you contract \nout a fire department.\n  I am telling you this is terrible.\n  They not only go to the firefighters, but they go to scientists, \nscientific support, and other jobs at NIH which are slated for \ncompetition.\n  There is a group called Senior Scientists Category 2. These are \npostdoctoral research fellows. OMB wants to contract out the \ndecisionmaking process in selecting these scientists. They want to \ncontract it out. They want to provide a bid for outside contractors to \nselect these key scientists. I cannot believe it.\n\n[[Page S13093]]\n\n  I listened to Dr. Zerhouni testify. By the way, Dr. Zerhouni is a \nvery eminent physician, an entrepreneur, formerly of Johns Hopkins, now \nthe head of NIH, and an outstanding Bush appointee. He told me they had \nto spend $15 million at NIH to study how they could contract this out. \nThat is $15 million that could have gone to find a cure for Alzheimer's \nand diabetes. Dr. Zerhouni and others said it took over 100,000 hours \nof staff time. Dr. Zerhouni protested. He went right to OMB and said \ndon't contract out my fire department. It is a waste of time and a \nwaste of money. Please let us select these postdoctoral fellows. He was \noverridden by OMB. We are grateful for this man who heads up NIH, and \nwho because of his own research could be a candidate for the Nobel \nprize. But they overrode him under the guise of a political agenda \nmasquerading as management reform that has absolutely left the morale \nat NIH in shambles.\n  Let us take VA. I couldn't believe it. Just when Senator Bond and I \nare trying to come up with more money for our veterans, we got a \nrequest from VA saying they want to spend $75 million to study \ncontracting out. Whoa--$75 million? I am the appropriator along with \nSenator Bond. Seventy-five million could have put up 75 new outpatient \nclinics. It could have provided prescription drugs for 77,000 veterans. \nJust when our men and women are coming back from Iraq, we want to \ncontract out VA health care and things such as radiology, pathology, \nand pharmaceutical care.\n  I am telling you: Boy, don't they feel good. We should be lucky to \nhave these doctors and nurses and professionals. Guess what. They have \ntried this. The jobs they want to contract out are actually even held \nby veterans themselves. You are telling me we should take money from \nveterans health care to pay for studying how to contract out veterans' \njobs to provide health to other veterans. By my calculation, one study \nthey did didn't work out.\n  Let me tell you about the most heartbreaking example.\n  At the Medical Center in Bethesda--we all know about Naval-Bethesda. \nIt is an outstanding facility. People here at the Senate have used it. \nOur own President goes there for his annual checkup, as has every \nPresident preceding him. It is great. At Naval-Bethesda down in the \nkitchen there are 21 custodial food service employees. They work in \nwhat they call the hospital scullery. They are a very unusual group of \npeople. They are mentally challenged. There are 21 people who work \nthere. They have worked there as a special unit. This Federal \nGovernment reached out using it as a model for hiring people with \nmental disabilities who could be self-sufficient and self-employed.\n  Boy, have they done a good job. They clean up the kitchen. They prep \nthe food. Everybody at Naval-Bethesda loves them. Devorah Shapiro has \nworked there for 10 years. She is in a group home. James Eastridge is \nfrom Hagerstown. He started working there 22 years ago, and he hasn't \nmissed a day of work. He gets all kinds of awards.\n\n  Guess what. At Naval-Bethesda working in the kitchen are people who \nare trying desperately to be self-sufficient. And we are going to \ncontract out 21 jobs in the kitchen for people who wash the dishes and \nprep the food? I am telling you, shame on you, OMB. Shame on you, OMB, \nfor what you are doing here. I think this is outrageous.\n  That is why I have the Mikulski amendment. It is for those people. It \nis for those veterans who have gotten their education from the GI bill \nand who are serving there--our scientists, our seafood inspectors, the \npeople who are doing the mapping at the FAA for our flight plans for \nour military and commercial planes.\n  I could go on and on and on. Those are the kinds of people I am \ntalking about. They aren't bureaucrats sitting there looking at their \nfingernails. They are not people just sitting around. They are people \nwho work every day. They are people at NIH who win Nobel prizes. They \nare people out there in the Coast Guard who are protecting us from drug \ndealers and from terrorists. They are people like those who lost their \nlives in the Oklahoma bombing.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. I have told you my opinion \non contracting out. But to the naysayers and those people who are \nfussbudgets, let me reassure you this amendment doesn't prohibit \ncontracting out. It does not. It simply changes the rules to make them \nmore fair. All it does is throw out the unfair May 29 version to give \nthe administration a chance to rethink its one-sided, overly aggressive \npolicy.\n  Speaking of that, I know OMB has tasked every Federal agency to get \nrid of 400,000 jobs. You know my feeling about that. It is just \noutrageous. Instead, we should pass the Mikulski amendment and go back \nto the drawing boards. There are simple reasons why. This new process \ndoesn't require appreciable cost savings. It allows contractors to make \nappeals but not Federal employees. It fails to track the cost and \nquality of contractors. It encourages it. It doesn't offer alternatives \nto progress. It is bad for diversity. The jobs being contracted out \ntend to be primarily service jobs and clerical jobs which are often \nwomen. It is also in the blue-collar jobs that have a very strong \ndiversity group. It doesn't allow Federal workers to bid on contractor \nwork. It doesn't give them an appeal process. I could go on and on.\n  It is a new A-76. It is a dangerous trend to replace our Civil \nService employees with cronyism and political patronage contracts. I \nbelieve this A-76 system is inherently unfair. We should send it back \nto OMB. Let us work in a very constructive way to get the best value \nfor the taxpayer and make sure we have the best people operating our \nmissions--driven not by money but by agencies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take a little time to \ndiscuss this issue. Let me say at the beginning it is my intention to \noffer a second-degree amendment.\n  We have been through this before. Actually it is the same thing. We \nare going back through it again. It is sort of interesting. You would \nthink most people here as well as in the country would like to have an \nefficient government workforce. We would like to in instances which are \npotentially possible have the private sector involved in things. At the \nsame time, we recognize there is a strong Federal employee group, and \nthey will continue to be there. No one thinks that is all going to \nchange. That is not the intention.\n  The idea that all of this is going to change--the example used of \npeople in the food service at the Naval Hospital. As a matter of fact, \nI was just there this morning. That isn't going to happen. They are \nthere for other reasons, and those reasons will be considered.\n  I think it is really too bad to take an issue like that--and there is \na good basis for them being there--and attempt to use stories like that \nto make it sound unreasonable.\n  The idea of competition, of course, has been around for a good long \ntime. A-76 is not a brand new idea. It was passed during the Clinton \nadministration. In this Congress we passed it, and continues to endorse \nthe idea, certainly of competitive sourcing, streamlining Federal \nagencies. What is wrong with that?\n\n  We hear all the time, we could do a better job with the energy, the \nports we have, of course. Make Government more accountable to the \ntaxpayers. That is a good idea, it seems to me. We use the Government's \ndirect competition with the private sector, thereby ensuring \ncompetition. As a matter of fact, there is competition in these \npotential job changes. In most cases, there has been efficiency in the \nGovernment workforce, and the Government workforce continues to be \nthere in a more efficient way. I have trouble finding a problem with \nthat, unless it is totally political, which I suspect it perhaps is.\n  The competitive source initiative is designed to improve Government \nperformance and efficiency. That is what it is all about. When the \nGovernment competes with the private sector, we erode the local tax \nbase; we drive up prices; we decrease performance by Federal agencies. \nBy doing what we are talking about doing, we have cost savings. Whether \nor not the Federal workers stay in place or whether we do it through \ncontract, we save money. That has been the history. Competition does \nthat. Competition causes whoever is there, whether they be Federal or \nprivate, to find more efficient ways to do\n\n[[Page S13094]]\n\nthe job they are seeking to do. What is new about that? For all who \nhave been in the private sector, that is the way we do things. There is \nnothing wrong with that.\n  We are seeking to use the Center for Naval Analysis. Two independent \ngroups, along with the General Accounting Office, have found through \nextensive research that competition sourcing reduces costs by about 30 \npercent regardless of who wins. The cost savings success stories \ninclude the printing of the fiscal year 2004 budget of the U.S. \nGovernment, the location in Washington, DC. Competition was completed \nin 2002, printing of four of the five volumes of the President's budget \nrequested by Congress. Precompetition costs were $505,370; competition \nresults, $387,000. It was retained in house. This reduction in costs by \nhaving outsourcing competition to do the same job ended up being done \nby Federal employees with a 23 percent savings. Those are the things we \nare talking about.\n  It seems to me, and a lot of people believe, we have two issues. One \nis a practical, efficiency, cost saving issue. It is pretty well \nproven. The other is the philosophy of competition and of the use of \nthe private sector where appropriate.\n  I was chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. The thought that \nwe would replace rangers in the park has never been the idea. We are \ntalking about the service jobs, the maintenance jobs. We are talking \nabout those jobs, not park rangers. No one is talking about that.\n  It is interesting to note, as the competition has taken place, there \nhave been great savings: 2,500 positions have been reviewed under the \ncompetitive sourcing since 2001, and not 1 full-time Federal employee \nhas been involuntarily replaced.\n  These are the issues we are dealing with. We have been through this \nbefore. We went completely through this bill, and now we are back \nseeking to do it again.\n  The Mikulski-Landrieu amendment would prevent agencies from taking \nadvantage of recent revisions of OMB Circular A-76 to improve program \nperformance and lower cost through the application of public-private \ncompetition. This amendment denies taxpayers the process the General \nAccounting Office believes would result in better transparency, \nincreased savings, improved performance, and greater accountability. \nThat is not bad stuff.\n\n  Undue processes that have been shaped around the consensus of a \nsupermajority of the public and private sector representatives: A \ncommercial panel was convened by GAO to study the comprehensive \nsourcing. Why are some of the revisions to OMB Circular A-76 important? \nThe rule makes important changes to level the playing field for public \nand private sector sources to offer the best services by eliminating \nthe longstanding policy of prior revisions of the circular that \ndiscourage the Government from competing with the private sector even \nthough the Government might be able to provide a better value. It \ndiscourages Government transportation as well. That is part of the \nproblem we had.\n  The faulty premise of the Mikulski amendment is based on a series of \nmisplaced concerns that inaccurately suggest that a new private-public \ncompetition process provided by Circular A-76 is unfair. In fact, the \nrevised circular promotes reasoned decisionmaking and increases \nopportunity for fair consideration of both in-house and private sector \nproviders.\n  The revised circular does not allow Federal employees to submit their \nbest bid: It significantly expands Federal employees' opportunities and \ntheir capacity to serve the taxpayer by expressly requiring agencies to \nensure their in-house providers have access to available resources, \nskilled manpower, funding, thereby ending the longstanding practice of \ndirect conversions where agencies convert work from in house to private \nsector without considering the in-house capabilities, encouraging the \nin-house provider to offer more and more efficiently in house in order \nto compete with the bids. This is what it is all about.\n  The revised circular, it is alleged on the other side of the aisle, \ndoes not require appreciable cost savings. It seeks to ensure cost-\neffective performance from both the private and public sectors and has \nsucceeded in doing that.\n  I cannot help but remember when we got this passed in the \nsubcommittee in the Clinton administration, nothing happened. Now we \nare finally getting something in place to have competitive outsourcing \nand making it work and we have constant complaint about the opportunity \nto compete. It simply makes Government much more effective and much \nmore efficient.\n  As I pointed out, there has not been a loss of Federal employees \ndespite the talk we hear from the other side of the aisle. That is an \ninteresting fact. We will be talking about this for some time, I am \nsure. As I mentioned, we will probably have a second-degree amendment \nto be offered later.\n  I hope we can continue to provide the opportunity for this Government \nto be more efficient, for this Government to be able to compete with \nthe outside private sector--that is where most people are, in the \nprivate sector--to have an opportunity to participate in those jobs \nthat are appropriate and noninherently governmental. That is the \ndirection we are taking.\n  I hope we can continue to get some facts out and not get carried away \nby the kind of emotion of people being let out of their jobs without \nany opportunity because that is absolutely not the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am a cosponsor of the Mikulski-Landrieu amendment, \nand I say to my colleague from Wyoming, before he leaves, the more I \nlistened to him, the more committed I became to this amendment. In \nfact, with each passing minute as he spoke, I was increasingly \nstrengthened in my view that it is the right and honorable thing to \nsupport this amendment and to urge my colleagues to support it. I will \noutline why that is the case.\n  Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid of Nevada \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Wyoming spoke as though the amendment \nis going to repeal public-private competition sourcing.\n  My colleague talked about what was done in 2001 and the competitions \nthat have taken place since that date. So, as one listened to him, one \nwas thinking: Well, is this whole competitive arrangement going to be \nstopped in its tracks? Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  What this amendment seeks to do is to stop an OMB revision, of last \nMay 29, with respect to the terms on which these competitions are going \nto take place. That is all it does. When I was first listening to the \nSenator from Wyoming, I thought to myself: Well, surely we would meet \nwhat seems to be his concern if we just went back to the system that \nprevailed before the OMB revision. But then, at the end, he became \nclear and said, no, he wants those revisions as well. That is what I am \nvery much opposed to.\n  This amendment seeks to ensure the Government work is allocated in a \nfair and equitable manner. I believe it would provide the American \ntaxpayers with the best value for Government services and for their tax \ndollars.\n  Often--in fact, federal employees win most of these competitions. \nThere seems to be a premise on the part of the Senator from Wyoming \nthat savings is most often achieved when work goes to the private \nsector. That is not the case.\n  What has happened is the OMB is driving an ideological agenda. It has \nrewritten the rules governing competitive sourcing, which, I think, in \neffect, jeopardizes fair competition, jeopardizes getting the best \nvalue for Government services, and jeopardizes the taxpayers' dollars.\n  Earlier this year, the Office of Management and Budget, on May 29, \nissued a new circular, a new ruling that rewrote the rules by which \nthis competition takes place. The concept of public-private \ncompetitions or competitive sourcing is not new, but the manner in \nwhich it is to be conducted is drastically altered by the rules of May \n29 put forward by OMB.\n  The new process established by OMB unfairly favors private sector \ncontractors over Federal employees, opens highly specialized Government \njobs to the lowest bidder, imposes arbitrary quotas and deadlines on \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S13095]]\n\nagencies, and, I think, lead, in fact, leads to a waste of Government \nmoney rather than saving Government money.\n  We all seek to make the Federal Government more cost effective and \nefficient. However, to achieve these goals, there are certain tests \nwhich should be met.\n  First, we need to demonstrate with certainty that cost savings are \nachieved through the outsourcing of work to the private sector. No \neffective method has been put in place for oversight of the private \ncontractors doing work for the Federal Government. This is most \napparent at the Department of Defense where competitive sourcing has \nbeen most prevalent. It is my understanding that DOD cannot fully \naccount for how many contract workers they currently employ or the cost \nto the American taxpayers for the work they do.\n  Second, we must ensure that Federal employees are given the \nopportunity to compete on fair terms. Often, in these public-private \ncompetitions Government employees can be placed at a distinct \ndisadvantage by making proprietary information about the Government bid \navailable to their commercial competitors at a time when that \ninformation can be used to unfairly enhance the commercial offering. \nGovernment employees are not offered the same opportunity to enhance \ntheir bids.\n  There is a great temptation that with this access to proprietary \ninformation for the commercial bidder to lowball their bid to win the \ncontract, and then increase prices once the competition is eliminated.\n  Unfortunately, because there is so little Government oversight of \ncontractors, it is difficult to assess the costs of contractor work. \nWhen contract costs escalate, it is difficult to fix the problem.\n  Thirdly, I am concerned that many highly specialized Government jobs \nwill be let out to the private sector without proper consideration of \nqualitative factors. I believe many of these positions are inherently \ngovernmental and should not be awarded to the lowest bidder.\n  The Senator from Wyoming, in effect, dismissed concrete examples \noffered by my colleague with respect to the problems. But how do we \nunderstand this issue if we do not focus on concrete examples?\n  At NIH, competitive sourcing, it has been asserted to us, threatens \nnot only the critical scientific work conducted there but also the \nsecurity of the installation itself.\n\n  NIH scientists have testified before a joint House-Senate hearing \nthat they believe competitive sourcing has created a wave of \nunnecessary anxiety and bureaucratic duplication, and that the \nimplementation of the initiative at NIH was not well thought out.\n  Additionally, the administration rejected a request by NIH officials \nto exempt the fire department from competitive sourcing. Because the \nnature of the work done at NIH often involves hazardous materials, the \nFederal firefighters assigned to NIH have specialized training in the \nhandling of chemical, biological, and radiological events.\n  This kind of expertise cannot be matched in the private sector, and \nlosing this asset would certainly be to the detriment of NIH's mission. \nYet the administration refused to classify the firefighters as core \npublic employees who would not be privatized.\n  I want to add another dimension to this consideration as one of the \nlargest employers in the country, the Federal Government should serve \nas a model for other businesses.\n  In recent years, we have made great strides in extending employment \nto disadvantaged groups. I believe the Government must lead by example \nin this area. At Bethesda National Naval Medical Hospital, competitive \nsourcing threatens the jobs of mentally challenged workers who perform \nimportant services in the hospital's scullery.\n  My very able colleague from Maryland outlined this situation. To \ncounter what I thought was a very powerful statement of this point, the \nSenator from Wyoming sort of dismissed it as, quote, an emotional \nargument.\n  Is it an emotional argument to register the fact that the National \nNaval Medical Hospital is seeking to provide some dignity and self-\nrespect for mentally challenged workers to do these basic, virtually \ncustodial, services in the hospital's scullery?\n  This employment enables these individuals to lead independent lives. \nThere is no accounting for that in this OMB circular. These are real \nexamples. These are real people. This problem ought not to be \ndismissed. It is one of the consequences of the revision of this OMB \ncircular.\n  The House has passed its version of the Mikulski amendment by a vote \nof 220 to 198. Obviously, when it was considered by our colleagues on \nthe other side, they saw merit in it.\n  Furthermore, this proposal from OMB artificially inflates the cost of \nthe Federal employees' bid by arbitrarily assuming a 12-percent \noverhead as part of the bid. The Inspector General of the Department of \nDefense has said the 12-percent overcharge arbitrarily placed on all \nin-house bids is insupportable and that either a new overhead rate must \nbe established or an alternative methodology must be devised to allow \noverhead to be calculated on a competition-specific basis.\n  If we are to have this competition--and we have had it, as the \nSenator from Wyoming pointed out when he went back in earlier \nreferences, for some period of time--it needs to be on a fair basis. \nYou need to make sure the playing field has not been tilted. The \nregulations of May 29 tilted the playing field unfairly, not only to \nthe disadvantage of the Federal worker but to the disadvantage of the \nFederal taxpayer.\n  It needs to be understood that if the rules of competition are not \nfair, the awarding of the work to the private contractor may cost the \ntaxpayer more money with a less quality product. That is what is at \nissue here. This amendment doesn't stop the competitive sourcing \nprocess. It only stops the revised regulations, the radical revised \nregulations that were put into place on May 29 and which have tilted \nthe playing field, have moved away from a fair process, and resulted in \na bad deal for the American taxpayers. We need to have an even playing \nfield. We need to make sure the rules of competition are fair. This \namendment is designed to accomplish that, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic leader has conferred with the \nmajority leader. They believe this legislation should be finished \ntoday, whether it is at 5 o'clock or 8 or 12. That is the goal we have, \nfinishing this bill today.\n  I say to all Members who have amendments to offer, they should notify \nthe two managers of amendments they wish to offer.\n  On this amendment, I have been advised that there is going to be a \nsecond-degree amendment or we will work out some way to have two side-\nby-side votes at the appropriate time. If we could arrive at a point \nwhere we might be able to have a time agreement on the matter now \nbefore us, could the Chair advise how much time the two Senators from \nMaryland have taken on their speeches?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We don't know. We would have to go back and \ncheck the Congressional Record.\n  Mr. REID. Well, we wouldn't want to go to all that trouble. We have a \ngeneral idea how much time was taken. We want to make sure everyone has \nample opportunity to speak on this amendment. If we can solicit from \nboth sides who is interested in this amendment, maybe we can arrive at \na time agreement so, if for no other reason, Members could have some \nidea when the next vote will occur. I can ask the two managers to see \nif they can work something out on a time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose the Mikulski \namendment to the Transportation, Treasury, general government \nappropriations bill. I have the highest regard for both Senators from \nMaryland but have a real difference of opinion in regard to the \nrelevancy and the need for this amendment that would throw out the new \nOMB A-76 circular that was issued in May of this year. The A-76 rules \nwere designed to fix a process which government managers, private \nsector contractors, and Federal employees unions agreed was broken. \nCongress recognized the problem as well. Therefore, Congress \nestablished the\n\n[[Page S13096]]\n\ncommercial activities panel as part of the 2001 national defense \nauthorization bill. In other words, Congress recognized that there was \na problem with the A-76 back in 2001.\n  The panel was convened specifically to consider A-76 revisions and \nother issues related to competition. It was led by Comptroller General \nDavid Walker, head of the General Accounting Office. The other members \nof that panel should be of interest to the Members of the Senate: David \nWalker was chairman; Pete Aldridge, Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisitions; Frank A. Camm, senior analyst from Rand; Mark C. Filteau, \nPresident, Johnson Controls; Steven Goldsmith, Senior Vice President, \nAffiliated Computer Services; Bobby Harnage, Sr., National President, \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; Kay Cole James, \nDirector of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; Colleen M. Kelley, \nNational President, National Treasury Employees Union--this is the \npanel that considered changing A-76 and came back with a \nrecommendation--David Pryor, Director, Institute of Politics, Harvard \nUniversity; Stan Soloway, President, Professional Services Council; \nAngela B. Styles, Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy in the administration; and another very distinguished labor \nleader in this country, Robert M. Tobias, distinguished adjunct \nprofessor at American University who is the former President of the \nNational Treasury Employees Union.\n  This was a very distinguished group that looked at the A-76 process \nand said it is broken and it needs to be fixed. What this amendment \nwould do is take us back to that broken A-76 which was recognized for \nsome time and deny us the opportunity to use this new A-76 that was \nagreed upon by this distinguished panel.\n  I could go on at length as to how the new rules are an overall \nimprovement on the old. But this is not really what this amendment is \nabout.\n  The real purpose of the amendment we are hearing from the other side \nof the aisle is to stop the Bush administration's competitive sourcing \ninitiative by disrupting the administrative processes associated with \nit. While Senator Mikulski's amendment would not stop competitive \nsourcing, as I say, it would force the executive branch to continue to \nuse a process that everybody agreed was broken and in need of repair.\n  When the administration first came out with their six management \ninitiatives, one of the things I became very upset about, as someone \nwho has a great appreciation for people who work in government, was \nthat they had set some artificial percentages that Departments would \nhave to follow in terms of outsourcing. So it would be 5 percent this \nyear and then 10 percent.\n  We had a hearing on this, and we made it clear that we thought it was \nbad public policy, that what directors should be doing, and people who \nwork for them, was to look at their manpower to see if those people who \nare in place can do the job better; and in many cases they could, but \nthey were not given money for the training they needed to upgrade their \nskills. I say to colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we got the \nadministration to back away from that. They publicly have backed away \nfrom it. Clay Johnson, the new management person at OMB, has said we \nare backing away from it. He gets it; he understands that that policy \nwasn't in the best interest of the people who work for the Government \nor in the best interest of the taxpayers of this country.\n  I urge colleagues to defeat this amendment. I want you to know that \nSenator Thomas and I will offer an amendment later this afternoon to \naddress what we have identified as some remaining issues of concern \nwith the A-76 rules and the Bush administration's competitive sourcing \nagenda. I believe these amendments will indeed level the playing field. \nI believe they will give the fairness that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would like to see in terms of the issue of \ncompetitive sourcing.\n  The amendment will apply to all competitive sourcing activities all \nacross the Government. It will do the following:\n  It will require all agencies to provide Congress with detailed \ninformation on how it is implementing public-private competition. This \nincludes a description of how the agency's competitive sourcing \ndecisionmaking process is aligned with the Department's strategic \nworkforce plan. That is the beginning--the strategic workforce plan: \nHow are we going to get the job done and shape our workforce to achieve \nthe goals we set for our Departments?\n  It also requires the agency to report the projected number of full-\ntime equivalent employees covered by the competition scheduled to be \nannounced during the next fiscal year. So right off the bat, we are \ngoing to require these people to identify what they are looking at in \nterms of outsourcing or putting up for competitive bid.\n  I believe having rigorous reporting requirements is the right \napproach. This would have to do it prospectively and retroactively. How \nmuch money are we saving? How much more efficient are we? Then they \nwould have to come back and report after they did it to see how it was \nworking.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. After I am finished with my presentation.\n  It has been the prerogative of every administration since the 1950s \nto decide when to conduct public-private competitions and the manner in \nwhich these competitions would be conducted. That is the prerogative of \nthe executive administrative branch of Government. Congress, in its \noversight role, has the right and responsibility to know what the \nexecutive branch is doing.\n\n  This amendment will require the Bush administration to provide \nexactly that information. This will create a uniform reporting \nrequirement on competitive sourcing activities at all executive branch \nagencies of Government across the board--not just Treasury. This \naffects the entire operation across the board of the Federal \nGovernment. That information will guide congressional oversight and \nallow us to judge if further congressional action is necessary.\n  The amendment also gives appeal rights to a Federal organization when \nit loses a bid. Currently, when private contractors lose a competition \nwith a Government entity, or another private sector contractor, they \nhave a right to appeal the decision to the General Accounting Office. \nThe Federal organization currently does not have that right. This \nprovision levels the playing field and makes the competition process \nfair to Federal employees. We put them in the same position as we do \nthe private contractors. We want them to be able to appeal it. This \ntime, it says if our employees lose, they can appeal that, just as the \nprivate contractor can appeal.\n  Third, this amendment modifies the provision of the new Circular A-\n76, which requires that activities identified for competitive sourcing \nmust be recompeted every 5 years if the Federal organization wins the \ncompetition. I am concerned about the effects this requirement may have \non employee morale. This amendment removes the provision. In doing so, \nit sends a signal that as long as the MEO continues to perform well, it \ndoesn't need to be subject to future competition. In other words, if \nthe Federal workers win the competition, why should they, at the end of \n5 years, have to have it recompeted? If you want to recompete it, the \nDepartment decides that; it means they are not getting the job done. \nBut to have an automatic 5 years that says, hey, boys and girls, you \nare getting the job done, but after 5 years we are going to recompete \nit, that is not fair.\n  Fourth, this amendment requires the executive branch Departments and \nAgencies to spend such sums as are necessary to ensure that they have \nstrong contract oversight capabilities. One of the problems we have in \na lot of Federal agencies is we don't have the people who can properly \noversee this competitive sourcing, nor do we have the people inside. \nThere is a contract management office in the executive branch, and they \ndon't have the necessary resources to properly do their job.\n  It is not enough to farm something out to a private company and then \nnot find out whether or not they are doing the job. We should have \nthat. When I was the tax assessor of Cuyahoga County, we had internal \npeople who watched the appraisal company that we had do the annual job. \nWhen I became the\n\n[[Page S13097]]\n\nauditor, we had nobody inside. So we would hire a company, and nobody \nwould know whether they were doing a good or a bad job or who helped us \ndraft a contract to make sure we got what we wanted. So we brought them \nin house. It is the same thing we need in the Federal Government.\n  If you are going to do competitive outsourcing, you had better have \npeople in house who can do it right and, once it is done, make sure you \nare getting what you are supposed to get: We are saving money, and we \nare more efficient. If it is not happening, then you can throw the red \nflag.\n\n  This amendment demonstrates congressional awareness of this problem \nand directs the executive branch agencies to do what is necessary to \ncorrect any deficiencies. This is a lot of work. I have talked to Clay \nJohnson at OMB. He gets it. He knows we must do a better job in these \nagencies.\n  Fifth, the amendment prohibits private sector contractors who win \ncompetitions from relocating jobs overseas. Our reasoning is very \nsimple. Jobs that were previously performed by U.S. citizens should not \ngo to foreigners. We know today that more and more of that is happening \nwith these private companies. Say it would be some company that \ncompetes for data processing and they get the job and then they would \nhave people in Bangalore, India, do the work for them. This would \nrequire that if somebody won the competition in the private sector, \nthose jobs had to be in the United States and not farmed out to India \nor some other country.\n  Overall, this amendment represents a very balanced approach to \nfurther addressing some lingering concerns Congress may have with the \nBush administration's competitive sourcing initiative. I have spent a \nlot of time on this issue. I have been working on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia. We were the ones who put together, with Senator Akaka, \namendments to the Homeland Security Act that created more flexibility, \nand it was something we worked on, on a bipartisan basis.\n  I have several other pieces of legislation that just got voted out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee on a bipartisan basis this week. I \ncare about our Federal workers. I do. I believed that our Federal \nworkers, when I was mayor, Governor, and now as a Senator, if given the \nright tools and are empowered and get the training they need, can beat \nanybody. We have to make sure they have an even playing field. But at \nthe same time we do that, I don't think we should go back to an A-76 \nprocedure that we, many years ago, said was broken.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to not support the amendment \nproposed by my good friends--people I respect--from Maryland, and that \nthey support the amendment I have put together with Senator Thomas.\n  I will say that we are trying to still, between now and then, work \nwith people on the other side of the aisle, and they have other ideas \non how we can do this better. This is a serious issue.\n  I will now yield for a question to my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will seek the floor on my own accord, \nif the Senator is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened very carefully to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Ohio. I don't gainsay his concern about the Federal workers. I \naccept his assertion in that regard, and it has been my own experience \nin dealing with him in the past. I was concerned about one thing when \nhe listed the members of this Commission.\n  He talked about this very diverse Commission, but it is my \nunderstanding that Commission, when it made its recommendations, had \nunanimity with respect to some and differences of opinion with respect \nto others. In any event, the OMB circular issued on May 29, the matter \nthat is at issue here with the Mikulski-Landrieu amendment, does not \ntrack the recommendations of the Commission. In other words, it departs \nfrom it in significant respects, and much of the problem we are talking \nabout is a consequence of that departure.\n  What we have before us is not something that has been worked out and \na consensus has developed, although we had a broad group that went into \nthe deliberations and it doesn't reflect a consensus in the Congress. \nWitness, the vote in the House of Representatives where a majority of \nthe House of Representatives supported the House version of the \nMikulski amendment. So there is no consensus on that score.\n  All this amendment would do would be to say: No, we are not going to \nlet the OMB hand down these revisions, this new circular, to rewrite \nthe rules in this way. We will put that on hold, and we will go back \nand look again at this issue to see if we can't come up with a solution \nwhich commands a consensus.\n  I feel very strongly that is the way we should seek to deal with this \nmatter. This isn't repealing competitive sourcing. All it is saying is \nthat this OMB circular, which was put into place a few months ago and \nwhich many very strongly feel does not give you a level playing field \nor fair competition, that is going to be put on hold and provide us an \nopportunity then to revisit this issue in a more careful, balanced, and \njudicious way, and out of that process hopefully come up with a \nconsensus.\n  I think that is a reasonable way to proceed in the circumstance. It \ndoesn't nullify or vitiate the competitive sourcing approach. It only \nseeks to assure that it will be done in a fair, balanced, level playing \nfield way. I think that is an important objective to achieve, and it is \nnot reflected in the May 29 OMB circular.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I certainly yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the 2001 National Defense Authorization \nAct required that panel be put together to look at a new A-76 rule, and \nthe commercial activities panel worked on this issue for a significant \namount of time and reflected a cross section of labor and management, \nthe final regulation that was put out by the administration was looked \nat by several of the people who were on that panel with whom I \npersonally spent some time.\n  In spite of whatever criticisms you may have with that A-76 process, \nit was the consensus that the new A-76 regulation is far better than \nthe one we have on the books, which is not getting the job done or we \nwouldn't have asked that a commercial panel come up with a new A-76 \nrecommendation in terms of a regulation.\n  My argument would be that the regulation proposed by the \nadministration--by the way, I don't think they even got into the issue \nof the A-76 regulation over in the House. This was just a question of \nwhether we were going to have competitive bidding. Some people were for \nit; some people were not.\n  With all due respect, I have talked with some of the people over on \nthe other side and I don't think a lot understood what this was about. \nI am saying to the Senator, the new regulation, though he and others \nmay have some problems with it, is far better than the one we decided \nwasn't getting the job done. I would argue that some of the concerns \nthat have been raised about competitive bidding are being responded to \nwith the amendment I am going to be offering with Senator Thomas this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is my colleague asserting that the members of the panel \nsupported or support the OMB circular of May 29?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am saying there was some difference \nof opinion, and it didn't do everything they wanted, but the consensus \nwas that the new A-76 regulation that was proposed by the \nadministration was better than the old A-76 procedure that we have.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that a number of members of that \npanel disagree with the OMB circular of May 29, and if that is the \ncase, I don't see how the Senator can be using this panel as supportive \nof the OMB circular.\n  The Senator mentioned this panel that was studying it and he went \nthrough the membership of the panel.\n\n[[Page S13098]]\n\nHe emphasized how diverse it was in terms of where it drew people from. \nBut it is my understanding that the OMB circular does not reflect the \nposition of a number of members of the panel. Is the Senator asserting \nto the contrary?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I am asserting \nthat talking to individual members of the panel indicated to me that \nthe circular that was put out by the administration was better than \nwhat they had before in terms of the A-76 process.\n  Now, if you are asking me did everyone agree with everything that was \non there, I can't verify that fact, but I will say this: The consensus \nthat we got, particularly from David Walker who was chairman of the \npanel, indicated that he thought that what they came back with was \nbetter than the old A-76 process.\n  Then, by the way, other issues were raised. Frankly speaking, that is \none of the reasons why I am here with an amendment that deals with \ncompetitive sources. There was a concern about the fact that our \nemployees would--if they won the competition--have to come back every 5 \nyears. There was concern that there wasn't a right of appeal if our \nemployees lost the competition. There was concern about the fact that \nthe agencies have the individuals they need on board to put competition \ntogether, and that once they are put together, they have people who can \nmonitor the private sector doing the work to make sure they are getting \nthis cost savings and the efficiencies they expected they were going to \nget from the process.\n  Last but not least, as you know, I am making it very clear that the \namendment makes it very clear that if they do win, it can't be farmed \nout to some foreign workers.\n  These amendments are a reflection of trying to deal with some of the \nconcerns that employee unions and other people have with this A-76.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have the floor, I believe. I am not \ngoing to press my colleague further because I think it is manifest by \nthe comments he just made in terms of deficiencies in the OMB circular, \nthat the members of this panel who studied this matter did not concur \nor support the OMB circular.\n  Obviously, by his own statement just now, a number of concerns and \nproblems were raised with respect to the OMB circular. I, therefore, \nrenew my very strong support for the amendment of my colleague in an \neffort to try to, in effect, hold things in place while we try to \nfigure out what constitutes a fair and reasonable solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Democratic assistant leader.\n  Mr. REID. We are waiting to receive a copy of the amendment that \nwould allow us to have the two votes in relation to the Mikulski \namendment. That is forthcoming, I understand, from legislative counsel. \nThe two managers have been visited, along with the proponent of this \nlegislation. Senator Kennedy wishes to speak on the amendment that is \npending. I see the Senator from Wyoming. If he wishes to speak also on \nthis amendment, my proposal would be that the managers--everyone thinks \nwe should move forward on the Dodd-McConnell amendment, which would \ntake just a short period of time while we are waiting to get \nlegislation from the legislative counsel approved.\n  What I would propose in the form of a unanimous consent request is \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized to speak on the \npending amendment; following that, the pending amendment be set aside \nand Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell be allowed to offer their \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I do not know where Senator McConnell is, but I want to \nclear this with him before we set this amendment aside and move to \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. I understand.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We will try to get in touch with him shortly.\n  Mr. REID. I will renew that request later.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object, are we possibly setting \nmy amendment aside so that the language of the Senator from Wyoming \ncould arrive from legislative counsel? It would enable the debate to \nproceed without waiting for legislative counsel and then return to the \ndebate with the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely right.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Wyoming would be protected and we \nwould be expediting the process?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, and the Senator is also protected.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think that is a reasonable solution. I want to \ncooperate in any way I can to ensure the Senator's right to offer a \nsecond degree and to expedite the debate.\n  I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I still reserve my right to object, and I would object \nuntil we clear this with Senator McConnell that he is ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I will withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request has been \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will take a moment to speak in support of \nthe Mikulski-Landrieu outsourcing amendment. This amendment would \nrequire the administration to revise the guidelines for conducting \noutsourcing studies, which it changed this spring. We have been hearing \na lot about competition and I am all for competition. It makes our \neconomy strong. But I have to wonder if competition is good in some \ncases, why isn't it good for companies like Halliburton, which receive \nhuge contracts without submitting bids?\n  The administration seems to think that competition is good for the \nlittle guy, but not for big corporations that have connections to the \nWhite House. Competition should be fair. There should be an equal \nplaying field. That means, when we are talking about the jobs of people \nwho have given years of service to a public agency, we have to consider \nthe value of their experience.\n  Experience matters. Experience is valuable. And having experienced \nworkers in critical positions is in the public interest. The \nadministration's changes to the rules for outsourcing studies put \nworkers at a disadvantage, and favor contractors. For example, under \nthe former rules, contractors were required to demonstrate a 10 percent \ncost savings before they could win a job competition. This ensured that \nwe wouldn't sacrifice experience for a negligible savings. Under the \nadministration's new rules, contractors are not even required to \ndemonstrate a cost savings in order to receive a contract.\n  The administration claims that privatization is about saving money, \nbut where is the supposed savings in that rule? In fact, it costs a lot \nof money just to conduct these studies--money that could be better \nspent on pressing needs. Recent estimates show that privatization \nstudies at the Department of Interior cost over $5,000 for every \nposition studied. At the National Institutes of Health, privatization \nstudies this year cost $3,500 per position and next year NIH predicts \nthey will cost $6,000 per position. This money is wasted because we are \nfinding that public workers provide better service than private \ncontractors.\n  In case after case, public workers have won competitions for their \njobs. In Nevada, the Bureau of Land Management conducted six studies of \n13 positions--at a cost of over $92,000--only to find that BLM workers \nare the most capable and efficient to do their jobs. That $92,000 could \nhave been better spent on so many things. And that is the heart of the \nproblem with these outsourcing studies.\n  I have heard estimates that the Interior Department could divert as \nmuch as $110 million in unauthorized funds to pay for outsourcing \nstudies. We are finding that the supposed cost savings in privatization \njust aren't there and we are also finding that the experience and \ndedication of public workers has great value, which we simply can't \nafford to throw away.\n  The Mikulski-Landrieu amendment would require the administration to \nat least set fair rules for these competitions. The House of \nRepresentatives agrees with this amendment. It passed\n\n[[Page S13099]]\n\nthis language by a vote of 220 to 198. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate also recognize the need to correct these unfair changes the \nadministration has made to its rules for privatization studies.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Alabama. In the time agreement \nthat they have, I will be glad to yield and cooperate.\n  I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues the result of the \nexisting OMB outsourcing proposals which have really had a very adverse \nimpact on one of the great institutions of our Government, which is the \nNational Institutes of Health. I will relate to that in just a moment.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski, Senator Landrieu, Senator Sarbanes, and \nothers who have raised this issue. I am mindful at this time that one \nout of every four of those who serve in the Federal Government are \nveterans. More than 11,000 of our activated reservists are now on \nactive duty over in Iraq.\n  I am very mindful, having watched the agencies over a period of time, \nthat there is some opportunity to get greater efficiency and better \nproductivity. Excellence is demanded by many of the agencies, as well \nas expertise which so many of our Federal employees bring to these \nagencies. We are a very gifted and fortunate Nation.\n  The case that comes to mind and pops right out is just a recent \nexample of these current regulations and what it is doing at the \nNational Institutes of Health. NIH is the premier, the gold watch, in \nterms of basic research all over the world. They are the envy of the \nworld at the NIH. We constantly are facing different challenges of \ngetting the youngest, most talented, most creative, most innovative, \nmost committed, and most hard-working researchers in the world to go to \nthe NIH.\n  We have had Dr. Zerhouni, who has appeared before our HELP Committee, \nwith Dr. Varmus and others talking about the new paths and \nopportunities that are out there in terms of the NIH, which are \nenormously exciting and challenging.\n  Then, what happened later this last spring? Well, there was a \nchallenge that involved some 677 employees who were grant managers. \nGrant managers are the ones who review the various research \npossibilities that are being collected. In many instances, they have \nthe most sensitive kinds of jobs at the NIH because we know that only \nabout 30 to 35 percent of all of the qualified applications actually \nget funded. We are actually going to see a reduction this year, at a \ntime when we have the greatest opportunities in any time in the history \nof the world for breakthroughs in all kinds of drugs that affect \nfamilies, whether talking about cancer, about heart, or Alzheimer's. We \nwould empty the nursing homes in this country if we had a breakthrough \nas a result of trying to find a prescription drug for Alzheimer's.\n  The grant managers are the ones who help make the judgments and the \ndecisions in terms of prioritizing these various grants which are \nreally the heart of the NIH programs, and they were challenged.\n  We had some 677 employees working for a period of weeks because the \nestimate that was given by OMB was that this would result in \nsignificant savings. The employees got together, they made an \napplication, and they won the contract. They won it hands down. And it \ncost them $7 million. Overall, competitions at NIH will exceed $15 \nmillion.\n  Not only that, but the signal that it sent on through this blue \nribbon agency--sure, there may be important changes that ought to be \nmade out at the NIH; sure there may be different changes in terms of \ndirection and what they ought to be doing on clinical trials; sure \nthere could be better utilization of different kinds of reviews, but \nthe fact that we are going to fine the agency which has this degree of \nexpertise and can make the difference in terms of people's lives, being \nsubjected to this, what I think is effectively, harassment.\n  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Maryland, it is to \nassure that we are going to find a common playing field, and the basic \nrules for competition will be the standards which have been reviewed \nand recommended and are not the ones which have been embraced by this \nadministration.\n  I know others have pointed this out. But when we see that, we are \ngoing to have competition between some contractors who are not \nproviding the kind of protections or benefits, health benefits, when we \nknow the benefits that exist under the Federal contractors, so that \nthey will be able to continue the slide, in terms of meaning that more \nand more people are going to lose their benefits, when we find out \neffectively there is no opportunity for appealing the decision, not for \nthe Federal employees, although there are appeal decisions available to \ncontractors, when we look at the no review and following the cost and \nthe quality of the work performed by the contractors, we have seen time \nin and time out--and all of us have these examples in our own States--\nwhere people bid in and they bid in cheap, they try to add onto the \ncosts of various proposals, which then results in the work not being \ndone, and too often the Federal Government gets stuck holding the bag.\n  The kinds of unfair competitions which have been reviewed to date, in \nterms of current conditions, I find so compelling and so unfair. What \nthe Mikulski amendment will ensure is that we are really going to have \na system that will be respected, that will be supported by those in all \nagencies as well as the private sector, and as a result of which we \nwill be able to ensure greater productivity and the savings of \ntaxpayers' money. That is the way to go, not the skewed way which is \ncurrently, I think, working to the great disadvantage of hard-working, \nskilled, dedicated, and committed Americans who are doing a job. \nWhether they are trying to work out in the immigration process with all \nthe implications that has in homeland security, whether they are border \nguards trying to guard our borders, whether they are in the Customs \nService and dealing with all the challenges they are facing out there, \nday in and day out--people who join those services need to be highly \nskilled and highly competent.\n  Maybe there are better ways of doing it, but the current proposal is \nnot the way to go. The Mikulski amendment will change and alter that. I \nhope it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader spoke to the Democratic \nleader on more than one occasion following a conference between Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens, seeing if we could move some of these \nappropriations bills. The sprint is now on. We on this side believe we \ncan move them quickly. It sounds a little unusual that the minority is \npushing appropriations bills, but we are doing that because we want to \ndo everything we can to avoid this omnibus bill. Anything we can \naccomplish that avoids the omnibus, we are better off.\n  There are just a very few issues that remain. One of them is the \nDodd-McConnell or McConnell-Dodd amendment. That is an important \namendment. It will take a little bit of time--not a lot. We also need \nto finish this matter here now before the Senate. I want the record to \nbe spread with the fact that we are doing everything on this side to \nmove the legislation. We have agreed to set amendments aside. We have \ndone everything within our power to move it along.\n  We have sent a hotline to Senators on our side to find out what \namendments they have to offer. We have gotten a response back. It is \nnot complete, but certainly it is reasonable at this stage.\n  Again, what I want to say is we don't want someone coming later \nsaying we are not moving the appropriations bills because of the \nminority. We are willing to move these bills as quickly as possible. We \nhave two managers here who are experienced on the bills before us. I \nbelieve they are doing everything they can.\n  I hope the majority leader can find out what is slowing this bill up. \nIt is taking far too much time, in my opinion.\n  I have also have been told--not by the majority leader but by his \nfloor staff--that if we finish the bill tonight there will be no votes \ntomorrow. I hope, with all the things we have to do, that will be some \nincentive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Corzine\n\n[[Page S13100]]\n\nand Senator Edwards be added as cosponsors to the Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am sponsor of the amendment that is \ncurrently pending on the Senate floor. I ask unanimous consent Senator \nAkaka also be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Mikulksi-Landrieu \namendment to the Transportation/Treasury Appropriations bill.\n  I believe the Administration's revision to A-76 is unfair to Federal \nworkers and threatens cost-effective and accountable Federal \ncontracting.\n  The Commercial Activities Panel, which was mandated by Congress to \nfind ways to improve A-76, was deeply divided on this issue. In fact, \nthe Panel was so deeply divided that it issued two proposals to fix A-\n76: one supported by Federal employee unions and the other by Federal \ncontractors, the Comptroller General, and certain Administration \nofficials.\n  OMB's A-76 revision is controversial. The revision allows Federal \njobs to be contracted out without appreciable cost-savings. Under the \nrevision, Federal workers could lose their jobs before they have the \nchance to improve efficiencies. It does not allow Federal workers to \ncompete for work already contracted out. Nor does the revision consider \nmeasures to improve government efficiencies outside eliminating Federal \njobs. Moreover, it allows contractors to appeal decisions to contract \nout, but not Federal workers.\n  The revision does not reflect the idea of fair competition, and the \nrevision is not in the public's interest.\n  The Mikulski-Landrieu amendment promotes fair competition by \nprohibiting the Administration from using what I believe is an unfair \nprocess for determining whether government work should be contracted \nout. The amendment does not stop privatization, nor would it force \nagencies to use the old A-76 rules or prevent OMB from making changes \nto A-76.\n  As the Ranking Member of both the Senate Governmental Affairs \nFinancial Management Subcommittee and the Armed Services Readiness and \nManagement Support Subcommittee, I believe we should develop \ncontracting out policies that are fair to Federal workers and achieve \nthe best return on the dollar. These goals are complementary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Mikulski-\nLandrieu amendment. This is a very important amendment. It overturns \nthe newly revised guidelines--known as OMB A-76--for the ``competitive \noutsourcing'' of government jobs.\n  This A-76 process the administration has proposed isn't about saving \nmoney or promoting efficiency. It implements a rabid anti-government \nideology by stacking the deck against Federal employees; there's \nnothing fair about it.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has had \nhearings on this issue, I have had an opportunity to hear OMB officials \ntry to justify the new rules. To put it bluntly, they haven't \nsucceeded.\n  This administration's desire to privatize vast swaths of the Federal \nworkforce needs a lot more scrutiny from Congress.\n  Ultimately, the outsourcing of jobs is about people--the people who \nwork for our Government and the people who pay taxes.\n  Civil servants are the backbone of our government and we should \nremember that the skills, talent, and professionalism of the men and \nwomen in the Federal workplace are the best in the world.\n  The overwhelming majority of civil servants are dedicated to their \njobs. Many of them could make more money in the private sector but they \nwork in the government because they see public service as a higher \ncalling.\n  Many of us here in Congress strongly disagree with the \nadministration's privatization agenda. For instance, it struck me as \nludicrous that we would federalize baggage screening at airports and \nthen turn air traffic control over to the lowest bidder. So I offered \nan amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill to prevent that. Eleven of \nmy Republican colleagues voted for that amendment, which the Senate \nadopted, 56-41.\n  People correctly point out that taxpayers are the owners of the \nFederal Government and deserve the most effective and efficient \ngovernment possible.\n  I agree, but I would also point out that Federal employees are \ntaxpayers, too, and they have ``invested'' even more than their taxes--\nthey have invested their working lives. They deserve to be treated \nfairly and with respect.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support my friends from \nMaryland and Louisiana, who have offered an important amendment to get \nrid of unfair rules that disadvantage Federal Workers. I want to talk \nabout one group of Federal Workers in particular--those with mental \ndisabilities who are at risk of losing their jobs if these outsourcing \nrules are allowed to stand. I joined both of my colleagues from \nMaryland in sending a letter to Mr. Bolten, the Director of OMB, and to \nDefense Secretary Rumsfeld, expressing our outrage about workers at one \nworkplace in Maryland, and urging them to adopt a government-wide \npolicy protecting these workers and others like them from losing their \njobs.\n  Senator Mikulski has spoken about employees with mental disabilities \nworking at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, mentioned in a \nWashington Post article earlier this month. These 22 workers in the \nhospital kitchen are providing dependable and reliable service in very \nhard-to-fill positions. In return, the Navy provided them with a steady \npaycheck and the ability to lead independent, productive lives. This \nrelationship is mutually beneficial, but it is being jeopardized by \noutsourcing. And these workers could lose much more than their jobs. \nThey could lose their independence. That is what is at stake for these \nworkers.\n  As the author of the ADA and longstanding advocate for the rights of \npeople with disabilities, I am shocked that the administration would \nconsider outsourcing these jobs and reversing decades of Federal policy \nprotecting people with disabilities from discrimination and ensuring \nthat the Federal Government serve as a model employer.\n  These workers have been hired under a longstanding program that \nencourages the employment of individuals with mental disabilities. The \nprogram has operated under presidents from both parties and has been \nwell implemented. No one has ever thought to attack it, until now. In \n2000, the government employed 1,734 workers with mental retardation, \nabout \\1/10\\ of 1 percent of the 1.8 million Federal workers. If this \noutsourcing is allowed to continue, that number could shrink \ndramatically.\n  Our Senate report on committee-passage of the ADA in 1989 noted this \nsad truth ``According to a recent Louis Harris poll not working is \nperhaps definition of what it means to be disabled in America.'' \nThirty-two percent of people with disabilities are working full or part \ntime compared to 81 percent of people who don't have a disability. The \nadministration ought to be doing more to increase the number of workers \nwith disabilities, not outsourcing the jobs of the few who are \nemployed.\n  I am proud to support the amendment of the Senators from Maryland and \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are looking forward to moving this \nbill. I know the Senator from Wyoming wishes to offer a second degree. \nI note that he is on the floor.\n  I also note that the Senator from Ohio has done a great deal of work \non the Civil Service. He has some very interesting ideas.\n  I wish we could continue the debate on these amendments. The Senator \nfrom Ohio will be offering an amendment. We are ready to debate and \ndiscuss it.\n  If we all work together, I think we can finish the bill in the \ninterest of the\n\n[[Page S13101]]\n\nAmerican public, the integrity of the Civil Service, and the taxpayer.\n  I will save my rebuttal until the pertinent parties are on the floor.\n  I am ready to go. If we could have the second degree, we are ready to \ndebate it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThomas be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment on the issue of \ncompetitive sourcing; I further ask consent that there be 40 minutes of \ntotal debate equally divided in the usual form relative to both the \nThomas and Mikulski amendments; I further ask consent that following \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Thomas amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation \nto the Mikulski amendment, with no amendments in order to the \namendments prior to the vote and 2 minutes equally divided prior to the \nsecond vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator's request be modified to have 10 minutes \non the second vote rather than the usual 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is agreed to.\n  Is there an objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object--I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to have a vote at approximately 4:25. Senator \nDodd has been here since 11 o'clock this morning to offer an amendment. \nHe and Senator McConnell are working on this now. I ask consent they \ncome up next, but Senator Shelby is not in a position to approve that. \nWe are going to do everything we can so they come up after the next \nvote. It is probably the most important amendment to the whole bill. We \nhope we can dispose of that as soon as possible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1923\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for a \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for himself and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 1923.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1923\n\n     (Purpose: To substitute a requirement for an annual report on \n  competitive sourcing activities on lists required under the Federal \n    Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 that are performed for \n    executive agencies by Federal Government sources, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. . (a) Not later than December 31 of each year, the \n     head of each executive agency shall submit to Congress \n     (instead of the report required by section 642) a report on \n     the competitive sourcing activities on the list required \n     under the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-270; 31 U.S.C. 501 note) that were performed \n     for such executive agency during the previous fiscal year by \n     Federal Government sources. The report shall include--\n       (1) the total number of competitions completed;\n       (2) the total number of competitions announced, together \n     with a list of the activities covered by such competitions;\n       (3) the total number (expressed as a full-time employee \n     equivalent number) of the Federal employees studied under \n     completed competitions;\n       (4) the total number (expressed as a full-time employee \n     equivalent number) of the Federal employees that are being \n     studied under competitions announced but not completed;\n       (5) the incremental cost directly attributable to \n     conducting the competitions identified under paragraphs (1) \n     and (2), including costs attributable to paying outside \n     consultants and contractors;\n       (6) an estimate of the total anticipated savings, or a \n     quantifiable --description of improvements in service or \n     performance, derived from completed competitions;\n       (7) actual savings, or a quantifiable description of \n     improvements in --service or performance, derived from the \n     implementation of competitions completed after May 29, 2003;\n       (8) the total projected number (expressed as a full-time \n     employee equivalent number) of the Federal employees that are \n     to be covered by competitions scheduled to be announced in \n     the fiscal year covered by the next report required under \n     this section; and\n       (9) a general description of how the competitive sourcing \n     decisionmaking processes of the executive agency are aligned \n     with the strategic workforce plan of that executive agency.\n       (b) The head of an executive agency may not be required, \n     under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or any \n     other policy, directive, or regulation, to conduct a follow-\n     on public-private competition to a prior public-private \n     competition conducted under such circular within five years \n     of the prior public-private competition if the activity or \n     function covered by the prior public-private competition was \n     performed by Federal Government employees as a result of the \n     prior public-private competition.\n       (c) Hereafter, the head of an executive agency may expend \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available for any \n     purpose to the executive agency under this or any other Act \n     to monitor (in the administration of responsibilities under \n     Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 or any related \n     policy, directive, or regulation) the performance of an \n     activity or function of the executive agency that has \n     previously been subjected to a public-private competition \n     under such circular.\n       (d) For the purposes of subchapter V of chapter 35 of title \n     31, United States Code--\n       (1) the person designated to represent employees of the \n     Federal Government in a public-private competition regarding \n     the performance of an executive agency activity or function \n     under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76--\n       (A) shall be treated as an interested party on behalf of \n     such employees; and\n       (B) may submit a protest with respect to such public-\n     private competition on behalf of such employees; and\n       (2) the Comptroller General shall dispose of such a protest \n     in accordance with the policies and procedures applicable to \n     protests described in section 3551(1) of such title under the \n     procurement protest system provided under such subchapter.\n       (e) An activity or function of an executive agency that is \n     converted to contractor performance under Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular A-76 may not be performed by \n     the contractor at a location outside the United States except \n     to the extent that such activity or function was previously \n     been performed by Federal Government employees outside the \n     United States.\n       (f) The process that applies to the selection of architects \n     and engineers for meeting the requirements of an executive \n     agency for architectural and engineering services under \n     chapter 11 of title 40, United States Code, shall apply to a \n     public-private competition for the performance of \n     architectural and engineering services for an executive \n     agency.\n       (g) In this section, the term ``executive agency'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 4 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403).\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. This is a Thomas-Voinovich amendment. We worked on this \ntogether. I will cover a little bit about what it does.\n  This is a reporting requirement addressing a number of the concerns \nvarious Senators have had about competitive sourcing. The amendment \ndoes the following:\n  It requires the Secretary of Interior to annually report on its \ncompetitive sourcing efforts, including the list of the total number of \ncompetitions completed, the list of the total number of competitions \nannounced, the activities covered, the total number of full-time \nequivalent Federal employees studied under the completed competition, \nthe total number of full-time equivalent Federal employees being \nstudied but not completed. It also asks for the incremental costs \ndirectly attributable to conducting the competitions, including the \ncosts to paying outside consultants and estimated total anticipated \nsavings or description of the improvements and service or performance \nderived from the competitions. Also, actual savings and improvements in \nour services or performance derived from the competition, the total \nprojected number of full-time equivalent Federal employees covered by \ncompetitions scheduled to be announced for the next fiscal year.\n  It requires a general description of how the competitive sourcing \ndecisionmaking process of the Department of Interior is aligned with \nthe strategic workforce plan of the Department.\n  The amendment is a responsible measurement to allow additional \naccountability and transparency to public-private competitions. That is \nreally what we have been concerned about.\n\n[[Page S13102]]\n\n  Two weeks ago the House overwhelmingly adopted a similar reporting \nrequirement during consideration of the Treasury-Transportation \nappropriations bill. This amendment will give Congress additional \noversight of competitive sourcing, unlike the Reid amendment that \nstopped it altogether. Competitive sourcing allows for tax dollars to \nbe used more efficiently and improves agency efficiency. The provision \nwould apply to all Federal agencies and not simply Interior.\n  This is something we need. We talked a little bit about the changes \nbrought about in the past. The fact is in the past there was nothing \ndone to implement A-76. Now there is a plan. The plan will be reported. \nThe plan will be transparent. I certainly urge all Senators to give it \nsome consideration and hopefully to vote in favor of continuing to have \ncompetitive sourcing, continuing to strengthen the efficiency of the \nGovernment, continuing to give a chance for the private sector to \nparticipate.\n  I yield now to my friend from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to save my remarks. I am \nwaiting for something to come from my office that I can share with the \nMembers of the Senate from the chairman of the Commercial Activities \nPanel I made reference to in my remarks earlier. I will let the other \nside continue with their remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I feel at a bit of a disadvantage. I am \nall set to debate, but we keep waiting. We waited for the amendment. \nNow we have to wait for the Senator from Ohio to make his points in the \nargument and then he tells me to go ahead and make the argument. My \nargument is to rebut their amendment. So I am waiting for the Senator \nfrom Ohio to make his argument.\n  I have great admiration for the Senator from Ohio, particularly in \nthe area of Civil Service. I know he has put in countless hours in \nterms of the Civil Service. Perhaps if he could explain his amendment. \nI listened carefully to Senator Thomas, but I am not sure I grasped the \nfull extent of the amendment. There are many elements about the \namendment I find attractive and I would like to comment on those. Those \nI find deficient I would like to identify.\n  I do want the Senator from Ohio to know I think you are an expert on \nCivil Service. I have great admiration for you.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in my previous remarks in opposition to \nthe Senator's amendment, I went into the details of the amendment we \npresented to the floor. So those five provisions I just mentioned--and \nthey were reiterated by the Senator from Wyoming--basically constitute \nthe amendment. I think that lays it out. I am more than happy to hear \nthe Senator's thoughts in regard to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first, again I wish to make clear what I \nsaid about my two colleagues and my great respect for them. And I know \nof their work on civil service. I am particularly aware of the work of \nthe Senator from Ohio. But I must say, the Thomas-Voinovich amendment \nproves my point that the May 29 A-76 circular on the new framework for \ncontracting out is deficient. And it is deficient because it is unfair. \nIt absolutely tilts the bidding process, to almost rig it to the fact \nthat private contractors would win the bid. Their corrections of the A-\n76 that they offer in their amendment point out how deficient May 29 \nwas. So they make my point.\n  No. 2, I note also that they call for more reporting and more \naccountability. I think that is great, but, guess what, we are going to \ncontract out Federal employees like the fire department at NIH, like \nthe people with mental disabilities in the kitchen at the Bethesda \nNaval Hospital, and then we are going to hire people to watch the \ncontracts.\n  Why are we contracting people out and then hiring people to watch the \ncontracts that we have contracted out? Where are we going? What is the \npoint? Where is the management reform in that?\n  So I respect the need for greater accountability and oversight. In \nfact, I think it is called for. Know that I know that the old A-76 also \nhad some potholes in it.\n  What my amendment does is it says: You cannot implement May 29. Go \nback to the drawing boards. Work with the Commission that the Senator \nfrom Ohio described. But let's implement all of the recommendations, \nnot only the selective ones that tilt the playing field to the \ncontracting out. So that is where my amendment is.\n  I ask my colleague from Ohio and my colleague from Wyoming, am I \nright in saying that your amendment would want more accountability; it \nwould allow an appeals process, which now they do not have; that they \nwould not bid every 5 years; and they cannot contract overseas?\n  I ask either the Senator from Wyoming or the Senator from Ohio, have \nI grasped your amendment? Have I? What are your five points? I will \nrepeat it: Greater accountability; reporting requirements; the right \nfor Federal employees to have an appeal, just like the private \ncontractors; that they would not have to compete every 5 years; and \nthis wonderful one that says they cannot contract out to move jobs \noverseas.\n  Is that what I understand your amendment to be?\n  Well, I salute you. I think those are excellent improvements, but \nthey are not a substitute for my amendment because even if your \namendment goes through, I identified 15 things that were wrong with A-\n76.\n  Now, you are willing to correct five. I was not as prescriptive. But \nyou are willing to correct five. There are 10 others that need \ncorrecting. And I am just going to give a few, as I hear your \narguments.\n  When I look at the ones that are not in there, the ones that are not \nincluded: One, it does not require appreciable cost savings. A contract \nout does not have to show that it is saving money. The other one is it \ndoes not end the unfair advantage given to contractors who provide \ntheir employees with inferior health benefits. So when there is a \ncompetition between the Federal employees and this so-called private \ncontractor, the Federal employee's health benefits will count in the \ncontract but not for the contractor.\n  Also, what it does is it does not consider alternatives to \nprivatization; in other words, to give them the chance to reorganize \nand to streamline. That has been done at NIH. It has been done at other \nagencies.\n  It also encourages the privatization of inherently Government work. \nThis is a big sticking point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my time to my \ncolleague from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply make the observation that the \noffering of this amendment by the Senators from Wyoming and Ohio \nclearly admits and sends the signal that the OMB circular issued on May \n29 was grossly deficient.\n  Now, they are addressing it in certain limited respects. And to the \nextent that is the case, so be it. But it does not really solve the \nbasic problem which we confront, and that is that OMB handed down this \ncircular which grossly tilts the playing field and which structures an \nunfair competition.\n  It seems to me the best way to resolve this situation is to adopt the \namendment offered by my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nwhich in effect would hold the May 29 OMB circular. We could then \nrevisit this question and address the range of the deficiencies that \nare in that circular. My own view is, if people of good will undertake \nthat enterprise, we will be able, I hope, to reach a consensus and have \na better product as a consequence.\n  I think this is, in a sense, elemental fairness for the Federal \nemployee and for the Federal taxpayer. This issue is always portrayed \nas though contracting out to the private sector is beneficial to the \nFederal taxpayer. That is clearly not the case. In fact, there has been \ninstance after instance in which Federal employees win competitions, \ntherefore validating the argument that they are better for the\n\n[[Page S13103]]\n\ntaxpayer than putting it out into the private sector.\n  Now, OMB, because it is not meeting its targets--these ideological \ntargets that have been placed upon them, which they in turn are \nimposing upon the agencies because they cannot get the outcome they \nseek--has come in with a new circular, of May 29, which tilts the \nplaying field in an unfair way. That really cries out for the passage \nof the very well considered amendment of my colleague from Maryland.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, could the Chair inform me when I have \nused 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would just like to clarify something \nfor my colleagues in the Senate. First of all, the A-76 old rule was \nconsidered to be broken. Congress recognized the problem, and they \nestablished a Commercial Activities Panel as part of the 2001 Defense \nAuthorization Act. The panel was convened specifically to consider \nrevisions to the A-76 competition. It was led by Comptroller David \nWalker, the head of the General Accounting Office.\n  Now, there have been some allegations here that the circular that was \nput out by the Bush administration was not reflective of the panel's \ndecision.\n  First of all, the recommendations coming from the panel were either \nagreed to unanimously or by a supermajority of the public and private \nrepresentatives.\n  I will say, in all candor, I correct my earlier statements. They were \nnot supported by Bob Tobias. They were not supported by Colleen Kelley. \nAnd they were not supported by Bobby Harnage. So let's clarify that. \nThe union representatives did not like it that much.\n  So the question is, Is the new A-76 better than the old one that the \nSenators from Maryland want us to adopt?\n  As I noted earlier, the A-76, the new regulation, quoting David \nWalker:\n\n     . . . is generally consistent with the commercial activities \n     panel's sourcing principles and recommendations and, as such, \n     provides improved and foundation for competitive sourcing \n     decisions in the Federal Government. In particular, the new \n     circular permits . . .\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about the new circular.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If effectively implemented, the new Circular should result \n     in . . . [greater credibility] and greater accountability \n     regardless of the service provider selected.\n\n  As part of an executive session at Harvard University that was \nconvened by Dean Nye, in which I participated, I got to know several \nmembers of the Clinton administration. One of those members of the \nadministration was Steve Kelman, administrator of the Office for \nFederal Procurement Policy at OMB. He had the job of Ms. Styles who has \nleft the administration. I asked Steve what he thought about the new A-\n76 circular and he said that overall it was better than the old A-76 \nand that the only problem he had with it was this recompete after 5 \nyears for those people in the public sector who won the competition.\n  What I am saying is that the A-76 circular that was submitted by the \nBush administration is not perfect. There are differences of opinion \nabout it, but it is a far cry better than the old A-76 circular.\n  What we are saying today is that we should not go back to that, that \nthe new circular is better. Our amendment enhances the playing field \nfor our Federal workforce in that it requires certain reporting \nrequirements that say this competition is not going to be done willy-\nnilly, that it is going to be done as part of their workforce shaping.\n  By the way, I would like to correct one Senator from Maryland who \nsaid the administration has given the charge to go out and do this \narbitrarily. They did that initially. I blew a gasket. I blew a fuse. \nSenator Durbin and I had a hearing on that. We had a second hearing on \nit and the administration has backed off from the quotas. So there is \nnot going to be a rush out there to do competitive bidding. We are \ngoing to require them to have reporting requirements, letting people \nknow beforehand that they are going to go to competition.\n  Once they go to competition and if the private sector wins, they are \ngoing to have to report whether they are getting the money efficiencies \nand whether they are getting the other efficiencies they thought they \nwere going to get.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. It provides that if the Government employees lose the \ncompetition, they will have a right to appeal, just as the private \nsector has a right of appeal. So we are giving them that opportunity. \nWe are eliminating the every 5-year competition if it is won in-house.\n  It also provides that if the private sector gets the work, it has to \ngo to American people and not be farmed out overseas.\n  I believe this amendment, plus the revised A-76 regulation, is a far \nbetter system than going back to something that we acknowledged back in \n2001 was not working. We fixed it. It may not be perfect. I am not \nsaying it is. I am not saying that everybody agrees with it. But it is \na far cry better than to go back to what we had before.\n  Fundamentally, I think the other side wants to go back there because \nthere are many people who are opposed to competitive bidding. I want \neveryone to know, competitive bidding ought to be something that is \navailable to the administrative branch of Government, but it ought to \nbe something that is carefully considered before they go forward and do \nit.\n  My feeling always is, I would rather stay with the people who are \nworking in the Federal Government and give them the training, the \nempowerment, and tools to get the job done. We have leveled the playing \nfield. We slowed down the process.\n  I believe with Clay Johnson over there at OMB and with Kay James over \nat OPM, we have two outstanding people. That is what it is about, the \nintegrity of the people. They are not going to go forward and do some \nof the things that the folks on the other side of the aisle think they \nare going to do.\n  I am staying on top of this issue. I am going to monitor this issue \nto make sure they continue to do what they have represented that they \nare going to do to me and so many other members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes thirty-five seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield myself 5 minutes and withhold 4 to see if \nSenator Kennedy or another Senator wishes to speak. Right now I would \nlike to yield myself 5 minutes. I ask the Chair to confirm, as I get a \nlittle excited when I am talking about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator when 5 \nminutes have expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, what I want to say in response to what \nmy colleague has said is, No. 1, he says the May 29 circular is better. \nThere is a fundamental difference between us on that. I don't believe \nit is better. I stand with the way the National Treasury Union Workers \nfeel about it and the way the other Federal employees feel about it.\n  If you are on the side of the companies that are going to benefit \nfrom privatization, you like it. If you are the ones who are on the \nfiring line or the chopping block, you don't like it.\n  What I do acknowledge is that the amendment offered by my two \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle does improve the A-76 \nprocess.\n  I also acknowledge that I know the Senator from Ohio did go \nballistic. I am glad that he went ballistic. I thank him for standing \nsentry down in the Government Affairs Committee against bounty hunting, \nagainst quotas, and against sending jobs overseas. I salute him on \nthat. But he is one man against\n\n[[Page S13104]]\n\na whole tide here. This is why I think his amendment has merit.\n  But I tell you, deep down to my toes, I believe they want to \nprivatize most of the Federal Government, and I do believe that deep \ndown inside they want quotas to privatize. I don't believe that about \nhim.\n  When we look at this whole issue that he raised about private sector \ncontractors moving jobs overseas, the Senator knows they have already \ndone it. If the call center at the Census Bureau is now in India, \nHello? The United States of America calling India to find out about \ncensus?\n  I could go on with other examples. The time is late. I appreciate the \nfact that the Senator gives Federal employees a right to appeal when \nthey lose a competition which they now don't have. I also acknowledge \nthat his amendment removes the 5-year recompete competition, and I \nsalute him on that, and also ensures contract oversight.\n  In other words, you have some good ideas here. But in my comments, I \nsay, you can vote for both. I want my colleagues to know they can vote \nfor both. They can vote for Voinovich-Thomas and they can vote for \nMikulski. Voinovich-Thomas has ideas of merit. Theirs is a modest \nimprovement.\n  My amendment improves it all. They improve five things about this. I \nhave identified 15. If you want 15, you vote for Mikulski. But you can \nvote for them and you can vote for me.\n  The other thing I want to say is that the Mikulski amendment does not \nstop contracting out. It simply stops the May 29 circular, which is \nharsh, punitive, and unfair to Federal employees.\n  I said to the administration, back to the drawing boards, work with \nVoinovich and Thomas and Collins, and work with Mikulski, Kennedy, and \nSarbanes, and make sure our Federal workforce keeps on working.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I need 2 minutes.\n  I appreciate the kind words from the Senator of Maryland with regard \nto our amendment. But I think that to go back to the old A-76 circular \nafter the commercial panels spent so much time on it would not be in \nthe best interest of our Government.\n  I am going to quote from David Walker, who is chairman of that panel, \nto clarify the fact that the new circular is better than the old \nsystem, and that we would be better off having our amendment attached \nto the new circular rather than to the old rules and old circular. He \nsays:\n\n       As I noted previously, the new Circular A-76 is generally \n     consistent with the Commercial Activities Panel's sourcing \n     principles and recommendations and, as such, provides an \n     improved foundation for competitive sourcing decisions in the \n     Federal Government. In particular, the new Circular permits: \n     greater reliance on procedures contained in the FAR, which \n     should result in more transparent, simpler, and consistently \n     applied competitive process, and source selection decisions \n     based on tradeoffs between technical factors and cost.\n       The new Circular also suggests the potential use of \n     alternatives to the competitive sourcing process, such as \n     public-private and public-public partnerships and high-\n     performing organizations. It does not, however, specifically \n     address how these alternatives might be used.\n\n  That is an improvement.\n\n       If effectively implemented, the new Circular should result \n     in increased savings, improved performance, and greater \n     accountability, regardless of the service provider selected.\n\n  That is why the amendment is so important.\n\n       However, this competitive sourcing initiative is a major \n     change in the way Government agencies operate, and successful \n     implementation of the Circular's provisions will require that \n     adequate support be made available to Federal agencies and \n     employees, especially if the timeframes called for in the new \n     Circular are to be achieved.\n\n  The point I am making today--one of the reasons we have one of our \namendments--is that we are requiring the Federal agencies to have the \ncapacity to properly go through this competitive sourcing. That is what \nour amendment says. In addition, it says that once the competitive \nsourcing has been--if the outsiders win, we are going to monitor their \nperformance to make sure we are going to get the savings and the \nefficiencies we are supposed to get. If we are not, that would mean our \nworkers in the Federal Government would get another shot at what had \nbeen farmed out to the private sector.\n  I know there have been instances in the Defense Department where \nthings have been farmed out and then they have been brought back into \nthe Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Thomas \namendment. I believe competitive sourcing is an important process for \nthe Federal Government. I believe it will help to improve the overall \nperformance and efficiency of certain activities carried out by the \nFederal Government.\n  Allowing these competitions to move forward is important to improve \nthe value of service provided by the Federal Government to all \nAmericans. Whether the contract is won by the incumbent Federal workers \nor private sector bidders, the Federal Government wins by encouraging \ngreater efficiency and a more focused workforce. That improves service.\n  I believe we must be careful to clarify that competitive sourcing, as \nproposed, doesn't apply to those activities considered inherently \ngovernmental. Those jobs will be reserved solely for the Federal \nworkforce, and no one is proposing otherwise.\n  Our goal is clear. What we are trying to do is make the Federal \nworkforce more efficient and competitive. At some point, the Federal \nGovernment is going to have to demand that it get a greater return on \nits investment. I believe that allowing public-private competitive \nsourcing is a step in that direction. At the proper time, I will urge \nadoption of the Thomas amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I have a couple of points I had intended \nto make. It was brought up before that this system, as it exists now, \ndoesn't require savings. That is not the case. You don't grant a \ncontract unless there are going to be savings.\n  They talked about no alternatives. That is what competition is all \nabout, to take advantage of the alternatives.\n  Someone mentioned management of contracts. That is not a brand new \nidea. A lot of contracting goes on around the world, particularly in \nthe private sector, and you always have to manage those.\n  So we have a real opportunity to strengthen competitive outsourcing \nhere. That is what our amendment does. It doesn't go back to zero, but \nit strengthens it from where we are.\n  We had a similar one before that the Senate rejected. I urge the \nSenate to reject this one as well.\n  Whenever the other side is ready, we will yield back our time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 28 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to notify the Chair that other \nSenators are on the way. I will speak for 2 minutes and then I hope \nthey are here.\n  Again, I reiterate, the Thomas amendment has some good points. You \ncan vote for both. My amendment does not stop privatization; it just \nmakes it fair. I say something and they something back. But I am \ntelling you, they don't mandate cost savings in this A-76.\n  Let me tell you a boondoggle. Defense Finance Accounting Service--\nthis is finance accounting--contracted out 650 jobs to a private \ncomputer company. Guess what. The DOD inspector general found out that \nit cost the taxpayers $25 million more than it would cost under Federal \nemployees. Take the call center. They won the competition, and they won \nit by sending it to India. Lower wages, no health care. Let's ship \nthose jobs overseas.\n  My gosh, what are we doing? This May 29 circular is despicable, it is \nunfair, it is harsh, it is punitive, and it will cost taxpayer dollars \nto do studies, and it is costing morale. If we want people to work for \nthe Federal Government and be enthusiastic and put their best energies \nforth and put America first, we cannot keep Tinkertoying with them. I \nhope you can vote for their amendment, but, please, in the interest of \nthe vitality and integrity of the Federal workforce, please vote for \nthe Mikulski amendment.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S13105]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nfrom Maryland to oppose this rule change. Let me say quickly, because I \nknow the time is short, we have tried this in Louisiana at Fort Polk, \nin Leesville, to be exact--1,500 Federal jobs, people not overly paid, \nbut well paid with good health benefits, and others.\n  Needless to say, the base plays a vital role in the economy of \ncentral Louisiana and is by far the single largest employer in the \narea. The secondary employment impact on the State is even more \nsignificant with Fort Polk accounting for millions of dollars in \npayroll annually.\n  The workers at Fort Polk are patriots. They work hard, they stay \nlonger, they get the job done. I heard that not from the unions, not \nfrom the workers, not from some local politician--I heard that from the \nmilitary commanders at Fort Polk who just did not want to see their \nworkforce contracted out.\n  They already had experience with contractors at Fort Polk, and, \nfrankly, they didn't like it. Base operations were bogged down by the \nrefusal of contractors to take the little steps that improve quality of \nlife, improve the aesthetics at the base, and go that extra mile when \ntroops were deploying or coming home.\n  It is not that the contractors were not willing to take the work, it \nis that they wanted to charge the Government more to do it. Despite \nthese objections, the workforce at Fort Polk was subject to the A-76 \nprocess. It has been an embarrassment and totally unworthy of the way \nthis Government should treat it workers.\n  To boil the controversy down to its bare essentials, contractors \nbidding on the Fort Polk work were made aware of what the DoD civilian \nbid would be. Now the OMB wants to take this process even further.\n  Now the OMB says contractors don't have to prove they would save any \nmoney. They only have to show they would provide some ``financial \nbenefit.'' Now the OMB says that workers can't include in their bids \nproposed reorganizations to make themselves more efficient. Now outside \ncontractors will not have to figure in any health care benefits to \ntheir workers into these packages.\n  Good jobs are simply too hard to come by in Louisiana for me to allow \nthis to go forward without a fight.\n  We know what A-76 really means in Louisiana. It means that workers \nthat are paid a reasonable wage, including real health benefits and a \npension, will be replaced. They will be replaced, frequently by the \nsame people, but this time, they won't have health benefits or \npensions. The difference will be the profit that corporations will \npocket.\n  Our Armed Forces deserve better than to be supported by civilians who \nare underpaid, understaffed, and overstretched so that contractors can \npocket a few extra dollars per hour. That is not a savings to the \nAmerican people. It is pennywise and pound foolish.\n  With this experience, I simply cannot endorse broadening a system \nthat I consider already broken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her fight and \nstrong advocacy on this issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I reserve 2 minutes, waiting for Senators Byrd and \nLautenberg. Does the Senator from Wyoming wish to speak?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Pardon me, I did not hear the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I said I reserve 2 minutes to allow Senator Byrd and \nSenator Lautenberg to speak. Does the Senator wish to speak any longer?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, we are ready to vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am going to wrap up. Remember, there are 15 reasons \nwhy the new public-private competition is unfair.\n  It does not allow Federal employees to submit their best bids.\n  It fails to end the unfair advantage given to contractors who provide \ntheir employees with inferior health benefits.\n  It allows the use of quotes instead of actually soliciting bids from \ncontractors.\n  It doesn't consider alternatives to privatization giving Federal \nemployees the right to come up with streamlining.\n  It is very bad for diversity in the Federal workplace. Many of these \njobs are clerical. I have already gotten feedback from constituents who \nrefer to the clerical workers as ``let's get rid of them; they will be \nlow-hanging fruit.'' Is that the way we refer to the clerical people \nwho are willing to work 24/7 in keeping the FBI or keeping the DOD \ngoing? And guess what. Once it goes, it does not allow the Federal \nworkers to rebid to get it back.\n  All I am saying is, stop the implementation of the May 29 circular. \nLet's have a better process. Let's have a better plan. I am not opposed \nto privatization, but I am opposed to this May 29 circular.\n  I yield back such time as we may have remaining, and I am ready to \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, there will now be \na vote with respect to amendment No. 1923. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1923. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Ensign) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID.

The Senate will come to order.\n  There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before a vote with respect to \nthe Mikulski amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we now come to the Mikulski amendment. \nKnow that the amendment that just passed with the support of my side of \nthe aisle corrects 5 and only 5 of 15 egregious problems with the May \n29 circular. That amendment was a downpayment. But if you want to \ncorrect all the grievances, vote for the Mikulski amendment. It does \nnot end privatization. It ends the harsh, punitive, and egregious \nproblems with the May 29 circular.\n  Stand up for America, stand up for the Federal employees, stand up \nfor the Mikulski amendment and vote aye.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, the Senate has just adopted an amendment\n\n[[Page S13106]]\n\nwhich approves congressional oversight of public-private. It is a good \nthing for us to do.\n  We urge the Senate to oppose the Mikulski amendment because it \nattempts to amend the problem by going back to the old A-76 process \nthat we all agree was broken.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment that is before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID (after having voted in the affirmative). Mr. President, I \nhave a pair with the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. If he were \npresent and voting, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, would vote \n``no.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote ``yea.'' I therefore \nwithhold my vote.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my pair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pair is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that my pair be reinstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pair is reinstated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, a mass liquidation of the Government is \nunderway. U.S. corporations and industry entrepreneurs are salivating \nat this administration's effort to open at least 850,000 Federal jobs \nto private contractors.\n  If this administration has its way, the most basic services of the \nFederal Government--from national security to tax collection to air \ntraffic control to the maintenance of our national parks--will be \nhanded over to private contractors like birthday party favors.\n  And to expedite the process the administration has rewritten the \nFederal Government's A-76 contracting rules for the entire Federal \nGovernment, opening each agency and department to a host of potential \nabuses. The President's proposal has political disaster written all \nover it.\n  I voted in favor of the Mikulski amendment to block this egregious \nscheme from going into effect.\n  Also, the record should reflect the fact that the Thomas amendment \nwould allow executive agencies to use funds appropriated for other \npurposes to monitor the performance of an activity or function that has \nbeen subjected to public-private competition. Such a provision is a \npreemption of the appropriations powers of Congress. The Congress \nshould not be handing over such broad spending authority to executive \nagencies.\n  I voted to protect congressional prerogatives and against the Thomas \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1928\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1928.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To fund the Election Assistance Commission for fiscal year \n                                 2004)\n\n       On page 85, strike lines 20 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     Commission, $1,500,000,000, for providing grants to assist \n     State and local efforts to improve election technology and \n     the administration of Federal elections, as authorized by the \n     Help America Vote Act of 2002: Provided, That no more than \n     \\1/10\\ of 1 per-\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid, and, of course, on behalf of my \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, as well, to address this \nmatter. I do not want to take a lot of time on this amendment. There \nare other Members who have obligations they want to meet.\n  This amendment is pretty straightforward. Let me begin by thanking my \ncolleague from Kentucky, my colleague from Missouri, and others with \nwhom, over the last several years, we have worked to create and pass \nthe Help America Vote Act, which was signed into law by the President 1 \nyear ago next week.\n  This is a law, of course, to try to improve the conduct of Federal \nelections across the country. I need not remind my colleagues, of \ncourse, of the condition of the Federal election system based on the \nresults we saw in the national elections in the year 2000.\n  The piece of legislation that authorized these funds was adopted 98 \nto 2 by this body, and almost by a similar percentage of votes in the \nother body.\n  Last week, Senator McConnell and I came to the floor. I was going to \nsuggest we offer an additional appropriation on the $87 billion package \nfor Iraq. But, rightly, as my colleague from Kentucky pointed out, that \nwas not the appropriate place to do this. We agreed in a colloquy that \nwe would try to find an opportunity to provide the additional resources \nnecessary so the State and local officials across this country could \nmeet the obligations of doing these elections in a proper way.\n  I point out to my colleagues that the sense of timing is important. \nIn the Federal elections in 2004, the first primary of which is in the \nDistrict of Columbia on January 13--less than 3 months away--all States \nand localities must provide provisional ballots to any voter who is \nchallenged. Those provisional ballots must be verified, according to \nState law, in 2004. Also, in 2004, all States and localities must be \nprepared to implement the anti-fraud provisions that the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, fought so diligently and hard for as part of the \nHelp America Vote Act which affect first-time voters who register by \nmail. There are other requirements, of course, by 2004, and a whole \nseries of things that must be done by 2006.\n  Needless to say, as the State and local officials will tell you, \ngetting mechanisms in place to get it done requires advanced timing. \nThis cannot\n\n[[Page S13107]]\n\njust happen in the last few months before the elections occur.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that, obviously, the States are \nfacing tremendous budget constraints themselves. This is not the ideal \nway we would like to do this, but we have no other choice but to be \npart of this budgetary cycle and to include these dollars in this \nparticular effort.\n  In a time when we are committing, obviously, billions in Federal \nresources to build democracies around the world--and I supported that; \nI had reservations about it but, nonetheless, that is critically \nimportant--we cannot ignore the needs of our own democracy. Obviously, \nI think we would all agree we need to do what we can as well, as a \nnation that prides itself on being the leader when it comes to the \nconduct of our elections, to try to get these systems working better \nthan they have been.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have worked very hard on this \nmatter. This was truly a bipartisan effort. It continues to be one. We \nhave tried to work together on these matters over the last several \nyears so as not to create any partisan feelings. I think that has been \nthe case.\n  So today, in a bipartisan way, we are asking our colleagues to be \nsupportive of this additional amount in the appropriations process so \nwe can get the moneys back to our States.\n  I am sure every one of my colleagues has heard from their State and \nlocal officials. By the way, the States are doing a very good job. You \nmay have read recent articles of how the States are getting up to \nspeed, putting things in place, getting their implementation plans in \norder, and doing so with a great deal of expedition and care.\n  Several States have already utilized some of the newer approaches as \na result of their own State efforts, which are proving to be very \nsuccessful.\n  I think we are on the right track. I think we are doing the right \nthing. The National Governors Association, of course, reported the \ndifficulties they are having with their budget problems, as I mentioned \na moment ago.\n  I do not want to take a lot of time of my colleagues. I think they \nknow what the issues are. I have talked to many of them.\n  Just last week, Senator McConnell and I came to this floor to express \nour concerns that the Congress not leave here this session without \nproviding sufficient resources to the States to implement the minimum \nrequirements and other election priorities, for Federal elections \nenacted under the Help America Vote Act. Some of those requirements \nmust be implemented in time for the Federal elections next year.\n  The States are living up to their end of the bargain--all States are \nwell along in the development of their state plans and many are in the \ninitial implementation stages of the effort. But we must live up to our \nside of the bargain.\n  In his budget request, the President recommended funding these \nprograms in fiscal year 2004 at only one-half of the authorized amount, \nfor a total of $500 million. To their credit, the Appropriations \nSubcommittee fully funded that request, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Shelby, and my friend and colleague, the ranking \nmember, Senator Murray, for their efforts.\n  However, State and local budgets simply cannot absorb this $500 \nmillion shortfall. More importantly, any shortfall in fiscal year 2004 \nfollows on a similar shortfall of over $600 million in the fiscal year \n2003 appropriations. Unless we increase funding in this fiscal year, \nour commitment to the States to share in the funding of the new \nrequirements for Federal elections will fall over $1 billion short.\n  In a time when we are committing billions of dollars in Federal \nresources to build democracies around the world, we simply cannot \nafford to shortchange our own. The basic premise of a democracy is that \nevery citizen must have an equal voice in the determination of its \ngovernment.\n  And in this Nation, that voice is expressed through the equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted. If America is to \ncontinue to be the leader and example for emerging democracies around \nthe world, then our system of giving our citizens an equal voice--our \nsystem of elections--must meet this test.\n  Unfortunately, what we learned in the elections of 2000 was that not \nall Americans enjoy an equal voice. In fact, some citizens were denied \na voice at all because of malfunctioning or outdated voting equipment, \ninaccurate and incomplete voter registration records, and allegations \nof voter intimidation and fraud.\n  The silver lining of the 2000 elections was that it created the \nopportunity to recognize the challenges confronting our system \nof Federal elections and the ability to respond with bipartisan \ndetermination to provide Federal leadership to overcome those \nchallenges. And 98 members of the Senate responded to that opportunity \nby overwhelmingly passing the Help America Vote Act last year.\n\n  I once again want to thank my distinguished colleagues, and coauthors \nof the Help America Vote Act, Senator McConnell and Senator Bond, for \ntheir bipartisan leadership in that effort and for their continuing \ncommitment to see our promise for Federal funding fulfilled.\n  I especially want to recognize the leadership of my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, whose unfailing leadership on this issue \nhas help to bring us to this point. As then Chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, he chaired the first hearings on election reform and \nintroduced one of the first measures in Congress to offer assistance to \nthe States.\n  And today we stand before you again, united by our desire to fulfil \nthe commitment and promise of HAVA to the States, and to every American \nvoter, to be a full partner in Federal elections. But rhetoric alone \nwill not fulfill this commitment, nor will it fix the problems that \ncame to light in the 2000 elections. It will take leadership and funds. \nAnd that is what the Help America Vote Act provides.\n  HAVA provides federal leadership in the form of new minimum \nrequirements that all states must meet in the conduct of Federal \nelections. Those requirements will ensure that all voters can check \ntheir ballots and correct them before they are cast and counted. The \nrequirements will ensure that no voter who believes he or she is \nregistered and eligible to vote can be turned away from the polls--but \nmust be given a provisional ballot to cast and then have verified \npursuant to State law. And those requirements will ensure the accuracy \nof voter registration lists against fraud and mistakes through the \ncreation of a single statewide registration list. In short, HAVA will \nstrengthen our democracy by giving an equal voice to all citizens by \nmaking it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\n  Implementing these reforms will not be cheap and so for the first \ntime in our history, Congress committed to being a full partner in the \nfunding of these reforms by authorizing $3.8 billion to fund the \nimplementation of these requirements.\n  Federal funding is critical to nationwide implementation of this Act \nand may well govern the success and effectiveness of the new law. To \nhelp pay for election reforms and avoid an unfunded mandate on the \nStates, HAVA authorizes a total of nearly $4 billion over three fiscal \nyears, including over $2 billion in fiscal year 2003; $1 billion in \nfiscal year 2004; and $645,000 in fiscal year 2005.\n  Of the $1.5 billion Congress appropriated last year to fund grants to \nthe States, $650 million has been distributed to all 50 states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and \nAmerican Samoa. I thank my colleagues for their support during the FY03 \nappropriations process, particularly Senator Stevens, Chair of the \nAppropriations Committee and Senator Byrd, the Ranking Member, for \nproviding this substantial down-payment on our commitment to the \nStates.\n  But we now know that the FY03 appropriation will not provide \nsufficient funds for the States to fully implement their State plans \nand meet the new requirements of the law. And the shortfall in the \nfirst critical year of funding under HAVA is only compounded by the \nadditional shortfall of $500 million in the bill before the Senate \ntoday.\n\n  Given the dire financial budget constraints faced by our states and \ncounties, the total shortfall of over just over $1 billion in promised \nFederal support creates an unfunded mandate that is both unfair and \nunnecessary and\n\n[[Page S13108]]\n\nthreatens to undermine the very reforms that were adopted last year.\n  According to the National Governors Association, the current \nfinancial health of state and local governments was at its lowest point \nsince World War II last year and has worsened in the past 10 months. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, States have \nstruggled to close deficits that have totaled approximately $190 \nbillion over the past three years and the best estimate at this time is \nthat they will face deficits of more than $40 billion in fiscal year \n2005.\n  And the counties are in no better economic situation than the States. \nAccording to the National Association of Counties, nearly 72 percent of \ncounties are facing budget shortfalls and 56 percent of counties are \nfacing reductions in State funding for State-mandated programs. While \ncounties are struggling to deal with the revenue reductions, the demand \nfor county-provided services continues to rise.\n  State and local governments are willing and anxious to implement the \nnew requirements; they simply cannot go it alone. And that was the \nhistoric message of the Help America Vote Act: the Federal Government \nwill step up to our responsibility to be a full partner in funding \nFederal election reforms.\n  Full Federal funding for HAVA is crucial to ensuring that the reforms \nthat Congress overwhelmingly approved, on a broad bipartisan basis, and \nthe President endorsed with his signature, are implemented. The very \nintegrity of our elections, and consequently our democracy, hangs in \nthe balance.\n  Full funding of HAVA is critical to our national credibility for \nfairness and accuracy in Federal elections. It is fundamental to the \nintegrity of our democratic process. This amendment not only fulfils \nout commitment to date, it assures that the very reforms Congress \nenacted last year will actually be implemented.\n  This effort is overwhelming supported by a bipartisan and powerful \ncoalition of State and local election officials, in conjunction with \nall the major civil rights, disability, language minority, and other \nvoter interest groups in the United States. I thank each and every one \nof them for their strong support in passing HAVA and their continuing \ncommitment to see that Congress makes good on its promise to be a full \npartner in Federal elections by fully funding the provisions of HAVA. I \nask unanimous consent that a letter from the Coalition be included in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  No civil right is more fundamental to our democracy than the right to \nvote and no need for Federal funding is more essential to securing that \ndemocracy than is the commitment made by this body to ensure the \nintegrity and accuracy of our Federal elections.\n  I thank my colleagues for their continuing support of this effort and \nurge my colleagues to fulfill our commitment of last year to ensure the \nintegrity of our Federal elections and the very foundation of our \ndemocracy by supporting this bipartisan amendment to fully fund the \nHelp America Vote Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a letter supporting \nthis amendment in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMake Election Reform a Reality--Support the Dodd-McConnell Amendment to \n                               H.R. 2989\n\n                                                 October 23, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned organizations, strongly \n     urge you to support an amendment to be offered by Senators \n     Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to \n     increase funding for the Help America Vote Act (P.L. 107-252) \n     (``HAVA'') in H.R. 2989, the FY 2004 Treasury-Transportation \n     Appropriations bill. The Dodd-McConnell amendment will \n     increase the level of HAVA funding in that bill from $500 \n     million to $1.5 billion. We ask that you vote in favor of the \n     amendment and vote against any Budget Act point of order that \n     may be raised.\n       The Help America Vote Act was enacted with overwhelming \n     bipartisan support in order to prevent the many problems of \n     the 2000 election from ever happening again. Among its many \n     reforms, it places significant mandates upon states and \n     localities to replace outdated voting equipment, create \n     statewide voter registration lists and provide provisional \n     ballots to ensure that eligible voters are not turned away, \n     and make it easier for people with disabilities to cast \n     private, independent ballots.\n       To help pay for these reforms, HAVA authorizes a total of \n     $3.9 billion over three fiscal years, including $2.16 billion \n     for FY03 and $1.045 billion for FY04. To date, however, the \n     actual funding of HAVA has been woefully inadequate. So far, \n     only $1.5 billion of FY03 funding has been appropriated, and \n     $830 million of that amount has yet to reach the states \n     because the President has nominated and the Senate has not \n     confirmed the members of the new Election Assistance \n     Commission. Additionally, only $500 million is currently \n     included in pending FY04 appropriations; once again, this is \n     a sum that falls well below what is needed for successful \n     implementation of HAVA. States and localities were assured by \n     Congress that this new law would not evolve into a set of \n     unfunded federal mandates. It is now time for Congress to \n     honor its commitment to the states and to the American public \n     at large.\n       Given the difficult fiscal circumstances facing state and \n     local governments, immediate and full funding of HAVA is now \n     needed in order to make essential progress before Election \n     Day in 2004. Without the strong leadership that HAVA promised \n     at the federal level, states and local governments simply do \n     not have the ability to complete implementation of the \n     important reforms that they are now required to make.\n       No civil right is more fundamental to America's democracy \n     than the right to vote. As our nation spends billions of \n     dollars helping to promote democracies abroad, Congress \n     simply should not allow doubts about the legitimacy of our \n     electoral processes continue to linger here at home.\n       We thank you for your support of funding for the ``Help \n     America Vote Act,'' and we look forward to working with you \n     on this critical issue.

Again, my colleagues from Kentucky and Missouri and I would \nprefer to have some other way we could do this, but if we don't get it \ndone now, it is going to be very difficult for us to meet these \nobligations at all. This additional amount in fiscal year 2004 will get \nus back on track and allow us to complete this process and to see the \nelection cycle work in a way that all of us would be proud to see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S13109]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today finding myself in a very \nunusual situation. As an ardent supporter of the budget resolution and \nenforcing the axiom of ``live within your means,'' I am very much \nopposed to blowing the budget caps, except under the rarest of \ncircumstances. This is just such a circumstance.\n  At a time in which the United States is the key to developing a \ndemocracy in Iraq, this amendment ensures our democracy at home. While \nthe United States is leading the repair of a country mired in \ncorruption and suppression, this amendment provides the support to \nensure the franchise of all Americans, and to combat the dissolution of \nthat franchise.\n  As all my colleagues heard me say many a time, everyone who is \neligible to vote, should vote and have their vote count, but they \nshould do so only once. This amendment provides an additional $1 \nbillion to implement the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The \nTransportation-Treasury appropriations bill as drafted sets aside $500 \nmillion for election improvement grants. This amount, when added to the \nfiscal year 2003 appropriation, falls $1 billion short of our \ncommitment. This amendment fills that gap.\n  In enacting election reform last year, we all knew it would come at a \nsignificant financial cost and we all have heard repeatedly from State \nand local officials about the importance of full funding. The \nadditional funds provided in this amendment will be used by States and \nlocalities to meet requirements which have a 2004 implementation date \nand continue their work on those with a 2006 date.\n  As a refresher to all my colleagues, the election reform legislation \nwe passed last year protects the sanctity and security of the votes of \nall Americans in the following ways: Provisional ballots for all voters \nwhich are later verified for eligibility so no one is turned away from \nthe polls; statewide databases to include information from registrants \nto ensure accurate and up to date lists of legally registered and \neligible voters; mail-in voter registration procedures to include \npositive identification of not only the eligibility of the registrant, \nbut the existence of that registrant; update and improvement of voting \nsystems to achieve ease, access and security; and increased poll worker \ntraining, voter information and overall modernization of the entire \nvoting process.\n  One year ago next Wednesday marks the 1-year anniversary of the \nenactment of election reform legislation. Since that date, States and \nlocalities have been working tirelessly to meet the standards the \nFederal Government placed upon them. With the 2004 elections right \naround the corner, it is important we provide the necessary resources \nfor full implementation of these important standards.\n  Once again, I commend both the Budget chairman and the Appropriations \nchairman who have been outstanding throughout the year, and I have been \na stalwart supporter of their efforts. This, however, is that very rare \ninstance which I believe warrants providing funding above that provided \nin the budget.\n  Win or lose on this amendment, we must honor our commitment to \nfinancially partner with the States to improve our elections process.\n  As I said, I find myself in an extremely awkward position. I support \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. I support the budget resolution. \nI support the great work that he has done in holding us to the budget \nresolution as we move along. And I wouldn't be in favor of waiving the \nbudget but for an extraordinary circumstance.\n  The cold hard reality is this: When we passed the election reform \nbill a year ago this month, we promised the American people that in the \nfall of 2004, we would have the mechanisms in place to dramatically \nimprove the election system, including having the antifraud provisions \nthat the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, and I fought so diligently \nfor, that guarantees that every American has a right to vote but, as \nSenator Bond frequently put it, votes only once.\n  None of those provisions will go into place unless the amendment \nSenator Dodd is offering is approved. I can tell you that everybody \nseems to be in favor of this, but nobody has been able to figure a way \nto get it done. I spent the afternoon talking to people in the \nadministration who want to see it done, talking to the people in the \nHouse of Representatives right at the top who want to see it done, \npeople on that side of the aisle who want to see it done, and people on \nthis side of the aisle, but nobody is showing a clear path to how you \nget it done.\n  I think I am safe to say, on behalf of the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Missouri, we are here to offer this amendment to \ndemonstrate, we hope, that a significant percentage of the Senate wants \nto see, at the end of the appropriations process, this money found to \nguarantee that we dramatically improve our election process, not \nsometime in the far distant future but next November.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond, Senator Hatch, Senator \nRoberts, and Senator Burns be added as cosponsors to the Dodd-McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know Senator Bond would like to speak as well. We \nare anxious to move ahead, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut has introduced \na very important amendment that deserves the support of this body.\n  Events of the 2000 election in my home State and elsewhere pointed \nout that there are serious flaws in our election system that invite \nmischief and confusion. But last year, in a near unanimous vote, this \nbody passed important legislation that will make it easier for \nAmericans to vote and harder for those who would do such a thing, to \ncheat. The legislation offers a tremendous opportunity to modernize our \nelection system, improve election technology and help State and local \nofficials manage elections better. Once this legislation is in full \neffect, we will see a dramatic improvement in the reliability and \nintegrity of elections. But funding is essential to move forward on the \nkey aspects of this bill. With the funding, we can take large steps \nforward before the upcoming election.\n  So far, we have funded a significant downpayment on implementation of \nthis law. The chairman has included a generous sum in this bill, and I \nthank him for his attention to the issue. We are here today to ensure \nthat we are on target with the funding level and funds are flowing in \nadvance of the 2004 election; we can have an impact on this election, \nmove rapidly towards complete implementation and put the problems we \nexperienced behind us for future elections.\n  I will take a minute to remind my colleagues of some of the more \nimportant components of this bill. First, this funding will go toward \nensuring that every State has a modern, computerized statewide voter \nregistration system. This is perhaps one of the most important aspects \nof this bill and one provision that cannot be implemented without \nfunding.\n  Surprisingly, much of voter registration has missed out on the rapid \nadvances in technology. In many States and jurisdictions they are still \npaper records. Compounded by Motor Voter's overly broad restrictions on \nremoving names from lists, too many voting lists around the country \nhave become clogged with fake names or names that should simply no \nlonger be there. The result is inaccurate, unreliable, and unmanageable \nvoter registration lists. As my colleagues and I learned while working \non this bill, voter registration lists are the most basic element of \nany well-run election, and their accuracy is essential if elections are \nto be honest and voters are to have confidence in the outcome.\n  How bad are these lists? When we looked into this issue while working \non this bill, West Virginia's Mingo and Lincoln Counties both had more \nregistered voters than living people. Allegheny County, PA, had 18 \nmunicipalities with more registered voters than voting-age adults. The \nState of Alaska had 502,968 on the voter rolls, though census figures \nshow only 437,000 Alaskans of voting age.\n  In Missouri we have found individuals who are registered at three, \nfour, and even five different locations across the State--not to \nmention those that are registered twice in the same jurisdiction. At \none point in the city of St.\n\n[[Page S13110]]\n\nLouis, we had 240,000 registered voters but only 200,000 people of \nvoting age.\n  These are the problems that are a serious threat to the confidence \npeople have that their vote will be counted and that the outcome of the \nelection will be honest.\n  This bill also includes a requirement that voters using the ``by \nmail'' registration offered in Motor Voter will now have to identify \nthemselves before casting a vote. How did all those names get on the \nlists? As some may remember from our discussions last fall, we even \ndiscovered the odd circumstances of voter rolls including the names of \ncanines. How did this happen--because mail registration was available \nand could be used to anonymously put names on voter lists. Those same \nStates that were required to accept registrations through the mail were \nalso prohibited from authenticating those registrations. The election \nreform bill corrects that problem by requiring those who exercise their \nright to register by mail to provide some identification prior to \nvoting. As previously stated, this contributed greatly to the troubled \nshape of voter rolls and the administration of elections. This bill \nfixes this, and we need to step up and ensure it is fully implemented.\n  This bill addresses a number of important issues, including dealing \nwith judicial orders affecting polling place hours, providing \nprovisional voting for those who have their names removed from voting \nrolls because of administrative error and ensuring that voting \nequipment have advanced audit trails to prevent manipulation of votes \nat the polling places. States will also be issuing identification \nnumbers to registered voters to track voters and will be collecting \ninformation to ensure that voters are citizens and of proper \neligibility status.\n  To summarize, the bill contains significant advances that will \ngreatly enhance integrity and administration. It is important that \nthese and all the provisions in this bill are fully implemented--the \nsooner the better. So thanks again to Senators Dodd and McConnell for \ntheir work and help pushing this bill and its funding forward. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  As has been stated by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, we had a very long and difficult process over better \nthan 18 months to try to pull together a truly significant piece of \nlegislation that would, in fact, make it easier to vote and tougher to \ncheat. A lot of people had lots of questions about the 2000 election. I \nhappened to think that from my own personal experience, the fraudulent \nparts of that election were of extreme concern. And it is my view and \nunderstanding that in order for us to ensure, No. 1, that we have the \nvoting equipment available for the 2004 Presidential election, and that \nwe have the antifraud provisions in effect for the 2004 election, we \nneed to appropriate this money.\n  We made the commitment. It is a question of ``pay me now or pay me \nlater.'' Frankly, I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to \nsay: Let's pay now rather than pay later. You can ask questions about \nhow quickly the money is spent but, frankly, in order to trigger the \nantifraud provisions, we have to get the money now.\n  In many States around the country, Motor Voter has led to an amazing \nelectoral turnout. People send in a postcard and say ``register me,'' \nor register whatever name is signed. There is no authentication \nrequired. States were even prevented from authenticating it. When you \nlook at the list, West Virginia's Mingo and Lincoln Counties had more \nregistered voters than living people, adults and children. Allegheny \nCounty, PA, had 18 municipalities with more registered voters than \nvoting age adults. The State of Alaska had 503,000 on the voter rolls, \nthough the census figures only show 437,000 Alaskans. In Missouri, we \nfound some truly amazing things--three, four, even five different voter \nregistrations by the same individual, some two or more times in the \nsame jurisdiction; at one point the city of St. Louis, 240,000 \nregistered voters but only 200,000 people of voting age. That is a heck \nof a trick. We found out when, fortunately, a very aggressive media \nwent out and checked on it. We found vacant lots with people \nregistered. We found 10, 15, 20 people registered from one location. In \na subsequent election, a very popular alderman from the city of St. \nLouis re-registered to vote on the 10th anniversary of his death. That \nis a wonderful statement of theological implications, but it does not \ndo much for political science.\n  Of course, many on this Senate floor were tired of seeing the picture \nof my favorite St. Louis voter, Ritzy Mekler, the 13-year-old cocker \nspaniel who was registered.\n  We have to stop that. The way we do it is to make all of the \nprovisions of this bill effective for the very important 2004 \nelections.\n  I thank Senators Dodd and McConnell. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the events of the last Presidential \nelection highlighted the importance of election reform and the need to \nreplace antiquated and faulty voting machines. The Help America Vote \nAct, HAVA, was enacted last year to address these issues and to \nestablish new minimum requirements that all States must meet in the \nconduct of Federal elections. My home State of Washington is struggling \nwith implementing and paying for the requirements of HAVA due to our \nheavy reliance on vote-by-mail ballots.\n  Last year, the bill included $1.5 billion for election reform, but \nthat funding was not part of the subcommittee's initial allocation. The \nfull committee provided this funding in addition to our subcommittee \nallocation.\n  I am in agreement that the $1.5 billion is necessary and should be \nprovided for election reform. But we do not have the available funding \nfor that purpose in our bill, so it will be necessary to waive the \nBudget Act. During consideration of the budget resolution, I was not \nable to vote for election reform funding due to the competing needs of \nthe agencies under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. So I am \ncomfortable with the amendment offered by Senator Dodd, which waives \nthe Budget Act for this important purpose.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I truly wish that I did not have to address \nthis body on this topic. Last February, I stood before this body and \nurged my colleagues to ensure the Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA, \ncontained adequate funding, assuring the States that they will have the \nnecessary resources to comply with the mandates contained in the new \nlaw.\n  In fact, the Senate adopted a Sense of the Senate amendment to \nreinforce our commitment to fund this act fully so that States and \nlocalities would not be hurt by yet another unfunded mandate. Our vote \ntoday should reflect that commitment.\n  As this body debated HAVA in February of 2002. I asked this pointed \nquestion: ``What if a future Congress fails to provide adequate funding \nfor this legislation?'' Well, here we are just one Congress later and \nour States and localities--who were then experiencing budget shortfalls \nin early 2002 and are now facing budget crises--are now forced to make \nextremely difficult choices. We in Congress have fallen woefully short \nin delivering on our promise to fully fund the mandated portions of the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I cannot tell you how many individuals in Utah have \ncome up to me and expressed their great displeasure at the lack of \nfunding for the HAVA law. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nthe cost of HAVA at $3 billion. That is billion with a ``B.''\n  Let us look at the hard realities. Is it ethical for us, at a time \nwhen the majority of our States are facing serious financial \ndifficulties, when some, such as my home State of Utah are cutting off \nhealth care benefits to children and closing prisons, to even suggest \nthey foot the entire bill for these new mandates? I think not.\n  In this case, I'm sorry to have been correct. But, it is one Congress \nlater and we are exactly where I warned that we would be. For the good \nof the States and the voters, we need to make available the resources \nnecessary to fully implement HAVA.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember your commitment to your State and \nvote in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I congratulate Senator Shelby for \nhis management of this bill. This is an appropriations bill. The budget \nauthority\n\n[[Page S13111]]\n\nof this bill is actually less than last year's level. And the outlays \nunder this bill, as far as the outlays that are controlled, grew by 3.6 \npercent. So it is within the budget. It is within the budget that we \nhave passed, and it is also within the budget agreement that the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee made with the President.\n  This amendment is not. This amendment does bust the budget. This \namendment does have a budget point of order that lies against it. But \nit also is not necessary. I heard my colleague say it is necessary. Let \nme state a different opinion than that.\n  In last year's appropriations bill, we appropriated $1.5 billion for \nelection assistance. There is $833 million of that that has not been \nused. As a matter of fact, there is an election assistance commission \nthat was formed under that legislation. The commissioners haven't even \nbeen appointed or confirmed. I understand they are going to be soon. I \nheard my colleague from Missouri say: We can't take the enforcement \nprovisions unless we get this money. That is not correct. They need the \ncommission. The commission hasn't been confirmed. I am not sure; maybe \nthat is because the names weren't submitted. Maybe they were not \nconfirmed because of a little disagreement between Democrats and \nRepublicans. We have had trouble confirming some people this year. But \nI understand they are going to. I think that is good.\n  The facts are, there is $833 million of 2003 money that has not been \nspent. In the 2004 appropriations bill, there is $500 million that is \nin the bill. That is a total of $1.3 billion for this purpose that is \navailable to be spent as soon as the appropriations bill is passed.\n  How much did the administration request? The administration requested \n$500 million. They requested $500 million which is in the bill. So by \nthe time we pass this bill, there will be $1.3 billion to be spent. I \nwould venture to say the States couldn't spend another billion if we \ntried. I wouldn't be surprised if they can't spend $1.3 billion in the \nnext 12 months. They have only been able to spend less than $800 \nmillion this year. So now we want to increase that and make it $2.3 \nbillion that they are going to spend in the next 12 months. I don't \nthink they can do it. Certainly, it would be busting the budget.\n  Sometimes we have things we would like to do, but we can't do because \nwe have fiscal constraints.\n  We have very large deficits and they are going to get larger if we \ncome up and say, I am sorry, but, yes, there is a good cause here; and \neven though elections have always been basically administered and paid \nfor by the States, we would love to have the Federal Government assume \nall the costs and throw out billions of dollars in the process. We have \nbeen very generous with $1.5 billion last year, $500 million this year, \nand $831 million yet to be spent. I think we have ample money and every \nreason to sustain the budget point of order that will soon be raised by \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Oklahoma in \nopposing this amendment. No one wants to see fraud or abuse in the \ndemocratic process. The Senator from Missouri talked about some pretty \negregious examples, and it is not necessarily an easy amendment to \noppose. But there is a lot of funding in the pipeline that is equally \nimportant, maybe more important.\n  This busts the budget, and this is subject to a point of order. I \nthink we have to exercise restraint, discipline, and focus when we are \ndealing with budget issues. If the funds are a priority, we should find \na way to provide the support and funding within the constraints of the \nbudget resolution. But we cannot come to the floor with amendments for \ninitiatives that sound very worthwhile but violate the budget \nresolution and take us over the budget limits and caps, which will \ncontinue to increase the deficit.\n  So I think we need to stay focused on that resolution and exercise \nsome fiscal discipline. I appreciate the concerns in a place such as \nSt. Louis, where cocker spaniels are voting, but I think we can address \nthat with funding already in the pipeline. I hope the States are taking \nreal action to address those kinds of situations of fraud and abuse. I \nwill support my colleague from Oklahoma in opposing this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague. \nLet me just say that this amendment is providing for the number of \ndemands being made on the States. The Senator from Missouri points out \nwhat has to be done by the next calendar year, and, just a few weeks \nfrom now, on January 13, the Federal primary season, and State and \nlocals are up against the requirements. We are going to get the \nnominees to the Election Assistance Commission confirmed, but this \nkeeps us on track with the funding. We won't need to come back to this \nagain for another year, but this has to be done now.\n  We authorized over $3.8 billion for this bill over three fiscal \nyears. This will get us on track for FY03 and FY04 so the States can \ncomplete the job. As the Senators have said, this is not our preferred \nmethod for providing full funding. Everybody agrees we have to get it \ndone. Contrary to what my friend from Oklahoma says, if we don't get it \ndone now, it will make it that much more difficult to accomplish these \ngoals and it will create huge problems. I will not go through the \nlitany, but I hope my colleagues, when the point of order is made--and \nI will offer a waiver of that point of order--will support the States \non this. I don't want to take much more time. The chairman has other \nobligations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a couple of points. The chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, is certainly doing his job, \nand I understand his concern. But I have just a couple of observations.\n  The Commissioners of the new Election Administration Commission have \ntheir hearing next Tuesday. They will be confirmed before we leave this \nfall. This money can and will be spent. It all goes out by formula, all \nacross America--directly out by formula. It doesn't require them to use \nsome discretion on it. It goes out directly by formula, and it will be \nspent because this is a Federal mandate. We are mandating that this \nmoney be spent for the reasons specified in the bill.\n  If you are interested in having, to the maximum extent, an honest \nelection next year, then we need to provide adequate funding early in \nthe year because the election is 13 months away, so that these mandates \ncan be carried out in time to guarantee that we have next fall, to the \nmaximum number extent possible, an honest election.\n  It is because of these extraordinary circumstances I find myself in a \nposition I would not normally be in, which is supporting waiving the \nBudget Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am tempted to remark about my friend \nfrom Missouri saying there are only 477,000 Alaskans, but I will let \nthat go.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator will yield, I offer my sincere apologies. \nWould he accept it if I said ``of voting age'' and correct that \nstatement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It comes closer. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, up my way there is a saying: The promise made is the \ndebt unpaid.\n  This year, when I went to the President to increase the moneys \nallowed for education and a series of other items in this total budget, \nafter a serious discussion, he agreed. I told him if he would make \nthose changes, I would promise him I would see to it that there would \nbe no funds appropriated in the regular process in excess of the \namounts he requested. He has not requested this additional amount.\n  Therefore, the pending amendment No. 1928 offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, increases the spending by $1 billion. This \nadditional spending would cause the underlying bill to exceed the \nsubcommittee section 302(b) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Parenthetically, I also say that, before we recess this year, we will \nhave to provide this money and the Appropriations Committee will find \nsome way to find it within the budget.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional\n\n[[Page S13112]]\n\nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID (after having voted in the affirmative). Mr. President, I \nhave a pair with the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. If he were \npresent and voting, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, would vote \n``nay.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote ``yea.'' I, \ntherefore, withhold my vote.\n  Mr. McConnell. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Ensign) would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nwould each vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to describe this proposal \nconcerning the administration's request to proceed with the lease of \n100 aircraft.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the past 2 years, this issue has had a \nrather contentious but serious debate--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I apologize, but the Senate is still not \nin order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the past few years there has been a \nsort of contentious but serious and conscientious debate within the \nadministration and the Congress as to how to resolve the problem for \nthe Department of the Air Force.\n  What I regard as a compromise to the pending understanding would be \nthe following: First, according to my sources, in many ways this has \nbeen corroborated by the various Departments which worked with us. It \nwould provide up to perhaps $4 billion in savings. It would give prompt \ndelivery of 100 new tanker aircraft. It would put this program back \ninto the traditional procurement process, put this program back into \nthe traditional budget process, put this program back into the \ntraditional authorization process, and provide the Air Force with \ntitle--underline ``title''--ownership of at least 80 of the aircraft \nunder this contract.\n  Pursuant to section 133 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2003, which established guidelines for the congressional \nreview of any tanker lease, the Air Force, on July 10, submitted to the \nCongressional Defense Committees a new start notification of at least \n100 aircraft.\n  Under section 133 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003, all four \ncommittees must act favorably on this notification for the lease to \nproceed. Our Senate Armed Services Committee has yet to act. We \nconducted extensive oversight of this tanker lease program, holding a \nhearing on September 4.\n  During this hearing, I first put out my thoughts for public comment \non the idea of leasing at that time up to 25 aircraft and purchasing \nthe remainder. I have now modified that to 20 and 80.\n  Subsequent to this hearing, the committee explored numerous options \nand requested additional studies from the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe General Accounting Office and the Air Force.\n\n[[Page S13113]]\n\n  I commend the members of my committee for their careful review of \nthis matter and coming up with this proposal despite the enormous \npressure from many sectors to simply adopt the new start reprogramming \nrequest.\n  The proposal amendment to be included in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2004 would provide for the approval \nof a lease for 20 aircraft and authorize a multiyear procurement \nprogram for the remaining 80 aircraft. Thus, the Air Force would still \nobtain 100 tankers, in keeping with the goal of the Administration's \ntanker lease proposal.\n  This approach allows the tanker program to get started with no lease \npayments required until fiscal year 2006 and no purchase payments \nrequired until fiscal year 2008, while still permitting the same \nschedule of deliveries as in the currently negotiated lease contract.\n  This proposal would also authorize the use of incremental funding for \nthe 80 aircraft purchase. Incremental funding is an approach that \nshould not be taken lightly by Congress, but it is one that has been \nused for other weapon systems acquisitions where there was a critical \nneed.\n  I plan to continue to consult with all interested parties and work to \nget an agreement to include this proposal in the national defense \nauthorization conference report. That action would provide the Air \nForce the option to immediately execute the program and being \nproduction of these 100 aircraft.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n     SEC.  . PROCUREMENT OF TANKER AIRCRAFT.  \n\n       (a) Leased Aircraft.--The Secretary of the Air Force may \n     lease up to a total of 20 aircraft under the multiyear \n     aircraft lease pilot program referred to in subsection (d).\n       (b) Multiyear Procurement Authority.--(1) Beginning with \n     the fiscal year 2004 program year, the Secretary of the Air \n     Force may, in accordance with section 2306b of title 10, \n     United States Code, enter into a multiyear contract for the \n     purchase of aircraft necessary to meet the requirements of \n     the Air Force for which leasing of aircraft is provided for \n     under the multiyear aircraft lease pilot program but for \n     which the number of aircraft leased under the authority of \n     subsection (a) is insufficient.\n       (2) The total number of aircraft purchased through a \n     multiyear contract under this subsection may not exceed 80.\n       (3) Notwithstanding subsection (k) of section 2306b of \n     title 10, United States Code, a contract under this section \n     may be for any period not in excess of 10 program years.\n       (4) A multiyear contract under this subsection may be \n     initiated or continued for any fiscal year for which \n     sufficient funds are available to pay the costs of such \n     contract for that fiscal year, without regard to whether \n     funds are available to pay the costs of such contract for any \n     subsequent fiscal year. Such contract shall provide, however, \n     that performance under the contract during the subsequent \n     year or years of the contract is contingent upon the \n     appropriation of funds and shall also provide for a \n     cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such \n     appropriations are not made.\n       (c) Study of Long-Term Aircraft Maintenance and Training \n     Requirements.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall carry out a \n     study to identify alternative means for meeting the long-term \n     requirements of the Air Force for--\n       (A) the maintenance of aircraft leased under the multiyear \n     aircraft lease pilot program or purchased under subsection \n     (b); and\n       (B) training in the operation of aircraft leased under the \n     multiyear aircraft lease pilot program or purchased under \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Not later than April 1, 2004, the Secretary shall \n     submit a report on the results of the study to the \n     congressional defense committees.\n       (d) Multiyear Aircraft Lease Pilot Program Defined.--In \n     this section, the term ``multiyear aircraft lease pilot \n     program'' means the program authorized under section 8159 of \n     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002 (division \n     A of Public Law 101-117; 115 Stat. 2284).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee for his extraordinary effort in putting together a \nproposal which I am pleased to support. For the reasons he gave, it is \na much more honest approach to the acquisition of these tankers. There \nis no use pretending this is a lease when, in fact, it is intended to \nbe a sale. It has been the intent of the Air Force they purchase it. It \nhas been wrapped in the clothing of a lease but, in fact, the clear \nintention here and the only commonsense outcome is that it be a \npurchase, not a lease, because under the lease agreement, 80 percent of \nthe cost of these planes would be laid out by the Air Force while only \n20 percent of their useful life would have been actually used by the \ntime the lease was over. It is obvious the intention and the \ncommonsense approach was this is intended to be a purchase and it ought \nto be called what it is.\n  The proposal I am pleased to join in sponsoring is much more honest \nin terms of the intention. It also complies much more closely to what \nthe normal budgeting procedures are around here. We do not want this to \nbe a precedent for leasing. That distorts the entire budget process \nbecause it looks like it is free, in essence, for a couple years. These \nare not free. There is a huge cost. If we can reduce the real cost, as \nthis proposal does, by acknowledging that it is really a purchase, by \nauthorizing a multiyear acquisition, which is what we do after the \nleasing of the first 20, it seems to me we will save taxpayer dollars, \nwe will commit to actually acquiring these tankers, but we will force \nthe Air Force to be straightforward in the use of this country's \nresources. They are not going to be able to have something which looks \nfree for a couple years because there is a small lease payment and then \nhave this huge obligation in the outyears.\n  At the same time presumably they will want to buy more and more \ntankers. We address the long-term need to acquire tankers. We do it in \na more straightforward way. We save money for the taxpayers.\n  I commend the two Senators from Washington, Senators Murray and \nCantwell, for being so persistent in moving this program forward. This \noutcome would not have happened without them. I also acknowledge \nSenator McCain's role. He has insisted from the beginning this be \nreviewed in an honest way by the General Accounting Office, by the \nCongressional Budget Office, and by the Armed Services Committee. It \nhas been his insistence we deal with this honestly. That has led to \nthis proposal. I have not had a chance to speak with Senator McCain \npersonally or directly so I don't know what his reaction is. I hope it \nmeets his expectations and his needs. I do acknowledge the fact that \nSenator McCain is always playing it straight, looks at things straight, \nand wants an honest addressing of an issue. That is what we are now \ndoing.\n  To the two Senators from Washington and the Senator from Arizona, I \nexpress my thanks, and particularly the chairman of the committee, who \nput together a proposal which I am pleased to join.\n  The members of the committee have spent considerable effort in \nreviewing the basic Air Force proposal to sign a long-term lease for \n100 KC-767 tanker aircraft. Based on my review of the issues \nsurrounding this proposal, I support Senator Warner's intention to \noffer the proposal he outlined in the conference on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004.\n  Let me also recognize the strong and positive role that the two \nSenators from Washington, Senator Patty Murray and Senator Maria \nCantwell, have played in moving the leasing program forward. I know \npersonally that they have spent many hours understanding the current \nAir Force tanker situation, and in working with other members of the \nSenate in moving this program forward.\n  The proposal to go forward with a lease of 20 aircraft now and \nproviding, up-front, multiyear procurement authority for the Air Force \nto buy the remaining 80 tankers should help address several concerns.\n  First, it will help address our long-term need to replace the Air \nForce's existing fleet of tanker aircraft. We have spent many hours \ntrying to understand the severity of the corrosion problem within the \nKC-135 tanker fleet. While the Air Force has not made a convincing case \nthat there is an imminent risk to the fleet, the Air Force does have a \nlong-term requirement for tankers that will ultimately require the \nfielding of replacement aircraft. For this reason, I believe that it is \nprudent to move forward now with an orderly replacement program.\n  Second, our approach would give the Air Force multiyear contracting \nauthority now. This will reduce the acquisition cost for aircraft, \nsignificantly reducing the price to be paid by the\n\n[[Page S13114]]\n\ntaxpayers. I believe that providing such multiyear contracting \nauthority is a responsible step to take in the case of a program like \nthis, which involves very little new development and very little \nprogram risk.\n  Third, the proposal that Senator Warner and I are putting forward \nwould address very real concerns with the lease proposal presented by \nthe Air Force. I believe that what the Congressional Budget Office said \nis correct: this is not a real lease, but a purchase. The Air Force, \nnot Boeing, will control the special purpose entity that borrows funds \nfor this program. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the Air Force \nintends to buy these aircraft at the end of the lease. We simply cannot \nafford to pay 90 percent of the value of the aircraft for less than 20 \npercent of the useful life.\n  Finally, our proposal would take a far more responsible approach to \nfederal budget issues than the proposal put forward by the Air Force. \nThe Air Force proposal would have pushed the cost of the tanker \naircraft off until the next decade, creating a huge funding program for \nthe next generation of Air Force leaders. Our approach would move the \ncosts forward, requiring the Department of Defense to provide almost $5 \nbillion more in current Future Years Defense Program. The Air Force \ncase that it is urgent to replace these tanker aircraft will be a lot \nmore convincing, if the Department of Defense is willing to put money \nup for the problem earlier, rather than taking a free ride on the back \nof future taxpayers and defense needs.\n  I hope that we will get agreement from the House conferees on the \ndefense authorization on including this provision in the final \nauthorization act. I believe that it will help address a significant \nproblem identified by the Air Force, while acting more responsibly in \npreventing postponing too much funding to later years.\n  I thank Chairman Warner for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend my colleague from Michigan. We have been \nworking together some 25 years on this committee now. Last night we \nstudied the final language I crafted with the help of others and my \ncolleague decided to join us.\n  Senator McCain wishes to follow the two distinguished colleagues from \nWashington. Again, I commend the Senator. We met last night on the \nfloor. We talked about it. We worked into the evening with our staff. I \nvery much appreciate the expressions the Senator is about to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, more than 2 years ago the Senate began a \njourney to help improve our military readiness by replacing the \noutdated Air Force asset with 100 new Boeing 767 air refueling tankers. \nIn spite of the best efforts of the Air Force to maintain that tanker \nfleet, those planes are outdated and cost billions of dollar to \nmaintain.\n  In the 2 years that have passed since we first began discussing \nreplacing our Nation's tanker fleet, the KC-135s have grown older, more \ncorroded, and less safe. It is a testament to the resourcefulness of \nthe flying men and women of our Air Force that these planes are still \nflying as well as they are.\n  Over the past several days, Senator Cantwell and I have engaged in a \nvery productive series of meetings and discussions with Chairman \nStevens and Chairman Warner, ranking Members Levin and Inouye. We were \nhere late last night, as Senator Warner indicated, and all day long \nworking with our colleagues on a way to move this forward. I am really \npleased we have worked our way through some very big issues. The \nleaders of our Senate Armed Services Committee agree we do need to \nprovide the Air Force a way to begin to recapitalize its aging tanker \nfleet with new Boeing 767s. I am proud Senator Warner and Senator Levin \nagree Boeing airframes will help our air men and women protect our \nNation and advance our security around the world.\n  I had the honor of meeting with a number of people who fly these \nplanes. I am proud we are finally working our way to bring some new \nplanes to these brave young men and women.\n  These planes are critical. They are the backbone of America's air \npower capability. The importance of replacing them cannot be \noverstated. The Warner-Levin proposal is a great step in the right \ndirection. It is finally going to allow Boeing to begin producing \nstate-of-the-art KC-767 aircraft right away with delivery of the first \nfour tankers in 2005.\n  There are outstanding issues remaining, but it is clear to me today \nthat we have a commitment finally to move forward and the Air Force is \ngoing to get the tankers it so desperately needs.\n  I commend Senator Warner, Senator Stevens, Senator Levin, Senator \nInouye, and especially my colleague in Washington, Senator Cantwell, \nwho spent a tremendous amount of time trying to work this issue through \nwith all of the details. I am proud to serve with her in the Senate. \nShe is a testament to the people who are going to be building these \nplanes and her advocacy for them, particularly over the last several \ndays.\n  I yield to my colleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am sure there is no way I can convey \nin these minutes all of the important information that needs to be \nconveyed about this issue. I will highlight a few things.\n  This debate started in 2001 and still goes strong today. The \ntestament of the many Members who were here on the floor is that we are \ntrying to move ahead and move ahead with what is a very needed product.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington and my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin, who is also interested in this issue.\n  The bottom line is we all know if we could buy these planes now and \nhave the resources, we would do that. We all know buying the planes \nsooner makes them cheaper. The issue we have been struggling with is, \nwhere are the resources and how do we make this come together in a \ntimely fashion to meet the need.\n  Senator McCain has made all of us stop and think about this issue in \nways we might not have thought. I don't think any Member wanted to or \nshould have excluded the authorizing committee from playing its normal \nrole and capacity of reviewing these projects. The fact of the matter \nis we now are 2 years into this process and we have to figure out a way \nto move forward. The Armed Services Committee is trying to do just \nthat, trying to say 100 planes should be made through either a lease or \nprocurement process as part of a contract and that we need to move \nforward soon on the start of that lease contract.\n  We are still a few days away from finally getting a product. I thank \nSenators Warner and Levin for taking this step in the process outlined \nin 2001 of the authorizing committee giving its feedback on this \noriginal proposal by Congress to have a pilot lease program.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time does this Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Virginia has \n1 minute 42 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend my two colleagues from \nWashington. While we only have 2 or 3 minutes to speak about this \nmatter, I would hate to know the number of hours that each of them have \nexpended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 5 minutes \nallocated to the Senator from----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. We have to get back to the appropriations \nsometime.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 3 \nminutes be given to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 of my 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nArizona for his generosity.\n  I compliment Senator Warner and Senator McCain and Senator Levin and \nothers. I think a purchase is so much more fiscally responsible, and it \nis such\n\n[[Page S13115]]\n\nmore honest with the budget. We are going to save billions of dollars \nby doing the purchase. The lease, in my opinion, is, frankly, not the \nright way to do it if we are going to be honest with the taxpayers and \nhonest in saving money for the system.\n  We need the airplanes. I am all in favor of moving forward with the \nairplanes. And certainly this is a much more logical deal.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  The CBO, Congressional Budget Office, certainly concurs that a \npurchase is a much more fiscally responsible method of purchasing the \nairplanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my two leaders in the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, who have worked \nso hard on this issue. I appreciate everything they have done.\n  I also thank both Senators from Washington. I know this has been a \nvery difficult process for them.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of lessons to be learned from this \nexercise. One of the lessons is--and I see the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee here on the floor--we should not start this \nkind of process with a line on an appropriations bill. It should have \ngone through the authorizing committee. There should have been hearings \nand ventilation of a $20 to $30 billion acquisition. None of this \nproblems would have arisen if we had gone through the proper \nauthorizing committee rather than the Appropriations Committee assuming \nresponsibilities which are not theirs.\n  I appreciate very much my two colleagues for asserting the authority \nof the authorizing committee where it belongs. I believe this is a good \ncompromise. I would like to see better.\n  Obviously, I thank my colleagues again, especially the Senators from \nWashington, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the \nauthorizing committee, for their hard work on this effort.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply conclude, we are here today \nbecause of the efforts of Senator McCain to bring this matter to our \nattention, and I salute him for that purpose. And I thank all.\n  I yield back my time so the distinguished chairman can move ahead \nwith the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, since I have been mentioned personally, \nlet me just say I will be happy to see the day when the Armed Services \nCommittee brings the bill to the floor, goes through the normal \nprocess, and passes a bill and provides the budget authority and the \noutlays to do it. That has been the problem. This is air we are talking \nabout now--air.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii want time to speak on his amendment to \nthis bill? How much time does the Senator want?\n  Two minutes? I yield the Senator up to 5 minutes. We are waiting for \nthe balance of the papers.\n  I say to the Senator, we have tried to clear his amendment. We have \nnot been able to clear his amendment because of a problem with \njurisdiction on the House side. But I believe he would like to explain \nhis amendment. We were willing to take it to conference, but we are \ntold that it would not survive conference because of the jurisdictional \nproblem on the House side.\n  I ask Senator Akaka, does he wish to speak at this time?\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico wish time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1939\n\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment that I filed, No. 1939, which I \nunderstand is going to be acceptable to both the managers of the bill \nand will be included with other amendments that are approved in a few \nminutes.\n  I particularly compliment Senator Snowe as the cosponsor of this \nlegislation. She has been a long-time champion of commercial air \nservice in rural areas, and I appreciate her leadership on the \namendment.\n  The amendment is very simple. In fact, both the House and the Senate \nhave passed the substance of this amendment previously in connection \nwith the FAA reauthorization legislation.\n  The amendment that we are offering, that we appreciate people \nsupporting, will preserve the Essential Air Service Program by \npreventing the Department of Transportation from implementing a new \nprogram that would require communities to pay in order to retain their \ncommercial air service. I hope the Senate will again support it.\n  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to \nensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline \nderegulation could continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, \nmany rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently hinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For \nsmall communities, commercial air service provides a critical link to \nthe national and international transportation system.\n  The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air \nservice to over 100 communities in 34 States. EAS supports an \nadditional 33 communities in Alaska. Because of increasing costs and \nthe current financial turndown in the aviation industry, particularly \namong commuter airlines, about 28 additional communities have been \nforced into the EAS program since the terrorist attacks in 2001.\n  In my State of New Mexico, five cities currently rely on EAS for \ntheir commercial air service. The communities are Clovis, Hobbs, \nCarlsbad, Alamogordo and my hometown of Silver City. In each case \ncommercial service is provided to Albuquerque, the State's largest city \nand business center.\n  Back in June, during consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, \nSenator Inhofe and I, with 13 bipartisan cosponsors, offered an \namendment that struck out a provision in that bill that would for the \nfirst time require some communities to pay to retain their commercial \nair service. I believed that arbitrary proposal would have eliminated \nscheduled air service for many rural communities that participate in \nthe Essential Air Service Program.\n  I was pleased the full Senate listened and adopted our amendment to \nthe FAA reauthorization bill. In parallel, the full House of \nRepresentatives also voted to eliminate mandatory cost sharing language \nfrom the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  Most students of Government would tell you that when a majority of \nboth Houses of Congress have voted against a particular measure, the \nconferees couldn't arbitrarily put it back in. Well they did. In \nanother example of secret House-Senate back-room dealing, the \nRepublican conferees excluded the minority members, flagrantly ignored \nthe will of the majority in the House and the Senate, and restored the \nvery cost-sharing language both Houses one month before had voted to \nreject.\n  I believe adding this extraneous and objectionable provision is an \negregious violation of the conference process. A conference report on \nH.R. 2115 was filed 3 months ago and there has been no further action \nin either House of Congress. Clearly, this was flawed process and the \nresult is an FAA conference report that can't pass either the House or \nthe Senate.\n  It is not clear how the leaders will resolve the problems with the \nFAA conference report. Last month, 16 bipartisan Senators wrote to the \nHouse and Senate conferees opposing the mandatory cost sharing for EAS \ncommunities. Thirty-five bipartisan House Members signed a similar \nletter to conferees. I ask unanimous consent that both letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13116]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2003.\n     Hon.

James Oberstar,\n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: We write out of grave concern for a provision \n     added to the Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization \n     conference report regarding the adoption of a local cost \n     share for certain Essential Air Service communities. This \n     addition to the conference report not only goes against the \n     will of both the House and the Senate, but may also have a \n     disastrous effect on many of our small rural airports. \n     Therefore, we urge the conference committee to remove this \n     language before bringing the report to the respective floors \n     for a vote.\n       The local cost share provision was removed from S. 824 by a \n     bipartisan amendment offered by 15 senators, which passed on \n     a voice vote. Likewise, a similar local cost share provision \n     was removed from H.R. 2115 by an amendment offered by \n     Representatives McHugh, Peterson (PA) and Shuster.\n       It is our understanding that negotiations are currently \n     under way to remove language from the conference report \n     regarding the privatization of air traffic controllers. This \n     provides the conference committee an excellent opportunity to \n     remove the EAS local match provision that was already \n     stricken on both the House and Senate floors and not included \n     in either bill brought to the conference committee.\n       Additionally, this provision will have untold effects on \n     many small rural communities. It is unacceptable to force \n     communities to pay up to $100,000 in a local cost share, in \n     addition to the many costs they currently incur in running a \n     small local airport.\n       We respectively request the removal of Section 408 from the \n     Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act \n     conference report before it is brought to the House and \n     Senate floors for consideration, and we look forward to \n     working with you in the future to ensure rural communities \n     continue to receive essential air service.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman; Hillary Rodham Clinton; Blanche L. \n           Lincoln; Mark Pryor; Charles Schumer; Arlen Specter; \n           Olympia Snowe; Patrick Leahy; Jim Jeffords; Tom Harkin; \n           Tom Daschle; Benjamin Nelson; Susan M.

This addition to the conference report \n     not only goes against the will of both the House and the \n     Senate, but may also have a disastrous effect on many of our \n     small rural airports. Therefore, we urge the conference \n     committee to remove this language before bringing the report \n     to the respective floors for a vote.\n       As you know, the local cost share provision was removed in \n     H.R. 2115 by an amendment offered by Representatives McHugh, \n     Peterson (PA) and Shuster, which passed by a voice vote. \n     Likewise, a similar local cost share provision was removed \n     from S. 824 by an amendment offered by Senator Bingaman.\n       It is our understanding that negotiations are currently \n     under way to remove language from the conference report \n     regarding the privatization of air traffic controllers. This \n     provides the conference committee an excellent opportunity to \n     remove the EAS local match provision that was already \n     stricken on both the House and Senate floors and not included \n     in either bill brought to the conference committee.\n       Additionally, this provision will have untold affects on \n     many small rural communities. It is unacceptable to force \n     communities to pay up to $100,000 in a local cost share, in \n     addition to the many costs they currently incur in running a \n     small local airport.\n       We respectfully request the removal of Section 408 from the \n     Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act Conference \n     Report before it is brought to the House and Senate floors \n     for consideration and we look forward to working with you in \n     the future to ensure rural communities continue to receive \n     essential air service.\n           Sincerely,\n         John E. Peterson; John McHugh; Bill Shuster; John \n           Shimkus; Barbara Cubin; Ron Paul; Frank D. Lucas; Kenny \n           C. Hulshof; Rob Bishop; Jim Gibbons; Allen Boyd; Jerry \n           Moran.\n         Chris Cannon; Marion Berry; Charles F. Bass; John Tanner; \n           Scott McInnis; Rick Renzi; Dennis A. Cardoza; Jim \n           Matheson; Ed Case; Mike Ross; Lane Evans.\n         Bernie Sanders; Tom Latham; Ron Lewis; Doug Bereuter; \n           Collin C. Peterson; Anibal Acevedo-Vila; Tom Udall; \n           Timothy Johnson; John Boozman; Heather Wilson; Jo Ann \n           Emerson; Bart Stupak.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would also like to point out that the \nPresident has not issued a veto threat on this issue.\n  All Senators know that a conference report is not amendable. I would \nhave preferred not to pursue an amendment on an appropriations bill, \nbut the conferees ignored the majority in the House and Senate once \nbefore. Put simply, this amendment is our only opportunity to undo what \nthe conferees have done.\n  Mr. President, the choice here is clear: If we do not preserve the \nEssential Air Service Program today, we could well see the end of all \ncommercial air service in rural areas. The EAS program provides vital \nresources that help link rural communities to the national and global \naviation system. Our amendment will help ensure affordable, reliable, \nand safe air service remains available in rural America. I hope all \nSenators will join us in opposing this attack on rural America.\n  Again, I appreciate the support of all Senators and the support of \nthe two managers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1936\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a number of amendments I will be \nsending to the desk individually. They have been cleared on both sides \nby the managers. First is an amendment proposed for Senator Durbin. I \nsend it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1936.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To insert a provision relating to notification information \n                     concerning pharmacy services)\n\n       On page 155, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss. I send it to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. Chambliss, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1937.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1938) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1939\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have another amendment that I send to \nthe desk on behalf of Senator Bingaman and others.\n  It has been cleared on both sides by the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Schumer, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, \n     Ms. Collins, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1939.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the obligation of funds for the establishment or \n      implementation of an EAS local participation pilot program)\n\n       On page 14, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 105. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended to \n     establish or implement a pilot program under which not more \n     than 10 designated essential air service communities located \n     in proximity to hub airports are required to assume 10 \n     percent of their essential air subsidy costs for a 4-year \n     period, commonly referred to as the EAS local participation \n     program.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nBingaman-Snowe amendment to protect the Essential Air Service, EAS, \nprogram.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of \nEAS, which provides subsidized air service to 125 small communities in \nthe country, including four in Maine--Augusta, Rockland, Bar Harbor and \nPresque Isle--that would otherwise be cut off from the Nation's air \ntransportation network. As approved in May by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, Reauthorization \nbill reauthorized and flat-funded the program for 3 years, and includes \nchanges to the program, which are drastically scaled back from what the \nadministration proposed earlier this year for EAS ``reform.'' The \nadministration had called for EAS towns to provide up to 25 percent \nmatching contributions to keep their air service.\n  The Commerce Committee bill creates a number of new programs to help \nEAS communities grow their ridership, including a marketing incentive \nprogram that would financially reward EAS towns for achieving ridership \ngoals. With regard to local cost-sharing--the centerpiece of the \nAdministration's EAS proposal--the Commerce bill would create a pilot \nprogram to allow for a 10 percent annual community match at no more \nthan 10 airports within a 100 miles of a large airport.\n  While the cost-sharing provisions in the Committee bill are much less \nstrict than the administration proposal, and could only be applied to a \nEAS community under certain specific conditions, I remain concerned \nabout the concept of requiring EAS towns--some of which are cash \nstrapped and economically depressed--from kicking in hundreds of \nthousands of dollars annually to keep their air service. For example, \nif Augusta or Rockland, ME were to be chosen for the cost-sharing pilot \nprogram, they would have to come up with more than $120,000 annually to \nretain their air service.\n  As such, during floor consideration of the FAA bill, I supported \nSenator Bingaman's amendment to strike the cost-sharing section from \nthe bill, and was pleased when it was approved unanimously by the full \nSenate. The House adopted an identical amendment offered by \nRepresentative Peterson. And I felt so strongly about this issue that \nin late July I circulated a letter to the FAA conferees signed by 15 \nother Senators expressing strong opposition to having mandatory EAS \ncost-sharing language in the final legislative package. As such, I was \nextremely disappointed when that same language found itself into the \nFAA conference report issued on July 25.\n  That is why the amendment we have offered today is necessary. While \nthe FAA bill has not been yet signed into law, I agree with my \ncolleague that we need to take out an ``insurance policy'' and ensure \nthat EAS local cost-sharing never gets off the ground.\n  The EAS program is not perfect, and Congress certainly needs to do \nall we can to keep the costs and subsidy levels associated with the \nprogram as low as possible. I look forward to working with members of \nthe Commerce Committee and the Senate on the issue, but I continue to \nbelieve that requiring cost sharing in today's economy and today's \naviation environment is clearly a wrong-headed approach. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Bingaman-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to support the Bingaman-Snowe \namendment, which would bar the Department of Transportation from using \nany funds to implement cost-sharing requirement for communities that \nreceive subsidized air service through the Essential Air Service \nProgram--EAS.\n  As ranking Democrat on the Aviation Subcommittee, I work very hard to \nimprove air service for small and rural communities. Most recently, I \nworked with Senator Lott on legislation to address this important \nissue. We introduced the Small Community and Rural Air Service \nRevitalization Act of 2003 to address the growing air services needs of \nsmall communities. The legislation became the basis for the small \ncommunity air service provisions in Senate FAA reauthorization bill and \nultimately the FAA Conference Report. The FAA Conference Report \nestablishes a series of pilot programs to help communities improve \ntheir existing air service. I strongly believe that communities need \nnew resources and tools to improve their air service options. The new \ninitiatives established in the FAA Conference Report will allow \ncommunities the ability to improve their air service choices, and give \na community a greater stake in the EAS program.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration--FAA--Conference Report includes \na provision that allows the DOT to select up to 10 communities within \n100 miles of a hub airport to pay 10 percent of the their Essential Air \nService subsidy, even though both the Senate and the House voted \nagainst imposing a cost-sharing requirement.\n  Small Community and Rural Air Service Revitalization Act of 2003 also\n\n[[Page S13118]]\n\nincluded a pilot program that would allow DOT to require a cost-share \nfor up to 10 communities within 100 miles of a hub. As I expressed in \nmy statement on the introduction of this bill, I have significant \nreservation about forcing communities to pay for a service the Federal \nGovernment promised them. I expressed my strong reservations throughout \nthe development and Senate consideration of the FAA reauthorization \nbill in this matter.\n  During Senate consideration of the FAA bill, Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Inhofe offered an amendment to strip the cost-sharing \nprovision. Senators McCain and Lott accepted the amendment without \ndebate as it was clear that a large majority of Senators did not \nsupport this provision. The House bill as passed by their \nTransportation Committee had a local match provision. The House \nstripped their cost-sharing provision as well on the floor so neither \nbill had a cost-sharing provision. Clearly, the will of Congress was \nthat the Federal Government should provide the entire subsidy. During \nthe conference negotiations on the FAA bill in which I was invited to \nparticipate, I argued against reinstating cost-sharing provisions, but \nthe majority conferees insisted on this provision.\n  The adoption of this provision will prohibit cost-sharing in the \nupcoming fiscal year. It is a short-term solution to a larger problem \nthat I hope we can ultimately address by reopening the FAA conference \nreport.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1939) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1940\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh. It has been cleared on both \nsides by the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. Akaka, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1946.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the Debt Indicator program)\n\n       On page 73, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 218. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used for the Debt Indicator \n     program announced in Internal Revenue Service Notice 99-58.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, certain tax preparers are lining their \npockets with money that should be going toward the everyday needs of \nlower income families. These preparers are taking advantage of those \nthat have sought assistance in claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, \nEITC, by successfully marketing to them to obtain refunds through \nexorbitantly priced refund anticipation loans, RALs.\n  An estimated $1.75 billion intended to assist low-income families \nwent to commercial tax preparers and affiliated national banks for tax \nassistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost refund loans in \n1999, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution. In \n2001, 40.7 percent of taxpayers who earned the EITC received their \nrefund through RALs. The States that had the highest percentage of EITC \nreturns with RALs included Mississippi, 61.5, South Carolina, 58.9, \nGeorgia, 57.6, North Carolina, 57.5, and Louisiana, 56.8.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, IRS, reduces the risk that lenders take \non RALs by providing them a Debt Indicator, DI, on all IRS e-file \nacknowledgements. The DI informs the lender whether or not an applicant \nowes Federal or State taxes, child support, student loans, or other \ngovernment obligations, and this assists the tax preparer in \nascertaining the applicant's ability to obtain their full refund so \nthat the RAL is repaid. The vast majority of refunds are remitted to \nthe preparer as prepared. Thus, interest rates for RALs that vary from \n97 percent to more than 2000 percent are not justifiable when the IRS \nlowers the risk of the loans by providing the DI service.\n  In 1995, the use of the DI was suspended because of massive fraud in \ne-filed returns with RALs. After the program was discontinued, RAL \nparticipation declined. The use of the DI was reinstated in 1999, \naccording to H Block, to ``assist with screening for electronic \nfiling fraud and is also expected to substantially reduce refund \nanticipation loan pricing.'' Although RAL prices were expected to go \ndown as a result of the reinstatement of the DI, this has not occurred. \nThe Debt Indicator should be stopped.\n  The Akaka amendment would prohibit the use of funds in H.R. 2989, the \nFiscal Year 2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Act, for the Debt Indicator program.\n  The Akaka amendment has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica and the National Consumer Law Center.\n  The DI is helping tax preparers make excessive profits of low- and \nmoderate-income taxpayers who utilize the service. If the Debt \nIndicator is removed, then the loans become riskier and the tax \npreparers may not aggressively market them among EITC filers. The IRS \nshould not be aiding efforts that take the earned benefits away from \nlow-income families and allow unscrupulous preparers to take advantage \nof low-income taxpayers.\n  RALS are extremely short-term loans that unnecessarily diminish the \nEITC. There are alternatives to speeding up refunds such as filing \nelectronically or having the refund directly deposited into a bank or \ncredit union account. Using these methods, taxpayers can receive their \nreturns in about 7 to 10 days without paying the high fees associated \nwith RALs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter and chart from \nthe National Consumer Law Center be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           National Consumer Law Center, Inc.,\n\n                                   Boston, MA, September 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The National Consumer Law Center (on \n     behalf of its low-income clients) and the Consumer Federation \n     of America write to support your amendment to H.R. 2989, \n     which would prohibit the Treasury Department from using its \n     appropriation for the Internal Revenue Service's Debt \n     Indicator program. As you know, the Debt Indicator program \n     mostly benefits refund anticipation loan (RAL) programs by \n     letting tax preparers and RAL lenders know when a tax refund \n     offset exists. Thus, IRS is abetting the making of RALs \n     through the Debt Indicator. We believe that the IRS should \n     not use tax dollars to increase the bottom line of RAL \n     lenders and major tax preparation chains, especially when \n     RALs are draining nearly 2 billion dollars from the pockets \n     of taxpayers, including EITC refunds paid out of the U.S. \n     Treasury.\n       Thus, we support your amendment to prohibit the use of \n     Treasury appropriations for the Debt Indicator program. Thank \n     you for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jean Ann Fox,\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n     Chi Chi Wu,\n       National Consumer Law Center.\n

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment Senator \nDomenici and I offered to address a regulation recently proposed by the \nOffice of Personnel Management; a regulation that is wrong-headed.\n  Congress and the executive agencies have long enjoyed a mutually \nbeneficial relationship where executive branch employees are detailed \nto congressional offices. These details typically exist for 1 to 2 \nyears.\n  As a result, the executive branch has an opportunity to have its \nemployees learn about the legislative process and oversight activities. \nLikewise, the legislative branch has an opportunity to utilize the \nexpertise of executive branch employees. Everyone benefits.\n  The regulation proposed by the Office of Personnel Management will \ninevitably ruin the benefits of this long-term practice.\n  The regulation proposed by the Office of Personnel Management for \nexample, seeks to reduce to 6 months the time that a detailee can spend \nin Congress. This is too short a time for even the most industrious of \ndetailees to understand the intricacies of the legislative process and \ncontribute to that process.\n  Moreover, this regulation attempts to limit the activities in which \nexecutive branch employees can engage while under the direct \nsupervision of a Congressional office in an effort to micro-manage from \nafar. This is unacceptable.\n  Senator Domenici and I have offered an amendment to prohibit the use \nof any funds for the implementation of\n\n[[Page S13121]]\n\nthis regulation that will severely reduce the number, availability and \nbenefit of executive branch detailees to the legislative branch to the \ndetriment of all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1963) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the votes by which \nthe previous amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1946\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great \nimportance. I offered an amendment, but I was advised that it would \nhave been an obstruction to the bill. In the interest of not holding up \nthe bill, I agreed to withdraw my amendment, but I intend to address \nthis issue on another vehicle.\n  I thank Senators Bingaman, Edwards, and Fitzgerald for agreeing to be \ncosponsors of this amendment. My amendment is supported by the Consumer \nFederation of America and the National Consumer Law Center.\n  Mr. President, certain tax preparers are lining their pockets with \nmoney that should be going toward the everyday needs of lower-income \nfamilies. These preparers are taking advantage of those who have sought \nassistance in claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, by \nsuccessfully marketing to them exorbitantly priced refund anticipation \nloans, RALs. Although these firms work to guide families through the \nsometimes complicated tax filing process, I am concerned about their \naggressive marketing of RALs in low-income neighborhoods where EITC \nrecipients often live. These loans take money away from the day-to-day, \nkitchen-table needs of lower-income families.\n  What is the extent of this problem? An estimated $839 million \nintended to assist low-income families went to commercial tax preparers \nand affiliated national banks for tax assistance, electronic filing of \nreturns, and high-cost refund loans in 2001, according to a report \npublished by the Brookings Institution. As you can see on the chart \nbehind me, a total of 18.7 million returns were filed with EITC claims. \nOf these, 7.6 million or 41 percent of EITC taxpayers received their \nrefund through RALs. I will ask to print in the Record a document \ncompiled by Alan Berube from the Brookings Institution on usage of RALs \namong EITC recipients by State. If I may pick out some of the States \nwhere RALs are most prevalent. I would like to note that Mississippi \ntops the list, with 61.5 percent of EITC returns with RALs. South \nCarolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, \nArkansas, Texas, and the District of Columbia round out the top 10, \nwith slightly more than half of DC's EITC returns filed with RALs. \nAgain, the point here is that RALs unfairly diminish the value of the \nEITC and take money away from working families, which is not justified \nby the service provided.\n  Mr. President, the EITC was created to support work and reduce \npoverty. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the \nFederal credit lifts more children out of poverty than any other \nGovernment program. However, the EITC will not continue to boast this \nrate of success if it continues to be eroded by the artificially high \ncost of highly-marketed RALs. Rather than going to pay for household \nessentials like food, housing, clothing, and transportation, families \nare being convinced to spend this money unnecessarily on RALs, rather \nthan waiting a few more days for a tax refund deposited at no cost to \nthem.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the mechanics of how RALs work. A \ntaxpayer approaches a company for tax preparation services, applies for \nthe EITC, and is convinced to use the RAL, which provides families cash \nfrom their calculated refund within 1 to 2 days. In the RAL application \nprocess, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, reduces the risk that \nlenders.\n  Take on RALs by providing them with a Debt Indicator, DI, on all IRS \ne-file acknowledgments. The DI informs the lender whether or not an \napplicant owes Federal or State taxes, child support, student loans, or \nother government obligations, and this assists the tax preparer in \nascertaining the applicant's ability to obtain their full refund so \nthat the RAL is repaid. The vast majority of refunds are remitted to \nthe preparer as prepared. Thus, interest rates for RALs that vary from \n97 percent to more than 2,000 percent are not justifiable when the IRS \nlowers the risk of the loans by providing the DI service. My amendment \nterminates the use of the Debt Indicator service. For anyone who is \nwondering whether ending RALs pose a hardship on the very families I am \nworking to help, there are alternatives to speeding up refunds, such as \nfiling electronically or having the refund directly deposited into a \nbank or credit union account. Using these methods, taxpayers can \nreceive their returns in about 7 to 10 days without paying the high \nfees associated with RALs. With economic and financial literacy \nawareness--which I am also pursuing for all age levels--we can help \npeople have better access to sound money management skills and \npractices that can help them to plan in advance for the minimal delay \nof a few days for their refund. However, at this point, we must work to \nencourage the use of no-cost alternatives and eliminate the abusive \npractice of RALs.\n  Once again, my amendment would terminate the Debt Indicator program. \nIf we look at the history of this program, the path taken in my \namendment is a fix that must be reinstated. In 1995, the use of the \nDebt Indicator was suspended because of massive fraud in e-filed \nreturns with RALs. After the program was discontinued, RAL \nparticipation declined. The use of the Debt Indicator was reinstated in \n1999. Remarks from H & R Block Chief Executive Officer Frank L. \nSalizzoni upon the reinstatement of the program state that the Debt \nIndicator:\n\n       . . .is good news for many of our clients who opt to \n     receive the amount of their refund through Refund \n     Anticipation Loans. The IRS program will likely result in \n     substantially lower fees for this service.\n\n\n[[Page S13123]]\n\n\n  However, according to a study conducted by the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica and the National Consumer Law Center, that has not been the \ncase for at least one of the major tax preparers. H & R Block and \nHousehold Bank's fees dropped for a year after the DI was reinstated. \nHowever, the trend reversed itself and the fees rose significantly from \n2000 to 2001, which increased H & R Block's revenue from RALs by 49 \npercent. Per RAL revenue rose by 44 percent while RAL sales volume \nincreased by only 2.7 percent. Therefore, the expected outcome that RAL \nprices would go down as a result of the reinstatement of the indicator \nhas not occurred. Rather, it has gone in the opposite direction as the \nprofit motive has presented itself.\n  It is important at this point to recall the ideal of actions by \ngovernment agencies to ``do no harm.'' However, the Debt Indicator \nconveniently provides information about an individual's credit history \nthat is in many cases only known by the Federal Government and is \nhelping tax preparers make excessive profits of low- and moderate-\nincome taxpayers who utilize the service. If the Debt Indicator is \nremoved, then the loans become riskier and the tax preparers may not \naggressively market them among EITC filers. The IRS should not be \naiding efforts that take the earned benefits away from low-income \nfamilies and allow unscrupulous preparers to take advantage of low-\nincome taxpayers.\n  Again, I agree to withdraw my amendment at this time, but I encourage \nall of my colleagues to support my efforts to address this issue in \norder to protect low-income working families from the predatory \npractice of RALs and eliminate the ability of the IRS to facilitate the \nprocessing of RALs by ending the DI.\n\n\n                            speed rail study\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from Washington, \nPatty Murray. I would like to refer to the Midwest Regional Rail \nInitiative which appears in the ``Next Generation High-Speed Rail \nProgram'' at $250,000. This project is a collaborative effort of nine \nStates in the Mid-West, AMTRAK and Federal Railroad Administration. \nThis is a 3,000 mile system plan and I am concerned that $250,000 will \nnot enable us to fully address the environmental and engineering \nassociated with such a large regional system. Due to the extreme budget \nconstraints facing this subcommittee I understand that it may be \ndifficult to find additional resources for this study. However, I have \nbeen told that it would be helpful to the Mid-West Rail Coalition if \nprior contributions made by member States for planning activities prior \nto January 1, 2001 can be counted as the required State-match under \nthis account. I am hopeful that you will support this effort as we move \nto conference on this appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Wisconsin has highlighted an important \nnine-State effort regarding high-speed rail and I will do all I can in \nConference to accommodate the Senator's concerns.\n\n\n                      eastside light rail transit\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Eastside Light \nRail Transit, LRT project in Los Angeles, which would receive \n$5,000,000 in New Starts funds contained in this appropriations bill. \nThis six-mile, dual track light rail system will originate at Union \nStation in downtown Los Angeles, where it connects with the newly \nopened Pasadena Gold Line, and will travel east to Atlantic Boulevard. \nIt will bridge State Route 101 Freeway and traverse the existing 1st \nStreet Bridge over the Los Angeles River, then under the communities of \nEast LA and Boyle Heights and return to the surface near the \nintersection of 1st and Lorena Streets.\n  The Eastside LRT project is the top fiscal year 2004 appropriations \npriority of the Los Angeles County MTA.\n  I understand that the administration's fiscal year 2004 budget \nincludes $55,000,000 for the Eastside LRT project and it also states \nthat the project is pending receipt of a Full Funding Grant Agreement, \nFFGA.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Eastside LRT project will provide vital transit \nservice for tens of thousands of people, many of whom do not have \naccess to an automobile. Almost 20,000 people are expected to ride the \nline once it has opened, providing a much needed transportation \nalternative and congestion relief in one of the lowest income areas of \nLos Angeles.\n  I understand that the Eastside LRT project is expected to receive its \nFFGA in the coming months, which will enable construction to move ahead \nrapidly.\n  Senator Feinstein and I urge you to give every consideration to fund \nthis project according to the levels that will be recommended in its \nforthcoming FFGA.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. My distinguished colleagues from California have told me \nof the importance of this project to their constituents in East Los \nAngeles, as well as to the LACMTA's expanding rail transit system. I \nwill work with Chairman Shelby to help the committee meet this \nproject's funding needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the bill? If not, \nthe question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I announce that on vote No. 406, the \nFeingold amendment, amendment No. 1904, which occurred earlier today, I \nwas necessarily absent from the Senate on business. Had I been present \nto vote, I would have voted ``nay'' on the tabling motion for that \namendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I have a long-standing \ncommitment to a remarkable project in the ongoing downtown Los Angeles \nredevelopment effort. Therefore, I am unable to be present for the \nvotes today in the Senate.\n  However, if I had been present, I would have voted ``no'' on the \nmotion to table the Dorgan amendment.\n  I would have voted ``yes'' on the motion to table the Feingold \namendment.\n  I would have voted ``yes'' on both the Thomas and Mikulski \namendments.\n  I would have also voted ``yes'' on the motion to waive the Budget Act \nwith regard to the Dodd-McConnell amendment.\n  Finally, I would have voted ``yes'' on final passage of the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1964\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding passage of H.R. 2989, the Transportation appropriations \nbill, the amendment at the desk by Senator Collins be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1964) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1964\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for converting to contractor \n       performance of executive agency activities and functions)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I honor the scientists, engineers, and \nother innovators working with the NASA Glenn Research Center in \nCleveland. They are working tirelessly to develop technologies and \nproducts that improve the lives of Americans--both in missions to space \nand in everyday applications here on Earth. Through commercialization \ninitiatives, these products are brought from the laboratory into the \nmarketplace, driving the creation of new jobs and economic growth \nnationwide.\n  NASA Glenn recently received six of Research & Design Magazine's \n``R 100'' awards, which are awarded annually to the 100 most \ntechnologically significant products introduced into the marketplace. \nThis is a tremendous accomplishment for the Glenn Research Center, its \nemployees, and the numerous organizations and individuals who work in \npartnership with the Center. I recognize each of the award recipients \nand thank them for the their outstanding work:\n\n       NASA Glenn's Structures and Acoustics division, in \n     collaboration with the University of Toledo and the Army \n     Office, developed new high-load bearings capable of operating \n     at over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This new bearings \n     technology has opened the door to two new patent \n     applications, and is the result of the hard work and \n     dedication of Gerald Montague, Andrew Provenza, Albert \n     Kascak, Mark Jansen, Ralph Jansen, Ben Ebihara, and Dr. Alan \n     Palazzolo.\n       A combined airport data and radar device developed by NASA \n     Glenn in collaboration with ViGYAN, Inc., will provide new \n     opportunities for pilots to access weather information while \n     in the sky via a portable device called the ``Pilot Weather \n     Advisor''. It was made possible by NASA Glenn's Engineering \n     Design and Analysis Center, as well as the personal \n     assistance of Glenn Lindamood.\n       Thanks to a system developed through a partnership between \n     Zin Technologies and NASA Glenn, real time data plots from \n     the International Space Station are now available to end \n     users through a system known as the ``Microgravity Analysis \n     Software System,'' MASS. NASA staff, including Kevin \n     McPherson, Ted Wright, Ken Hrovat, Eric Kelly, Gene \n     Lieberman, and Nissim Lugasy, teamed up with Zin \n     Technologies' Tim Reckart to make the MASS project possible.\n       Drawing on NASA Glenn's renowned expertise with icing \n     research, a New York-based company has recently brought the \n     first new FAA approved deicing technology to market in 40 \n     years. This new system will provide protection to sensitive \n     aircraft materials, while also combining two long-recognized \n     deicing techniques. NASA Glenn's Dean Miller and Andy \n     Reehorst, as well as representatives from Cox & Company, \n     developed this important innovation.\n       Advances in thermal protection technologies known as \n     ``DMBZ-15,'' jointly developed by NASA Glenn and an Ohio \n     firm, will improve the temperatures and wear resistance of \n     aircraft engines and other propulsion systems, extending \n     flight capabilities and\n\n[[Page S13125]]\n\n     component life spans. Dr. Kathy Chuang of NASA Glenn joined \n     representatives from the Maverick Corporation to accomplish \n     this feat of engineering.\n       Last, but certainly not least, versatile new lubricant \n     products pioneered by NASA Glenn are now being used to \n     improve commercial steam valves and furnace conveyors. Dr. \n     Christopher Dellacorte and Brian Edmonds, both NASA Glenn \n     researchers, made these lubricants possible.\n\n  I extend my most sincere congratulations to everyone involved with \neach of NASA Glenn's award-winning projects and also thank NASA Glenn's \nAeroSpace Frontiers newsletter for bringing these wonderful \naccomplishments to my attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13125-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CAN-SPAM ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to add my congratulations to the \nauthors of the CAN-SPAM Act. This is an important topic, and I am \npleased that the Senate passed this bill.\n  The Internet is a medium that in under a decade has completely \nchanged the way we live in this country. And it still has enormous \nuntapped potential to enrich our lives and improve and expand \ncommunications and commerce for all of our citizens. E-mail has been \ncalled the ``killer application'' of the Internet, and it is truly \nubiquitous in our daily lives in a way that no one could have predicted \nonly a few short years ago. But over the past few years, the spam \nproblem has come to threaten the utility of e-mail in very serious way. \nBy passing this bill, the Senate has begun to address some of the worst \nabuses false and misleading headers and subject lines, fraudulent and \npornographic solicitations, the harvesting of addresses and the \nhijacking of addresses to send unsolicited e-mail.\n  I am pleased also that the bill will allow legitimate commercial e-\nmail to continue to be sent as long as the sender provides a way for \nthe recipients to indicate that they do not want to receive such e-mail \nin the future. Not all unsolicited commercial e-mail is bad. E-mail is \nan inexpensive way for businesses to advertise their products and we \nshould not try to stamp out all such communications.\n  At the same time, some people don't want to receive such e-mails at \nall and they should be able to make that fact known and have their \nwishes respected. In addition to requiring that unsolicited commercial \ne-mail give consumers the ability to opt out of future such \ncommunications, I am pleased that portions of Senator Schumer's bill, \nwhich I have cosponsored, will be incorporated into this bill because I \nbelieve a Do-Not-Email List, modeled on the very popular Do-Not-Call \nList recently activated by the FTC, is something that should be \ncreated.

Mr. President, 73 million acres of national forests are at \nunnaturally high risk of catastrophic wildfires because of unhealthy \nforest conditions. Efforts by the Forest Service to restore forest \nhealth and prevent catastrophic wildfires have been frustrated by \nrequirements for detailed documentation, administrative appeals of \nproposed forest treatment projects, lawsuits and injunctions.\n  The U.S. Forest Service recognizes that it must be able to move more \nquickly to achieve results on the ground. One of its reports, ``The \nProcess Predicament--How Statutory, Regulatory, and Administrative \nFactors Affect National Forest Management, dated, June, 2002, cited a \nstudy conducted by the National Academy of Public Administration where \nit was estimated that planning and assessment consume 40 percent of \ntotal direct work at the national forest level, representing an \nexpenditure of more than $250 million per year.\n  We cannot continue to shuffle paper while our forests burn. Federal \nland management must address dangerous fuel loads and declining forest \nhealth before we can ever hope to stem the wildfires that have plagued \nArizona and other parts of our country. H.R. 1904 allows the Federal \nland management agencies to take action in protecting forest health.\n  It would streamline the administrative process by allowing the \nFederal land management agencies, in their preparation of environmental \nassessments or environmental impact statements, to describe a proposed \naction, an alternative of no action, and one additional action \nalternative if the additional alternative is proposed during scoping or \nthe collaborative process and meets the purpose and need of the \nproject.\n  The legislation would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to issue \ninterim final regulations which will serve as the sole means by which \nadministrative review may be sought for authorized hazardous fuel \nreduction projects. It further directs that authorized hazardous fuel \nreduction projects be subject to judicial review only in U.S. District \nCourt where the Federal land to be treated is located. It would \nencourage the court to expedite proceedings with the goal of rendering \na decision as soon as practicable. It would further direct the court--\nin its consideration of injunctive relief--to balance the short and \nlong-term effects to the ecosystem of undertaking the project versus \nthe short and long-term effects to the ecosystem of not undertaking the \nproject.\n  H.R. 1904 would authorize hazardous fuel reduction projects to \nprotect wildland-urban interface areas, municipal watersheds or water \nsupply systems, and areas where windthrow, blowdown, ice storm damage, \nor the existence of insects or disease poses a significant threat to \necosystems or forests or rangeland resources on Federal land or \nadjacent non-Federal land, or contain threatened and endangered species \nhabitat.\n  It outlines a path to unlock the gridlock that has precluded our \nFederal land managers from moving forward to protect our forest health.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that even at this date, after the bill has \nbeen reported favorably from the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, and following lengthy bipartisan discussions, \nsome Members of this Senate remain unwilling to move this vital \nlegislation forward. If we fail to act, our communities and our forests \nwill continue to be at risk from insect damage and fire that threatens \nour citizens and their homes and property.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. I commend the chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, Thad Cochran, and his staff who \nhave worked tirelessly since this legislation was reported out of \nCommittee to reach a compromise with members on both sides of the aisle \nwho have concerns about this legislation.\n  In the South forest fires pale in comparison to forest fires of the \nWest. In\n\n[[Page S13126]]\n\nmy home State of Georgia, we don't have a significant threat from fire \nin our forests because we receive adequate moisture throughout the \nyear. According to the Georgia Forestry Commission, my State \nexperiences approximately 8 thousand fires each year damaging or \ndestroying approximately 38,000 acres of forestland.\n  However with 24.6 million acres of forestland in the State of \nGeorgia, which is nearly two-thirds of my home State, major outbreaks \nof disease caused by pathogens and insects such as the southern pine \nbeetle pose a significant threat to forests in the South. In 2002 \nalone, damage caused by the southern pine beetle totaled over $150 \nmillion.\n  The forest community has waited long enough for comprehensive forest \nmanagement legislation. It is time for the Senate to pass this \nlegislation so that Americans have the tools to manage our Nation's \nforests--by putting out fires and by reducing disease and insect \npressure. This act will help our Nation's forest to flourish for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13126-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13126-S13127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GIVE US A VOTE, PART II\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as a Senator frustrated by this situation, \nI rise today to respond to comments made by my colleague from New \nMexico, Mr. Bingaman, regarding the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, \nH.R. 1904. As he chose to address the entire Senate, I too am following \nhis lead in addressing the entire Senate. I appreciate Mr. Bingaman's \nattention to this issue and look forward to future discussions with him \non this issue.\n  However, I am perplexed and troubled by some of my colleague's \nstatements and feel it is important to include some additional \ninformation for the Record.\n  First, on June 26, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing on H.R. \n1904 and many of our colleagues, including myself, took the time to \nattend the hearing, listen to the testimony, and participate in the \ndiscussions. Mr. Bingaman could have done the same, but chose not to.\n  In the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we then held a hearing \non July 22. The purpose of this hearing was to examine the impacts of \nfires, insects and disease on forest lands. And we looked at processes \nfor implementing hazardous fuels reduction projects more expeditiously.\n  The committee also considered S. 1314, the Collaborative Forest \nHealth Act, Mr. Bingaman's bill; H.R. 1904 the Healthy Forest \nRestoration Act; as well as other related legislation that addresses \nthese issues.\n  During that hearing, Senator Bingaman hardly even mentioned his bill \nand had very few questions about H.R. 1904.\n  In Mr. Bingaman's statement to the Senate, he brought up having \nconcerns about many of the issues covered at the hearing. If he had so \nmany questions, I have to wonder why he waited until now to ask them?\n  Two Senators who did engage at the hearing, Senator Wyden and Senator \nFeinstein, asked probing questions that helped the bipartisan group, \nhosted by Mr. Cochran, find a commonsense solution.\n  Second, Mr. Bingaman's staff was invited to the table, at the point \ndiscussions of the major issues began in earnest and were never \nexcluded from being a part of the discussions that developed the \ncompromise amendment. In fact, his staff attended several of the \nnegotiations sessions, but chose to stop being a part of the \ndiscussions.\n  At that time in the discussions, all the major issues related to \nTitle I--old growth, judicial review, large tree retention--were still \nin flux and any contributions they would have made could have been a \nfruitful part of the discussion. But, again, they chose not to \nparticipate.\n  In addition, his staff attended the all-staff briefing once the \ncompromise amendment was agreed to by the bipartisan group of Senators \nparticipating in the discussions and Mr. Bingaman's staff was very \nactive in that briefing. And it is my understanding that they asked \nmany of the questions and received answers for the issues Mr. Bingaman \nnow is questioning.\n\n  It is one thing to disagree about the approach we have taken and \noffer amendments to modify that approach and another to foster needless \ndelay.\n  If any of my colleagues would like a personal briefing on the \ncompromise amendment, and the process in which it was developed, I am \ncertain that the cosponsors of this amendment would join me in sitting \ndown with anyone who would like to be a part of this discussion.\n  While Senator Bingaman has supported active management and wants to \nbe a part of the solution, it would appear that he is taking a play out \nof the environmentalist's handbook and is delaying the process through \nstalling, such as asking for a hearing on the amendment.\n  I believe the Senate should not get into the habit of holding \nhearings on amendments because a Senator chose not to participate in \nthe process.\n  Again, this is a move the radical environmental community uses time \nand time again to prevent hazardous fuel reduction projects from going \nforward. In the vernacular of forest appeals, Mr. Bingaman has stayed \ninvolved just enough to meet the standing requirements, he has held his \nwater till the appeal period is just about over and now he is launching \nhis appeal.\n  The question now is, what now? The environmental community usually \nfiles a lawsuit when they don't see the results they wanted. Will \nSenator Bingaman try to filibuster this important legislation? Or will \nhe step forward to offer amendments to make the modifications he \nbelieves need to be made.\n  There have been two unanimous consent requests offered that included \nthe opportunity to offer amendments on the very issues that the Senator \nbrought up today. Yet he has objected both times. A third unanimous \nconsent request that is even more broad was offered this morning.\n  It is time to move on and proceed to a debate on the floor of the \nSenate. This is important legislation that needs to be signed into law \nso that we can start to address the hazardous fuels problems that are \nthreatening our communities.\n  This legislation will result in a more public, expedited, process for \nmoving hazardous fuels projects through the NEPA process.\n  It provides for the development of a new and improved predecisional \nprotest process for projects authorized under this bill. The new \nprocess will replace the highly contentious, time consuming, appeals \nprocess that currently delays many forest health projects.\n  It directs that all preliminary injunctions be reviewed every 60 \ndays, with the opportunity for the parties to update the judges on \nchanges in conditions so the court may respond to those changes if \nneeded, something that Senators Wyden and Feinstein desired.\n  Finally, it reminds the courts that when weighing the equities that \nthey should balance the impact to the ecosystem of the short and long-\nterm effects of undertaking the project against the short and long-term \neffects of not undertaking the project. I am sure there are communities \nin New Mexico that would welcome this balancing of the harms.\n  It is time for the Senate to take action on this issue. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in bringing this legislation up for \nconsideration.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate Catherine \nBertini, former Executive Director of the United Nations World Food \nProgram, for her selection as recipient of the 2003 World Food Prize, \npresented in a ceremony in Des Moines, IA on October 16.\n  Ms. Bertini has worked long and hard and with innovation and \ncreativity to rid the world of the scourge of hunger. For her efforts \nthis recognition is richly deserved. As the leader of the World Food \nProgram between 1992 and 2002, Ms. Bertini directed programs \nresponsible for addressing hunger around the world, providing \nassistance to an estimated 700 million people during that period. \nBecause of her dedication and leadership, millions are alive today \nwhose need for assistance would otherwise have been ignored.\n  Catherine Bertini is the twenty-first recipient of the World Food \nPrize, and the second civil servant so honored. During her tenure at \nthe World Food Program, or WFP, Ms. Bertini reorganized the agency and \nimproved its logistical capacity, while focusing attention on \ndelivering food aid through women in the developing world, and thereby \nnourishing women and girls\n\n[[Page S13127]]\n\nboth in nutrition and education. As she wrote in the Des Moines \nRegister, ``The key to ending hunger may lie in a little girl's hands. \nIn her left, she holds a bowl of rice; in her right, her school \nbooks.'' I strongly support these goals, and share Ms. Bertini's desire \nto fund fully for fiscal 2004 the McGovern-Dole Food for Education and \nChild Nutrition Program, which we included in the 2002 farm bill.\n  Even as we celebrate her achievements, Catherine Bertini is focused \non the challenges that lie ahead. She may have left her position at the \nWFP, but her long-time work to defeat global hunger and poverty \ncontinues. Only a few months after her departure from the WFP, she was \nasked by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to work for him in New York, \nas Under Secretary General for Management. Prior to her selection as \nWFP Executive Director, Ms. Bertini served as Assistant Secretary of \nAgriculture for Food and Consumer Services in the first Bush \nAdministration.\n  Ms. Bertini exemplifies the best ideals of public service and reminds \nus that our fundamental work is not to leave the world as we found it, \nbut as we know it should be--free of deprivation, devoid of want and \nwith equal opportunity for all regardless of who they are or where they \nare. For her efforts, I salute Ms. Bertini and her dedication to the \ncause of helping the needy around the world.\n  The World Food Prize was established in 1986 to provide international \nrecognition for individuals who have made vital contributions to \n``improving the quality, quantity, or availability of food throughout \nthe world.'' The World Food Prize embodies the vision of Dr. Norman E. \nBorlaug, an Iowa native who received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his \ndevelopment of dwarf wheat. Through the adoption of dwarf wheat \nvarieties in the 1960's, developing countries doubled their wheat \nyields in what became known as the Green Revolution. Dr. Borlaug's \nachievements and devotion to eliminating world hunger exemplify the \nideals honored by the World Food Prize.\n  Within a few years after the World Food Prize was created, it lost \ncritical sponsorship and its future was in serious doubt. In short, the \nPrize badly needed a committed benefactor. Iowa businessman and \nphilanthropist John Ruan stepped forward to provide critical funding \nand to establish a headquarters for the World Food Prize in Des Moines, \nIA. Under Mr. Ruan's stewardship, and with the leadership of its \npresident, Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn, the Prize now rests on a solid \nfoundation. The annual awarding of the Prize serves as the anchor to a \ntwo-day international symposium and many other activities in support of \ndefeating world famine and hunger.\n  It is a sobering reality that the world is still plagued with \nstaggering levels of hunger and poverty. The World Food Prize heightens \nawareness of that reality, but it also inspires hope by recognizing \nthat progress has been made and that much more can be done. Dr. Borlaug \nand Ms. Bertini, along with previous World Food Prize laureates, serve \nas examples to inspire and motivate us all to commit ourselves \nwholeheartedly to ending global hunger and poverty as rapidly as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13127-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13127-S13130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \ndocuments related to the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 be made \na part of the permanent Record for October 21, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 12, 2003.\n     Senator Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I have read the letter from Dr. \n     Philip Darney addressed to Senator Feinstein regarding the \n     intact D (often referred to as ``intact D'' in medical \n     terminology) procedure (partial-birth abortion) and its use \n     in his experience.\n       As a board certified practicing Obstetrician/Gynecologist \n     and Maternal-Fetal Medicine sub-specialist I have had much \n     opportunity to deal with patients in similar situations to \n     the patients in the anecdotes he has supplied.\n       In neither of the type of cases described by Dr. Darney, \n     nor in any other that I can imagine, would an intact D \n     procedure be medically necessary, nor is there any medical \n     evidence that I am aware of to demonstrate, or even suggest, \n     that an intact D is ever a safer mode of delivery for the \n     mother than other available options.\n       In the first case discussed by Dr. Darney a standard D \n     could have been performed without resorting to the techniques \n     encompassed by the intact D procedure.\n       In the second case referred to it should be made clear that \n     there is no evidence that terminating a pregnancy with \n     placenta previa and suspected placenta accreta at 22 weeks of \n     gestation will necessarily result in less significant blood \n     loss or less risk to the mother than her carrying later in \n     the pregnancy and delivering by cesarean section. There is a \n     significant risk of maternal need for a blood transfusion, or \n     even a hysterectomy, with either management. The good outcome \n     described by Dr. Darney can be accomplished at a near term \n     delivery in this kind of patient, and I have had similar \n     cases that ended happily with a healthy mother and baby. \n     Further a standard D procedure could have been performed in \n     the manner described if termination of the pregnancy at 22 \n     weeks was desired.\n       I again reiterate, and reinforce the statement made by the \n     American Medical Association at an earlier date, that an \n     intact D procedure is never medically necessary, that there \n     always is another procedure available, and there is no data \n     that an intact D provides any safety advantage whatsoever \n     to the mother.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                   Nathan Hoeldtke, MD, FACOG,\n\n                               Med.

Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The purpose of this letter is to \n     counter the letter of Dr. Philip Darney, M.D. to Senator \n     Diane Feinstein and to refute claims of a need for an \n     exemption based on the health of the mother in the bill to \n     restrict ``partial birth abortion.''\n       I am board certified in Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology and have over 20 years of \n     experience, 17 of which have been in maternal-fetal medicine. \n     Those of us in maternal-fetal medicine are asked to provide \n     care for complicated, high-risk pregnancies and often take \n     care of women with medical complications and/or fetal \n     abnormalities.\n       The procedure under discussion (D, or intact dilation and \n     extraction) is similar to a destructive vaginal delivery. \n     Historically such were performed due to the risk of caesarean \n     delivery (also called hysterotomy) prior to the availability \n     of safe anesthetic, antiseptic and antibiotic measures and \n     frequently on a presumably dead baby. Modern medicine has \n     progressed and now provides better medical and surgical \n     options for the obstetrical patient.\n       The presence of placenta previa (placenta covering the \n     opening of the cervix) in the two cases cited by Dr. Darney \n     placed those mothers at extremely high risk for catastrophic \n     life-threatening hemorrhage with any attempt at vaginal \n     delivery. Bleeding from placenta previa is primarily \n     maternal, not fetal. The physicians are lucky that their \n     interventions in both these cases resulted in living healthy \n     women. I do not agree that D was a necessary option. In \n     fact, a bad outcome would have been indefensible in court. A \n     hysterotomy (cesarean delivery) under controlled non-emergent \n     circumstances with modern anesthesia care would be more \n     certain to avoid disaster when placenta previa occurs in the \n     latter second trimester.\n       Lastly, but most importantly, there is no excuse for \n     performing the D procedure on living fetal patients. Given \n     the time that these physicians spent preparing for their \n     procedures, there is no reason not to have performed a lethal \n     fetal injection which is quickly and easily performed under \n     ultrasound guidance, similar to amniocentesis, and carries \n     minimal maternal risk.\n       I understand the desire of physicians to keep all \n     therapeutic surgical options open, particularly in life-\n     threatening emergencies. We prefer to discuss the \n     alternatives with our patients and jointly with them develop \n     a plan of care, individualizing techniques, and referring \n     them as necessary to those who will serve the patient with \n     the most skill. Nonetheless I know of no circumstance in my \n     experience and know of no colleague who will state that it is \n     necessary to perform a destructive procedure on a living \n     second trimester fetus when the alternative of intrauterine \n     feticide by injection is available.\n       Obviously none of this is pleasant. Senator Santorum, I \n     encourage you strongly to work for passage of the bill \n     limiting this barbaric medical procedure, performance of D \n     on living fetuses.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    Susan E.

Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I am writing in support of the \n     proposed restrictions on the procedure referred to as \n     ``partial birth abortion,'' which the Senate is now \n     considering.\n       I am chief of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine in \n     the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University \n     of Southern California in Los Angeles. I have published more \n     than 100 scientific papers and book chapters regarding \n     complications of pregnancy. I direct the obstetrics service \n     at Los Angeles County Women's and Children's Hospital, the \n     major referral center for complicated obstetric cases among \n     indigent and under-served women in Los Angeles.\n       I have had occasion to review the cases described by Dr. \n     Philip Darney, offered in support of the position that \n     partial birth abortion, or intact D, was the best care for \n     the patient in those situations. Mindful of Dr. Darney's \n     broad experience with surgical abortion, I nevertheless \n     disagree strongly that the approach he describes for these \n     two cases was best under the circumstances. Such cases are \n     infrequent, and there is not single standard for management. \n     However, it would certainly be considered atypical, in my \n     experience, to wait 12 hours to dilate the cervix with \n     laminaria while the patient was actively hemorrhaging, as was \n     described in his first case. Similarly, the approach to \n     presumed placenta acreta, described in the second case, is \n     highly unusual. Although the mother survived with significant \n     morbidity, it is not clear that the novel approach to \n     management of these difficult cases is the safest approach. \n     It is my opinion that the vast majority of physicians \n     confronting either of these cases would opt for careful \n     hysterotomy as the safest means to evacuate the uterus.\n       Although I do not perform abortions, I have been involved \n     in counseling many women who have considered abortion because \n     of a medical complication of pregnancy. I have not \n     encountered a case in which what has been described as \n     partial birth abortion is the only choice, or even the better \n     choice among alternatives, for managing a given complication \n     of pregnancy.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          T.

Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I have reviewed the letter from Dr. \n     Darney describing two examples of what he believes are high \n     risk pregnancy cases that show the need for an additional \n     ``medical exemption'' for partial birth abortion (also \n     referred to as intact D). I am a specialist in maternal-\n     fetal medicine with 23 years of experience in obstetrics. I \n     teach and do research at the University of Minnesota. I am \n     also co-chair of the Program in Human Rights in Medicine at \n     the University. My opinion in this matter is my own.\n       In the rare circumstances when continuation of pregnancy is \n     life-threatening to a mother I will end the pregnancy. If the \n     fetus is viable (greater than 23 weeks) I will recommend a \n     delivery method that will maximize the chance for survival of \n     the infant, explaining all of the maternal implications of \n     such a course. If an emergent life-threatening situation \n     requires emptying the uterus before fetal viability then I \n     will utilize a medically appropriate method of delivery, \n     including intact D\n       Though they are certainly complicated, the two cases \n     described by Dr. Darney describe situations that were not \n     initially emergent. This is demonstrated by the use of \n     measures such as dilation of the cervix that required a \n     significant period of time. In addition, the attempt to \n     dilate the cervix with placenta previa and placenta accreta \n     is itself risky and can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. \n     There may be extenuating circumstances in Dr. Darney's \n     patients but most obstetrical physicians would not attempt \n     dilation of the cervix in the presence of these \n     complications. It is my understanding that the proposed \n     partial birth abortion ban already has an exemption for \n     situations that are a threat to the life of the mother. This \n     would certainly allow all measures to be taken if heavy \n     bleeding, infection, or severe preeclampsia required \n     evacuation of the uterus.\n       The argument for an additional medical exemption is \n     redundant; furthermore, its inclusions in the legislation \n     would make the ban virtually meaningless. Most physicians and \n     citizens recognize that in rare life-threatening situations \n     this gruesome procedure might be necessary. But it is \n     certainly not a procedure that should be used to accomplish \n     abortion in any other situation.\n       Passage of a ban on partial birth abortion with an \n     exemption only for life-threatening situations is reasonable \n     and just. It is in keeping with long-standing codes of \n     medical ethics and it is also in keeping with the provision \n     of excellent medical care to pregnant women and their unborn \n     children.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve Calvin, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n         Synergy Medical Education Alliance, Department of \n           Maternal-Fetal Medicine,\n                                      Saginaw, MI, March 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I am writing in response to the \n     letter from Dr. Phillip Darney which was introduced by \n     Senator Feinstein.\n       I have cared for pregnant patient patients for almost 29 \n     years, and have worked exclusively in the field of Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine (high risk pregnancy) for over 15 years. I am \n     board certified in Obstetrics & Gynecology, and also in the \n     subspecialty of Maternal-Fetal Medicine. I am an assistant \n     professor in Obstetrics & Gynecology for the Michigan State \n     College of Human Medicine, and co-director of Maternal-Fetal \n     Medicine in Saginaw Michigan.\n       I have never seen a situation in which a partial birth \n     abortion was needed to save a mother's life. I have never had \n     a maternal death, not ever.\n       I am familiar with Dr. Darney's letter describing two of \n     his cases. My comments are not meant as a criticism of Dr. \n     Darney as a person or as a physician. I have great respect \n     for anyone in our field of medicine, which is a very \n     rewarding specialty but which requires difficult decisions on \n     a daily basis. We are all working to help mothers and their \n     children make it through difficult pregnancies. Still, I do \n     disagree with his stand that the legal freedom to do partial \n     birth abortions is necessary for us to take good care of our \n     patients. For example, in the second case he describes, I \n     believe that patient could have carried the pregnancy much \n     further, and eventually delivered a healthy child by repeat \n     cesarean section followed by hysterectomy. Hemorrhage is \n     always a concern with such patients, but we have many \n     effective ways to handle this problem, which Dr. Darney knows \n     as well as I. Blood vessels can be tied off at surgery, blood \n     vessels can be occluded using small vascular catheters, cell-\n     savers can be used to return the patients own blood to them, \n     blood may be given from donors, pelvic pressure packs can be \n     used for bleeding following hysterectomy, and other blood \n     products (platelets, fresh frozen plasma, etc) can be given \n     to treat coagulation abnormalities (DIC). His approach of \n     placing laminaria to dilate the cervix in a patient with a \n     placenta praevia is not without its own risk.\n       If Dr. Darney performed the partial birth abortion on this \n     patient to keep from doing another c-section, or even to \n     preserve her uterus, I'm hopeful he counseled the patient \n     that if she becomes pregnant again, she will once again have \n     a very high risk of having a placenta praevia and placenta \n     accreta.\n       Lastly, I believe that for some abortionists, the real \n     reason they wish to preserve their ``right'' to do partial \n     birth abortions is that at the end of the procedure they have \n     only a dead child to deal with. If they were to abort these \n     women by either inducing their labor (when there is no \n     placenta praevia present), or by doing a hysterotomy (c-\n     section), they then need to deal with a small, living, \n     struggling child--an uncomfortable situation for someone \n     who's intent was to end the child's life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Daniel J. Wechter, M.D.,\n     Co-Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Rockford Health System,\n\n\n                              Div. of Maternal-Fetal Medicine,\n\n                                     Rockford, IL, March 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I am writing to contest the letter \n     submitted to Senator Feinstein by Philip D. Darney, MD \n     supporting the ``medical exemption'' to the proposed \n     restriction of the partial birth abortion (or as abortionists \n     call it ``intact D'').\n       I am a diplomate board certified by the American Board of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology in general Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology and in the sub-specialty of Maternal-Fetal \n     Medicine. I serve as a Visiting Clinical Professor in \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Illinois at Chicago, \n     Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine \n     at Rockford, Illinois; as an Adjunct Professor of Obstetrics \n     and Gynecology at Midwestern University, Chicago College of \n     Osteopathic Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology; and as an Adjunct Associate Professor of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology, Uniformed Services University of \n     Health Sciences, F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, \n     Washington, D.C. I have authored over 50 peer review articles \n     in the obstetric and gynecologic literature, presented over \n     100 scientific papers, and have participated in over 40 \n     research projects.\n       In my over 14 years as a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist \n     I have never used or needed the partial birth abortion \n     technique to care for any complicated or life threatening \n     conditions that require the termination of a pregnancy. \n     Babies may need to be delivered early and die from \n     prematurity, but there is never a medical need to perform \n     this heinous act.\n       I have reviewed both cases presented by Dr. Darney, and, \n     quite frankly, do not understand why he was performing the \n     abortions he indicates, yet alone the procedure he is using. \n     If the young 25-year-old woman had a placenta previa with a \n     clotting disorder, the safest thing to do would be to place \n     her in\n\n[[Page S13129]]\n\n     the hospital, transfuse her to a reasonable hematocrit, \n     adjust he clotting parameters, watch her closely at bed rest, \n     and deliver a live baby. If the patient had a placenta \n     previa, pushing laminaria (sterile sea weed) up into her \n     cervix, and, potentially through the previa, is \n     contraindicated. It is no surprise to anyone that the patient \n     went, from stable without bleeding, to heavy bleeding as they \n     forcibly dilated her cervix to 3 centimeters with laminaria. \n     The use of the dangerous procedure of blindly pushing \n     scissors into the baby's skull (as part of the partial birth \n     abortion) with significant bleeding from a previa just \n     appears reckless and totally unnecessary.\n       Regarding the second case of the 38-year-old woman with \n     three caesarean sections with a possible accreta and the risk \n     of massive hemorrhage and hysterectomy due to a placenta \n     previa, it seems puzzling why the physician would recommend \n     doing an abortion with a possible accreta as the indication. \n     Many times, a placenta previa at 22 weeks will move away from \n     the cervix so that there is no placenta privia present and no \n     risk for accreta as the placenta moves away from the old \n     cesarean scar. (virtually 99.5% of time this is the case with \n     early previas) Why the physicians did not simply take the \n     women to term, do a repeat cesarean section with preparations \n     as noted for a possible hysterectomy, remains a conundrum. \n     Dr. Darney actually increased the woman's risk for bleeding, \n     with a horrible outcome, by tearing through a placenta \n     previa, pulling the baby down, blindly instrumenting the \n     baby's skull, placing the lower uterine segment at risk, and \n     then scraping a metal instrument over an area of placenta \n     accreta. No one I know would do such a foolish procedure in \n     the mistaken belief they would prevent an accreta with a D\n       Therefore, neither of these cases presented convincing \n     arguments that the partial birth abortion procedure has any \n     legitimate role in the practice of maternal-fetal medicine or \n     obstetrics and gynecology. Rather, they demonstrate how \n     cavalierly abortion practices are used to treat women instead \n     of sound medical practices that result in a live baby and an \n     unharmed mother.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron C. Calhoun, MD, FACOG, FACS.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 17, 1996]\n\n                         Viability and the Law\n\n                         (By David Brown, M.D.)\n\n       The normal length of human gestation is 266 days, or 38 \n     weeks. This is roughly 40 weeks from a woman's last menstrual \n     period. Pregnancy is often divided into three parts, or \n     ``trimesters.'' Both legally and medically, however, this \n     division has little meaning. For one thing, there is little \n     precise agreement about when one trimester ends and another \n     begins. Some authorities describe the first trimester as \n     going through the end of the 12th week of gestation. Others \n     say the 13th week. Often the third trimester is defined as \n     beginning after 24 weeks of fetal development.\n       Nevertheless, the trimester concept--and particularly the \n     division between the second and third ones--commonly arises \n     in discussion of late-stage abortion.\n       Contrary to a widely held public impression, third-\n     trimester abortion is not outlawed in the United States. The \n     landmark Supreme Court decisions Roe v. Wade and Doe v. \n     Bolton, decided together in 1973, permit abortion on demand \n     up until the time of fetal ``viability.'' After that point, \n     states can limit a woman's access to abortion. The court did \n     not specify when viability begins.\n       In Doe v. Bolton the court ruled that abortion could be \n     performed after fetal viability if the operating physician \n     judged the procedure necessary to protect the life or health \n     of the woman. ``Health'' was broadly defined.\n       ``Medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all \n     factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the \n     woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the patient,'' the \n     court wrote. ``All these factors may relate to health. This \n     allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his \n     best medical judgment.''\n       Because of this definition, life-threatening conditions \n     need not exist in order for a woman to get a third-trimester \n     abortion.\n       For most of the century, however, viability was confined to \n     the third trimester because neonatal intensive-care medicine \n     was unable to keep fetuses younger than that alive. This is \n     no longer the case.\n       In an article published in the journal Pediatrics in 1991, \n     physicians reported the experience of 1,765 infants born with \n     a very low birth weight at seven hospitals. About 20 percent \n     of those babies were considered to be at 25 weeks' gestation \n     or less. Of those that had completed 23 weeks' development, \n     23 percent survived. At 24 weeks, 34 percent survived. None \n     of those infants was yet in the third trimester.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Euthanasia of Partly Born Human Beings\n\n       The greatest number of partial-birth abortions are \n     performed during the latter part of the second trimester, \n     from 20 through 26 weeks--both before and after \n     ``viability.'' (A 1991 NIH survey of selected neo-natal units \n     found that 23% of infants born at 23 weeks now survive.) \n     However, partial-birth abortions have also often been \n     performed in the third trimester, in a wide variety of \n     circumstances, as documented elsewhere.\n       In a minority of cases involving partial-birth abortions, \n     the baby suffers from genetic or other disorders. (Dr. \n     Haskell estimated that ``20%'' of his 20-24 week abortions \n     were ``genetic'' cases.) It appears that most of these \n     involve non-lethal disabilities, such as Down Syndrome. (Down \n     Syndrome was the most frequent ``fetal indication' on Dr. \n     McMahon's table.)\n       The sort of cases highlighted by President Clinton--third-\n     trimester abortions of babies with disorders incompatible \n     with sustained life outside the womb--surely account for a \n     small fraction of all the partial-birth abortions. Confronted \n     with identical cases, most specialists would never consider \n     executing a breech extraction and puncturing the skull. \n     Instead, most would deliver the baby alive, sometimes early, \n     without jeopardy to the mother--usually vaginally--and make \n     the baby as comfortable as possible for whatever time the \n     child has allotted to her.\n       Dr. Pamela Smith, Director of Medical Education, Department \n     of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Chicago, \n     testified, ``There are absolutely no obstetrical situations \n     encountered in this country which require a partially \n     delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the life or \n     health of the mother.'' [Senate hearing record, p. 82]\n       Dr. Harlan Giles, a professor of ``high-risk'' obstetrics \n     and pereinatology at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, \n     performs abortions by a variety of procedures up until \n     ``viability.'' In sworn testimony in the U.S. Federal \n     District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Nov. 13, \n     1995), Prof. Giles said: ``[After 23 weeks] I do not think \n     there are any maternal conditions that I'm aware of that \n     mandate ending the pregnancy that also require that the fetus \n     be dead or that the fetal life be terminated. In my \n     experience for 20 years, one can deliver these fetuses either \n     vaginally, or by Cesarean section for that matter, depending \n     on the choice of the parents with informed consent . . . But \n     there's no reason these fetuses cannot be delivered intact \n     vaginally after a miniature labor, if you will, and be at \n     least assessed at birth and given the benefit of the doubt.'' \n     [transcript, page 240]\n       When American Medical News asked Dr. Haskell why he could \n     not simply dilate the woman a little more and remove the baby \n     without killing him, Dr. Haskell responded: ``The point here \n     is you're attempting to do an abortion . . . not to see how \n     do you manipulate the situation so that I get a live birth \n     instead.''\n       President Clinton and others have tried to center their \n     arguments on cases in which the baby suffers from advanced \n     hydrocephaly (head enlargement) that would make delivery \n     risky or impossible. (Cases of hydrocephaly accounted for \n     less than 4% of Dr. McMahon's ``series'' of more than 2,000 \n     late-term abortions.) But an eminent authority on such \n     matters, Dr. Watson A. Bowes, Jr., professor of ob/gyn \n     (maternal and fetal medicine) at the University of North \n     Carolina, who is co-editor of the Obstetrical and \n     Gyneocological Survey, wrote to Congressman Canady; ``Critics \n     of your bill who say that this legislation will prevent \n     doctors from performing certain procedures which are standard \n     of care, such as cephalocentesis (removal of fluid from the \n     enlarged head of a fetus with the most severe form of \n     hydrocephalus) are mistaken. In such a procedure a needle is \n     inserted with ultrasound guidance through the mother's \n     abdomen into the uterus and then into the enlarged ventricle \n     of the brain (the space containing cerobrospinal fluid). \n     Fluid is then withdrawn which results in reduction of the \n     size in the head so that delivery can occur. This procedure \n     is not intended to kill the fetus, and, in fact, is usually \n     associated with the birth of a live infant.''\n       President Clinton said that the five women who appeared \n     with him had ``no choice,'' and two of the women suggested \n     that their babies endangered their lives. However, Claudia \n     Crown Ades and Mary-Dorothy Line have explained that the \n     danger to their lives would have occurred if the baby had \n     died in utero and not been removed. Prof. Watson Bowes says \n     that if a baby dies in utero, it can sometimes cause problems \n     for the mother--after about five weeks. Thus, there is plenty \n     of time to deal with such a situation by removing the body if \n     necessary. Such a procedure is not, legally, an abortion, has \n     never been affected by any kind of abortion law, and raises \n     no ethical questions.\n       Under closer examination, it becomes clear that in some \n     cases, the primary reason for performing the procedure is not \n     concern that the baby will die in utero, but rather, that he/\n     she will be born alive with disorders incompatible with \n     sustained life outside the womb, or with a non-lethal \n     disability. (Again, in Dr. McMahon's table of ``fetal \n     indications,'' the single largest category was for Down \n     Syndrome.)\n       In a letter opposing HR 1833, one of Dr. McMahon's \n     colleagues at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Jeffrey S. \n     Greenspoon, wrote: ``As a volunteer speaker to the National \n     Spina Bifida Association of America and the Canadian \n     National Spina Bifida Organization, I am familiar with the \n     burden of raising a significantly handicapped child. . . . \n     The burden of raising one or two abnormal children is \n     realistically unbearable.'' [Letter to Congressman Hyde, \n     July 19, 1995]\n       Viki Wilson, whose daughter Abigail died at the hands of \n     Dr. McMahon at 38 weeks, said: ``I knew that I could go ahead \n     and carry the baby until full term, but knowing, you know, \n     that this was futile, you know, that she was going to die . . \n     .

Mr. President, on October 15, we honored the late Senator \nMike Mansfield with the unveiling of the new book, ``Senator Mansfield: \nThe Extraordinary Life of a Great American Statesman and Diplomat,'' by \nauthor Don Oberdorfer.\n  To many, he was Senator Mansfield, Majority Leader Mansfield, or \nAmbassador Mansfield. To us in Montana, he was just Mike. He was our \nMike. He was humble, self effacing, and didn't want people making a big \nfuss about him.\n  Although he wouldn't have wanted one, I'd like to thank the \nUniversity of Montana and their alumni for hosting an event here in the \nCapitol to commemorate the life and times of Mike through this new \nbook.\n  Mike had three great loves in his life: his wife Maureen, his State \nof Montana and serving in the United States Senate. Maureen was the \nlove of his life. He always said that his successes were because of \nher. The last time I visited Mike in the hospital his face lit up when \nhe talked about her. ``What a gal,'' he said. ``What a gal she was.''\n  Mike was a good friend and a great inspiration to many people, \nincluding myself. Mike encouraged me to get into public service, he was \nmy mentor when I was first elected to Congress, and he provided me sage \ncounsel until his death.\n  Mike would think that tonight's event was too much. That is just the \nkind of man he was. But it's our job to keep his memory alive and \neducate others on what a great impact he had on Montana, the Nation, \nand the world. It's our responsibility to ensure others can learn from \nhis example of working together to do what's right.\n  The University of Montana Alumni Association, the Maureen and Mike \nMansfield Library, the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center, and the \nMaureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation here in Washington, D.C. all put \nforth a great effort to make this event possible.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ninternational coffee crisis. With much of the world focused on Iraq and \nthe Middle East, it is perhaps not surprising that a crisis affecting \ntens of millions people, on virtually every corner of the Earth, has \nreceived little attention.\n  The worldwide price of coffee has plummeted almost 70 percent over \nthe last several years. This has devastated the economies of poor \ncountries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; it has ruined the \nlivelihoods of millions of people; and it has damaged our foreign aid \nand counter-narcotics efforts in these countries.\n  For example, over the last few years, the United States has provided \nalmost $3 billion to Colombia for counter-narcotics assistance. This \nhas made Colombia the top recipient of U.S. assistance outside of the \nMiddle East.\n  Even though this is an extremely generous amount of aid, the goals \nand objectives are being undermined by the collapse of coffee prices. \nLast year, Colombia's President Alvaro Uribe wrote a letter to me, in \nwhich he stated:\n\n       [T]he impact of the international coffee crisis on \n     Colombian coffee growers has been devastating. In Colombia, \n     more than 800,000 people are directly employed on coffee \n     farms and another three million are dependent on coffee for \n     their livelihood. Colombian coffee farmers are struggling to \n     cover their cost of production, and the problems of \n     oversupply and a decline in coffee prices has brought poverty \n     and uncertainty to Colombia's coffee-growing regions, which \n     were previously free of violence and narcotrafficking \n     activity. Additional support from the United States will help \n     improve this dire situation in Colombia and other developing \n     countries around the world which are also being impacted by \n     oversupply and falling prices.\n\n  A range of humanitarian relief agencies, with operations around the \nworld, further support President Uribe's views. For example, an Oxfam \nreport on the topic found:\n\n       The coffee crisis is becoming a development disaster whose \n     impact will be felt for a long time. Famlies dependent on \n     money generated by coffee are pulling their children, \n     particularly girls, out of school, can no longer afford basic \n     medicines, and are cutting back on food. Beyond farming \n     families, national economies are suffering. Coffee traders \n     are going out of business, some banks are in trouble, and \n     governments that rely on the export revenues that coffee \n     generates are faced with dramatically declining budgets for \n     education and health programs and little money for debt \n     repayment.\n\n  The United States is, by far, the biggest importer of coffee. At the \nsame time, we provide billions of dollars of foreign aid to nations \nimpacted by the coffee crisis. It is common sense. The United States \nhas a strong interest in finding a solution to this international \nproblem.\n  A couple of years ago, several of us in Congress started asking \nquestions about what the administration is doing to address this issue. \nIt is safe to say that we were disappointed with the answers.\n  There are some good programs being run by different agencies within \nthe Government. But, there are so many agencies involved--State, USAID, \nAgriculture, USTR, Treasury--and there are times when one hand does not \nseem to know what the other is doing. For example, USAID has programs \nin Latin America to help coffee farmers find alternative livelihoods, \nbecause of the\n\n[[Page S13131]]\n\noverproduction that exists in the global market. At the same time, we \nfound another program that was encouraging Bolivian farmers to get into \ncoffee production. In other words, two steps forward, one step back.\n  What is worse, the administration does not seem to have a \ncomprehensive strategy across agencies to effectively address the \ninternational coffee crisis. Nothing to get everyone on the same page \nand working towards the same goal. Nothing that outlines a plan on how \nto deal with the crisis.\n  This is not just my opinion, this is the bipartisan, bicameral view \nin Congress.\n  To address these shortcomings, a number of us have come together \nacross party lines and from different sides of the Capitol. We have \npushed hard to move forward on this issue.\n  During the final days of the 107th Congress, I along with Senators \nSpecter, Dodd, and Feinstein, successfully sponsored S. Res. 368, which \ncalled attention to the coffee crisis and urged the administration to \nformulate a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to address the \nproblem. Although this measure passed the Senate, the administration \nhas been slow to respond, and, as a result, we were forced to include a \nprovision in the Fiscal Year 2004 Foreign Operations bill that requires \nthe Secretary of State to report to Congress on any progress made in \nformulating this strategy.\n  To this day, the administration has not come forward with this \nstrategy. While we should take care to make sure this strategy is done \nright, it has taken the administration too long. This is not a \nsituation that will just go away. We have to act, and that makes coming \nforward with a strategy all that more important. I urge the \nadministration to finish the job.\n  Here in the Senate we are doing what we can to respond to the crisis. \nWe were successful in getting the Senate to serve fair trade coffee. \nAnd, I am also pleased to report that we helped USAID and Green \nMountain Coffee enter into a public-private partnership to implement \ndevelopment projects to address the crisis. These were smaller, but \nimportant accomplishments.\n  Other accomplishments include working with the private sector, and \nencouraging major companies such as Procter and Gamble and Dunkin' \nDoughnuts to serve fair trade coffee.\n  Much of the recent debate on the coffee crisis surrounds U.S. \nmembership in the International Coffee Organization (ICO). As Chairman \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I included $500,000 in the \nFiscal Year 2003 Foreign Operations bill for a U.S. contribution to the \nICO, if the United States rejoined by June 1, 2003. This move was \nhailed by a diverse range of groups, including the National Coffee \nAssociation, Oxfam International, several Latin American governments, \nthe Speciality Coffee Association of America, and the Colombian Coffee \nFederation.\n  Unfortunately, this deadline has come and gone with no decision. \nHowever, it triggered a debate within the administration on the issue \nof ICO membership. That debate continues to this day.\n  This is not an indictment on those working on this issue in the \nadministration. To the contrary, those in the State Department, USAID, \nand other agencies working with Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nState, Shaun Donnelly, are talented individuals. They have been \nresponsive to concerns raised by Congress, and I know they are working \nhard to resolve this issue and find a solution to the coffee crisis.\n  To ensure that these funds were not lost, the Commerce-State-Justice \nSubcommittee, under the leadership of Senators Gregg and Hollings, \nhonored my request to include another $500,000 for a contribution to \nthe ICO in the Fiscal Year 2004 CJS Appropriations bill. I applaud \ntheir leadership on this issue. Along with relentless pressure from \nRepresentatives Cass Ballenger and Sam Farr, the help of the Commerce-\nState-Justice Subcommittee sent a clear signal to the administration: \nCongress is not going to go away on this issue.\n  We were recently informed that the State Department supports the U.S. \nmembership in the ICO. This is a positive step, but the administration \nas a whole has yet to endorse this view.\n  What is the hold-up? This process has been dragging on for months. It \nshould end, and the U.S. should rejoin the ICO. This is something that \nU.S. industry, humanitarian NGOs, key friends and allies, and a \nbipartisan group in Congress supports.\n  Some may recall the way the ICO used to operate in the past, working \nas a cartel to stabilize coffee prices. But, nobody is talking about \nrejoining the ICO to establish a cartel over the coffee market. The ICO \nis a reformed organization and its chartering agreement has been \nsubstantially rewritten, specifically to get the ICO out of the \nbusiness of price-fixing. The idea of a coffee cartel is an idea on the \nash heap of history. I would not support it. I suspect no one in this \nChamber would.\n  I support U.S. membership in the ICO, but recognize that is by no \nmeans a silver bullet. Membership alone is not enough to solve the \ninternational coffee crisis. Rather, it is one arrow in the quiver, and \nit can be an effective tool, when used as an integral part of a \ncomprehensive strategy that includes funding for alternative assistance \nfor coffee farmers, working with friends and allies, and the deep \ninvolvement of other international organizations such as the World \nBank. This is the appropriate role for the ICO.\n  There are some compelling reasons for rejoining that have been put \nforward by experts who follow this issue closely. I want to briefly \nsummarize a few of them:\n  U.S. participation in the ICO would help strengthen the \nimplementation of resolution 407, which establishes quality guidelines \non coffee exports. Although not perfect, ICO resolution 407 is a \nserious, multilateral attempt to help address the international coffee \ncrisis that a number of economists believe could have a meaningful \nimpact. According to some industry leaders, it also enhances \ncompetition in the coffee industry.\n  U.S. participation would help the ICO become more effective in \naddressing the coffee crisis. Many European nations have said they \nwould be more willing to invest and commit additional resources to \nresolving this crisis through the ICO, if the U.S. were participating. \nThe European Community (EC) recently called on the U.S. to rejoin. \nBecause the U.S. and EC are not producing nations, this momentum would \nhelp the ICO pursue goals to more effectively address development \nissues associated with the coffee crisis, while helping the ICO \ncontinue to move away from discredited policies of the past.\n  U.S. membership in the ICO would focus more senior level attention, \nand inter-agency cooperation, on this important foreign policy issue \nwithin the administration. This would go a long way in overcoming some \nthe problems stemming from a lack of coordination between agencies that \nI mentioned earlier.\n  The ICO engages in projects to help address the crisis: price risk \nmanagement for Africa, disease control, and market development \nprojects. Moreover, the ICO is also promoting diversification in \ncooperation with multilateral agencies such as the FAO, UNCTAD and the \nWorld Bank. These strategies could all be enhanced through U.S. \nmembership in the ICO.\n  ICO membership would send an important signal to the rest of the \nworld that the United States is committed to working collaboratively on \nevery possible solution to this problem. This would be an important \ndiplomatic step on an issue that many of our friends and allies in the \ndeveloping world care deeply about.\n  Again, the ICO is not a perfect solution. But, if a $500,000 \ncontribution can help begin to solve a crisis that is undermining \nbillions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance, devastating the \nlivelihood of millions of people around the word, and causing severe \neconomic damage to key developing countries, I say its well worth the \ninvestment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13131-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13131-S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF SCOTT OBENSHAIN, M.D.\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. \nScott Obenshain, of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, \nfor his commitment and services to the University and to the people of \nhis State.\n  In his 32 years at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, \nDr. Obenshain has provided the leadership for many innovative \neducational programs that have contributed to the\n\n[[Page S13132]]\n\nschool's reputation as a national and international leader in the field \nof medical education. His loyalty to generations of students, combined \nwith his respect for them as adult learners, is truly commendable. In \naddition, Dr. Obenshain's commitment to education is evidenced in his \npioneering work to improve learning by creating a curriculum that is \nstudent-centered and problem-based.\n  The leadership that Dr. Scott Obenshain has demonstrated at the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of medicine has also had a wide impact \non the quality of undergraduate medical education. Students are treated \nwith the highest respect, and Dr. Obenshain has set a tone of \nexcellence in the education of our students. His example has left a \nlasting impression on innumerable graduates of our medical school. The \ninnovations he began at the University of New Mexico have served as \nmodels for other schools both in the United States and around the \nworld, and many institutions have benefited from the leadership that \nDr. Scott Obenshain has provided over the years.\n  Finally, Dr. Obenshain has demonstrated continuing dedication to \nmeeting the needs of poor, rural, and underserved communities in New \nMexico, and has steadfastly achieved this by including such populations \nin the primary care curriculum. For example, he implemented the rural \nclinical practice component for fourth year medical students in 1974, \nwhich became a requirement for all students soon thereafter.\n  Dr. Scott Obenshain is honored today in the Senate because he has \nserved selflessly and widely, and because he has led with \ndistinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13132-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in every sense of the word, Dr. \nAllen Merritt is a true health care hero for the State of Oregon. Dr. \nMerritt is not only a caring and compassionate pediatrician, but also a \ntireless and dedicated volunteer. His work to serve the physical and \nmental health needs of children, as well as his work to help enact \nimportant state initiatives on behalf of children, serves as an \ninspiration to us all.\n  Dr. Merritt has practiced medicine at St. Charles Medical Center in \nBend, OR, for the last 7 years. Although Dr. Merritt received his \nmedical degree from the University of Kansas, his entry into the Oregon \nmedical community began at Lewis and Clark University where he received \na Certificate in Health Care Administration. Dr. Merritt later received \na Masters of Public Administration in Health Care Administration at \nPortland State University.\n  In Bend, Dr. Merritt serves multiple organizations dedicated to the \nwell-being of children in Deschutes County and throughout the State. \nMost notably, Dr. Merritt serves on the Oregon Commission for Children \nand Families and is a reviewer for the Oregon Board of Medical \nExaminers. Besides serving children as a pediatrician and respected \nstate leader, Dr. Merritt has also dedicated his time and effort to \nnumerous community charities including Project Stepping Stones, which \npromotes infant hearing screenings; The Boys and Girls Club; and, \nDeschutes County Children's Foundation.\n  As the 2003 recipient of the Oregon Medical Association's Doctor-\nCitizen of the Year Award, Dr. Merritt was recognized for his \nimmeasurable contributions to health care in the state of Oregon. For \ndedicating his life's work to the improvement of health care I would \nlike to again recognize Dr. Allen Merritt as an Oregon Health Care \nHero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13132-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO STAFF OF THE DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight a small \nband of employees in my home State who deserve special recognition for \nthe consistent high quality work they do. I am proud and pleased to \nhonor Michelle Thibodeau, Chief of the Disability Determination \nServices office in Helena, MT, and her entire staff. Special \nrecognition must also go to Cathy Surdock who works on youth claims and \nhas been singled out for her excellence.\n  My constituents who face disabilities depend on those at the \nDisability Determination Services office to evaluate their claims and \nissue a fair and timely decision. Issuing these decisions quickly is of \nthe utmost importance and makes a real difference to a lot of \nMontanans. The regional Social Security Administration Commissioner in \nDenver has recognized Montana's Disability Determination Services \noffice for having the Nation's best processing time for claims. The \nHelena office averages 68 days processing time as compared to the \nnational average of 110 days. This important honor is for work \naccomplished during Federal fiscal year 2002. This office won the same \naward for fiscal year 1999. Additionally, in 2001, they were awarded \nthe Commissioner's Citation for Quality. Michelle's office reviews \nabout 12,000 claims for benefits each year, 2000 of which involve \nchildren.\n  This award recognizes the staff ``for exemplary performance in \naccuracy, timeliness and productivity in providing exceptional service \nto Montana's citizens with disabilities.'' Montanans that find \nthemselves physically and mentally challenged are grateful for the \nheroic steps that Michelle's staff has taken to address their needs in \na timely fashion. The professionalism, compassion and technical \nexpertise exhibited by the dedicated staff at the Disability \nDetermination Services office is an example for us all.\n  In closing, I would like to offer my congratulations to Michelle, \nCathy and the entire crew at Disability Determination Services and also \nmy thanks for the good work you do daily. This is just another example \nof neighbor helping neighbor in the great State of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13132-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13132-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13132-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 11:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \nresponsibility for intermodal equipment compliance with commercial \nmotor vehicle safety requirements, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intermodal \nEquipment Safety and Responsibility Act of 2003. This bill is a \ncompanion bill to language originally brought to the floor of the House \nof Representatives by my good friend from South Carolina, \nRepresentative Henry Brown.\n  Every day, literally hundreds of unsafe intermodal chassis carrying \ncontainers leave U.S. ports and travel on our public roads and \nhighways, endangering not only the drivers of these vehicles but also \nthe general public which shares the road with them. This bill will go a \nlong way to ensure that only safe, roadworthy chassis are released for \nuse and remove this often deadly threat to highway safety.\n  This legislation places responsibility for equipment safety and \ncompliance with Federal and State regulations squarely where it \nbelongs--with those who own or control the equipment. Under current \nlaw, the brunt of responsibility for equipment safety and compliance is \nplaced on port drivers. The trucking companies and commerical drivers \nthat service the ports do not own chassis, but are obligated by \nterminal operators to use the chassis provided to transport intermodal \ncontainers to and from the ports. This bill would require equipment \ncontrollers to inspect and repair intermodal equipment to meet all \nsafety regulations prior to offering it for interchange, and to certify \nand document that such inspections have been performed. In addition, it \ngives the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration the authority to \nenter a port facility to review the inspection process and assure \ncompliance.\n  This Act also requires that citations issued for violations related \nto the defective condition of an intermodal chassis that is not owned \nby that motor carrier or driver, will not affect the motor carrier's \noverall safety rating or the motor carrier's driving record.\n  The objective of this legislation is simple: to ensure that equipment \ncontrollers perform regular maintenance on intermodal equipment and \ngive truckers safe and roadworthy equipment in compliance with current \nUSDOT safety regulations. Professional truck drivers are not \nprofessional mechanics, nor should they be. Unfortunately, too many \nequipment controllers do not perform the required systematic inspection \nand maintenance, and truck drivers are expected to find not only \nvisible defects, but also safety defects that are not visible.\n  I am joined by the Colorado Motor Carriers Association, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Longshoreman's \nAssociation, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the \nAmerican Trucking Association and the Truckload Carriers Association \nwho all worked together diligently to reach a consensus of support for \nthis legislation.\n  The traveling American public deserves to be confident that the roads \nthey share with truckers are safe. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intermodal Equipment Safety \n     and Responsibility Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Promoting safety on United States highways is a \n     national priority. The Secretary of Transportation has \n     promulgated\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\n     the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to further this \n     purpose. The systematic maintenance, repair, and inspection \n     of equipment traveling on public highways in interstate \n     commerce are an integral part of this safety regime.\n       (2) Intermodal transportation plays a significant role in \n     expanding the United States economy, which depends heavily \n     upon the ability to transport goods by various modes of \n     transportation.\n       (3) Although motor carriers and their drivers often receive \n     trailers, chassis, containers, and other items of intermodal \n     equipment to be transported in interstate commerce, they do \n     not possess the requisite level of control or authority over \n     this intermodal equipment to perform the systematic \n     maintenance, repair, and inspection necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Regulations and to ensure the safety of United States \n     highways.\n       (4) As a result of roadside inspections, motor carriers and \n     their drivers are cited and fined for violations of the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to \n     intermodal equipment that they do not have the opportunity to \n     systematically maintain. These violations negatively affect \n     the safety records of motor carriers.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that only those \n     parties that control intermodal equipment transported on \n     public highways in the United States (and thus have the \n     opportunity and authority to systematically maintain, repair, \n     and inspect the intermodal equipment) have legal \n     responsibility for the safety of that equipment as it travels \n     in interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 5901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(9) `motor carrier' includes--\n       ``(A) a motor private carrier, as defined in section 13102 \n     of this title; and\n       ``(B) an agent of a motor carrier.\n       ``(10) `intermodal equipment'--\n       ``(A) means equipment that is commonly used in the \n     intermodal transportation of freight over public highways as \n     an instrumentality of foreign or interstate commerce; and\n       ``(B) includes a trailer, chassis, container, and any \n     device associated with a trailer, chassis, or container.\n       ``(11) `equipment interchange agreement', with respect to \n     intermodal equipment, means a written document that--\n       ``(A) is executed by a controller of the equipment, or its \n     agent, and a motor carrier; and\n       ``(B) establishes the responsibilities and liabilities of \n     both parties as they relate to the interchange of the \n     equipment.\n       ``(12) `controller', with respect to intermodal equipment, \n     means any party that has any legal right, title, or interest \n     in the equipment, except that a motor carrier--\n       ``(A) is not a controller of the equipment solely because \n     it provides or arranges for any part of the intermodal \n     transportation of the equipment; and\n       ``(B) may not be considered a controller of the equipment \n     if authority for systematic maintenance and repairs of the \n     equipment has not been delegated to the motor carrier.\n       ``(13) `interchange', with respect to intermodal equipment, \n     means the act of providing the equipment to a motor carrier \n     for the purpose of transporting the equipment for loading or \n     unloading by any party or repositioning the equipment for the \n     benefit of the equipment controller, except that such term \n     does not mean the leasing of the equipment to a motor carrier \n     for use in the motor carrier's over-the-road freight hauling \n     operations.\n       ``(14) `applicable safety regulations' means the \n     regulations applicable to controllers of intermodal equipment \n     under section 5909 of this title.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to authorize a land conveyance between the United \nState and the City of Craig, Alaska, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce along with my \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, an important bill that will facilitate \nForest Service land management on Prince of Wales Island and help \ncommunity expansion and development. The City of Craig is the economic \ncenter of Prince of Wales Island, the third largest island in the \ncountry. The town contains the major retail shopping and service \noutlets on the island and island residents drive up to a hundred miles \nround trip to come to town for medical services and shopping. Craig \nalso has the most active and largest commercial fishing harbor and \nfleet on the island.\n  Due to land selection conflicts between the Forest Service and the \nState of Alaska in the 1960's, the city of Craig received no municipal \nentitlement land. This legislation will help alleviate some of the loss \nto the city from the lack of an entitlement.\n  One of the Forest Service's main administrative facilities, the Craig \nRanger District Station is located in Craig. The Craig Ranger has \nmanagement authority over approximately one million acres on Prince of \nWales Island. It is critical that the Forest Service has the tools it \nneeds to provide good management for that part of the island. One of \nthese tools is the presence of some Federal land near the Craig Ranger \nStation. Right now, there is not any Forest Service land near the \nRanger Station. In an unusual situation for Alaska, the Ranger Station \nis an in holding among private, state, and City owned land.\n  This legislation would provide for a three way conveyance process \nwhich would result in three parcels of land now owned by the City being \nconveyed into the National Forest and an in holding owned by a private \nentity being acquired by the City.\n  To use the vernacular, this is one of those situations people like to \ndescribe as ``win-win.'' Providing a recreational opportunity in the \nForest at Craig benefits the public and the city of Craig would obtain \nland vital to its future community development plan.\n  What our legislation does is authorize the Federal Government to \naccept conveyance of land from the City of Craig and authorize an \nappropriation for land acquisition. The funding would be used by the \ncity of Craig to purchase the private land at Craig. In return the city \nwould convey to the Federal Government up to 346 acres of land it now \nowns to the Tongass National Forest. This land is highly prized for \nlocal recreation and would provide the Craig Ranger District with a \nmissing piece of its management scheme by providing a recreation site \nwithin short walking distance of the Ranger Station.\n  Right now, visitors to the Forest come to the Craig Ranger Station to \norient themselves to the Forest. One of the things they look for is \nonsite recreation in the Forest from the Ranger Station. But there is \nnone. Because of the land conveyance status directly around Craig, \nthere is no Forest land in that area.\n  However, the city of Craig owns almost 350 acres of prime \nrecreational land including a dedicated trail in the immediate vicinity \nfrom the Ranger Station. The Forest should own this land so that it can \nintegrate the parcel into its land management plans.\n  The property to be acquired by the city of Craig is a cannery site \ndating from the early 1900's which has not been used since the early \n1980's. It is prime land for the city to redevelop in\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\norder to improve its community management plan and to provide economic \nstimulus in Craig. The parcel includes both uplands and tidelands and \ncould be used by Craig to develop a good port and harbor and to provide \nfirst class land for retail merchants and other community services.\n  Senator Stevens and I strongly support the needs of Craig in \ndeveloping its local economy.\n  The entire island is in transition. In the early 1980's, the city and \nPrince of Wales Island were the center of a vibrant timber based \neconomy that provided thousands of direct and indirect jobs to the \nIsland. Much of that is now gone as a result of unfortunate Federal \npolicies which have devastated the timber based economy on Prince of \nWales Island and much of Southeastern Alaska.\n  According to unemployment data published by the Alaska Department of \nLabor, unemployment rates in Craig's census area regularly exceed 20 \npercent. Their annual rate of unemployment is typically more than twice \nthe national average.\n  We must help Craig in its transition to another economy. The city \nleaders are dynamic and visionary people who have provided real \nleadership on the island. They have worked hard to help maintain the \nremaining timber plant at Klawock to provide year round employment to \ncity and Island residents. They have organized along with their \nneighbors, the Prince of Wales Community Advisory Council, an \nassociation of municipalities and Native and non Native communities to \nwork as a team on island wide projects.\n  Passage of this legislation is critical to the future of the city of \nCraig. It will provide a great management tool to the Forest Service \nand increase recreational opportunities for the local and visiting \npublic.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in moving forward on this \nlegislation. All of the conveyances in the legislation will be subject \nto appraisals as required by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment will receive equal value in land from the city. The passage \nof this Act is good for the public and for the residents of Craig.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. \n        Stabenow):\n  S. 1779. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for fairness in the provision of medicare services for Indians; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Medicare \nIndian Health Fairness Act of 2003 with Senators Inouye, Daschle, \nMurray, Dayton, Johnson, Cantwell, and Stabenow. This legislation would \ntake a number of steps to improve the delivery of health care to Native \nAmerians through Medicare and the Indian Health Service, IHS, system.\n  First and foremost, Indian Health Service and tribal hospitals and \nclinics, which provide health care to American Indians on or near \nreservations and to Alaska Natives, are currently unable to bill for \nall Medicare Part B services. In effect, the Indian Health Service is \nsubsidizing the Medicare program because those services, which would \notherwise be paid for by Medicare, are instead paid for by IHS, which \nis horribly underfunded.\n  In 2000, IHS hospitals and clinics were made eligible to bill \nMedicare for certain Part B services for the first time, including \nservices delivered by physicians and certain other practitioners, but \nthose services were limited and denied payment for Part B items and \nservices, such as the following: Durable medical equipment--this \nincludes such items as wheelchairs, as well as blood testing strips and \nblood monitors for diabetes patients, which is a severe problem among \nNative Americans; home and some institutional dialysis supplies and \nequipment--since the prevalence of diabetes in American Indians--Alaska \nNatives is three times the rate in the general U.S. population, Indian \npeople experience a high rate of renal disease, including end state \nrenal disease; cancer screening; pap smears; glaucoma screening; clinic \nor hospital-based ambulance services; prosthetic devices; covered \nvaccines, including hepatitis B, pneumococcal and influenza \nchemotherapy drugs; and clinical laboratory services.\n  This legislation would simply make these Indian health facilities and \nproviders eligible for payment for all Part B Medicare-covered items \nand services to the same extent that any other provider would be \neligible for payment.\n  Furthermore, the bill assures that Native Americans should have the \nsame access to Medicare services as any other American. If IHS \nproviders are unable to bill for such Medicare services, IHS budget \nshortfalls may result in rationing and delays in treatment. For some, \nit means going out of the IHS system to get prompt service, as other \nproviders are able to bill the Medicare program. Native Americans and \nIHS providers should not be subject to such barriers to care and \npayment. Nor should they be subject to such complexity, as they are \nonly prohibited from billing and receiving payment for certain Part B \nservices.\n\n  There is absolutely no policy rationale for limiting the payment to \nIHS, tribal hospitals and clinics to only certain Medicare Part B \nservices. I urge the Senate to end this unfortunate disparity.\n  Fortunately, identical language has been included in S. 1, the \nMedicare prescription drug bull that passed the Senate earlier this \nmonth. I offered an amendment with Senator Daschle, amendment No. 973, \non the Senate floor and was pleased that it was accepted by Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus accepted it as part of the manager's \namendment prior to final passage of the bill.\n  In addition to that important provision, the ``Medicare Indian Health \nFairness Act'' includes another provision that was adopted as part of \nS. 1 as a Bingaman amendment during the Finance Committee mark-up. This \nprovision requires Medicare providers to charge no more than Medicare \nrates for inpatient hospital services provided to Indians who are \neligible for contract health services from the Indian Health Service, \ntribally operated health programs, and urban Indian organizations.\n  This allows IHS to maximize its purchase of contract health services, \njust as is done by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nDepartment of Defense. Since the contract health services, CHS, account \nis chronically underfunded, IHS and the tribes seriously ration and \noften exhaust those funds before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal \nyear 2001 alone, the Indian Health Service had insufficient funding to \nprovide services for over 100,000 cases that met its medical priority \ncriteria and denied 22,000 other cases of medically necessary care \nwhich did not meet IHS medical priorities. Therefore, this section of \nthe bill would enable IHS and tribes to achieve greater economy for the \nprovision of contract health services.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector \nGeneral's Cost-Saver Handbook has annually made this recommendation. As \nper its 2003 Red Book or cost-saver handbook reads:\n\n       As a federal purchaser of inpatient health care from the \n     private sector, IHS should receive rates commensurate with \n     those received by other federal agencies that engage in \n     similar purchases [such as the VA and DOD].\n\n  The Inspector General adds:\n\n       If the favorable Medicare rates were legislatively \n     required, the dollars saved could be applied to the backlog \n     of patient services that cannot be accommodated in the \n     Contract Health Services program.\n\n  And last, the legislation includes a section intended to bring a \nmeasure of consistency, rationality and efficiency to the Medicare \npayment rate for all clinics in the Indian Health Service-supported \nhealth care system. This language creates a uniform payment methodology \nthat would be available to all IHS and tribal clinics and corrects the \ncurrent situation where payment rates differ widely--based not on the \nnature of the services a clinic provides, but on whether the facility \nis operated by the IHS or operated by a tribe, and whether the clinic \nis considered provider-based or free-standing. Since all clinics \nprovide primary patient care and arrange for secondary, tertiary and \nspecialty care on a referral basis, there is no rational reason for the \nwide disparity in the Medicare payment methodologies for these \nfacilities.\n  The legislation would give all Indian clinics the ability to collect \nreimbursement from the same IHS-CMS all-inclusive rate. Application of \nthe same\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nall-inclusive rate to all clinics would have the added value of being \nefficient and economical to use at the clinic level and would apply the \nsame payment method in Medicare, by which IHS-funded clinics are \nreimbursed, as they receive in Medicaid.\n  This section of the bill was the only one not included in S. 1, but \nthe rationale for it makes it an important component of this bill and \nsomething we hope to see passed into law as well.\n  Although these provisions address a diversity of problems IHS \nproviders and clinics have with respect to the Medicare program, they \nare critical and we should pass all of these provisions either as part \nof a conference agreement on S. 1, as part of the ``Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act,'' or on their merits through passage of this \nfreestanding bill.\n  I would like to thank Senators Inouye, Daschle, Murray, Dayton, \nJohnson, Cantwell, and Stabenow for being original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation. I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify the \ndefinition of anabolic steroids and to provide for research and \neducation activities relating to steroids and steroid precursors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to introduce, along with my \ngood friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, the distinguished Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the ``Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2003.'' Over \nthe last several weeks, we have read front-page articles on the \ndangerous mix of sports and steroids, including a new ``designer'' \nsteroid tetrahydrogestrinone, known as ``THG.'' Several premier \nathletes have allegedly tested positive for THG, and there is a Federal \ngrand jury investigation into the alleged manufacture and distribution \nof this new substance. Our bill would make THG, and several other \nsimilar substances, subject to the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, \nthese products would no longer be available over the counter. Absent a \nprescription from your doctor, you will not be able to buy them \nlegally.\n  First, a bit of background on how we got here. Thirteen years ago I \nheld a number of hearings on the dangers associated with steroid use \nand introduced legislation to make steroids Schedule III substances. \nAfter my bill became law, a number of steroid users continued to buy \nand use steroids only now they were buying them through a developing \nillicit market. Others relied on new products being developed or \nrediscovered by scientists, products which may not violate the letter \nof the law, but certainly violate the spirit of the law.\n  These substances, called steroid precursors or pro-steroids, are one \nstep removed from the substances scheduled in the law: when ingested, \nthey metabolize into testosterone or other illicit steroids. These are \nproducts which the United States Anti-Doping Agency, the group in \ncharge of testing Olympic athletes for performance enhancing drugs, has \ncalled ``the functional equivalent of steroids.''\n  In writing about the lack of testing for steroid precursor use in \nprofessional baseball, Barry Rozner of the Chicago Daily Herald \ndescribed the close relationship between steroids and steroid \nprecursors. He wrote:\n\n       There's still no testing for andro (androstenedione) \n     because technically it's not a steroid. It's a steroid \n     precursor. Technically a cake mix isn't a cake but as soon as \n     you pour it in a bowl and stick it in the oven, it's a cake. \n     You put andro in the body, mix it with the body's chemicals \n     and let it bake, and it turns into a powerful steroid. If it \n     walks like a duck and talks like a duck, baseball calls it a \n     sparrow.\n\n  The most well known of the steroid precursors is androstenedione \noften called ``andro.'' Most recently Hiram Cruz, a 2001 national judo \nchampion, was suspended from competition for two years after testing \npositive for andro. And it is widely thought that some East German \nOlympic athletes used it in the 1970s and 1980s to improve their \nperformance. But perhaps the substance gained the most notoriety when \nprofessional baseball player Mark McGuire admitted that he used it when \nhe broke Roger Maris's single season record for home runs. After \nMcGuire revealed that he had taken andro, sales of the product \nquadrupled.\n  Andro increases both testosterone and estrogen levels in the body. \nAccording to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation ``orally administered adrostenedione increases serum \ntestosterone and estrogen levels in healthy men, particularly at higher \ndoses.'' The study further notes that ``long-term administration could \nbe hazardous, particularly in women or children.'' Another study showed \nthat even a single 100 milligram dose of andro can yield unhealthy \nlevels of testosterone in women and can increase estrogen levels by 80 \npercent. Andro has also been associated with a decrease in HDL the \n``good'' cholesterol and elevated levels of estradiol which may \nincrease women's risk of breast cancer.\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\n  As I will discuss in greater detail later, in addition to the grave \nhealth effects associated with using andro and other steroid \nprecursors, the physical effects can also be quite serious: women can \ndevelop masculine sex characteristics including changing of the sexual \norgans; men can develop feminine sex characteristics including breast \ndevelopment; and adolescent users can stunt their growth.\n  The International Olympic Committee, the National Football League and \nthe National Collegiate Athletics Association have banned andro \nand other steroid supplements. Other sports, particularly baseball, \nhave been criticized for refusing to agree to test players for steroid \nprecursors. I should note that Major League Baseball has endorsed the \nlegislation I am introducing today. And at a hearing in the Senate \nCommerce Committee last year, Donald Fehr, the Executive Director of \nthe Major League Baseball Players Association, said that ``it may well \nbe time for the Federal Government to revisit whether steroid \nprecursors should also be covered by Schedule III.'' I agree with him. \nInterestingly enough, so do the 79 percent of major league baseball \nplayers and nearly 86 percent of baseball fans who, according to \nsurveys conducted by USA Today last year, support testing for steroids \nand performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n  The USA Today survey also revealed that 80 percent of fans believe \nthat steroid use is behind some of the major league records that have \nbeen broken recently. It is understandable, therefore, that some \nplayers may support testing to preserve the integrity of their records. \nAs Yankees' shortstop Derek Jeter has been quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't have a problem with getting tested because I have \n     nothing to hide. Steroids are a big issue. If anything like a \n     home run or any injury happens, people say it's steroids. \n     That's not fair.\n\n  In my view, it is time for Congress to act so that we can put an end \nto the charade that androstenedione and similar products are any \ndifferent from the anabolic steroids that are controlled under current \nlaw.\n  To be honest I would be less concerned about what professional \nathletes are doing to their bodies if their actions did not have such a \nprofound effect on kids. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation \nrevealed that nearly three-quarters of kids say that they look up to \nand want to emulate professional athletes. Sadly, more than half of \nthose kids believe that their sports heroes use steroids and other \nperformance enhancing drugs to win. That may be why adolescent anabolic \nsteroid use is at its highest level in the past decade, with 1 million \nteens having used them.\n  As Dr. Bernard Greisemer, a pediatrician and sports medicine \nspecialist, testified before the Senate last year, many of these \nproducts are marketed to kids who want to be like their favorite sports \nhero. Dr. Greisemer said:\n\n       [P]rofessional athletes are major role models for our young \n     athletes; in the clothes they wear, the cars they drive, the \n     food they eat, and the drugs and dietary supplements they \n     take. The millions of dollars that are spent by major \n     corporations in linking their products to a particular \n     athlete, team, or sporting event, counter any argument that \n     professional athletes are not affecting the lifestyles of our \n     young athletes. Use of and media exposure of the use of, \n     anabolic steroids in professional athletes also directly \n     affects the interest in, the perception of benefits of, and \n     the use of these substances.\n\n  There are plenty of children and adults who believe that supplements \nwill make them faster and stronger. That they'll have bigger muscles \nand be more like their favorite athlete. That they'll have a \ncompetitive advantage or have what it takes to win. In reality, they \nare jeopardizing their health. The ignorance of the consequences of \nusing these substances is astounding. A study by Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nfound that 70 percent of kids and half of parents surveyed were unable \nto identify even one negative side effect associated with performance-\nenhancing drugs. And 80 percent of kids reported that their parents \nhave never talked to them about the dangers of steroid use. Clearly \nthere is quite a bit of education to be done about these very dangerous \nsubstances.\n  Let me go through just a few of the side effects of steroid use. In \nboth males and females it can lead to increased blood pressure, \nincreased risk of heart attack and stroke, liver and cardiac \ndysfunction, increased libido, aggressiveness and appetite, and acne. \nFor males, steroid use can lead to breast development, premature \nbalding, testicular atrophy, decreased sperm count and prostate \nenlargement. Females can develop masculine sex characteristics \nincluding increased body hair, facial hair, deepening of the voice, \nmale pattern baldness and changes to the sex organs. And among \nadolescent users, steroid precursor use can lead to stunted growth due \nto hardening of cartilage. Many of these side-effects are irreversible.\n  Quite troubling to me is that some people are taking these substances \nunwittingly. It is not unusual for manufacturers of creatine or other \nperformance enhancing substances to put andro or another precursor into \ntheir product to give them a competitive edge over a competitor's \nproducts.\n  Clearly these substances are dangerous and they should not be widely \navailable over the counter. That is why I am joining with Senator Hatch \nand Senator Grassley today to introduce the Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct of 2003.\n  My bill does four things. First, it amends the Anabolic Steroid \nControl Act of 1990 by adding THG, androstenedione and their chemical \ncousins to the list of anabolic steroids controlled under the \nControlled Substances Act and makes it easier for the DEA to add \nsimilar substances to that list in the future. This would prohibit \npeople from obtaining these substances over the counter without a \nprescription in either their pure form or as an additive to another \nproduct.\n  Second, it directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review the \nFederal sentencing guidelines for crimes involving anabolic steroids \nand consider increasing them. Currently, the maximum sentence for \noffenses involving anabolic steroids is only 33-41 months for first \ntime offenders. And to receive the maximum sentence an offender would \nhave to have between 40,000 and 60,000 units, which is defined as a 10 \ncc vial or 50 tablets. That means that someone trafficking 300,000 \ndoses faces a maximum of three and a half year behind bars. That does \nnot seem to be enough of a deterrent and I hope the Sentencing \nCommission will consider raising the guidelines for steroid \ntrafficking.\n  Third, the bill authorizes $15 million for the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to award grants to public and non-profit entities to \ncarry out science-based education programs in elementary and secondary \nschools to highlight the harmful effects of anabolic steroids. \nPreference will be given to programs based on the Athletes Training and \nLearning to Avoid Steroids program (ATLAS), the Athletes Targeting \nHealthy Exercise and Nutrition Alternatives (ATHENA) program, and other \nprograms which the National Institute on Drug Abuse has determined to \nbe effective. ATLAS, which is aimed at male student athletes, has been \nnamed as one of the Department of Education's Exemplary Programs and is \none of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's \nModel Programs. ATHENA is ATLAS's companion program designed for female \nathletes.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto include questions about steroid use in the National Survey on Drug \nUse and Health, an annual survey to measure the extent of alcohol, drug \nand tobacco use in the United States. The bill authorizes $1 million \nfor this purpose.\n  I'm proud to say that the bill has been endorsed by a wide range of \nmedical, athletic and drug policy organizations including: American \nAcademy of Family Physicians; American Academy of Pediatrics; American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; American College for Sports \nMedicine; American Council on Exercise; American Medical Association; \nAssociation of Tennis Professionals; Blue Cross Blue Shield \nAssociation; Boys and Girls Clubs; Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of \nAmerica; Consumer Healthcare Products Association; Council for \nResponsible Nutrition; The Endocrine Society; The Hormone Foundation; \nLittle League; Major League Baseball; National Athletic Trainers \nAssociation; The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University; National Collegiate Athletic Association; National \nFederation of State High Schools Association;\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\nNational Football League; National High School Athletic Coaches \nAssociation; National Junior College Athletic Association; National \nNutritional Foods Association; Pharmacists Planning Services, Inc.; \nUnited States Anti-Doping Agency; U.S. Olympic Committee; U.S. Biathlon \nAssociation; U.S. Soccer Federation; USA Cycling; USA Luge; USA \nSwimming; USA Track and Field and Utah Natural Products Alliance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I hope that it \nwill be enacted into law soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1780\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Biden and \nSenator Hatch as a co-sponsor of the Steroid Control Act of 2003. Our \nyouth need to understand that while the short-term use of steroids may \nseem beneficial, the long-term effects on overall health can be \nextremely harmful or even fatal. Adults need to be more vigilant in \nensuring young people are not able to obtain these dangerous \nsubstances. The Steroid Control Act is an important step in working \ntoward that goal.\n  According to the latest Monitoring the Future Survey, 2.5 percent of \neighth graders, 3.5 percent of tenth graders and 4.0 percent of twelfth \ngraders used steroids at least once during their lifetime. Teens in \nparticular seem to believe the myth that steroid abuse, typically at 10 \nto 100 times what might be prescribed by a doctor, is a quick way to \ngain muscle mass with little cost.\n  But steroid abuse is associated with a range of physical and \nemotional problems. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, \nthe dangers associated with steroid use include liver tumors and \ncancer, jaundice, high blood pressure and increases in cholesterol \nlevels, kidney tumors, fluid retention, and severe acne. Adolescents in \nparticular risk prematurely halting their growth because of early \nskeletal maturation and acceleration of puberty. The emotional problems \nassociated with steroid use include dramatic mood swings, including \nmanic symptoms that can lead to violence called ``roid'' rage, \ndepression, paranoid jealousy, extreme irritability, delusions, and \nimpaired judgment.\n  This Bill makes clarifications to the Steroid Control Act passed in \n1990. It will make it easier to add steroid precursors such as \nandrostenedione, THG, and other similar substances--many of which have \nbeen developed since the Steroid Control Act of 1990 passed in order to \nevade the law--to the list of Schedule III anabolic steroids. In \naddition, it adds a number of known steroid precursors to the anabolic \nsteroid list, and removes the requirement that a substance be proven to \npromote muscle growth.\n  The Steroid Control Act also directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to review the Federal sentencing guidelines for crimes \ninvolving anabolic steroids. It provides an opportunity to conduct \nprevention programs for young students to educate them on the dangers \nof using steroids.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting these important \nreforms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        McCain, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1781. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to promulgate regulations for the reimportation of \nprescription drugs, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access Act of 2003 in the Senate, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Snowe, Stabenow, Johnson, Pryor, Dayton, Leahy, Levin, \nFeingold, McCain, and Jeffords. This legislation is the Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 2427, which passed the House of Representatives by a \nwide, bipartisan 243-186 vote earlier this year.\n  This bill would give Americans the benefit of the global market in \npurchasing FDA-approved medicines. Rather than paying the highest \nprices in the world for their prescription drugs, Americans, through \ntheir local pharmacist or drug wholesaler, should be able to access \nFDA-approved medicines from Canada and 24 other major industrialized \ncountries. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that this \nlegislation would save taxpayers $40.4 billion, including $4.5 billion \nin savings for the Federal Government.\n  As my colleagues know, the conference committee on Medicare currently \nhas before it House and Senate bills that include pharmaceutical market \naccess provisions. My hope is that the Medicare conferees will include \nstrong drug importation language that will give American consumers \nimmediate relief from high drug prices. If not, however, I will fight \nto have this bill called up separately in the Senate at the earliest \navailable opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1782. A bill to provide duty-free treatment for certain tuna; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nis designed to eliminate tariffs on certain tuna products imported into \nthe United States from member nations of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN).\n  ASEAN is a force for stability and development in Southeast Asia and \npursuit of cooperative economic policies is critical to the \nrelationship. The ASEAN nations include countries such as the \nPhilippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia that are valuable trading \npartners and important friends and allies in the ongoing fight against \nworld terrorism.\n  Several of the ASEAN nations import processed tuna imported into the \nUnited States. This includes pouch tuna, which is a relatively new \nproduct that uses an innovative process to vacuum pack tuna into easy \nto use and environmentally friendly airtight pouches for commercial and \nretail sale. A few creative companies, including Jana Brands, Inc. of \nNatick, Massachusetts, pioneered pouch tuna in the United States.\n  Tuna imported from the ASEAN nations is subject to higher tariffs \nupon entry into the United States. A provision was included in the \nTrade Act of 2002 that gives duty-free treatment to pouch but not \ncanned tuna imported from the beneficiary countries of the Andean Trade \nPromotion and Drug Eradication Act. I understand that the Andean Pact \npreferences are intended to increase production and trade with the \nUnited States in certain products and wean their economies away from \nany dependence on the production of crops used to make illegal drugs. I \nsupport the rationale behind the Andean Pact but it is also true that \nduty free treatment for pouch tuna imported from Andean countries puts \npouch tuna imported from ASEAN member nations at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  To restore fair trade and to benefit U.S. consumers and workers, I am \nintroducing the ``Fair Trade in Pouch Tuna Act of 2003''. This bill \nprovides limited duty free treatment for tuna packed in airtight \npouches imported from ASEAN nations that meet internationally \nrecognized labor standards and environmental protections. The \nlegislation requires that these imports come only from ASEAN nations \nthat provide and enforce recognized worker rights and environmental \nprotections.\n  This legislation is just the first step. I look forward to working \nwith the many parties that may be interested in this issue to craft a \nsuccessful proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1783. A bill to provide that transit pass transportation fringe \nbenefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees in the \nNational Capital Region; to allow passenger carriers which are owned or \nleased by the Government to be used to transport Government employees \nbetween their place of employment and mass transit facilities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Federal \nEmployee Commuter Benefits Act of 2003, which is cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Allen. This bill will \nguarantee transit benefits to all Federal employees in the National \nCapital Area and will remove a restriction that currently forbids \nFederal agencies from providing employee shuttles to and from transit \nstations. This measure is an important step forward in our efforts to \nencourage transit ridership and improve the quality of life for Federal \nemployees in the Washington, D.C. region and throughout the nation.\n  All across the Nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\nof economic loss, environmental impact, and personal frustration. \nAccording to the Texas Transportation Institute, in 2001 Americans in \n75 urban areas spent 3.6 billion hours stuck in traffic, with an \nestimated cost to the nation of $69.5 billion in lost time and wasted \nfuel. In response, Americans are turning to alternative transportation \noptions in record numbers. The American Public Transportation \nAssociation estimates that Americans now take over 9 billion trips on \ntransit per year, the highest level in more than 40 years.\n  Transit benefit programs are playing a vital role in increasing \ntransit ridership, which benefits both transit users and drivers. In \n1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century amended the \ntax code to allow financial incentives related to commuting costs for \nemployers and employees. These transit benefits allowed employers to \noffer a tax-free financial incentive toward the costs of transit \ncommuting, starting at $65 per month and raised in 2002 to $100 per \nmonth.\n  Based upon the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, there are clear improvements to \ncongestion, energy efficiency, and air quality from transit benefit \nprograms. According to their findings, an employer with 1,000 employees \nthat participates in a combination of transit benefits, carpool, and \ntelecommuting programs can take credit for taking 175 cars off the \nroad, saving 44,000 gallons of gasoline per year, and cutting global \nwarming pollution by 420 tons per year on average.\n  In April 2000, an Executive Order was signed requiring all executive \nbranch agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit \nbenefits to their employees. As a result, Federal employees commuting \nto Washington, D.C. from Montgomery, Prince George's, and Frederick \nCounties, Maryland, several counties in Northern Virginia, and as far \naway as West Virginia, are encouraged to choose transit as their means \nto get to work.\n  According to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, by 2001 more than 110,000 \nemployees--approximately one-third of all Federal employees in the \nNational Capital Region--joined the Federal transit benefit program \ncreated by the Executive Order. These program participants alone have \neliminated an estimated 12,500 single-occupancy vehicles from \nWashington, D.C. area roads, helping to reduce congestion and improve \nair quality for our region.\n  The Executive Order, however, is limited. It does not cover the more \nthan 100,000 Federal employees in the legislative and judicial \nbranches, and the dozens of independent Federal agencies located in the \nWashington, D.C. region. While many of these organizations provide \ntransit benefits to their employees, the implementation and level of \nbenefit is up to the discretion of individual offices. As such, many of \nthese organizations provide limited benefits or do not provide any \nbenefits at all. Guaranteed transit benefits would give these employees \nmore choice in their commuting options and provide an additional \nincentive to move off our congested roadways and onto public transit.\n  Of course, such incentives will be ineffective if employees lack \naccess to transit services. In my own state of Maryland, the United \nStates Food and Drug Administration planned to use its own resources to \nprovide a shuttle service for its employees from its new White Oak \nfacility to an area Metro station. When they investigated providing \nthis service, FDA officials found that the current law does not allow \nFederal agencies to use their own vehicles to shuttle employees to mass \ntransit stations.\n  The potential impact of this restriction on regional congestion is \nnot insignificant. By 2005, FDA estimates 1,700 employees will work at \nthe new White Oak facility, and plans have been made to eventually \nhouse more than 7,000 FDA researchers and administrators at the new \nfacility. The lack of access from FDA's new campus to a transit station \nrepresents a lost opportunity for reducing congestion, improving our \nenvironment and elevating the quality of life for employees.\n  This type of lost opportunity occurs across the nation. Nationally, \nthe Federal Government employs more than 2.6 million civilian workers \nat more than 3,000 Federal government office buildings. At Federal \noffices throughout the country, transit use is often limited as a \ncommuting option due to lack of employee access to a transit station or \na bus stop.\n  The Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would address both of \nthese issues faced by Federal employees. First, the bill would put into \nlaw the Executive Order's requirement that transit pass benefits be \nmade available to all qualified Federal employees in the National \nCapital Region. The bill also extends the requirement beyond executive \nbranch agencies to include the legislative and judicial branches and \nindependent agencies, providing guaranteed transit benefits to an \nadditional 100,000 employees in the Washington, DC region.\n  Second, the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would remove the \nrestriction that prohibits a Federal agency from operating a shuttle \nservice to a public transit facility. With this legislation, any \nFederal agency, anywhere in the United States, can choose to provide a \ntransit shuttle service for their employees. By providing access to \ncommuting alternatives, Federal agencies will be able to provide a \nbenefit to their employees that can make getting to work easier, more \naffordable, and more employee-friendly. It will also provide an \nopportunity to help reduce congestion and improve air quality across \nthe Nation.\n  Since 1982, the U.S. population has grown 20 percent, but the time \nspent by commuters in traffic has grown 236 percent. Each year, traffic \ncongestion wastes nine billion gallons of fuel. By encouraging Federal \nemployees to look to transit and by providing access to transit \nstations, we can help reduce congestion, improve the environment, and \npromote an improved quality of life.\n  I am introducing the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act because \nof the opportunities it will give Federal agencies to support public \ntransportation, both by providing employee access to transit facilities \nacross the nation, and by providing transit benefits to Federal \nemployees in the Washington, D.C. region. Both of these improvements \nwill aid our efforts to fight congestion and pollution by encouraging \nthe use of transportation alternatives. This legislation is strongly \nsupported by Federal employees, transit providers, and local elected \nofficials, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, along \nwith their letters of support, be printed in the Record. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Federal Employee Commuter \nBenefits Act.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Government Employees, Local No. \n           12, AFL-CIO,\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2003.\n     Hon.

The purpose of H.R. \n     1151 is ``To provide that transit pass transportation fringe \n     benefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees \n     in the National Capital Region; to allow passenger carriers \n     which are owned or leased by the Government to be used to \n     transport Government employees between their place of \n     employment and mass transit facilities, and for other \n     purposes.''\n       H.R. 1151 was introduced by Congressman Jim Moran and is \n     co-sponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, Albert \n     Wynn, Chris Van Hollen, Tom Davis, Steny Hoyer, and Frank \n     Wolf. It has been marked up in the Subcommittee on Civil \n     Service and Agency Organization of the Government Reform \n     Committee.\n       Passage into law of this legislation would not only help \n     employees at the Department of Labor and employees at any \n     other Federal agency in this area where management has \n     decided, for whatever reason, not to offer the tax-free \n     maximum transit subsidy. It would also benefit the region \n     generally by giving\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\n     more Federal employees the incentive to use mass transit, \n     thus helping to lesson traffic congestion and air pollution.\n       If you would like to discuss this further, please call me. \n     Thank you very much for your consideration of this serious \n     matter.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                           Lawrence C. Drake, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington Metropolitan Area\n\n\n                                            Transit Authority,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am pleased to offer the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) endorsement of \n     the legislation you are proposing concerning federal employee \n     commuter benefits. This legislation is very important in \n     supporting regional efforts to use every feasible technique \n     to reduce the severe traffic congestion in the National \n     Capital Region.\n       The recently released Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     report on congestion cites the metropolitan Washington region \n     as the third most congested in the nation, despite intense \n     transit use by commuters in this area. The TTI report cites a \n     number of strategies that help to reduce congestion and the \n     cost of delay to the residents of the region. For the \n     Washington metropolitan area, the TTI report indicates that \n     transit services currently save the metropolitan area more \n     than $1 billion annually in delay costs and almost 42 percent \n     of current delay time. A report issued by the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project (STPP) in 2002 noted that if \n     TTI calculated person trip delay rather than vehicle delay \n     and incorporated transit ridership into the equation, then \n     the Washington metropolitan area congestion ranking would \n     fall from 4th to 31st.\n       The TTI report and the STPP analysis demonstrate the \n     positive affects of transit services on reducing traffic \n     congestion in the Washington metropolitan area. With our \n     assault on traffic congestion, it is essential that we \n     continue to grow transit ridership. It is essential that the \n     federal government as the region's largest employer, \n     employing more than 374,000 people in this area, give \n     employees every incentive to take transit. The tremendously \n     successful transit benefits program, known in this area as \n     Metrochek, is currently required to be offered to civilian \n     and military employees of the Executive Branch and \n     voluntarily provided by the U.S. House and Senate and several \n     independent agencies. Since the imposition of Executive Order \n     13150 on October 1, 2000, the number of federal employees \n     receiving transit benefits has increased 147 percent, from \n     57,000 to 141,000 and 47 percent of Metrorail's peak period \n     riders are federal employees--up from 35 percent in the mid \n     1980s.\n       Your proposal will codify the federal employees transit \n     benefit and expand its eligibility to judicial, legislative \n     and independent agency employees in the National Capital \n     Region. While some of these agencies already participate in \n     the Metrochek program, this legislation ensures that \n     participation will be uniform across all three branches of \n     the federal government.\n       WMATA also supports the proposal to authorize the \n     establishment of federal agency shuttles to and from mass \n     transit facilities. While many federal agencies throughout \n     the region are within walking distance of Metrorail stations, \n     and other transit facilities, some are not. This legislation \n     will make transit accessible to many federal workers for whom \n     transit is not currently a viable alternative because their \n     work site is not convenient to a Metro station.\n       Many thanks for your leadership in proposing this \n     legislation. It is another example in a long list of \n     initiatives you have sponsored to promote public \n     transportation in the National Capital Region and the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. White,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         Maryland Department of Transportation, the Secretary's \n           Office,\n                                    Hanover, MD, October 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, 309 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: It has recently been brought to my \n     attention that you intend to introduce legislation to expand \n     and strengthen existing transit benefits available to federal \n     employees. My understanding is that the proposed bill would \n     accomplish the following: Codify the existing employee \n     transit benefit which is currently an Executive Order; extend \n     the eligibility of transit pass benefits to legislative, \n     judicial branch and independent agency employees in the \n     National Capital Region (estimated to be over 100,000 \n     employees); and allow government vehicles to be used to \n     provide shuttle services between federal agency locations and \n     mass transit facilities.\n       In the past Governor Ehrlich supported providing transit \n     benefits to federal employees. The Ehrlich Administration \n     continues its dedication to reducing congestion and aiding \n     the environment. According to the recently released Texas \n     Transportation Institute Study, the Washington area was \n     ranked third in congestion nationwide, this situation will \n     worsen unless serious measures are taken. Providing \n     additional access and an improved ability to utilize public \n     transportation is the type of sound policy that constitutes \n     the balanced and comprehensive transportation strategy that \n     is critically needed in the fight to relieve traffic \n     congestion.\n       In our view, your proposed bill deserves and receives our \n     support as it would expand coverage of a program that has \n     served the many Maryland citizens residing in the Washington \n     area who are employed by federal departments to those who \n     work for the remaining federal governmental entities. If I \n     may be of additional assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert L. Flanagan,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Virginia Railway Express,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 22, 2003.\n     Hon.Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to you to express my \n     support for your efforts to offer legislation that would \n     provide transit pass transportation fringe benefits to all \n     qualified Federal employees in the National Capital region. \n     As someone who has always been an advocate for the promotion \n     of public transportation and the mobility it affords the \n     citizenry, we are fortunate to have you as the Ranking Member \n     of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs, which oversees mass transit programs.\n       As you have witnessed, increased federal investment in \n     transit under TEA 21 has led to dramatic growth in public \n     transportation ridership, particularly in the National \n     Capital Region. The Virginia Railway Express is a prime \n     example of that growth, with ridership increasing by 18% each \n     year for the past three years, making us one of the fastest \n     growing commuter railroads in America. Nearly 69% of our \n     ridership is comprised of federal and/or military employees \n     working in the region.\n       Currently, transit benefits are offered to a select core of \n     federal employees under Executive Order 13150. The benefit is \n     limited to the executive branch agencies with no requirement \n     for participation by the legislative and judicial branches. \n     Such legislation would codify transit benefits to all \n     eligible federal employees by broadening the scope of \n     participation to another 100,000 workers, thus providing \n     greater flexibility and mobility for the federal work force \n     in the region.\n       Your legislation is significant not only because it affords \n     greater options to our federal workforce, but also because \n     the use of public transit is the only recourse to help \n     relieve the growing problem of traffic congestion in the \n     region. For instance, today VRE transports enough people to \n     remove one lane of traffic off of I-95 and I-66 during peak \n     rush hours in the morning and evening. Not only does it \n     reduce car emissions; thus improving air quality, but also \n     ensures that the federal and private workforce can get to \n     work in a timely fashion; thus saving millions of dollars for \n     employers. The passage of this legislation would only \n     increase these benefits to our region.\n       In conclusion, let me again thank you for all the support \n     that you have given to public transportation over the years \n     and for authoring this much needed legislation. I hope that \n     with your direct involvement that we will be successful in \n     seeing this measure signed into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dale Zehner,\n     Acting Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 1,500 member \n     organizations of the American Public Transportation \n     Association (APTA), I write to express strong support for \n     legislation you are proposing that would expand the use of \n     transit-related commuter tax benefits in the Washington, D.C. \n     region. This legislation will help promote the use of public \n     transportation and thereby support regional efforts to reduce \n     traffic congestion in the National Capital area. We note that \n     a recent report by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     cited the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as the third \n     most congested in the nation.\n       As we understand it, your legislation would codify language \n     currently in an executive order that requires federal \n     executive branch agencies to offer to their employees transit \n     benefits equal to employee commuting costs, up to $100 per \n     month. The legislation would also expand the eligibility of \n     these benefits to legislative and judicial branch employees \n     in the National Capital area.\n       We believe that it is important that the federal government \n     support the use of public transportation in its efforts to \n     reduce congestion, minimize auto pollution, and make the best \n     use of existing public transportation facilities that are \n     built with a substantial federal investment. APTA has been a \n     long-time proponent of providing federal tax incentives that \n     promote public transportation at no less a level than those \n     provided for parking.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this issue. If you have \n     questions, please have your staff contact Rob Healy of APTA's \n     Government Affairs staff at (202) 496-4811 or e-mail \n     rhealy@apta.com. We look forward to\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\n     working with you to see this important legislation enacted \n     into law.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Office of the County Executive,\n\n                            Rockville, Maryland, October 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for introducing companion \n     legislation to H.R. 1151, a bill to address federal employee \n     commuter benefits, including a critical transit provision for \n     a growing number of federal employees working for the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA) at White Oak. This measure will \n     directly benefit thousands of federal employees in the \n     region, and indirectly help Montgomery County at reducing \n     traffic congestion.\n       It is both timely and critical that this legislation be \n     adopted now, given the increased challenges the Washington \n     metropolitan area faces as a result of its recent designation \n     as a severe air quality non-attainment area. As the region \n     struggles to find the appropriate combination of actions \n     necessary to bring air quality into conformity with healthier \n     standards, this legislation can play a pivotal role.\n       Montgomery County has been a leader in encouraging \n     employers to provide transit benefits to their employees. \n     Through an intensive outreach program coupled with cost-\n     sharing incentives, the County raises awareness among \n     employers of the value of such benefits to both employees and \n     the community. For employers considering these options for \n     inclusion in their benefits packages, the context in which \n     they operate is a critical factor in their decision.\n       The federal government, as the largest single employer in \n     the region, plays a crucial role in setting that employment \n     benefits context. It is critical that the federal government \n     continue to provide transit benefits, and expand application \n     of these key benefits to the maximum number of employees \n     possible. By so doing, the federal government establishes the \n     standard against which many other employers in the region \n     measure their own benefits--a standard which has benefits for \n     the people of the Washington region which extend far beyond \n     those provided to the direct recipients.\n       By encouraging ridership to support a robust transit system \n     throughout the region, federal transit benefits help provide \n     accessibility in our transportation system. This is \n     particularly true for the FDA consolidation at White Oak. It \n     is critical that federal employees at FDA-White Oak not only \n     be encouraged to use transit by providing extended transit \n     benefits, but be permitted to travel on federal vehicles from \n     their agency to our local system. Daily shuttle operations \n     between White Oak and the New Carrollton or Silver Spring \n     Metro stations will be a positive contribution toward \n     increasing the security and accessibility of this federal \n     facility, while also promoting transit ridership, and \n     addressing air quality objectives in the region.\n       Again, thank you for your continued efforts to improve the \n     lives of thousands of Montgomery County residents. Please let \n     me know if I can do anything to help you in advancing this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas M. Duncan,\n     County Executive.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Metropolitan Washington\n\n\n                                       Council of Governments,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Capital \n     Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) at the \n     Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, I would like \n     to applaud your introduction of new legislation to codify and \n     expand the existing federal executive branch employee transit \n     benefit in the National Capital Region and allow government \n     vehicles to be used to provide shuttle services between \n     federal agency locations and transit stations.\n       It is TPB policy to support regional, state, and federal \n     programs which promote cost-effective strategies to reduce \n     traffic congestion and improve air quality, including \n     promoting the use of transit options and financial \n     incentives. One of the most pressing issues facing the TPB is \n     the contribution of vehicle emissions to the region's air \n     quality problems. Expanding the transit benefits to more \n     federal workers and providing shuttle links will encourage \n     more transit use, which will help reduce automobile vehicle-\n     miles traveled and reduce vehicle emissions.\n       In June of 2000, the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan \n     Washington Council of Governments (COG) adopted a resolution \n     to provide COG employees the same transit benefits that \n     federal executive branch employees receive as a result of \n     President Clinton's Executive Order of April 2000. It also \n     strongly urged local governments and public agencies to adopt \n     or expand similar transit benefit programs. We have estimated \n     that 50,000 executive branch employees will use transit by \n     2005 as a result of the current transit benefits. Passage of \n     this legislation will encourage even more federal workers to \n     use transit and provide additional support to the region's \n     efforts to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\n       We greatly appreciate your introduction of this \n     legislation. Your ongoing dedication to improving public \n     transit in the Washington region continues to benefit \n     families and organizations in our region.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Peter Shapiro,\n\n                                   Chair, National Capital Region,\n                                    Transportation Planning Board.\n\n                                S. 1783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate the safe-harbor exception for certain \npackaged pseudoephedrine products used in the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Methamphetamine Blister Pack Loophole Elimination Act of 2003,'' \nalong with my colleagues Senators Grassley, Kohl, Biden, Kyl and \nHarkin.\n  This is a simple bill, and directly follows recommendations made by \nthe United States Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2002 study \nrequested by Congress.\n  All this legislation does is make it harder for meth dealers to get \nthe precursor pseudoephedrine products necessary to make this illegal \ndrug.\n  Making it harder for meth dealers to make and obtain their drugs is \nsomething beneficial not just to California, but to the entire Nation.\n  Once predominantly found in the American Southwest, methamphetamine's \npresence now stretches from coast to coast.\n  I'm sorry to say that my home State of California has been referred \nto as the ``Colombia of meth production.'' In fact, our State is known \nas the ``source country'' for the drug, producing roughly 80 percent of \nthe Nation's methamphetamine supply.\n  According to the DEA, 1,847 clandestine meth labs were found in \nCalifornia in 2001 alone.\n  In each of these meth labs across the country, those who make \nmethamphetamine combine a number of precursor drugs, from red \nphosphorus, which is difficult to obtain, highly flammable and toxic, \nto pseudoephedrine, which can be found in common cold medicine in every \nsupermarket, pharmacy, and convenience store in America.\n  Recognizing the easy availability of pseudoephedrine, Congress has \nacted several times to make it more difficult for meth dealers to \npurchase it in bulk.\n  First, we placed a 24-gram limit, which represented almost 1000 \npills. Then, just a few years ago, we reduced this threshold to just 9 \ngrams--still some 366 30-milligram pills. Anyone buying more than this \namount of pseudoephedrine at one time would be required to give his or \nher name and address.\n  As it turns out, this reporting requirement is considered too \nburdensome by most retail stores, so instead of keeping track of \npurchasers, most retailers simply limit single transaction sales of \npseudoephedrine pills to less than 9 grams. This is an even more \nbeneficial result than the reporting requirements. Such limits, which \nnow often go as low as three or even two packages of cold medicine, \nmake it much harder for meth manufacturers to get this precursor drug. \nInstead of simply going to the local WalMart or Costco and clearing the \nshelves of thousands of packages at once, they must now buy just a few \npackages at a time.\n  But through all of this, there is one gaping loophole in the law, \nthat allows any of this product packaged in so-called ``blister-packs'' \nto avoid these reporting requirements. Only loose pills in bottles face \nthe 9-gram restrictions in the law.\n  Blister packs are the most common form of packaging for cold \nmedicine, as anyone who goes grocery shopping knows. Most people who \nbuy pseudoephedrine will find it in blister packs, as will most meth \ndealers. As a result, the 9-gram limit in the law has become fairly \nuseless--we limited the sales of pills, so meth dealers simply migrated \nto blister packs.\n  This loophole in the law exists because of previous doubts, by some, \nthat meth dealers would bother to use blister-packed products. These \nfoil and plastic containers hold each pill individually, and as a \nresult it is harder to gather the thousands of pills necessary to \nmanufacture methamphetamine in bulk.\n  Those of us from California have known for some time that blister \npacks are a problem, because California's Bureau of Narcotic \nEnforcement has been finding blister packs at meth lab sites for years.\n  But to answer the doubts of those not lucky enough to come from my \nhome state, we authorized DEA to do a study into this issue in 1999.\n  Well, that study is back, and guess what--DEA has given us clear, \nincontrovertible evidence that these blister packs are making up an \nincreasing percentage of the pseudoephedrine found at lab sites.\n  In some instances, meth manufacturers use sophisticated, industrial \n``deblistering'' machines to quickly extract pills from blister packs.\n  In others, I have been told, children are employed to sit in the meth \nlab and pop out thousands of pills, by hand, into nearby buckets.\n  According to the report we requested from the DEA, which was released \nin March of 2002, blister packaged pseudoephedrine products seized at \nclandestine methamphetamine laboratories and other locations, such as \ndumpsites, have involved seizures of over a million tablets.\n  The seizure of so many blister packaged pseudoephedrine products \nshows convincingly that blister packaging is not a deterrent to \nordinary, over-the-counter pseudoephedrine use in clandestine \nmethamphetamine laboratories.\n  So clearly, what we argued in 1999, and in 1996, is true. Meth \nmanufacturers are using blister packs, and something must be done to \nstop them as best we can.\n  In order to address this problem, DEA recommended in its report that \nthe blister pack loophole be closed, and that the current retail sales \nlimit of 9 grams for bottled pseudoephedrine be extended to blister \npacked products as well.\n  And that, is all that this bill would do.\n  According to DEA, this is the single best thing we can do to help \nthem in the fight against methamphetamine.\n  This legislation will clear up confusion among retailers who may find \nit hard to train employees to limit the sales of certain cold medicine \nif sold in bottles, but not the same medicine in other packaging.\n  This legislation will help DEA enforce the retail sales thresholds by \nmaking it harder for sellers to claim ignorance or confusion about the \nlaw.\n  This legislation might make it less likely that meth dealers will \nemploy young children to pop pills out of the blister packs, all within \nharms reach in meth labs around the country.\n  This legislation will not negatively impact the ability of \npharmaceutical manufacturers to make legitimate profits.\n  This legislation will not be a burden on consumers, because the 9 \ngram limit still represents 366 pills--30 packages of 12 pills, or 15 \npackages of 24 pills, two of the most common amounts.\n  It is hard for me to imagine that an average person--or even a large \nfamily--needs to buy more than 366 cold pills at one time. In fact, \nmany stores throughout the country have already voluntarily limited \npseudoephedrine sales to just a few packages at a time, and there has \nbeen little outcry from consumers unable to purchase more.\n  This bill is not a panacea for the meth problem in the United \nStates--far from it. I have been working on various parts of the meth \nproblem for many years, and I know that this must be a multi-faceted \napproach--tougher penalties, money for training, enforcement and clean-\nup, restrictions on precursor chemicals, tools for prosecutors, and so \non.\n  But to fail to enact this legislation is to make it far easier for \nmeth dealers to continue to easily ply their trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this bill, join us in supporting it, \nand help us to pass it as soon as possible to assist the DEA in the \nvery uphill battle\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\nagainst the illegal and pervasive manufacture and sale of \nmethamphetamine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Blister Pack \n     Loophole Elimination Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) methamphetamine is a dangerous drug distributed \n     throughout the United States;\n       (2) the manufacture, distribution, and use of \n     methamphetamine results in increased crime, damage to the \n     environment, hazardous waste that endangers the public, \n     expensive cleanup costs often borne by Federal, State, and \n     local government agencies, and broken families;\n       (3) Congress has acted many times to limit the availability \n     of chemicals and equipment used in the manufacturing of \n     methamphetamine;\n       (4) pseudoephedrine is 1 of the basic precursor chemicals \n     used in the manufacture of methamphetamine;\n       (5) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration has \n     indicated that methamphetamine manufacturers often obtain \n     pseudoephedrine from retail and wholesale distributors, in \n     both bottles and ``blister packs'', and that the use of \n     pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packs is pervasive in the \n     illicit production of methamphetamine in both small and large \n     clandestine methamphetamine laboratories;\n       (6) while current law establishes a retail sales limit of 9 \n     grams for most pseudoephedrine products, including common \n     cold medicine, there is no such limit on the sale of blister-\n     packed pseudoephedrine products;\n       (7) the 9 gram limit on bottled pseudoephedrine allows an \n     individual to purchase approximately 366 thirty-milligram \n     tablets at 1 time, which is more than enough for a typical \n     consumer in 1 transaction;\n       (8) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration \n     recommended in March 2002 that retail distribution of \n     pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packages should not be \n     exempt from the 9 gram retail sales limit; and\n       (9) in recommending legislation to correct the current \n     disparity in the law between bottled and blister-packed \n     pseudoephedrine tablets, the United States Drug Enforcement \n     Administration stated that ``The removal of this difference \n     would significantly prevent illicit access to this \n     methamphetamine precursor and would be easier for both the \n     government and the industry to monitor and would increase \n     compliance by retailers''.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF BLISTER PACK EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Regulated Transaction.--Section 102(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa) \n     of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     802(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa)) is amended by striking ``(except \n     that'' and all that follows through ``1996)''.\n       (b) Rule of Law.--To the extent that there exists a \n     conflict between the amendment made by subsection (a) and \n     section 401(d) of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control \n     Act of 1996 (21 U.S.C. 802 note), the amendment shall \n     control.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein \nas a cosponsor of the Methamphetamine Blister Pack Loophool Elimination \nAct of 2003. This legislation will make it harder for meth cooks to get \nan essential ingredient needed to manufacture methamphetamine. \nMethamphetamine is a dangerous narcotic and is a serious challenge \nfacing our country. The manufacture, distribution, and use of \nmethamphetamine has a lasting and devastating personal effect on our \nNation's families, communities, and our environment.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine is \na highly addictive stimulant drug that strongly activates certain \nsystems in the brain by releasing high levels of the neurotransmitter \ndopamine. Some of the short-term effects of using methamphetamine \ninclude: an accelerated heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, \nirritability, extreme nervousness, confusion, insomnia, aggression, \ntremors, convulsions, and hyperthermia, which can potentially result in \ndeath.\n  In addition to the effects on the central nervous system and the \ncardiovascular system, the prolonged use of methamphetamine also has \nmany psychological effects. Some of the symptoms resemble those of \nschizophrenia and are characterized by anger, panic, paranoia, auditory \nand visual hallucinations, and repetitive behavior patterns.\n  Other long-term effects can result in kidney and lung disorders, \nbrain damage, liver damage, blood clots, a deficient immune system and \nchronic depression.\n  The threat of methamphetamine is different than that of most other \nillegal drugs as it can be easily manufactured from readily available \nchemicals and substances. The relative ease of manufacturing and its \nhighly addictive potential has caused methamphetamine use to \ndrastically increase throughout the nation. According to the 2002 \nNational Survey on Drug Abuse and Health 5.3 percent of the U.S. \npopulation--over 12 million people--reported trying methamphetamine at \nleast once in their lifetime.\n  This is an alarming figure. Given the serious ramifications \nsurrounding the use of methamphetamine, we need to be vigilant, making \nsure that we are doing all that we can to curb this dangerous \nstatistic.\n  This bill makes specific clarifications to the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Act of 1996. While current law establishes a retail \nsales limit of 9 grams for most pseudoephedrine products, which is one \nof the basic precursor chemicals used in the manufacturing of \nmethamphetamine, there is no such limit on the sale of ``blister-\npacked'' pseudoephedrine products.\n  The bill we are introducing today follows the recommendation of the \nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration that retail distribution of \npseudoephedrine tablets in blister packages should not be exempt from \nthe 9-gram retail sales limit. This will make it more difficult for \nmethamphetamine producers to obtain large quantities of the precursor \nchemical pseudoephedrine.\n  As Senator Feinstein well knows, the two largest means of acquiring \nprecursor chemicals for methamphetamine in California are by mail order \nand retail sales. This acquisition is made easier because the meth \ncooks are able to exploit the blister pack exemption provision in the \ncurrent law. Removing this exemption will not halt meth production but \nit will make it more difficult for meth cooks to collect the key \ningredients they need.\n  This is not the only answer to this problem, but it is an important \nstep. Law enforcement cannot fix the problem alone. Schools can't do it \nalone. The Federal Government can't do it alone. It is important that \nwe each unite and lead local anti-drug initiatives in our respective \nneighborhoods and communities. I encourage my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting these important reforms. We cannot let this attack on our \nNation's citizens go unchecked.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S.J. Res. 20. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the number of years during which the death tax under subtitle B of \nthe Internal revenue Code of 1986 is repealed should be extended, \npending the permanent repeal of the death tax; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Sense of the Senate \nresolution that states that Congress should add to the number of years \nthat repeal of the death tax will last until we archive its permanent \nrepeal.\n  The death tax is an unfair, inefficient, economically unsound and, \nfrankly, immoral tax that should not come back. I have introduced \nlegislation, S. 13, to repeal it permanently in 2005. Unfortunately, \nunder current law, it will only be repealed for 1 year, in 2010. The \nHouse of Representatives voted four times in the last 2 years to make \nrepeal permanent, but because of Senate rules, we need 60 votes to do \nthis.\n  And so, I propose a resolution that expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat we should add 1 or more years to the 1-year repeal that is on the \nbooks. We could do this by moving the repeal date forward, for example, \nto 2009 or 2008; or we could extend the repeal through 2011 or 2012. \nThis would signal to the American people that we will not let this tax \ncome back.\n  I plan to follow up this resolution with a concerted effort next year \nto in fact add 1 or more years of repeal. We must end this tax on \nvirtue, work, savings, job creation and the American dream, and we must \nend if forever. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13135-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13135-S13148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1776. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \nresponsibility for intermodal equipment compliance with commercial \nmotor vehicle safety requirements, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intermodal \nEquipment Safety and Responsibility Act of 2003. This bill is a \ncompanion bill to language originally brought to the floor of the House \nof Representatives by my good friend from South Carolina, \nRepresentative Henry Brown.\n  Every day, literally hundreds of unsafe intermodal chassis carrying \ncontainers leave U.S. ports and travel on our public roads and \nhighways, endangering not only the drivers of these vehicles but also \nthe general public which shares the road with them. This bill will go a \nlong way to ensure that only safe, roadworthy chassis are released for \nuse and remove this often deadly threat to highway safety.\n  This legislation places responsibility for equipment safety and \ncompliance with Federal and State regulations squarely where it \nbelongs--with those who own or control the equipment. Under current \nlaw, the brunt of responsibility for equipment safety and compliance is \nplaced on port drivers. The trucking companies and commerical drivers \nthat service the ports do not own chassis, but are obligated by \nterminal operators to use the chassis provided to transport intermodal \ncontainers to and from the ports. This bill would require equipment \ncontrollers to inspect and repair intermodal equipment to meet all \nsafety regulations prior to offering it for interchange, and to certify \nand document that such inspections have been performed. In addition, it \ngives the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration the authority to \nenter a port facility to review the inspection process and assure \ncompliance.\n  This Act also requires that citations issued for violations related \nto the defective condition of an intermodal chassis that is not owned \nby that motor carrier or driver, will not affect the motor carrier's \noverall safety rating or the motor carrier's driving record.\n  The objective of this legislation is simple: to ensure that equipment \ncontrollers perform regular maintenance on intermodal equipment and \ngive truckers safe and roadworthy equipment in compliance with current \nUSDOT safety regulations. Professional truck drivers are not \nprofessional mechanics, nor should they be. Unfortunately, too many \nequipment controllers do not perform the required systematic inspection \nand maintenance, and truck drivers are expected to find not only \nvisible defects, but also safety defects that are not visible.\n  I am joined by the Colorado Motor Carriers Association, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Longshoreman's \nAssociation, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the \nAmerican Trucking Association and the Truckload Carriers Association \nwho all worked together diligently to reach a consensus of support for \nthis legislation.\n  The traveling American public deserves to be confident that the roads \nthey share with truckers are safe. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Intermodal Equipment Safety \n     and Responsibility Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Promoting safety on United States highways is a \n     national priority. The Secretary of Transportation has \n     promulgated\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\n     the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to further this \n     purpose. The systematic maintenance, repair, and inspection \n     of equipment traveling on public highways in interstate \n     commerce are an integral part of this safety regime.\n       (2) Intermodal transportation plays a significant role in \n     expanding the United States economy, which depends heavily \n     upon the ability to transport goods by various modes of \n     transportation.\n       (3) Although motor carriers and their drivers often receive \n     trailers, chassis, containers, and other items of intermodal \n     equipment to be transported in interstate commerce, they do \n     not possess the requisite level of control or authority over \n     this intermodal equipment to perform the systematic \n     maintenance, repair, and inspection necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Regulations and to ensure the safety of United States \n     highways.\n       (4) As a result of roadside inspections, motor carriers and \n     their drivers are cited and fined for violations of the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations attributable to \n     intermodal equipment that they do not have the opportunity to \n     systematically maintain. These violations negatively affect \n     the safety records of motor carriers.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that only those \n     parties that control intermodal equipment transported on \n     public highways in the United States (and thus have the \n     opportunity and authority to systematically maintain, repair, \n     and inspect the intermodal equipment) have legal \n     responsibility for the safety of that equipment as it travels \n     in interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to authorize a land conveyance between the United \nState and the City of Craig, Alaska, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce along with my \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, an important bill that will facilitate \nForest Service land management on Prince of Wales Island and help \ncommunity expansion and development. The City of Craig is the economic \ncenter of Prince of Wales Island, the third largest island in the \ncountry. The town contains the major retail shopping and service \noutlets on the island and island residents drive up to a hundred miles \nround trip to come to town for medical services and shopping. Craig \nalso has the most active and largest commercial fishing harbor and \nfleet on the island.\n  Due to land selection conflicts between the Forest Service and the \nState of Alaska in the 1960's, the city of Craig received no municipal \nentitlement land. This legislation will help alleviate some of the loss \nto the city from the lack of an entitlement.\n  One of the Forest Service's main administrative facilities, the Craig \nRanger District Station is located in Craig. The Craig Ranger has \nmanagement authority over approximately one million acres on Prince of \nWales Island. It is critical that the Forest Service has the tools it \nneeds to provide good management for that part of the island. One of \nthese tools is the presence of some Federal land near the Craig Ranger \nStation. Right now, there is not any Forest Service land near the \nRanger Station. In an unusual situation for Alaska, the Ranger Station \nis an in holding among private, state, and City owned land.\n  This legislation would provide for a three way conveyance process \nwhich would result in three parcels of land now owned by the City being \nconveyed into the National Forest and an in holding owned by a private \nentity being acquired by the City.\n  To use the vernacular, this is one of those situations people like to \ndescribe as ``win-win.'' Providing a recreational opportunity in the \nForest at Craig benefits the public and the city of Craig would obtain \nland vital to its future community development plan.\n  What our legislation does is authorize the Federal Government to \naccept conveyance of land from the City of Craig and authorize an \nappropriation for land acquisition. The funding would be used by the \ncity of Craig to purchase the private land at Craig. In return the city \nwould convey to the Federal Government up to 346 acres of land it now \nowns to the Tongass National Forest. This land is highly prized for \nlocal recreation and would provide the Craig Ranger District with a \nmissing piece of its management scheme by providing a recreation site \nwithin short walking distance of the Ranger Station.\n  Right now, visitors to the Forest come to the Craig Ranger Station to \norient themselves to the Forest. One of the things they look for is \nonsite recreation in the Forest from the Ranger Station. But there is \nnone. Because of the land conveyance status directly around Craig, \nthere is no Forest land in that area.\n  However, the city of Craig owns almost 350 acres of prime \nrecreational land including a dedicated trail in the immediate vicinity \nfrom the Ranger Station. The Forest should own this land so that it can \nintegrate the parcel into its land management plans.\n  The property to be acquired by the city of Craig is a cannery site \ndating from the early 1900's which has not been used since the early \n1980's. It is prime land for the city to redevelop in\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\norder to improve its community management plan and to provide economic \nstimulus in Craig. The parcel includes both uplands and tidelands and \ncould be used by Craig to develop a good port and harbor and to provide \nfirst class land for retail merchants and other community services.\n  Senator Stevens and I strongly support the needs of Craig in \ndeveloping its local economy.\n  The entire island is in transition. In the early 1980's, the city and \nPrince of Wales Island were the center of a vibrant timber based \neconomy that provided thousands of direct and indirect jobs to the \nIsland. Much of that is now gone as a result of unfortunate Federal \npolicies which have devastated the timber based economy on Prince of \nWales Island and much of Southeastern Alaska.\n  According to unemployment data published by the Alaska Department of \nLabor, unemployment rates in Craig's census area regularly exceed 20 \npercent. Their annual rate of unemployment is typically more than twice \nthe national average.\n  We must help Craig in its transition to another economy. The city \nleaders are dynamic and visionary people who have provided real \nleadership on the island. They have worked hard to help maintain the \nremaining timber plant at Klawock to provide year round employment to \ncity and Island residents. They have organized along with their \nneighbors, the Prince of Wales Community Advisory Council, an \nassociation of municipalities and Native and non Native communities to \nwork as a team on island wide projects.\n  Passage of this legislation is critical to the future of the city of \nCraig. It will provide a great management tool to the Forest Service \nand increase recreational opportunities for the local and visiting \npublic.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in moving forward on this \nlegislation. All of the conveyances in the legislation will be subject \nto appraisals as required by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment will receive equal value in land from the city. The passage \nof this Act is good for the public and for the residents of Craig.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Cantwell, and Ms. \n        Stabenow):\n  S. 1779. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for fairness in the provision of medicare services for Indians; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Medicare \nIndian Health Fairness Act of 2003 with Senators Inouye, Daschle, \nMurray, Dayton, Johnson, Cantwell, and Stabenow. This legislation would \ntake a number of steps to improve the delivery of health care to Native \nAmerians through Medicare and the Indian Health Service, IHS, system.\n  First and foremost, Indian Health Service and tribal hospitals and \nclinics, which provide health care to American Indians on or near \nreservations and to Alaska Natives, are currently unable to bill for \nall Medicare Part B services. In effect, the Indian Health Service is \nsubsidizing the Medicare program because those services, which would \notherwise be paid for by Medicare, are instead paid for by IHS, which \nis horribly underfunded.\n  In 2000, IHS hospitals and clinics were made eligible to bill \nMedicare for certain Part B services for the first time, including \nservices delivered by physicians and certain other practitioners, but \nthose services were limited and denied payment for Part B items and \nservices, such as the following: Durable medical equipment--this \nincludes such items as wheelchairs, as well as blood testing strips and \nblood monitors for diabetes patients, which is a severe problem among \nNative Americans; home and some institutional dialysis supplies and \nequipment--since the prevalence of diabetes in American Indians--Alaska \nNatives is three times the rate in the general U.S. population, Indian \npeople experience a high rate of renal disease, including end state \nrenal disease; cancer screening; pap smears; glaucoma screening; clinic \nor hospital-based ambulance services; prosthetic devices; covered \nvaccines, including hepatitis B, pneumococcal and influenza \nchemotherapy drugs; and clinical laboratory services.\n  This legislation would simply make these Indian health facilities and \nproviders eligible for payment for all Part B Medicare-covered items \nand services to the same extent that any other provider would be \neligible for payment.\n  Furthermore, the bill assures that Native Americans should have the \nsame access to Medicare services as any other American. If IHS \nproviders are unable to bill for such Medicare services, IHS budget \nshortfalls may result in rationing and delays in treatment. For some, \nit means going out of the IHS system to get prompt service, as other \nproviders are able to bill the Medicare program. Native Americans and \nIHS providers should not be subject to such barriers to care and \npayment. Nor should they be subject to such complexity, as they are \nonly prohibited from billing and receiving payment for certain Part B \nservices.\n\n  There is absolutely no policy rationale for limiting the payment to \nIHS, tribal hospitals and clinics to only certain Medicare Part B \nservices. I urge the Senate to end this unfortunate disparity.\n  Fortunately, identical language has been included in S. 1, the \nMedicare prescription drug bull that passed the Senate earlier this \nmonth. I offered an amendment with Senator Daschle, amendment No. 973, \non the Senate floor and was pleased that it was accepted by Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus accepted it as part of the manager's \namendment prior to final passage of the bill.\n  In addition to that important provision, the ``Medicare Indian Health \nFairness Act'' includes another provision that was adopted as part of \nS. 1 as a Bingaman amendment during the Finance Committee mark-up. This \nprovision requires Medicare providers to charge no more than Medicare \nrates for inpatient hospital services provided to Indians who are \neligible for contract health services from the Indian Health Service, \ntribally operated health programs, and urban Indian organizations.\n  This allows IHS to maximize its purchase of contract health services, \njust as is done by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the \nDepartment of Defense. Since the contract health services, CHS, account \nis chronically underfunded, IHS and the tribes seriously ration and \noften exhaust those funds before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal \nyear 2001 alone, the Indian Health Service had insufficient funding to \nprovide services for over 100,000 cases that met its medical priority \ncriteria and denied 22,000 other cases of medically necessary care \nwhich did not meet IHS medical priorities. Therefore, this section of \nthe bill would enable IHS and tribes to achieve greater economy for the \nprovision of contract health services.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector \nGeneral's Cost-Saver Handbook has annually made this recommendation. As \nper its 2003 Red Book or cost-saver handbook reads:\n\n       As a federal purchaser of inpatient health care from the \n     private sector, IHS should receive rates commensurate with \n     those received by other federal agencies that engage in \n     similar purchases [such as the VA and DOD].\n\n  The Inspector General adds:\n\n       If the favorable Medicare rates were legislatively \n     required, the dollars saved could be applied to the backlog \n     of patient services that cannot be accommodated in the \n     Contract Health Services program.\n\n  And last, the legislation includes a section intended to bring a \nmeasure of consistency, rationality and efficiency to the Medicare \npayment rate for all clinics in the Indian Health Service-supported \nhealth care system. This language creates a uniform payment methodology \nthat would be available to all IHS and tribal clinics and corrects the \ncurrent situation where payment rates differ widely--based not on the \nnature of the services a clinic provides, but on whether the facility \nis operated by the IHS or operated by a tribe, and whether the clinic \nis considered provider-based or free-standing. Since all clinics \nprovide primary patient care and arrange for secondary, tertiary and \nspecialty care on a referral basis, there is no rational reason for the \nwide disparity in the Medicare payment methodologies for these \nfacilities.\n  The legislation would give all Indian clinics the ability to collect \nreimbursement from the same IHS-CMS all-inclusive rate. Application of \nthe same\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nall-inclusive rate to all clinics would have the added value of being \nefficient and economical to use at the clinic level and would apply the \nsame payment method in Medicare, by which IHS-funded clinics are \nreimbursed, as they receive in Medicaid.\n  This section of the bill was the only one not included in S. 1, but \nthe rationale for it makes it an important component of this bill and \nsomething we hope to see passed into law as well.\n  Although these provisions address a diversity of problems IHS \nproviders and clinics have with respect to the Medicare program, they \nare critical and we should pass all of these provisions either as part \nof a conference agreement on S. 1, as part of the ``Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act,'' or on their merits through passage of this \nfreestanding bill.\n  I would like to thank Senators Inouye, Daschle, Murray, Dayton, \nJohnson, Cantwell, and Stabenow for being original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation. I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify the \ndefinition of anabolic steroids and to provide for research and \neducation activities relating to steroids and steroid precursors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to introduce, along with my \ngood friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, the distinguished Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the ``Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2003.'' Over \nthe last several weeks, we have read front-page articles on the \ndangerous mix of sports and steroids, including a new ``designer'' \nsteroid tetrahydrogestrinone, known as ``THG.'' Several premier \nathletes have allegedly tested positive for THG, and there is a Federal \ngrand jury investigation into the alleged manufacture and distribution \nof this new substance. Our bill would make THG, and several other \nsimilar substances, subject to the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, \nthese products would no longer be available over the counter. Absent a \nprescription from your doctor, you will not be able to buy them \nlegally.\n  First, a bit of background on how we got here. Thirteen years ago I \nheld a number of hearings on the dangers associated with steroid use \nand introduced legislation to make steroids Schedule III substances. \nAfter my bill became law, a number of steroid users continued to buy \nand use steroids only now they were buying them through a developing \nillicit market. Others relied on new products being developed or \nrediscovered by scientists, products which may not violate the letter \nof the law, but certainly violate the spirit of the law.\n  These substances, called steroid precursors or pro-steroids, are one \nstep removed from the substances scheduled in the law: when ingested, \nthey metabolize into testosterone or other illicit steroids. These are \nproducts which the United States Anti-Doping Agency, the group in \ncharge of testing Olympic athletes for performance enhancing drugs, has \ncalled ``the functional equivalent of steroids.''\n  In writing about the lack of testing for steroid precursor use in \nprofessional baseball, Barry Rozner of the Chicago Daily Herald \ndescribed the close relationship between steroids and steroid \nprecursors. He wrote:\n\n       There's still no testing for andro (androstenedione) \n     because technically it's not a steroid. It's a steroid \n     precursor. Technically a cake mix isn't a cake but as soon as \n     you pour it in a bowl and stick it in the oven, it's a cake. \n     You put andro in the body, mix it with the body's chemicals \n     and let it bake, and it turns into a powerful steroid. If it \n     walks like a duck and talks like a duck, baseball calls it a \n     sparrow.\n\n  The most well known of the steroid precursors is androstenedione \noften called ``andro.'' Most recently Hiram Cruz, a 2001 national judo \nchampion, was suspended from competition for two years after testing \npositive for andro. And it is widely thought that some East German \nOlympic athletes used it in the 1970s and 1980s to improve their \nperformance. But perhaps the substance gained the most notoriety when \nprofessional baseball player Mark McGuire admitted that he used it when \nhe broke Roger Maris's single season record for home runs. After \nMcGuire revealed that he had taken andro, sales of the product \nquadrupled.\n  Andro increases both testosterone and estrogen levels in the body. \nAccording to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation ``orally administered adrostenedione increases serum \ntestosterone and estrogen levels in healthy men, particularly at higher \ndoses.'' The study further notes that ``long-term administration could \nbe hazardous, particularly in women or children.'' Another study showed \nthat even a single 100 milligram dose of andro can yield unhealthy \nlevels of testosterone in women and can increase estrogen levels by 80 \npercent. Andro has also been associated with a decrease in HDL the \n``good'' cholesterol and elevated levels of estradiol which may \nincrease women's risk of breast cancer.\n\n[[Page S13140]]\n\n  As I will discuss in greater detail later, in addition to the grave \nhealth effects associated with using andro and other steroid \nprecursors, the physical effects can also be quite serious: women can \ndevelop masculine sex characteristics including changing of the sexual \norgans; men can develop feminine sex characteristics including breast \ndevelopment; and adolescent users can stunt their growth.\n  The International Olympic Committee, the National Football League and \nthe National Collegiate Athletics Association have banned andro \nand other steroid supplements. Other sports, particularly baseball, \nhave been criticized for refusing to agree to test players for steroid \nprecursors. I should note that Major League Baseball has endorsed the \nlegislation I am introducing today. And at a hearing in the Senate \nCommerce Committee last year, Donald Fehr, the Executive Director of \nthe Major League Baseball Players Association, said that ``it may well \nbe time for the Federal Government to revisit whether steroid \nprecursors should also be covered by Schedule III.'' I agree with him. \nInterestingly enough, so do the 79 percent of major league baseball \nplayers and nearly 86 percent of baseball fans who, according to \nsurveys conducted by USA Today last year, support testing for steroids \nand performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n  The USA Today survey also revealed that 80 percent of fans believe \nthat steroid use is behind some of the major league records that have \nbeen broken recently. It is understandable, therefore, that some \nplayers may support testing to preserve the integrity of their records. \nAs Yankees' shortstop Derek Jeter has been quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't have a problem with getting tested because I have \n     nothing to hide. Steroids are a big issue. If anything like a \n     home run or any injury happens, people say it's steroids. \n     That's not fair.\n\n  In my view, it is time for Congress to act so that we can put an end \nto the charade that androstenedione and similar products are any \ndifferent from the anabolic steroids that are controlled under current \nlaw.\n  To be honest I would be less concerned about what professional \nathletes are doing to their bodies if their actions did not have such a \nprofound effect on kids. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation \nrevealed that nearly three-quarters of kids say that they look up to \nand want to emulate professional athletes. Sadly, more than half of \nthose kids believe that their sports heroes use steroids and other \nperformance enhancing drugs to win. That may be why adolescent anabolic \nsteroid use is at its highest level in the past decade, with 1 million \nteens having used them.\n  As Dr. Bernard Greisemer, a pediatrician and sports medicine \nspecialist, testified before the Senate last year, many of these \nproducts are marketed to kids who want to be like their favorite sports \nhero. Dr. Greisemer said:\n\n       [P]rofessional athletes are major role models for our young \n     athletes; in the clothes they wear, the cars they drive, the \n     food they eat, and the drugs and dietary supplements they \n     take. The millions of dollars that are spent by major \n     corporations in linking their products to a particular \n     athlete, team, or sporting event, counter any argument that \n     professional athletes are not affecting the lifestyles of our \n     young athletes. Use of and media exposure of the use of, \n     anabolic steroids in professional athletes also directly \n     affects the interest in, the perception of benefits of, and \n     the use of these substances.\n\n  There are plenty of children and adults who believe that supplements \nwill make them faster and stronger. That they'll have bigger muscles \nand be more like their favorite athlete. That they'll have a \ncompetitive advantage or have what it takes to win. In reality, they \nare jeopardizing their health. The ignorance of the consequences of \nusing these substances is astounding. A study by Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nfound that 70 percent of kids and half of parents surveyed were unable \nto identify even one negative side effect associated with performance-\nenhancing drugs. And 80 percent of kids reported that their parents \nhave never talked to them about the dangers of steroid use. Clearly \nthere is quite a bit of education to be done about these very dangerous \nsubstances.\n  Let me go through just a few of the side effects of steroid use. In \nboth males and females it can lead to increased blood pressure, \nincreased risk of heart attack and stroke, liver and cardiac \ndysfunction, increased libido, aggressiveness and appetite, and acne. \nFor males, steroid use can lead to breast development, premature \nbalding, testicular atrophy, decreased sperm count and prostate \nenlargement. Females can develop masculine sex characteristics \nincluding increased body hair, facial hair, deepening of the voice, \nmale pattern baldness and changes to the sex organs. And among \nadolescent users, steroid precursor use can lead to stunted growth due \nto hardening of cartilage. Many of these side-effects are irreversible.\n  Quite troubling to me is that some people are taking these substances \nunwittingly. It is not unusual for manufacturers of creatine or other \nperformance enhancing substances to put andro or another precursor into \ntheir product to give them a competitive edge over a competitor's \nproducts.\n  Clearly these substances are dangerous and they should not be widely \navailable over the counter. That is why I am joining with Senator Hatch \nand Senator Grassley today to introduce the Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct of 2003.\n  My bill does four things. First, it amends the Anabolic Steroid \nControl Act of 1990 by adding THG, androstenedione and their chemical \ncousins to the list of anabolic steroids controlled under the \nControlled Substances Act and makes it easier for the DEA to add \nsimilar substances to that list in the future. This would prohibit \npeople from obtaining these substances over the counter without a \nprescription in either their pure form or as an additive to another \nproduct.\n  Second, it directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review the \nFederal sentencing guidelines for crimes involving anabolic steroids \nand consider increasing them. Currently, the maximum sentence for \noffenses involving anabolic steroids is only 33-41 months for first \ntime offenders. And to receive the maximum sentence an offender would \nhave to have between 40,000 and 60,000 units, which is defined as a 10 \ncc vial or 50 tablets. That means that someone trafficking 300,000 \ndoses faces a maximum of three and a half year behind bars. That does \nnot seem to be enough of a deterrent and I hope the Sentencing \nCommission will consider raising the guidelines for steroid \ntrafficking.\n  Third, the bill authorizes $15 million for the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to award grants to public and non-profit entities to \ncarry out science-based education programs in elementary and secondary \nschools to highlight the harmful effects of anabolic steroids. \nPreference will be given to programs based on the Athletes Training and \nLearning to Avoid Steroids program (ATLAS), the Athletes Targeting \nHealthy Exercise and Nutrition Alternatives (ATHENA) program, and other \nprograms which the National Institute on Drug Abuse has determined to \nbe effective. ATLAS, which is aimed at male student athletes, has been \nnamed as one of the Department of Education's Exemplary Programs and is \none of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's \nModel Programs. ATHENA is ATLAS's companion program designed for female \nathletes.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto include questions about steroid use in the National Survey on Drug \nUse and Health, an annual survey to measure the extent of alcohol, drug \nand tobacco use in the United States. The bill authorizes $1 million \nfor this purpose.\n  I'm proud to say that the bill has been endorsed by a wide range of \nmedical, athletic and drug policy organizations including: American \nAcademy of Family Physicians; American Academy of Pediatrics; American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; American College for Sports \nMedicine; American Council on Exercise; American Medical Association; \nAssociation of Tennis Professionals; Blue Cross Blue Shield \nAssociation; Boys and Girls Clubs; Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of \nAmerica; Consumer Healthcare Products Association; Council for \nResponsible Nutrition; The Endocrine Society; The Hormone Foundation; \nLittle League; Major League Baseball; National Athletic Trainers \nAssociation; The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University; National Collegiate Athletic Association; National \nFederation of State High Schools Association;\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\nNational Football League; National High School Athletic Coaches \nAssociation; National Junior College Athletic Association; National \nNutritional Foods Association; Pharmacists Planning Services, Inc.; \nUnited States Anti-Doping Agency; U.S. Olympic Committee; U.S. Biathlon \nAssociation; U.S. Soccer Federation; USA Cycling; USA Luge; USA \nSwimming; USA Track and Field and Utah Natural Products Alliance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I hope that it \nwill be enacted into law soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1780\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Biden and \nSenator Hatch as a co-sponsor of the Steroid Control Act of 2003. Our \nyouth need to understand that while the short-term use of steroids may \nseem beneficial, the long-term effects on overall health can be \nextremely harmful or even fatal. Adults need to be more vigilant in \nensuring young people are not able to obtain these dangerous \nsubstances. The Steroid Control Act is an important step in working \ntoward that goal.\n  According to the latest Monitoring the Future Survey, 2.5 percent of \neighth graders, 3.5 percent of tenth graders and 4.0 percent of twelfth \ngraders used steroids at least once during their lifetime. Teens in \nparticular seem to believe the myth that steroid abuse, typically at 10 \nto 100 times what might be prescribed by a doctor, is a quick way to \ngain muscle mass with little cost.\n  But steroid abuse is associated with a range of physical and \nemotional problems. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center, \nthe dangers associated with steroid use include liver tumors and \ncancer, jaundice, high blood pressure and increases in cholesterol \nlevels, kidney tumors, fluid retention, and severe acne. Adolescents in \nparticular risk prematurely halting their growth because of early \nskeletal maturation and acceleration of puberty. The emotional problems \nassociated with steroid use include dramatic mood swings, including \nmanic symptoms that can lead to violence called ``roid'' rage, \ndepression, paranoid jealousy, extreme irritability, delusions, and \nimpaired judgment.\n  This Bill makes clarifications to the Steroid Control Act passed in \n1990. It will make it easier to add steroid precursors such as \nandrostenedione, THG, and other similar substances--many of which have \nbeen developed since the Steroid Control Act of 1990 passed in order to \nevade the law--to the list of Schedule III anabolic steroids. In \naddition, it adds a number of known steroid precursors to the anabolic \nsteroid list, and removes the requirement that a substance be proven to \npromote muscle growth.\n  The Steroid Control Act also directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to review the Federal sentencing guidelines for crimes \ninvolving anabolic steroids. It provides an opportunity to conduct \nprevention programs for young students to educate them on the dangers \nof using steroids.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting these important \nreforms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        McCain, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1781. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to promulgate regulations for the reimportation of \nprescription drugs, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access Act of 2003 in the Senate, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Snowe, Stabenow, Johnson, Pryor, Dayton, Leahy, Levin, \nFeingold, McCain, and Jeffords. This legislation is the Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 2427, which passed the House of Representatives by a \nwide, bipartisan 243-186 vote earlier this year.\n  This bill would give Americans the benefit of the global market in \npurchasing FDA-approved medicines. Rather than paying the highest \nprices in the world for their prescription drugs, Americans, through \ntheir local pharmacist or drug wholesaler, should be able to access \nFDA-approved medicines from Canada and 24 other major industrialized \ncountries. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that this \nlegislation would save taxpayers $40.4 billion, including $4.5 billion \nin savings for the Federal Government.\n  As my colleagues know, the conference committee on Medicare currently \nhas before it House and Senate bills that include pharmaceutical market \naccess provisions. My hope is that the Medicare conferees will include \nstrong drug importation language that will give American consumers \nimmediate relief from high drug prices. If not, however, I will fight \nto have this bill called up separately in the Senate at the earliest \navailable opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1782. A bill to provide duty-free treatment for certain tuna; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nis designed to eliminate tariffs on certain tuna products imported into \nthe United States from member nations of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN).\n  ASEAN is a force for stability and development in Southeast Asia and \npursuit of cooperative economic policies is critical to the \nrelationship. The ASEAN nations include countries such as the \nPhilippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia that are valuable trading \npartners and important friends and allies in the ongoing fight against \nworld terrorism.\n  Several of the ASEAN nations import processed tuna imported into the \nUnited States. This includes pouch tuna, which is a relatively new \nproduct that uses an innovative process to vacuum pack tuna into easy \nto use and environmentally friendly airtight pouches for commercial and \nretail sale. A few creative companies, including Jana Brands, Inc. of \nNatick, Massachusetts, pioneered pouch tuna in the United States.\n  Tuna imported from the ASEAN nations is subject to higher tariffs \nupon entry into the United States. A provision was included in the \nTrade Act of 2002 that gives duty-free treatment to pouch but not \ncanned tuna imported from the beneficiary countries of the Andean Trade \nPromotion and Drug Eradication Act. I understand that the Andean Pact \npreferences are intended to increase production and trade with the \nUnited States in certain products and wean their economies away from \nany dependence on the production of crops used to make illegal drugs. I \nsupport the rationale behind the Andean Pact but it is also true that \nduty free treatment for pouch tuna imported from Andean countries puts \npouch tuna imported from ASEAN member nations at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  To restore fair trade and to benefit U.S. consumers and workers, I am \nintroducing the ``Fair Trade in Pouch Tuna Act of 2003''. This bill \nprovides limited duty free treatment for tuna packed in airtight \npouches imported from ASEAN nations that meet internationally \nrecognized labor standards and environmental protections. The \nlegislation requires that these imports come only from ASEAN nations \nthat provide and enforce recognized worker rights and environmental \nprotections.\n  This legislation is just the first step. I look forward to working \nwith the many parties that may be interested in this issue to craft a \nsuccessful proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1783. A bill to provide that transit pass transportation fringe \nbenefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees in the \nNational Capital Region; to allow passenger carriers which are owned or \nleased by the Government to be used to transport Government employees \nbetween their place of employment and mass transit facilities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Federal \nEmployee Commuter Benefits Act of 2003, which is cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Allen. This bill will \nguarantee transit benefits to all Federal employees in the National \nCapital Area and will remove a restriction that currently forbids \nFederal agencies from providing employee shuttles to and from transit \nstations. This measure is an important step forward in our efforts to \nencourage transit ridership and improve the quality of life for Federal \nemployees in the Washington, D.C. region and throughout the nation.\n  All across the Nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\nof economic loss, environmental impact, and personal frustration. \nAccording to the Texas Transportation Institute, in 2001 Americans in \n75 urban areas spent 3.6 billion hours stuck in traffic, with an \nestimated cost to the nation of $69.5 billion in lost time and wasted \nfuel. In response, Americans are turning to alternative transportation \noptions in record numbers. The American Public Transportation \nAssociation estimates that Americans now take over 9 billion trips on \ntransit per year, the highest level in more than 40 years.\n  Transit benefit programs are playing a vital role in increasing \ntransit ridership, which benefits both transit users and drivers. In \n1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century amended the \ntax code to allow financial incentives related to commuting costs for \nemployers and employees. These transit benefits allowed employers to \noffer a tax-free financial incentive toward the costs of transit \ncommuting, starting at $65 per month and raised in 2002 to $100 per \nmonth.\n  Based upon the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, there are clear improvements to \ncongestion, energy efficiency, and air quality from transit benefit \nprograms. According to their findings, an employer with 1,000 employees \nthat participates in a combination of transit benefits, carpool, and \ntelecommuting programs can take credit for taking 175 cars off the \nroad, saving 44,000 gallons of gasoline per year, and cutting global \nwarming pollution by 420 tons per year on average.\n  In April 2000, an Executive Order was signed requiring all executive \nbranch agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit \nbenefits to their employees. As a result, Federal employees commuting \nto Washington, D.C. from Montgomery, Prince George's, and Frederick \nCounties, Maryland, several counties in Northern Virginia, and as far \naway as West Virginia, are encouraged to choose transit as their means \nto get to work.\n  According to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, by 2001 more than 110,000 \nemployees--approximately one-third of all Federal employees in the \nNational Capital Region--joined the Federal transit benefit program \ncreated by the Executive Order. These program participants alone have \neliminated an estimated 12,500 single-occupancy vehicles from \nWashington, D.C. area roads, helping to reduce congestion and improve \nair quality for our region.\n  The Executive Order, however, is limited. It does not cover the more \nthan 100,000 Federal employees in the legislative and judicial \nbranches, and the dozens of independent Federal agencies located in the \nWashington, D.C. region. While many of these organizations provide \ntransit benefits to their employees, the implementation and level of \nbenefit is up to the discretion of individual offices. As such, many of \nthese organizations provide limited benefits or do not provide any \nbenefits at all. Guaranteed transit benefits would give these employees \nmore choice in their commuting options and provide an additional \nincentive to move off our congested roadways and onto public transit.\n  Of course, such incentives will be ineffective if employees lack \naccess to transit services. In my own state of Maryland, the United \nStates Food and Drug Administration planned to use its own resources to \nprovide a shuttle service for its employees from its new White Oak \nfacility to an area Metro station. When they investigated providing \nthis service, FDA officials found that the current law does not allow \nFederal agencies to use their own vehicles to shuttle employees to mass \ntransit stations.\n  The potential impact of this restriction on regional congestion is \nnot insignificant. By 2005, FDA estimates 1,700 employees will work at \nthe new White Oak facility, and plans have been made to eventually \nhouse more than 7,000 FDA researchers and administrators at the new \nfacility. The lack of access from FDA's new campus to a transit station \nrepresents a lost opportunity for reducing congestion, improving our \nenvironment and elevating the quality of life for employees.\n  This type of lost opportunity occurs across the nation. Nationally, \nthe Federal Government employs more than 2.6 million civilian workers \nat more than 3,000 Federal government office buildings. At Federal \noffices throughout the country, transit use is often limited as a \ncommuting option due to lack of employee access to a transit station or \na bus stop.\n  The Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would address both of \nthese issues faced by Federal employees. First, the bill would put into \nlaw the Executive Order's requirement that transit pass benefits be \nmade available to all qualified Federal employees in the National \nCapital Region. The bill also extends the requirement beyond executive \nbranch agencies to include the legislative and judicial branches and \nindependent agencies, providing guaranteed transit benefits to an \nadditional 100,000 employees in the Washington, DC region.\n  Second, the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would remove the \nrestriction that prohibits a Federal agency from operating a shuttle \nservice to a public transit facility. With this legislation, any \nFederal agency, anywhere in the United States, can choose to provide a \ntransit shuttle service for their employees. By providing access to \ncommuting alternatives, Federal agencies will be able to provide a \nbenefit to their employees that can make getting to work easier, more \naffordable, and more employee-friendly. It will also provide an \nopportunity to help reduce congestion and improve air quality across \nthe Nation.\n  Since 1982, the U.S. population has grown 20 percent, but the time \nspent by commuters in traffic has grown 236 percent. Each year, traffic \ncongestion wastes nine billion gallons of fuel. By encouraging Federal \nemployees to look to transit and by providing access to transit \nstations, we can help reduce congestion, improve the environment, and \npromote an improved quality of life.\n  I am introducing the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act because \nof the opportunities it will give Federal agencies to support public \ntransportation, both by providing employee access to transit facilities \nacross the nation, and by providing transit benefits to Federal \nemployees in the Washington, D.C. region. Both of these improvements \nwill aid our efforts to fight congestion and pollution by encouraging \nthe use of transportation alternatives. This legislation is strongly \nsupported by Federal employees, transit providers, and local elected \nofficials, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, along \nwith their letters of support, be printed in the Record. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Federal Employee Commuter \nBenefits Act.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Government Employees, Local No. \n           12, AFL-CIO,\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The American Federation of \n     Government Employees (AFGE) Local 12 represents 4,000 \n     employees at the U.S. Department of Labor in the Washington \n     D.C. metropolitan area.\n       We appreciate very much all the work you have done on \n     behalf of Federal employees, in particular your work to \n     assist our local to have the monthly transit subsidy raised \n     to $100. Unfortunately, Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao \n     continues to deny the $100 transit subsidy to the employees \n     represented by AFGE Local 12. This is why I am writing to you \n     today.\n       We respectfully request that you sponsor and introduce in \n     the Senate a companion bill to H.R. 1151. The purpose of H.R. \n     1151 is ``To provide that transit pass transportation fringe \n     benefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees \n     in the National Capital Region; to allow passenger carriers \n     which are owned or leased by the Government to be used to \n     transport Government employees between their place of \n     employment and mass transit facilities, and for other \n     purposes.''\n       H.R. 1151 was introduced by Congressman Jim Moran and is \n     co-sponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, Albert \n     Wynn, Chris Van Hollen, Tom Davis, Steny Hoyer, and Frank \n     Wolf. It has been marked up in the Subcommittee on Civil \n     Service and Agency Organization of the Government Reform \n     Committee.\n       Passage into law of this legislation would not only help \n     employees at the Department of Labor and employees at any \n     other Federal agency in this area where management has \n     decided, for whatever reason, not to offer the tax-free \n     maximum transit subsidy. It would also benefit the region \n     generally by giving\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\n     more Federal employees the incentive to use mass transit, \n     thus helping to lesson traffic congestion and air pollution.\n       If you would like to discuss this further, please call me. \n     Thank you very much for your consideration of this serious \n     matter.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                           Lawrence C. Drake, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington Metropolitan Area\n\n\n                                            Transit Authority,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am pleased to offer the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) endorsement of \n     the legislation you are proposing concerning federal employee \n     commuter benefits. This legislation is very important in \n     supporting regional efforts to use every feasible technique \n     to reduce the severe traffic congestion in the National \n     Capital Region.\n       The recently released Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     report on congestion cites the metropolitan Washington region \n     as the third most congested in the nation, despite intense \n     transit use by commuters in this area. The TTI report cites a \n     number of strategies that help to reduce congestion and the \n     cost of delay to the residents of the region. For the \n     Washington metropolitan area, the TTI report indicates that \n     transit services currently save the metropolitan area more \n     than $1 billion annually in delay costs and almost 42 percent \n     of current delay time. A report issued by the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project (STPP) in 2002 noted that if \n     TTI calculated person trip delay rather than vehicle delay \n     and incorporated transit ridership into the equation, then \n     the Washington metropolitan area congestion ranking would \n     fall from 4th to 31st.\n       The TTI report and the STPP analysis demonstrate the \n     positive affects of transit services on reducing traffic \n     congestion in the Washington metropolitan area. With our \n     assault on traffic congestion, it is essential that we \n     continue to grow transit ridership. It is essential that the \n     federal government as the region's largest employer, \n     employing more than 374,000 people in this area, give \n     employees every incentive to take transit. The tremendously \n     successful transit benefits program, known in this area as \n     Metrochek, is currently required to be offered to civilian \n     and military employees of the Executive Branch and \n     voluntarily provided by the U.S. House and Senate and several \n     independent agencies. Since the imposition of Executive Order \n     13150 on October 1, 2000, the number of federal employees \n     receiving transit benefits has increased 147 percent, from \n     57,000 to 141,000 and 47 percent of Metrorail's peak period \n     riders are federal employees--up from 35 percent in the mid \n     1980s.\n       Your proposal will codify the federal employees transit \n     benefit and expand its eligibility to judicial, legislative \n     and independent agency employees in the National Capital \n     Region. While some of these agencies already participate in \n     the Metrochek program, this legislation ensures that \n     participation will be uniform across all three branches of \n     the federal government.\n       WMATA also supports the proposal to authorize the \n     establishment of federal agency shuttles to and from mass \n     transit facilities. While many federal agencies throughout \n     the region are within walking distance of Metrorail stations, \n     and other transit facilities, some are not. This legislation \n     will make transit accessible to many federal workers for whom \n     transit is not currently a viable alternative because their \n     work site is not convenient to a Metro station.\n       Many thanks for your leadership in proposing this \n     legislation. It is another example in a long list of \n     initiatives you have sponsored to promote public \n     transportation in the National Capital Region and the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. White,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         Maryland Department of Transportation, the Secretary's \n           Office,\n                                    Hanover, MD, October 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, 309 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: It has recently been brought to my \n     attention that you intend to introduce legislation to expand \n     and strengthen existing transit benefits available to federal \n     employees. My understanding is that the proposed bill would \n     accomplish the following: Codify the existing employee \n     transit benefit which is currently an Executive Order; extend \n     the eligibility of transit pass benefits to legislative, \n     judicial branch and independent agency employees in the \n     National Capital Region (estimated to be over 100,000 \n     employees); and allow government vehicles to be used to \n     provide shuttle services between federal agency locations and \n     mass transit facilities.\n       In the past Governor Ehrlich supported providing transit \n     benefits to federal employees. The Ehrlich Administration \n     continues its dedication to reducing congestion and aiding \n     the environment. According to the recently released Texas \n     Transportation Institute Study, the Washington area was \n     ranked third in congestion nationwide, this situation will \n     worsen unless serious measures are taken. Providing \n     additional access and an improved ability to utilize public \n     transportation is the type of sound policy that constitutes \n     the balanced and comprehensive transportation strategy that \n     is critically needed in the fight to relieve traffic \n     congestion.\n       In our view, your proposed bill deserves and receives our \n     support as it would expand coverage of a program that has \n     served the many Maryland citizens residing in the Washington \n     area who are employed by federal departments to those who \n     work for the remaining federal governmental entities. If I \n     may be of additional assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert L. Flanagan,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Virginia Railway Express,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 22, 2003.\n     Hon.Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to you to express my \n     support for your efforts to offer legislation that would \n     provide transit pass transportation fringe benefits to all \n     qualified Federal employees in the National Capital region. \n     As someone who has always been an advocate for the promotion \n     of public transportation and the mobility it affords the \n     citizenry, we are fortunate to have you as the Ranking Member \n     of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n     Affairs, which oversees mass transit programs.\n       As you have witnessed, increased federal investment in \n     transit under TEA 21 has led to dramatic growth in public \n     transportation ridership, particularly in the National \n     Capital Region. The Virginia Railway Express is a prime \n     example of that growth, with ridership increasing by 18% each \n     year for the past three years, making us one of the fastest \n     growing commuter railroads in America. Nearly 69% of our \n     ridership is comprised of federal and/or military employees \n     working in the region.\n       Currently, transit benefits are offered to a select core of \n     federal employees under Executive Order 13150. The benefit is \n     limited to the executive branch agencies with no requirement \n     for participation by the legislative and judicial branches. \n     Such legislation would codify transit benefits to all \n     eligible federal employees by broadening the scope of \n     participation to another 100,000 workers, thus providing \n     greater flexibility and mobility for the federal work force \n     in the region.\n       Your legislation is significant not only because it affords \n     greater options to our federal workforce, but also because \n     the use of public transit is the only recourse to help \n     relieve the growing problem of traffic congestion in the \n     region. For instance, today VRE transports enough people to \n     remove one lane of traffic off of I-95 and I-66 during peak \n     rush hours in the morning and evening. Not only does it \n     reduce car emissions; thus improving air quality, but also \n     ensures that the federal and private workforce can get to \n     work in a timely fashion; thus saving millions of dollars for \n     employers. The passage of this legislation would only \n     increase these benefits to our region.\n       In conclusion, let me again thank you for all the support \n     that you have given to public transportation over the years \n     and for authoring this much needed legislation. I hope that \n     with your direct involvement that we will be successful in \n     seeing this measure signed into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dale Zehner,\n     Acting Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 1,500 member \n     organizations of the American Public Transportation \n     Association (APTA), I write to express strong support for \n     legislation you are proposing that would expand the use of \n     transit-related commuter tax benefits in the Washington, D.C. \n     region. This legislation will help promote the use of public \n     transportation and thereby support regional efforts to reduce \n     traffic congestion in the National Capital area. We note that \n     a recent report by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     cited the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as the third \n     most congested in the nation.\n       As we understand it, your legislation would codify language \n     currently in an executive order that requires federal \n     executive branch agencies to offer to their employees transit \n     benefits equal to employee commuting costs, up to $100 per \n     month. The legislation would also expand the eligibility of \n     these benefits to legislative and judicial branch employees \n     in the National Capital area.\n       We believe that it is important that the federal government \n     support the use of public transportation in its efforts to \n     reduce congestion, minimize auto pollution, and make the best \n     use of existing public transportation facilities that are \n     built with a substantial federal investment. APTA has been a \n     long-time proponent of providing federal tax incentives that \n     promote public transportation at no less a level than those \n     provided for parking.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this issue. If you have \n     questions, please have your staff contact Rob Healy of APTA's \n     Government Affairs staff at (202) 496-4811 or e-mail \n     rhealy@apta.com. We look forward to\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\n     working with you to see this important legislation enacted \n     into law.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Office of the County Executive,\n\n                            Rockville, Maryland, October 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Thank you for introducing companion \n     legislation to H.R. 1151, a bill to address federal employee \n     commuter benefits, including a critical transit provision for \n     a growing number of federal employees working for the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA) at White Oak. This measure will \n     directly benefit thousands of federal employees in the \n     region, and indirectly help Montgomery County at reducing \n     traffic congestion.\n       It is both timely and critical that this legislation be \n     adopted now, given the increased challenges the Washington \n     metropolitan area faces as a result of its recent designation \n     as a severe air quality non-attainment area. As the region \n     struggles to find the appropriate combination of actions \n     necessary to bring air quality into conformity with healthier \n     standards, this legislation can play a pivotal role.\n       Montgomery County has been a leader in encouraging \n     employers to provide transit benefits to their employees. \n     Through an intensive outreach program coupled with cost-\n     sharing incentives, the County raises awareness among \n     employers of the value of such benefits to both employees and \n     the community. For employers considering these options for \n     inclusion in their benefits packages, the context in which \n     they operate is a critical factor in their decision.\n       The federal government, as the largest single employer in \n     the region, plays a crucial role in setting that employment \n     benefits context. It is critical that the federal government \n     continue to provide transit benefits, and expand application \n     of these key benefits to the maximum number of employees \n     possible. By so doing, the federal government establishes the \n     standard against which many other employers in the region \n     measure their own benefits--a standard which has benefits for \n     the people of the Washington region which extend far beyond \n     those provided to the direct recipients.\n       By encouraging ridership to support a robust transit system \n     throughout the region, federal transit benefits help provide \n     accessibility in our transportation system. This is \n     particularly true for the FDA consolidation at White Oak. It \n     is critical that federal employees at FDA-White Oak not only \n     be encouraged to use transit by providing extended transit \n     benefits, but be permitted to travel on federal vehicles from \n     their agency to our local system. Daily shuttle operations \n     between White Oak and the New Carrollton or Silver Spring \n     Metro stations will be a positive contribution toward \n     increasing the security and accessibility of this federal \n     facility, while also promoting transit ridership, and \n     addressing air quality objectives in the region.\n       Again, thank you for your continued efforts to improve the \n     lives of thousands of Montgomery County residents. Please let \n     me know if I can do anything to help you in advancing this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas M. Duncan,\n     County Executive.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Metropolitan Washington\n\n\n                                       Council of Governments,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Capital \n     Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) at the \n     Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, I would like \n     to applaud your introduction of new legislation to codify and \n     expand the existing federal executive branch employee transit \n     benefit in the National Capital Region and allow government \n     vehicles to be used to provide shuttle services between \n     federal agency locations and transit stations.\n       It is TPB policy to support regional, state, and federal \n     programs which promote cost-effective strategies to reduce \n     traffic congestion and improve air quality, including \n     promoting the use of transit options and financial \n     incentives. One of the most pressing issues facing the TPB is \n     the contribution of vehicle emissions to the region's air \n     quality problems. Expanding the transit benefits to more \n     federal workers and providing shuttle links will encourage \n     more transit use, which will help reduce automobile vehicle-\n     miles traveled and reduce vehicle emissions.\n       In June of 2000, the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan \n     Washington Council of Governments (COG) adopted a resolution \n     to provide COG employees the same transit benefits that \n     federal executive branch employees receive as a result of \n     President Clinton's Executive Order of April 2000. It also \n     strongly urged local governments and public agencies to adopt \n     or expand similar transit benefit programs. We have estimated \n     that 50,000 executive branch employees will use transit by \n     2005 as a result of the current transit benefits. Passage of \n     this legislation will encourage even more federal workers to \n     use transit and provide additional support to the region's \n     efforts to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\n       We greatly appreciate your introduction of this \n     legislation. Your ongoing dedication to improving public \n     transit in the Washington region continues to benefit \n     families and organizations in our region.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Peter Shapiro,\n\n                                   Chair, National Capital Region,\n                                    Transportation Planning Board.\n\n                                S. 1783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate the safe-harbor exception for certain \npackaged pseudoephedrine products used in the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Methamphetamine Blister Pack Loophole Elimination Act of 2003,'' \nalong with my colleagues Senators Grassley, Kohl, Biden, Kyl and \nHarkin.\n  This is a simple bill, and directly follows recommendations made by \nthe United States Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2002 study \nrequested by Congress.\n  All this legislation does is make it harder for meth dealers to get \nthe precursor pseudoephedrine products necessary to make this illegal \ndrug.\n  Making it harder for meth dealers to make and obtain their drugs is \nsomething beneficial not just to California, but to the entire Nation.\n  Once predominantly found in the American Southwest, methamphetamine's \npresence now stretches from coast to coast.\n  I'm sorry to say that my home State of California has been referred \nto as the ``Colombia of meth production.'' In fact, our State is known \nas the ``source country'' for the drug, producing roughly 80 percent of \nthe Nation's methamphetamine supply.\n  According to the DEA, 1,847 clandestine meth labs were found in \nCalifornia in 2001 alone.\n  In each of these meth labs across the country, those who make \nmethamphetamine combine a number of precursor drugs, from red \nphosphorus, which is difficult to obtain, highly flammable and toxic, \nto pseudoephedrine, which can be found in common cold medicine in every \nsupermarket, pharmacy, and convenience store in America.\n  Recognizing the easy availability of pseudoephedrine, Congress has \nacted several times to make it more difficult for meth dealers to \npurchase it in bulk.\n  First, we placed a 24-gram limit, which represented almost 1000 \npills. Then, just a few years ago, we reduced this threshold to just 9 \ngrams--still some 366 30-milligram pills. Anyone buying more than this \namount of pseudoephedrine at one time would be required to give his or \nher name and address.\n  As it turns out, this reporting requirement is considered too \nburdensome by most retail stores, so instead of keeping track of \npurchasers, most retailers simply limit single transaction sales of \npseudoephedrine pills to less than 9 grams. This is an even more \nbeneficial result than the reporting requirements. Such limits, which \nnow often go as low as three or even two packages of cold medicine, \nmake it much harder for meth manufacturers to get this precursor drug. \nInstead of simply going to the local WalMart or Costco and clearing the \nshelves of thousands of packages at once, they must now buy just a few \npackages at a time.\n  But through all of this, there is one gaping loophole in the law, \nthat allows any of this product packaged in so-called ``blister-packs'' \nto avoid these reporting requirements. Only loose pills in bottles face \nthe 9-gram restrictions in the law.\n  Blister packs are the most common form of packaging for cold \nmedicine, as anyone who goes grocery shopping knows. Most people who \nbuy pseudoephedrine will find it in blister packs, as will most meth \ndealers. As a result, the 9-gram limit in the law has become fairly \nuseless--we limited the sales of pills, so meth dealers simply migrated \nto blister packs.\n  This loophole in the law exists because of previous doubts, by some, \nthat meth dealers would bother to use blister-packed products. These \nfoil and plastic containers hold each pill individually, and as a \nresult it is harder to gather the thousands of pills necessary to \nmanufacture methamphetamine in bulk.\n  Those of us from California have known for some time that blister \npacks are a problem, because California's Bureau of Narcotic \nEnforcement has been finding blister packs at meth lab sites for years.\n  But to answer the doubts of those not lucky enough to come from my \nhome state, we authorized DEA to do a study into this issue in 1999.\n  Well, that study is back, and guess what--DEA has given us clear, \nincontrovertible evidence that these blister packs are making up an \nincreasing percentage of the pseudoephedrine found at lab sites.\n  In some instances, meth manufacturers use sophisticated, industrial \n``deblistering'' machines to quickly extract pills from blister packs.\n  In others, I have been told, children are employed to sit in the meth \nlab and pop out thousands of pills, by hand, into nearby buckets.\n  According to the report we requested from the DEA, which was released \nin March of 2002, blister packaged pseudoephedrine products seized at \nclandestine methamphetamine laboratories and other locations, such as \ndumpsites, have involved seizures of over a million tablets.\n  The seizure of so many blister packaged pseudoephedrine products \nshows convincingly that blister packaging is not a deterrent to \nordinary, over-the-counter pseudoephedrine use in clandestine \nmethamphetamine laboratories.\n  So clearly, what we argued in 1999, and in 1996, is true. Meth \nmanufacturers are using blister packs, and something must be done to \nstop them as best we can.\n  In order to address this problem, DEA recommended in its report that \nthe blister pack loophole be closed, and that the current retail sales \nlimit of 9 grams for bottled pseudoephedrine be extended to blister \npacked products as well.\n  And that, is all that this bill would do.\n  According to DEA, this is the single best thing we can do to help \nthem in the fight against methamphetamine.\n  This legislation will clear up confusion among retailers who may find \nit hard to train employees to limit the sales of certain cold medicine \nif sold in bottles, but not the same medicine in other packaging.\n  This legislation will help DEA enforce the retail sales thresholds by \nmaking it harder for sellers to claim ignorance or confusion about the \nlaw.\n  This legislation might make it less likely that meth dealers will \nemploy young children to pop pills out of the blister packs, all within \nharms reach in meth labs around the country.\n  This legislation will not negatively impact the ability of \npharmaceutical manufacturers to make legitimate profits.\n  This legislation will not be a burden on consumers, because the 9 \ngram limit still represents 366 pills--30 packages of 12 pills, or 15 \npackages of 24 pills, two of the most common amounts.\n  It is hard for me to imagine that an average person--or even a large \nfamily--needs to buy more than 366 cold pills at one time. In fact, \nmany stores throughout the country have already voluntarily limited \npseudoephedrine sales to just a few packages at a time, and there has \nbeen little outcry from consumers unable to purchase more.\n  This bill is not a panacea for the meth problem in the United \nStates--far from it. I have been working on various parts of the meth \nproblem for many years, and I know that this must be a multi-faceted \napproach--tougher penalties, money for training, enforcement and clean-\nup, restrictions on precursor chemicals, tools for prosecutors, and so \non.\n  But to fail to enact this legislation is to make it far easier for \nmeth dealers to continue to easily ply their trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this bill, join us in supporting it, \nand help us to pass it as soon as possible to assist the DEA in the \nvery uphill battle\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\nagainst the illegal and pervasive manufacture and sale of \nmethamphetamine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) methamphetamine is a dangerous drug distributed \n     throughout the United States;\n       (2) the manufacture, distribution, and use of \n     methamphetamine results in increased crime, damage to the \n     environment, hazardous waste that endangers the public, \n     expensive cleanup costs often borne by Federal, State, and \n     local government agencies, and broken families;\n       (3) Congress has acted many times to limit the availability \n     of chemicals and equipment used in the manufacturing of \n     methamphetamine;\n       (4) pseudoephedrine is 1 of the basic precursor chemicals \n     used in the manufacture of methamphetamine;\n       (5) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration has \n     indicated that methamphetamine manufacturers often obtain \n     pseudoephedrine from retail and wholesale distributors, in \n     both bottles and ``blister packs'', and that the use of \n     pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packs is pervasive in the \n     illicit production of methamphetamine in both small and large \n     clandestine methamphetamine laboratories;\n       (6) while current law establishes a retail sales limit of 9 \n     grams for most pseudoephedrine products, including common \n     cold medicine, there is no such limit on the sale of blister-\n     packed pseudoephedrine products;\n       (7) the 9 gram limit on bottled pseudoephedrine allows an \n     individual to purchase approximately 366 thirty-milligram \n     tablets at 1 time, which is more than enough for a typical \n     consumer in 1 transaction;\n       (8) the United States Drug Enforcement Administration \n     recommended in March 2002 that retail distribution of \n     pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packages should not be \n     exempt from the 9 gram retail sales limit; and\n       (9) in recommending legislation to correct the current \n     disparity in the law between bottled and blister-packed \n     pseudoephedrine tablets, the United States Drug Enforcement \n     Administration stated that ``The removal of this difference \n     would significantly prevent illicit access to this \n     methamphetamine precursor and would be easier for both the \n     government and the industry to monitor and would increase \n     compliance by retailers''.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF BLISTER PACK EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Regulated Transaction.--Section 102(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa) \n     of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     802(39)(A)(iv)(I)(aa)) is amended by striking ``(except \n     that'' and all that follows through ``1996)''.\n       (b) Rule of Law.--To the extent that there exists a \n     conflict between the amendment made by subsection (a) and \n     section 401(d) of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control \n     Act of 1996 (21 U.S.C. 802 note), the amendment shall \n     control.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein \nas a cosponsor of the Methamphetamine Blister Pack Loophool Elimination \nAct of 2003. This legislation will make it harder for meth cooks to get \nan essential ingredient needed to manufacture methamphetamine. \nMethamphetamine is a dangerous narcotic and is a serious challenge \nfacing our country. The manufacture, distribution, and use of \nmethamphetamine has a lasting and devastating personal effect on our \nNation's families, communities, and our environment.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine is \na highly addictive stimulant drug that strongly activates certain \nsystems in the brain by releasing high levels of the neurotransmitter \ndopamine. Some of the short-term effects of using methamphetamine \ninclude: an accelerated heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, \nirritability, extreme nervousness, confusion, insomnia, aggression, \ntremors, convulsions, and hyperthermia, which can potentially result in \ndeath.\n  In addition to the effects on the central nervous system and the \ncardiovascular system, the prolonged use of methamphetamine also has \nmany psychological effects. Some of the symptoms resemble those of \nschizophrenia and are characterized by anger, panic, paranoia, auditory \nand visual hallucinations, and repetitive behavior patterns.\n  Other long-term effects can result in kidney and lung disorders, \nbrain damage, liver damage, blood clots, a deficient immune system and \nchronic depression.\n  The threat of methamphetamine is different than that of most other \nillegal drugs as it can be easily manufactured from readily available \nchemicals and substances. The relative ease of manufacturing and its \nhighly addictive potential has caused methamphetamine use to \ndrastically increase throughout the nation. According to the 2002 \nNational Survey on Drug Abuse and Health 5.3 percent of the U.S. \npopulation--over 12 million people--reported trying methamphetamine at \nleast once in their lifetime.\n  This is an alarming figure. Given the serious ramifications \nsurrounding the use of methamphetamine, we need to be vigilant, making \nsure that we are doing all that we can to curb this dangerous \nstatistic.\n  This bill makes specific clarifications to the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Act of 1996. While current law establishes a retail \nsales limit of 9 grams for most pseudoephedrine products, which is one \nof the basic precursor chemicals used in the manufacturing of \nmethamphetamine, there is no such limit on the sale of ``blister-\npacked'' pseudoephedrine products.\n  The bill we are introducing today follows the recommendation of the \nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration that retail distribution of \npseudoephedrine tablets in blister packages should not be exempt from \nthe 9-gram retail sales limit. This will make it more difficult for \nmethamphetamine producers to obtain large quantities of the precursor \nchemical pseudoephedrine.\n  As Senator Feinstein well knows, the two largest means of acquiring \nprecursor chemicals for methamphetamine in California are by mail order \nand retail sales. This acquisition is made easier because the meth \ncooks are able to exploit the blister pack exemption provision in the \ncurrent law. Removing this exemption will not halt meth production but \nit will make it more difficult for meth cooks to collect the key \ningredients they need.\n  This is not the only answer to this problem, but it is an important \nstep. Law enforcement cannot fix the problem alone. Schools can't do it \nalone. The Federal Government can't do it alone. It is important that \nwe each unite and lead local anti-drug initiatives in our respective \nneighborhoods and communities. I encourage my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting these important reforms. We cannot let this attack on our \nNation's citizens go unchecked.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S.J. Res. 20. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the number of years during which the death tax under subtitle B of \nthe Internal revenue Code of 1986 is repealed should be extended, \npending the permanent repeal of the death tax; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a Sense of the Senate \nresolution that states that Congress should add to the number of years \nthat repeal of the death tax will last until we archive its permanent \nrepeal.\n  The death tax is an unfair, inefficient, economically unsound and, \nfrankly, immoral tax that should not come back. I have introduced \nlegislation, S. 13, to repeal it permanently in 2005. Unfortunately, \nunder current law, it will only be repealed for 1 year, in 2010. The \nHouse of Representatives voted four times in the last 2 years to make \nrepeal permanent, but because of Senate rules, we need 60 votes to do \nthis.\n  And so, I propose a resolution that expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat we should add 1 or more years to the 1-year repeal that is on the \nbooks. We could do this by moving the repeal date forward, for example, \nto 2009 or 2008; or we could extend the repeal through 2011 or 2012. \nThis would signal to the American people that we will not let this tax \ncome back.\n  I plan to follow up this resolution with a concerted effort next year \nto in fact add 1 or more years of repeal. We must end this tax on \nvirtue, work, savings, job creation and the American dream, and we must \nend if forever. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13148-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 250--COMMENDING THE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF ROMANIA, \n ON THE OCCASION OF THE VISIT OF ROMANIAN PRESIDENT ION ILIESCU TO THE \n UNITED STATES, FOR THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS THEY HAVE MADE WITH RESPECT \n   TO ECONOMIC REFORM AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FOR THE \n       STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROMANIA AND THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hatch, and \nMr. McCain) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 250\n\n       Whereas, in 1995, Romania joined with the United States and \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to provide \n     assistance to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) deployed to \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina to support peace, security, and \n     freedom in the western Balkans;\n       Whereas, in 1999, Romania joined with the United States and \n     NATO member countries to provide assistance for Operation \n     Allied Force to use military force in order to halt the \n     genocide, known as ethnic cleansing, that was taking place in \n     Kosovo;\n       Whereas, after the conclusion of Operation Allied Force, \n     Romania provided support to democracy activists from the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in their successful efforts to \n     end the rule of Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic, and \n     also provided support to NATO stabilization forces deployed \n     in Kosovo Force (KFOR);\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks upon the United \n     States in September 2001, the Government of Romania \n     immediately expressed its sympathy for Americans and others \n     killed in the attacks and pledged its full support in \n     fighting the war on terror;\n       Whereas, on September 19, 2001, the Romanian Parliament \n     voted to open Romanian territory and airspace to United \n     States Armed Forces involved in Operation Enduring Freedom in \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas thousands of American aircraft flew through \n     Romanian airspace during the combat phase of Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, and continue to do so as part of peace-\n     building efforts;\n       Whereas, beginning on June 2002, Romanian aircraft flew \n     Romanian soldiers to serve in Afghanistan as part of the \n     forces involved in Operation Enduring Freedom and the \n     International Security Assistance Force, and over 500 elite \n     Romanian soldiers are currently stationed in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas Romania stood with the United States as a vital \n     member of the international coalition in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom by offering diplomatic, political, and military \n     support;\n       Whereas, in a January 31, 2003, letter to President George \n     W. Bush, President Ion Iliescu of Romania stated that \n     ``Romania can understand that aggressive dictators cannot be \n     appeased or ignored, but always be opposed. Romanians indeed \n     know the value of freedom and living in peace. They have seen \n     the face of evil embodied in communism and deeply share your \n     conviction, expressed in the State of the Union address, that \n     `free people will set the course of history' '';\n       Whereas, on February 12, 2003, the Romanian Parliament \n     voted to open Romanian territory and airspace to United \n     States Armed Forces carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas hundreds of American aircraft flew through Romanian \n     airspace and landed at Romanian airfields during the combat \n     phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom from May to July 2003;\n       Whereas thousands of United States soldiers were stationed \n     and transported into the Iraq theatre of operations from \n     Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, and the neighboring Black Sea \n     port of Constantza was also used in the fall of 2002 and \n     spring of 2003 for rotating United States Armed Forces and \n     equipment in and out of the Balkans;\n       Whereas, beginning on March 12, 2003, Romania began \n     deploying military forces to Iraq to assist in building \n     security, peace, and democracy, and over 750 Romanian \n     soldiers are currently stationed in Iraq;\n       Whereas the Government of Romania has spent more than \n     $160,000,000 during the past two years to fund its \n     participation in SFOR, KFOR, Operation Enduring Freedom, the \n     International Security Assistance Force, and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       Whereas, together with Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, Romania successfully \n     achieved the military, economic, and political reforms \n     necessary to be invited, at the November 2002 summit meeting \n     in Prague of the North Atlantic Council, to join the NATO \n     alliance;\n       Whereas, in his historic address at Piata Revolutiei on \n     November 23, 2002, President Bush told the Romanian people \n     that ``Romania has made a historic journey. Instead of \n     hatred, you have chosen tolerance.

And instead of dictatorship, you have built \n     a proud and working democracy.''; and\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2003, the Senate voted 96 to 0 to \n     approve the resolution of advice and consent to the Protocols \n     to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of \n     Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \n     Slovenia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the support expressed by the people of \n     Romania for strong and vibrant relations between the United \n     States and Romania;\n       (2) recognizes the steps the Government of Romania has \n     taken and continues to take in economic, political, and \n     social reforms, including reforms to improve protections of \n     the rights of minorities and to promote awareness and \n     understanding of the Holocaust;\n       (3) commends Romania for its leadership and commitment in \n     promoting regional peace and security in the Balkan and Black \n     Sea regions;\n       (4) values the participation of a significant number of \n     Romanian troops and civilian experts in Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the permission granted \n     by the Government of Romania for the United States to use \n     Romanian airspace and territory, and the deployment of \n     Romanian military forces in support of Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, all of which have been \n     important contributions to the global war on terror and serve \n     as a tangible and ongoing demonstration of Romania's \n     commitment as an ally of the United States;\n       (5) supports further cooperation between the United States \n     and Romania in the process of stabilizing and reconstructing \n     Iraq, including the utilization of Romania's experience \n     emerging from a Communist dictatorship and creating a \n     functioning democracy and free market economy;

Con. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas Down syndrome affects people of all races and \n     economic levels;\n       Whereas Down syndrome is the most frequently occurring \n     chromosomal abnormality;\n       Whereas 1 in every 800 to 1,000 children is born with Down \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas more than 350,000 people in the United States have \n     Down syndrome;\n       Whereas 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each \n     year;\n       Whereas as the mortality rate associated with Down syndrome \n     in the United States decreases, the prevalence of individuals \n     with Down syndrome in the United States will increase;\n       Whereas some experts project that the number of people with \n     Down syndrome will double by 2013;\n       Whereas individuals with Down syndrome are becoming \n     increasingly integrated into society and community \n     organizations, such as school, health care systems, work \n     forces, and social and recreational activities;\n       Whereas more and more people in the United States interact \n     with individuals with Down syndrome, increasing the need for \n     widespread public acceptance and education; and\n       Whereas a greater understanding of Down syndrome and \n     advancements in treatment of Down syndrome-related health \n     problems have allowed people with Down syndrome to enjoy \n     fuller and more active lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a \n     commemorative postage stamp to promote public awareness of \n     Down syndrome; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative United States \npostage stamp should be issued to promote public awareness of Down \nsyndrome and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to \nthe Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued. I am honored to be \njoined by Senator Cornyn, Senator Bayh, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Inouye in this effort.\n  Down syndrome is a genetic condition usually caused by an error in \ncell division called non-disjunction. Regardless of the type of Down \nsyndrome a person may have, all people with Down syndrome have an \nextra, critical portion of the number 21 chromosome present in all, or \nsome, of their cells. This additional genetic material alters the \ncourse of development and causes the characteristics associated with \nthe syndrome.\n  Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. It is \nthe most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality, occurring once \nout of every 800 to 1,000 births. In the United States, more than \n350,000 people have Down syndrome. Nearly 5,000 children with Down \nsyndrome are born each year. Because the mortality rate connected with \nDown syndrome is decreasing, the number of individuals with Down \nsyndrome in our society is increasing. Some experts predict that the \nprevalence of individuals with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 \nyears, further increasing the need for public acceptance and education \nabout this genetic condition.\n  October is designated as Down Syndrome Awareness Month, so this is an \nappropriate time to demonstrate support for people with Down syndrome \nand encourage greater inclusion and acceptance in our society. I \nencourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this meaningful resolution and \nassist our efforts to convince the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee \nto recommend the issuance of a postage stamp promoting public awareness \nof Down syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13149-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13149-S13150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1899.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of \n     Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the \n     ``CAN-SPAM Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and \n     popular means of communication, relied on by millions of \n     Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial \n     purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely \n     convenient and efficient, and offer unique opportunities for \n     the development and growth of frictionless commerce.\n       (2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are \n     threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account \n     for over 45 percent of all electronic mail traffic, up from \n     an estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to \n     rise. Most of these unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.\n       (3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (4) The receipt of a large number of unsolicited messages \n     also decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates \n     a risk\n\n[[Page S13177]]\n\n     that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial and \n     noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded amidst \n     the larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing the \n     reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the \n     recipient.\n       (5) Some unsolicited commercial electronic mail contains \n     material that many recipients may consider vulgar or \n     pornographic in nature.\n       (6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet \n     access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       (7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully disguise the source of such mail.\n       (8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully include misleading information in the message's \n     subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the \n     messages.\n       (9) While some senders of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients \n     to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, \n     other senders provide no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or \n     refuse to honor the requests of recipients not to receive \n     electronic mail from such senders in the future, or both.\n       (10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of \n     electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet \n     websites or online services where users must post their \n     addresses in order to make full use of the website or \n     service.\n       (11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to \n     regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, \n     but these statutes impose different standards and \n     requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been \n     successful in addressing the problems associated with \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, \n     since an electronic mail address does not specify a \n     geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-\n     abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate \n     statutes they are required to comply.\n       (12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and \n     abuse of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be \n     solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and \n     adoption of technological approaches and the pursuit of \n     cooperative efforts with other countries will be necessary as \n     well.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail on a \n     nationwide basis;\n       (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of \n     such mail; and\n       (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Affirmative consent.--The term ``affirmative consent'', \n     when used with respect to a commercial electronic mail \n     message, means that--\n       (A) the recipient expressly consented to receive the \n     message, either in response to a clear and conspicuous \n     request for such consent or at the recipient's own \n     initiative;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As directed by Congress in section 723 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), as added by \n     section 305 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-104; 110 Stat. 126), the Federal Communications \n     Commission adopted rules requiring closed captioning of most \n     television programming, which gradually require new video \n     programming to be fully captioned beginning in 2006.\n       (2) More than 28,000,000 Americans, or 8 percent of the \n     population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing, and many \n     require captioning services to participate in mainstream \n     activities.\n       (3) More than 24,000 children are born in the United States \n     each year with some form of hearing loss.\n       (4) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and a study done by the National Council on Aging--\n       (A) 25 percent of Americans over 65 years old are hearing \n     impaired;\n       (B) 33 percent of Americans over 70 years old are hearing \n     impaired; and\n       (C) 41 percent of Americans over 75 years old are hearing \n     impaired.\n       (5) The National Council on Aging study also found that \n     depression in older adults may be directly related to hearing \n     loss and disconnection with the spoken word.\n       (6) Empirical research demonstrates that captions improve \n     the performance of individuals learning to read English and, \n     according to numerous Federal agency statistics, could \n     benefit--\n       (A) 3,700,000 remedial readers;\n       (B) 12,000,000 young children learning to read;\n\n[[Page S13182]]\n\n       (C) 27,000,000 illiterate adults; and\n       (D) 30,000,000 people for whom English is a second \n     language.\n       (7) Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs \n     that train court reporters to become realtime writers has \n     decreased significantly, causing such programs to close on \n     many campuses.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 251, which was \nintroduced by Senator Brownback earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 251) designating October 27, 2003, as \n     ``International Religious Freedom Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues and the \nAmerican people to seriously consider the state of religious freedom \naround the globe.\n  Exactly 5 years ago we passed groundbreaking legislation aimed at \ncombating international religious persecution. The International \nReligious Freedom Act of 1998 only established the U.S. Commission on \nReligious Freedom and the International Religious Freedom Office at the \nDepartment of State, but it brought the issue of the religious \npersecution to the forefront of foreign policy initiatives. Religious \npersecution remains one of the leading violations of human rights in \nour world today. It is particularly important that on the 5 year \nanniversary of the passage of this bill, we remind the world of our \ncommitment to promote religious liberty for all people.\n  This Nation, founded by those seeking to adopt, believe, worship, \nobserve, teach, and practice their religion, has declared in the first \namendment that, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . \n.'' And over time, the United States was joined by other countries in \nsigning numerous declaration and international agreements specifically \nacknowledging the universal human right to freedom of religion.\n  Despite the great achievements we have made concerning religious \nliberty, we can not close the book on the millions that still suffer \npersecution. I remind my colleagues that persecution often includes \nimprisonment, torture, forced conversion, rape and even death. In \nVietnam, Christians are forced to drink the blood of animals and \ndenounce their faith. In Uzbekistan, Muslims who do not conform to the \ngovernment-prescribed ideas are imprisoned and often tortured. \nThousands of religious minorities in India have been killed by \nextremist majority groups because of their faith. We continue to hear \nstories from China, North Korea, Sudan, Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan, \nTurkmenistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Burma, Tibet, and the list goes on.\n  The people of Afghanistan and Iraq are currently faced with the \nchallenge of incorporating religious freedom into the drafting of their \nnew constitutions. As I have said before, religious freedom is the \nbedrock upon which democracy, hope and progress rest. Additionally, \nreligious freedom is more than just the ability to practice one's \nfaith, but it is central to other rights and freedoms, including a free \npress, public assembly, freedom of speech or the right to petition the \ngovernment. All of these freedoms will be circumscribed if religious \nfreedom is not part of the new constitutions being drafted in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. The time is ripe to unite and continue our work \non behalf of the millions that have endured their own plight from \nreligious persecution.\n  As we remember our victory 5 years ago, let us not forget the crucial \nwork on religious liberty that remains at the forefront of foreign \npolicy today. I hope that this resolution calling for the designation \nof ``International Religious Freedom Day'' on October 27, 2003 can be \nquickly considered and approved by my colleagues.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 52, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 52) recognizing the Dr. \n     Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry, an affiliate \n     of the Smithsonian Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, as the \n     official national museum of dentistry in the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, H.J. Res. 52 recognizes the Dr. Samuel \nD. Harris National Museum of Dentistry in Baltimore as the official \nnational museum of dentistry in the United States. It passed the House \nunanimously and is a companion measure to legislation I introduced in \nthe Senate, together with Senator Mikulski, S.J. Res. 12.\n  The principal purpose of this legislation is to help educate the \npublic about the critical importance of oral health\n\n[[Page S13184]]\n\nto the overall health of all Americans. Three years ago, U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral David Satcher issued a comprehensive report entitled ``Oral \nHealth in America,'' which identified the problem of dental and oral \ndisease as a ``silent epidemic'' facing the country. The report called \nfor the development of a National Oral Health Plan, and recommended \nthat actions be taken to ``change perceptions regarding oral health and \ndisease so that oral health becomes an accepted component of general \nhealth.'' By designating an official national museum and learning \ncenter dedicated to dentistry, this legislation takes an important step \ntoward the achievement of this goal.\n  The Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry is the largest \nand most comprehensive museum of dentistry in this country, and, \nindeed, the world. An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, the \nMuseum sits on the grounds of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, \nfounded in 1840 as the world's first dental college. With over 7,000 \nsquare feet of exhibit space, the Museum showcases the people, objects, \nand events that created and defined the dental profession, including \none of George Washington's famed ivory dentures. The Museum's vast \narchives also act as an important resource for research and serious \nacademic study of dentistry's past, with a unique collection of \nhistorical dental journals and other one-of-a-kind documents.\n  By designating the Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry as \nthe official national museum of dentistry, we will not only recognize \nthe critical role that dentists and oral health professionals have \nplayed in the history of our Nation's health care system, but enhance \nawareness and understanding of the importance of dentistry to public \nhealth.\n  I urge adoption of the legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be read three times and passed; that the preamble be agreed \nto; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all with no \nintervening action or debate; and that any statements relating to this \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 52) was read three times and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13184-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL CANCER PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 252) designating the month of \n     February 2004 as ``National Cancer Prevention Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, cancer is a disease that affects \nfamilies of all backgrounds in all parts of the country. This year over \n550,000 individuals will lose their life due to this terrible illness. \nWhile we must continue to pursue promising avenues of research that \nwill hopefully lead to a cure, individuals can take a number steps to \nreduce their risk of acquiring cancer.\n  Research shows that proper nutrition, adequate physical activity, \nsmoking cessation, and receiving timely screening procedures can all \nreduce cancer occurrences. Unfortunately, many Americans do not take \nthis advice and many others are unaware of the steps they can to help \nprevent cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that nutritional \nfactors and tobacco use contribute to approximately two-thirds of \ncancer deaths. In addition many individuals neglect early detection \nprocedures. Only 50 percent of individuals receive the recommended \nscreening for colon cancer, only 60 percent of men receive a timely \nprostate-specific antigen test, and 70 percent of women receive \nrecommended mammographies.\n  Today I submitted a resolution to declare February 2004 as National \nCancer Prevention Month. It is my hope that communities across the \ncountry will take this opportunity to educate one another on the steps \nthey can take to prevent cancer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and the preamble be agreed to en bloc; that the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, without any intervening action or \ndebate; and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 252) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

For the information of all Senators, following morning \nbusiness, it is the hope of the majority leader to proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 227, H.R. 2800, the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. There will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's \nsession. As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed today on the Leavitt \nnomination to be Administrator of EPA. That vote will be the first vote \non Monday and will occur at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could briefly respond to my dear friend \nfrom Kentucky, I think today is an example of a very productive day in \nthe Senate. Not only were we able to complete an important \nappropriations bill but we were also able to get to some other matters \nthat have been in the works for some time, such as fair credit \nreporting. It was very difficult to get it\n\n[[Page S13185]]\n\nin its present position. I think we are in a position now where that \nbill can be completed. It will not be easy, but I think with a lot of \nvery heavy lifting, we can complete that most important legislation. \nThe vast majority of Senators on this side certainly want to move \nforward.\n  On behalf of the Democratic leader, I say we should use this as a \nguide to having a smaller omnibus bill. There are appropriations bills \nthat we can complete. We have done some very good work. There are five \nremaining appropriations bills. The leader is moving to one of them \ntomorrow. I think we can complete that in a relatively short period of \ntime.\n  Usually we are moaning about how little we have gotten done, how slow \nthings have gone, but when one comes to the Senate, they do not enter a \ndrag race. It is more of a long race every day. I think we were able to \naccomplish a great deal in the race we had today.\n  As I said before, it is an example of how we can have a smaller \nomnibus bill and complete some other important issues in the few \nremaining days of this year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly agree with my friend from Nevada. We had a \nproductive day. Let's hope we can do that again each day next week and \nmake further progress for completing our work for the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/23/senate-section/article/S13185-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
