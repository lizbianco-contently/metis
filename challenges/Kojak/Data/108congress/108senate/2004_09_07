Mr. President, first, let me welcome everybody back from \nwhat I hope was a safe and productive August break. It seems as if only \na few days ago we were here on the floor finishing our work prior to \nour recess. Since that time, we have had the two party conventions, and \nour colleagues have been spending time with their constituents and with \nfamily and friends.\n  Today, we will resume our Senate business with a period of morning \nbusiness to allow Senators to make statements and to introduce \nlegislation. A number of colleagues have expressed their desire to come \nto the floor, and we will coordinate an informal schedule of speakers \nover the course of this afternoon.\n  Under the consent agreement reached prior to the recess, at 5 p.m. \ntoday we will proceed to executive session for debate on two district \ncourt nominations. Those nominations are Virginia Maria Hernandez \nCovington, of Florida, to be a U.S. district judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida, and Michael Schneider, of Texas, to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Texas. The Senate will vote \non the confirmation of those judicial nominations at 5:30 today, and \nthose will be the first votes of the day.\n  Following those votes, we will consider the nomination of Michael \nWatson, of Ohio, to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District \nof Ohio. I do not anticipate a rollcall vote to be necessary on the \nWatson nomination; therefore, the two votes at 5:30 today should be the \nonly rollcall votes of the day.\n  I know there are colleagues who are ready to speak; therefore, I will \ndefer some longer opening comments to about 30 minutes from now. I \nwould say at this time that our plans are to begin consideration of the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill tomorrow morning. I am discussing \nwith the Democratic leadership an agreement to allow us to move quickly \non that legislation. Again, I will have more to say on the Senate \nschedule in about 30 or 45 minutes.\n  With that, Mr. President, I look forward to a productive legislative \nperiod.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8811-6", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleague, the majority leader, \nin welcoming all of our colleagues back, and also our staff and a new \nclass of pages who are starting today. We are pleased they could join \nus. We know they will be enjoying their experience, and we are \ndelighted they could be here as we begin this important business.\n  I had the opportunity to talk with Senator Frist briefly this \nmorning. He and I come to the floor this morning with the realization \nthat, with what limited time is left, we must do what our eloquent \nChaplain has just prayed we would do; that is, we find the common \nground required to deal with the array of legislative challenges that \nwe face as a Senate body and as a country.\n  It would be my hope we could do what the majority leader has \nsuggested, which is to begin deliberations on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill very early in the session, hopefully as early as \ntomorrow. I will be discussing this matter and other scheduling issues \nwith our caucus and our leadership tomorrow morning, but I can say, \neven having not had the benefit of those discussions, there is a great \ndeal of interest in working with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to achieve completion of the Homeland Security bill, as we \nhave called for now for a couple of months.\n  We also have, of course, 11 other appropriations bills that have not \nyet reached completion. Most have not\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\neven been considered on the Senate floor. It would be my hope we could \ndevote all of our energy, all of our attention, all of the effort at \naddressing that need. We are only 3 weeks away from the end of this \nfiscal year, and clearly a lot of work has to be done if we are going \nto be able to complete our work on time.\n  So the appropriations bills, especially the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, need our attention. I will say publicly what I \nhave already said privately to the majority leader: that he can count \non our cooperation and partnership as we address that bill in \nparticular.\n  There are also a number of bills in conference. The highway bill \nought to be completed this month. The FSC bill, the foreign sales \ncredit bill, the Energy bill, the Defense bill--all of those bills need \nattention, need completion. So we have a lot of work to do.\n  It would certainly be my hope our Republican colleagues would send \nthe right message not only to all of us on this side of the aisle but \nto the country about their determination to put those priorities first. \nWe can always score cheap political points, but I hope we would resist \nthat temptation on both sides of the aisle and get on with the work of \nthe Senate and the country in a way that will accomplish this very \nextraordinarily long list of legislative challenges and needs that we \nface as we begin our session.\n  I also note we will be taking up additional judicial nominations, I \nam sure. The three judges confirmed today will bring the total for this \nadministration to 201, which is the fourth highest member of judges \never confirmed in a single term. I think it goes again to the \nextraordinary cooperation the administration has received on \nnominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8812-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8812-S8813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MAKING THE 9/11 COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS LAW\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have a lot more to say about \nnominations in coming days, but I want to focus, if I may, on just one \nmatter that I think deserves real attention this month. I have also \ndiscussed this matter with the majority leader. It has to do with the \nrecommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.\n  On November 27, 2002, when the President signed the law that created \nthe National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, he \nsaid:\n\n       I expect that the Commission's final report will contain \n     important recommendations for steps that can be taken to \n     improve our preparedness for and responses to terrorist \n     attacks in the future.\n\n  Twenty months, over 1,000 interviews, 12 public hearings, millions of \npages of documents reviewed later, the Commission has put together \nthose important recommendations--41 in all. Few of the recommendations \nare new. Many are obvious. Yet none are law. The ideas are there. The \nleadership has been lacking. It is up to us, with the time we have now, \nto provide that leadership.\n  Congress is back in session for less than 2 months. The single most \nimportant thing we can do is make the American agenda the Senate's \nagenda, and we need to put security first. That means putting at the \ntop of our legislative agenda the two items that carry with them an \nurgency that is unique to our time and our challenges: the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission and the funding necessary to \nincrease homeland security.\n  The last months have only heightened concerns about the threat of \nterrorism.\n  In early August, the Secretary of Homeland Security raised the terror \nalert level from elevated to high, putting Washington, DC, New York, \nand New Jersey on orange alert.\n  Also last month, two airliners crashed nearly simultaneously in an \nincident that appears to have been caused by midair explosions.\n  Last week the world witnessed the terrible hostage standoff at a \nRussian school and the tragic consequences that resulted.\n  In those last two incidents, other nations were targets. And yet we \nknow that America is a target. The question for every Member of \nCongress is, have we done enough to improve our Nation's security?\n  Three high-level government reports all sanctioned by the Bush \nadministration--conclude the answer is: not yet.\n  The 9/11 Commission is not the first to look at how we can strengthen \nour intelligence community in order to protect ourselves. In just the \npast 4 years, the Joint House-Senate inquiry into the September 11 \nterrorist attacks issued its findings, as did a commission appointed by \nPresident Bush and led by General Brent Scowcroft.\n  Three independent commissions have reviewed these issues, and they \nhave all made remarkably similar recommendations.\n  They have all said we need a national intelligence director someone \nwhose job it is to manage the national intelligence program and oversee \nthe agencies that make up the intelligence community. Right now, the \nCIA director also serves as the Director of Central Intelligence. But \nwhoever is in that job simply doesn't have the authority to reposition \nour intelligence community to face new threats. We know al-Qaida is \nadapting every day. We are not.\n  They have all said we need a national Counterterrorism Center, to \nbring together all sources of information so that we can eliminate the \nbarriers that kept one agency's information from another's and kept all \nof that information from getting analyzed.\n  We need to do more to understand and disrupt terrorist finances; \nimprove the FBI's counterterrorism capabilities; and work with our \nallies to abolish terrorist sanctuaries.\n  When you have all of these experts saying all of the same things, it \nwould be foolish for us not to listen and dangerous for us not to act.\n  The 9/11 Commission has made a series of additional recommendations. \nThey include: Securing weapons of mass destruction and keeping them out \nof the hands of terrorists; using the full array of our power--\nmilitary, diplomatic, law enforcement, and humanitarian--to combat \nIslamic extremism; finishing the job in Afghanistan with a long-term \ncommitment to reconstruction and security, so that land never again \nbecomes a haven for terrorists; openly confronting the ongoing Saudi-\nbased terror financing and official tolerance of extremists, and \nreconfiguring our relationship so that it is not based simply on oil.\n  Of course, one of their most significant recommendations was for us \nto do more to protect the homeland. Recent disclosures have \ndemonstrated that al-Qaida is an opportunistic organization. They don't \nattack where we are well defended. They attack where we aren't.\n  And so it is vitally important that we make America a harder target, \nwhile also preparing for attacks that may take place, so that we can \ncontain the damage and save lives.\n  The way we do that is through the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill.\n  This bill includes the funding necessary to improve border security \nand customs inspections, to hire 570 new border agents, to make our \nports safer by inspecting more shipping containers, and to make \nAmerica's transportation systems safer.\n  It also includes funding to protect America against bioterrorism, \ncyberterrorism and to ensure our first responders have the tools and \ntraining they need in case they are called upon to respond to an \nattack.\n  Right now, we face a test of seriousness.\n  The September 11 Commission has made 41 recommendations. One of them \ncan be addressed by completing work on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. But we need to act on all of them. As Lee Hamilton \nhas said:\n\n       We believe that the reforms are a package and that if some \n     are broken off, then the result is that you diminish the \n     impact of our recommendations . . . You end up with something \n     of less value.\n\n  We need to put security first. I don't think the Senate should be \nallowed to leave town until we have acted on all 41 of these \nrecommendations.\n  Certainly, there will be some disagreement on some. I know that \nothers have suggested different approaches and different reforms \nentirely.\n  All of these things deserve debate and discussion. But debate and \ndiscussion are meaningless if the 9/11 Commission's recommendations \ndon't also receive action.\n  Time is of the essence.\n  Every day the Congress spends not doing the 9/11 recommendations is a \nday we ignore the threat and neglect our most solemn duty as leaders.\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  As Governor Kean has said:\n\n       We all think that if we do not act quickly, we increase the \n     risk to the American people. We all agree that the status quo \n     is unacceptable Every day that passes is a day of increased \n     risk if we do not make changes.\n\n  In the words of the families of the victims of September 11:\n\n       Nearly three years have passed since our nation's homeland \n     security was cataclysmically breached. Far too little has \n     been done to better secure our homeland. We therefore request \n     that Congress and our President act with the greatest \n     urgency.\n\n  We need to listen to the experts.\n  We need to listen to the voices of those who have lost loved ones and \nare working to see that the horror that was visited on their families \nis not visited on others.\n  We need to listen to the American people who are concerned about the \nsafety of their families and communities. And then we need to do what \nthe American people expect of us.\n  Senators McCain and Lieberman have put together comprehensive \nlegislation that covers each of the 9/11 Commission's 41 \nrecommendations.\n  They will be introducing that legislation this afternoon.\n  We all understand that we have limited time in this session and a \ngreat deal of unfinished work. This should be our first order of \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8813-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I would like to comment on the agenda we are \ngoing to be dealing with in September. But before I do that, I want to \nsay I was very proud of the job that was done by the people of New York \nCity, the leadership of New York City, and all who were involved in the \nRepublican National Convention in New York.\n  I must confess, I dreaded going to New York City for our convention. \nI was worried about the heat at the end of August. I was worried about \nthe traffic and congestion. I was worried about the ability to secure \nthe place from potential terrorist threats. I was concerned about what \nthe protesters might do. I had a lot of concerns.\n  I also had some concerns about how the convention itself would be \nperceived. But I must say, I was pleased with the way the city handled \nthe convention. It was not as hot as I expected. The traffic was not as \nbad as I expected. The protesters were there, but they stayed within \nreasonable bounds. They were able to express themselves. Some of them \nwent too far, and they wound up being arrested. The police in New York \nCity did a very effective job. They were friendly. They were helpful. \nThe city officials, Mayor Bloomberg, the State officials, Governor \nPataki and his administration, all who were involved in the security \nand transportation aspects of the convention deserve to be commended \nbecause it turned out to be very good.\n  The convention itself, the events surrounding the convention, the \nexperience, exceeded my greatest expectations. There were good speakers \nevery night. I won't dare to name them now because if I name one, I \nmight not name another who did a wonderful job. I was inspired by it \nall. But not wanting to make this a partisan speech, my real purpose is \nto extend my congratulations to the city of New York. They did a great \njob. I feel as many people said when New York City was attacked on that \ninfamous day of 9/11, we all became New Yorkers, and from that we all \nbecame Americans again. We did a lot of things in a bipartisan, \nnonpartisan way for the future of the people in that city and for the \nsecurity of the American people. That was a good experience which came \nout of that terrible event.\n  So I want the record to show I found the whole event most enjoyable \nand a productive product for the political process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8813-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8813-S8814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, looking at the agenda for September--others \nset the agenda and I understand that and I will support that--there are \ncertain things we must do. We need to confirm Congressman Porter Goss \nto be head of the CIA. We need to look at the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations and see how much of those can be done in a responsible \nway.\n  I know there will be some who will resist and will defend the status \nquo or worry about committee turf. But we have a problem. Our \nintelligence operation is not set up properly. We had failures as we \nwent into Iraq. We should not try to deny that. We should acknowledge \nit. I commend our men and women in the intelligence community who do a \ngreat job. They are on the line this day in Afghanistan, Iraq, and even \nhere in America. We should recognize that talent. We should be careful \nnot to undermine the morale of those organizations. We have learned \nthere is a problem with chain of command and how the analytical \nmaterial is checked and double-checked. We know the Intelligence \nCommittees in the Congress have not been set up in a way to do proper \noversight. I can say that from experience, having looked at it from a \nleadership position, but also as a member of the Intelligence Committee \nfor the last year and a half. It is not set up properly. Membership \nshould be permanent, so that members not only can attend hearings, but \nunderstand what they are hearing, the dialog, acronyms and people, and \nburrow in and ask the right questions. This is not so that we will go \nnative and become captive to the community, but so we will be able to \nask the right questions. Even the staffing arrangement has to be \nchanged.\n  We have a limited period of time and, obviously, this requires taking \nup some of that time. I want us to act in this intelligence area, as \nfar as how it is set up, in the executive and legislative branches. We \nmay not be able to do it all in September, but let's do all we can and \nthen we can continue to work on it, provided, of course, we don't let \nthe forces of the status quo rise up and prevent the necessary changes \nthat I believe are called for. I am a strong advocate of reform across \nthe board when it comes to our intelligence community.\n  Of course, we have to deal with the appropriations bills in some way. \nI am pleased the leadership decided to call up the Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill. Certainly, other than defense, nothing is more \nimportant to fund as soon as we can and in the best way we can than \nhomeland security. I hope we can get through that process in a \nreasonable period of time, knowing there will be some amendments to be \noffered. We should get that appropriations bill done.\n  Beyond that, I am not sure whether we are going to have an omnibus \nappropriations bill or a continuing resolution or for how long funding \nwill be continued. That will be left in the hands of others in the \nleadership and even the Appropriations Committee. But I want to talk \nabout some other issues that don't always pop up when people are \ntalking about what we should do in September.\n  Yes, we should deal with the intelligence issue. We should do some \nconfirmations--confirm Porter Goss. We should do some judges and \nappropriations. But there are an awful lot of other things that have \nnot been done yet that we should complete before we go out. It is going \nto be very unattractive and, in fact, an admission of failure to do our \njob if we don't complete work on some of the bills that are in \nconference--for instance, the highway bill. I hear some talk now that \nwe should extend the current highway authorization into next year. Why? \nWe need those highway jobs this year.\n  There are very few things we can do, if anything, that would create \nmore jobs quicker than to pass a highway bill. There are highway \nprojects, bridge projects and public transportation projects all across \nthis country that\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\ncan begin immediately and will put thousands of people to work. By the \nway, it would make our roads safer and would help with economic \ndevelopment. We are in conference. There have been a lot of \ndiscussions, but I don't know that we are going to be able to get it \ncompleted if we don't pick up the pace. If we don't, then I think that \nall involved should feel badly because the American people will not be \nwell served if we don't do the highway bill and we put it off until \nafter the election or even next year.\n\n  I urge the leadership on that conference committee in the House and \nSenate, Democrat and Republican, to pay attention to this highway bill \nand get it done. It would be a huge achievement for the American people \nif we pass that bill before we go out. I am not incriminating any \nindividuals, but I am going to feel very critical of the Senate and the \nCongress if we don't get that highway bill done before we go home \nagain.\n  I realize maybe it is futile now, but when are we going to get \nserious about energy? For 3 years we have been striving mightily to \nproduce an energy bill. We get tangled up on one issue or another, such \nas over whether we should drill in Alaska. Now it is over an additive, \nMTBE. Meanwhile, we don't have a national energy policy. When the price \nof a barrel of oil went to $48 and more, as it did, I began to ask why, \nand what are we going to do about it? I know that if we pass an energy \nbill in the morning, it would not immediately affect the price of a \nbarrel of oil that much, but it would help our long-term energy \nsecurity. I think this is an issue that is staring us in the eye and we \nare continuing to blink.\n  Sooner or later we are going to pay an economic or a national \nsecurity price if we don't stop our dependence on foreign energy, and \noil specifically. I am very unnerved to think we depend on over 50 \npercent of our oil coming from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, and \nelsewhere. What if they cut us off for whatever reason? What would \nhappen and how soon? I am tired of hearing excuses about why we didn't \ndo it. I want to know how we are going to get it done. This bill came \nthrough committee, passed the Senate and the House, came out of \nconference and was passed by the House and came to the Senate, and with \n57 votes we stalled out.\n  Here we sit with no clear path to getting an energy bill. A pox on \nall our houses if we don't do something about that. Some people say \nstop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I agree. We should not \nfill the SPR when the price of oil is as high as it is. That is a small \npart of what should be done. We need the whole package. And I want to \nsay this: We need more exploration, more oil drilling, more natural gas \nwells, more coal, more hydroelectric power, and we need to perfect \nclean coal technology. We should have incentives for conservation and \nalternative fuels, the whole package, but here again the Congress is \nfailing in doing its job by not passing an energy bill. We should do it \nbefore we go home for the election.\n  Another bill I think is urgent that we pass is the so-called \nJumpstart Our Business Strength, or JOBS, bill. It is a bill that is \nrequired because the World Trade Organization held that some of our tax \npolicies were an unfair subsidization of our manufacturing. The World \nTrade Organization ruled that way. By the way, as a result of that, \neach month the tariff put on American goods by the European Union \ncontinues to go up 1 percent--it is now 11 percent, headed for 17 \npercent--because we supposedly had an export subsidy. That subsidy \nshould be eliminated and that money should be moved over into the \nmanufacturing area in a way that would help keep American industry in \nAmerica and create jobs.\n  How can we not do this? Some people throw up their hands and say we \ncannot get it done in the next month; that the House and Senate bills \nare too big; that the Senate bill has too much in it, and they are too \ndifferent; how will we ever merge them? I don't care. Throw them both \nout the door and come up with a different, smaller bill, one that gets \nthe job done in conference, and do it now. The chairmen of the \ncommittees in the House and the Senate and the ranking members need to \nget this done. I don't see how in the world we can leave this session \nof Congress and not pass that JOBS bill and allow American products to \nbe hit with an ever-increasing tariff of 1 percent increase every \nmonth, going up to 17 percent, and say we will see you later and we \nwill get to it next year. I urge my colleagues, especially the \nleadership and chairmen of the committees and the ranking members, to \nfind a way to get this bill done.\n\n  Lastly--and I will yield the floor--some people are whispering that \nugly phrase ``lame duck.'' I have been here 32 years. I have been \nthrough lame ducks and they are all ugly--to come back after the \nelection, when Congress is filled with people who have retired and have \nbeen defeated, and may have a different vested interest, perhaps.\n  Now I admit that on occasion, even though they were ugly, they were \nusually brief and we did something good. We did it during the Clinton \nadministration. We did a very important trade bill and, I think, once \nin the late nineties, maybe we came back and did the omnibus \nappropriations bill and then left. But I am worried about the large \namount of work being considered for a lame duck session this year and \nwhether that would be in the best interest of the American people.\n  Whatever we cannot get done in terms of appropriations, let's either \ndo it in an omnibus bill for the entire fiscal year or do it through a \ncontinuing resolution until February. But the idea that we are going to \ncome back in December and work right up until Christmas and fix what \nneeds to be fixed in that period of time to me is a very dubious and, \nfrankly, unwise suggestion.\n  How can it be stopped? I had somebody in the leadership ask me that: \nOh my goodness, we have other things we have to do; how can we avoid a \nlame duck session? Real simple, Mr. President. The two leaders in the \nHouse and the two leaders in the Senate say we are not coming back for \na lame duck session. It is not in the best interest of the American \npeople. Tell the appropriators to do what they have to do, but we are \nnot coming back for a lame duck session. If we do not do that and we \ncome back here, I dread to see it.\n  I welcome my colleagues back. I hope everybody had a nice, restful \nAugust. I hope we get a lot done in September. I do not expect very \nmuch because there are a few distractions underway, but we are poised \non the brink of being able to do some good things. If we could get a \nhighway bill, an energy bill, the JOBS bill, we could all go out and \ntake credit for it.\n  I remind my colleagues of the same thing I said many times over the \nyears to leaders, to my good friend from South Dakota--when you produce \na product, everybody wins. When you don't call up a bill or you don't \nfinish a bill, the American people lose, and that is where we are \npoised to go. Which will it be?\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8814-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8814-S8815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, and all those within the sound of my voice, I \nappreciate his dissertation on what we should do in the approximately \n15 days we have left in this legislative session. I appreciate his \nobservations. The fact is, whether we want to acknowledge it, we have \nnot done anything the whole year. If there is any cause for our having \nso little time to do so much, it is because we have not done anything \nup to now. We have not passed any appropriations bills--one.\n  To hear talk about an omnibus bill should cause the hair on \neveryone's neck to rise. The omnibus bill we had last year was a \ndisaster, in my opinion. I hope we do not do that again. I would rather \nhave a series of continuing resolutions than have this big, ugly piece \nof legislation that has so many ways of creating mischief.\n  I do appreciate my friend from Mississippi, who has a wealth of \nexperience, having been majority and minority leader of the Senate, but \nhe should acknowledge what he is talking about is pie in the sky. We \ncannot do that. We do not have time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield. Mr. President, we have to do the \nbest we can with the tools we have.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from \nMississippi. I agree we should pass a good energy bill and a jobs bill. \nI agree with all that. He suggested at the end to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota--I assume he was referring to the Democratic leader--that \nit would be good to get things done. I point out the Wall Street \nJournal article of today titled ``Lawmakers Face Big Backlog.'' Let me \nread what this article says, and most of us know this to be the case:\n\n       The highway bill, for example, is hung up in a dispute \n     between Republican Senators and the White House. . . .\n\n  That is not obstructionism by this side.\n\n       In the energy debate, oil-state Republicans, led by House \n     Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas, want liability \n     protections for companies that make the fuel additive MTBE; \n     Northeastern Senators, such as Sen. Judd Gregg of New \n     Hampshire, are opposed.\n\n  That is not obstructionism on this side. That is the Energy bill.\n  Quoting again:\n\n       The animosity between House Ways and Means Committee \n     Chairman Bill Thomas and Senate Finance Committee Chairman \n     Charles Grassley has slowed progress on tax legislation.\n\n  That is the JOBS bill about which my colleague was talking. There is \nthe highway bill, the Energy bill, the JOBS bill, and this article from \nthe Wall Street Journal today, hardly a progressive organization, says \nthe problem is not obstructionism by this side of the aisle; it is the \nother side of the aisle that is having an internal debate they cannot \nresolve, and that is what is slowing things down.\n  I say on my behalf and I expect I say on behalf of the assistant \nminority leader from Nevada and certainly from the standpoint of the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, we would like nothing more than to \nget a good highway bill, to get a good energy bill passed through the \nCongress, to proceed and deal with the issue of jobs. We cannot resolve \non this side of the aisle the internal debate that goes on between the \nWhite House and the majority party in the Republican caucus. That is \nexactly what is holding up these issues. My hope is they will resolve \nthose debates. We can work together and find a way in a bipartisan \nmanner to address all of these issues--energy, jobs, and the highway \nbill. I think we should do that.\n\n  I wanted to make that point quoting from an article that was in the \nWall Street Journal today which I believe describes what is really at \nwork here that has held up the progress and business of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, he has pointed out in reading from the Wall \nStreet Journal a few of the problems are around here. These very \nimportant issues cannot be resolved, in my opinion, in just a matter of \na few days. For them to come out now and say we suddenly have our act \ntogether now, let's have no debate and rush these through because we \nhave no time left in this legislative session, is not fair. It is not \nfair to the Senate but, more importantly, it is not fair to this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I hope all Senators had a good productive 6 weeks \nsince we were last in session. I personally had a productive time in \nNevada. I held many townhall meetings all over the State of Nevada, \nfrom Sparks to Pahrump in southern Nevada. They were productive \nmeetings, but I was surprised the meetings all related to the same \nsubjects.\n  People brought up the same issues no matter where we were in Nevada: \nHealth care. People are tremendously concerned about health care. The \npeople of Nevada realize we have 44 million people with no health \ninsurance, millions more who are underinsured, and those who have \nhealth insurance see the costs escalating. Small businesses are finding \nit more difficult all the time to give health benefits to their \nemployees. It is not because they are cheap. It is not because they are \nmean. It is simply that they cannot afford health insurance. They know \nthey would have a more productive workforce if people had health \ninsurance. This is a tremendous issue all over the State of Nevada and \nthis country.\n  Senior citizens. I had a number of townhall meetings related \nspecifically to senior citizens. To say they do not like the new \nMedicare bill is an understatement. It is a bill that is designed to \nbankrupt Medicare and is in the process of doing so. To top this off, \nthey were told last week that there would be a 17-percent premium \nincrease. They are very concerned.\n  Education. The Leave No Child Behind Act is leaving children behind. \nIt is ruining public education not only in Nevada but all over the \ncountry. Nevada is a rapidly growing State. We created about 15 new \nschools this year. When school started a week ago, we had in Clark \nCounty alone 15 new schools, 3 new high schools. There are so many new \nteachers hired in the Clark County school district they cannot get them \nall together at one time. I talked with all the new teachers, but it \ntook 2 separate groups of 1,000 each--2,000 new schoolteachers in Clark \nCounty alone.\n  These young men and women are anxious to begin a new career. There \nare some teachers who have transferred from other places or who have \ncome from other places, but most all the teachers are first-year \nteachers, and they are excited about being able to educate these \nchildren, to form the minds of these little people who appear before \nthem.\n  They are concerned because they know the reputation of the Leave No \nChild Behind Act has preceded them, and they know how difficult it is \nwith this law, these unfunded mandates that are contained therein, to \ndo a good job of teaching. Administrators acknowledge this.\n  I met with all 17 school administrators, school superintendents, in \nthe State of Nevada. All 17 said the Leave No Child Behind Act is \ndestroying public education. These 17 superintendents are from school \ndistricts as large as the one in Clark County of 300,000 students, to \nEsmeralda County, Goldfield, NV, 88 students in that school district.\n  I did not ask their party affiliation, but I am sure they are \nDemocrats and Republicans. They all acknowledge that the Leave No Child \nBehind Act is simply not working.\n  My friend from Mississippi gave a short dissertation on all the \nthings we need to do, but what one needs to do is look at the calendar \nand how we are going to accomplish this. It is a very short period of \ntime. I think the majority leader will tell us we are going to end \naround October 8. This is a real short week, so there is 1 week, 2 \nweeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks. That is 5 weeks. We have the Jewish holidays \nweek after next which will make that a very short week. We have \nColumbus Day. We have so few days to do so much.\n  What I think we need to do is make sure we fund the Government. If it \nmeans a lame duck session, which none of us like, it means a lame duck \nsession. The fact is, we have so little time to do so much. I hope we \nwould be able\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\nto focus on what is absolutely necessary.\n  Again, I have the greatest respect and admiration for my friend, the \njunior Senator from Mississippi. But what he is talking about does not \nacknowledge what we did not do before the break occurred.\n  I look forward to working with Senator McConnell. Senator Daschle has \nasked me to work as the lead Democrat on the working group to consider \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We will focus on the role \nCongress plays in supporting our intelligence community and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I start out on this acknowledging that the two people who led this \nCommission, Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton, are two of \nthe finest public servants anywhere in America. They spent a year of \ntheir lives working on this issue. They had good Commission members. \nThey had 80 of the top people in the world to help them do their \nresearch and investigations.\n  What they came up with is good, and it is going to take some real \nstrong evidence to show why we should not follow that. I have an open \nmind and look forward to working with Senator McConnell, for whom I \nhave the highest regard. This is a bipartisan working group and we must \nkeep it that way. We have to keep politics out of this process. We are \nin the middle of an election, but this is not a partisan issue. I am \ngoing to work with every member of this group to find solutions that \nwill make our Nation stronger and improve our intelligence \ncapabilities.\n  I hope we can finish the so-called FSC bill that the majority leader \nhas named the JOBS bill. I hope we do this for lots of reasons, but the \nmost important reason, as far as I am concerned, is when I went home \npeople are concerned about energy.\n  This country has less than 3 percent of the known oil reserves in the \nworld, counting ANWR. We cannot produce our way out of the problems we \nhave. There are things we can do to improve our production, but we \ncannot produce our way out of our problems. We use 12 million barrels a \nday. We import over 60 percent of those 12 million barrels. That cannot \ngo on forever.\n  I hope we would recognize that this FSC bill, the JOBS bill, has in \nit section 45 production tax credits to give tax credits for Sun and \nwind production of energy, geothermal production of energy, and \nbiomass. This is the future. When a country has less than 3 percent of \nthe known oil reserves in the world, this is where we need to go. We \nneed to go to alternative energy. That way we can move to a production \nsociety. We can do lots of good things.\n  The tax credit for wind energy expired the first of the year. We know \nit worked well. We know there are some farms in the Midwest that make \nmore money producing electricity than they do growing soybeans, corn, \nand wheat.\n  Developing these clean, renewable resources, in addition to being the \nright thing to do, will create thousands of new jobs, and it will help \nconsumers by providing a steady and reliable source of electricity and \nit will protect our environment. Because renewable energy is made in \nthe USA, it will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  We have so much to do. We have only passed 1 of the 13 appropriations \nbills. We need to address these most important issues. As I have \nalready indicated, I personally am opposed to an omnibus. I would \nrather have continuing resolutions than an omnibus bill because it was \nnot a good experience last time. We have a lot of work to do. Let us \nget busy.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor of the Senate, and I yield the \nfloor to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8816-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was in my office and I heard Senator \nDorgan talk about the Wall Street Journal and the Energy bill, or at \nleast he commented on it. The Energy bill that is pending at the desk, \nwhich the Democrats have refused to let us take up, does not have the \nMTBE provision to which the Senate Democrats and some Republicans \nobjected. It is not in there. So who is holding it up? The Senate \nDemocrats, led by Senator Bingaman, will not let us proceed on that \nbill.\n\n  It is most interesting. The distinguished Senator from Nevada read \noff a list of things we ought to be doing. The Senator ought to know \nthat every single one of those, and more, is in that Energy bill. He \ntalked about renewables from wind to solar and production tax credits. \nThey are all in that bill. More natural gas is in that bill; research \nto use clean coal is in that bill. Also, we have language that will \nforever cause us to not have any more big regional blackouts in \nAmerica, and on and on.\n  So let's be honest about it. The Energy bill, as a superbill, is \npending. If they would just let us vote, we would have a bill for \nAmerica that includes everything Senator Reid has talked about and \nmore.\n  As far as us killing an energy bill with provisions for holding \nharmless the producers of MTBE, I suggest Senators get the bill and \nread it. That provision is out of the bill that our leader called up \nand that the Democrats decided to filibuster. They want us to get 60 \nvotes on everything, including America's energy future. That is the way \nit is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8816-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8816-S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEGISLATION AND ISSUES BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. If we could just go back to regular order, I will do my \nstatement because I know there will be a response back and forth. At \nthis juncture, I have about a 15-minute statement.\n  I opened the Senate, now about 45 minutes ago, and as my colleagues \ncan tell, there is a lot of interest in a whole lot of both legislation \nand issues that people want to get out front on. What I would like to \ndo is take a few minutes and give an overview of where we have been a \nlittle bit, but also where we are going over the next several weeks.\n  I talked to Senator Daschle earlier today. We will continue our \ndiscussions over the course of today and tomorrow, meeting with the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle, and our various caucuses. We \nwill work out the details.\n  I want to step back and paint the larger picture because we have so \nlittle time with so many huge issues before us. Each Senator has four \nor five issues that mean the most to them.\n  What is absolutely critical, from a leadership standpoint on both \nsides of the aisle, is to have a framework so we can accomplish the \nNation's business and move America forward. With a limited number of \ndays and what we know is going to be a very trying season because of \nthe campaigns that are going on and the politics that go on that are \nnecessarily related to the campaigns, it is going to be a huge \nchallenge before us.\n  As I said an hour ago, I do want to welcome everybody back. I do hope \neverybody is energized--which we have\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\nseen already on the floor of the Senate--but also that everybody is \nrelaxed and understands the importance of the issues before us. I am \ndelighted people have had the time to spend back at home with their \nconstituents and, what is probably most important for periods like \nthis, with their family and friends.\n  We all must expect a very busy legislative session on the floor--\nwhich people will see laid out in our debate on amendments on the \nimportant issues--but also on a whole range of issues that are either \nin conference today or will soon be in conference. There are a number \nof crucial items before us that we must complete this year.\n  Stepping back to our timeline, our goal is to finish this session of \nCongress by October 8. Some people said it would be October 1, some \nOctober 15. The goal is October 8. There will be discussions about a \nlameduck session and people will be writing about it. Our goal is to \ncomplete this session by October 8. I look forward to working with the \nleadership in conferences and caucuses on both sides of the aisle to \naccomplish this because we are moving America forward. For whom? It is \nfor the American people. So we absolutely must be working together.\n  Today on our first day back, our top priority--it may spill into \ntomorrow morning, but our top priority is to address what is happening \nin Florida as we speak and as we have seen it play out over last night \nand the day before and, indeed, over the last several weeks. We need to \nreach out and aggressively respond to help the people of Florida who \nhave seen their homes literally devastated, who are displaced from \ntheir homes, displaced from their communities, huddling with their \nfamilies a long way from where they live.\n  We have had two devastating storms in a short 3-week period in \nFlorida. As our Senators from Florida know, as we have discussed, we \nwill be there, we will respond as soon as possible. I was talking to \nSenator Nelson on the floor about this.\n  Over the last weekend, even before Hurricane Frances touched the \neastern shores of Florida, the Congress, this body, was notified that \nFEMA would be obligating funds for these disasters at a rate greater \nthan what had been appropriated for this year. In other words, what \nthat means is FEMA would be operating in a deficiency. Currently the \nadministration estimates that FEMA indeed will be out of funds by the \nend of tomorrow. Therefore, last night the President of the United \nStates transmitted to us an emergency $2 billion supplemental request \nfor FEMA. The President has asked us, asked this body, to take \nimmediate action on this request.\n  I have been in contact with officials from the administration, with \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, with officials and \nRepresentatives from Florida, and everyone agrees we should act as soon \nas possible. I anticipate the House of Representatives will act no \nlater than tomorrow morning and perhaps even tonight. We should follow \nthat immediately upon receipt of this emergency supplemental, and I \nwill be working with the minority to structure an arrangement for quick \npassage in the Senate to help those people in Florida who are \nstruggling this very moment. Our neighbors in Florida are depending on \nus for emergency response, for shelter, for food, and other types of \ncare.\n\n  In his letter to us last evening, the President says he anticipates a \nfurther request in coming days as the full impact of Hurricanes Charley \nand Frances become clearer. I expect we will need to include further \nFEMA funding on the Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2005 that we will be turning to tomorrow morning. But we must act \nfirst on this initial $2 billion emergency request. Our prayers and \nthoughts do go out to the people of Florida who are suffering, who are \nliving in shelters, without homes to return to, and who must live with \nthat ever-present possibility that other storms will strike them, that \nthey may be on the way, given the fact that the hurricane season is \nonly half over as I speak. We must act quickly to provide the hard-\nworking staff at FEMA, who have done such a tremendous job over the \nlast several weeks, with the funds and with the resources they need to \ncontinue to aid the people of Florida.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might inquire on that point. I thank very much the \nmajority leader for his indulgence.\n  My understanding is the proposed $2 billion to restore FEMA money \nneeds to be acted on quickly. I understand that. I think everyone would \nwant to cooperate with the majority leader on that point. The majority \nleader indicated that the White House would intend then to send down a \nsecond request. The reason I am asking a question about that is this. \nThere are, as the Senator knows, other areas of the country that have \nsuffered substantial weather-related disasters. In North Dakota, for \nexample, 1.7 million acres could not even be planted in farmland this \nyear, so we have some farmers in pretty tough shape. It is not only \nNorth Dakota, but Minnesota, Montana, and other parts of the area. \nThere are some drought-stricken areas out West as well. Some of us \nwould want to include some help for those producers.\n  I don't think we would want to interrupt what is going on today. The \nSenator is absolutely correct, we need to move quickly to respond. But, \nSenator Frist, you indicated the second request may well be put on a \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. Yet I know there is a unanimous \nconsent request being offered today, or at least one that is being \ntalked about, that would preclude amendments to that that would not be \nabout Homeland Security.\n  How would we get an emergency or disaster piece on that bill? Would \nthose of us who want to add to it to deal with the disaster in farm \ncountry have an opportunity to do so?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the details we will get into. I have two \npoints I wanted to make, even in mentioning it. A, we need to respond \nand we need to respond quickly, as the Senator from Florida and I were \ntalking about. From a FEMA standpoint, this money is needed now. \nEverybody with FEMA down there is working hard. They should not have to \nbe worrying about money coming in. They are responding directly to the \npeople.\n  Even the $2 billion, as we have seen from estimates in the newspaper, \nwhat has happened in Florida is going to eventually cost, at least from \nthe estimates I have seen, several-fold that. I don't want to send the \nsignal that when we move so quickly on the $2 billion, we are excluding \nthe earlier events in Florida, the full ramifications of the current \nhurricane, or other needs. The real issue is whether we wait on this $2 \nbillion and address the other needs and assess wherever they are in the \ncountry. There is general agreement we need to move now with this \ninstallment that FEMA needs because they are out of money, and then the \nspecific vehicle we need to discuss.\n  I haven't talked to anybody about how we want to do that, but we will \nhave to have a second supplemental of some sort to address needs in \nFlorida and possibly other needs.\n  Let me continue to try to get through because the specifics we can \ncome back to and talk about, because I have a whole range of issues, if \nthat is all right.\n  I want to come back to homeland security because I mentioned in my \nopening statement today the importance of going to the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, and thematically that is the issue which \nI believe will dominate the next 4 weeks. I will come back to how the \nvarious pieces will fit in when addressing what is the overriding issue \nof this body over the next several weeks.\n  As Senator Daschle mentioned, last week we saw the terrible school \nsiege in Beslan, Russia, which served as a reminder that our enemies \nare ruthless and determined. Those pictures and the coverage we have \nseen are burned into our minds at this juncture, and the ferocity of \nthe enemy in that small town in southern Russia. Al-Qaida-linked \nmilitants literally slaughtered hundreds of schoolchildren, parents, \nand teachers on what should have been a joyous day--the first day of \nschool. It was a massacre. There is really no other way to describe it. \nThere are 334 people dead and 200 people missing right now. Our hearts \nache and reach out to the people of Russia and to the families who have \nbeen devastated by this sickening act of violence. America understands \nthe pain that is felt by those families, by that country, and by\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nthose communities. We are determined to defeat those forces of terror \nwhich were depicted by that horrendous event and to do so quickly and \nresponsibly.\n  We must strengthen our homeland security, and we will turn to that \nlegislation tomorrow. We need to reform our intelligence systems.\n  Thirdly, we need to address the vacancy of that top post of the CIA.\n  These are three objectives we need to keep coming back to and to stay \nfocused on over the course of the next several days since we have so \nlittle time. Those three objectives we absolutely must achieve.\n  Tomorrow morning we will go to the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill. In the past there have been efforts to bog down the process with \nunrelated amendments, nongermane amendments. We should all agree and we \ndo all agree that homeland security should not be used to advance \nseparate, unrelated political issues.\n  Our first responders and the American people are depending on this \nbody to act. Both Democratic leadership and Republican leadership agree \nto go to this particular bill, an important bill which funds our \nhomeland security in this country. I urge my colleagues again to act \nswiftly, to amend appropriately but act swiftly on this important bill. \nWe need a bill that is appropriately debated, amended, passed, signed, \nand enacted before we adjourn.\n  I will continue to work with our Democratic colleagues in terms of an \nagreement that will allow us to consider the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill and amendments with hopes of finishing that bill as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  As our top focus--protecting our Nation--must go beyond homeland \npreparedness, America will only be secure if we deal with threats \nbefore they happen, not just after they happen. As the 9/11 Commission \nReport so grimly outlined, our intelligence community calls out for \nmajor reform.\n  President Bush has already taken steps following a careful review of \nthe Commission's recommendations. President Bush has issued three \nExecutive orders to strengthen our intelligence system. The CIA \nDirector will now have expanded powers to ensure a joint, unified \nnational intelligence effort. The President has also ordered \nthe creation of a national counterterrorism center which will be \nresponsible for analyzing and integrating foreign and domestic \nintelligence which is acquired across various departments and agencies. \nWith the third Executive order, the President directed our intelligence \nagencies to give the highest priority to detection, prevention, \ndisruption, preemption, and mitigation of efforts of terrorist \nactivities against the United States. He has ordered our agencies to \nmaximize their ability to exchange intelligence so we can put together \neach piece of the puzzle and preempt terrorist plotting.\n\n  President Bush's top priority is defending America.\n  These directives are crucial to winning the war on terror, but as we \nall acknowledge and the reason we must act in this legislative body is \nthat these measures are interim measures. Here in the Senate we began \nresponding to the 9/11 Commission Report as soon as it came out, but we \nhave much work to do, as was outlined by several of my colleagues over \nthe last hour, this month to respond to the 9/11 Commission Report, its \ncriticisms, its critiques, as well as its recommendations.\n  There are three major areas we need to address in the coming weeks: \nFirst, legislation to reform intelligence analysis and coordination in \nthe executive branch; second, the confirmation of a new CIA Director; \nand third, the Senate's role in oversight of intelligence and homeland \nsecurity; that is, what goes on here in the U.S. Senate. What is our \nrole? Go back and look at it and engage appropriate reform. Those are \nthe three issues we must address.\n  I mentioned that after the 9/11 Commission Report this body began to \nrespond immediately. In July, just before the recess began, Senator \nDaschle and I immediately set the process in place in the Senate to \nrespond legislatively to the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  First, on executive reform in the executive branch, Senator Daschle \nand I asked the Governmental Affairs Committee in close consultation \nwith other committees that have a stake in these changes to carefully \nevaluate the Commission's proposals regarding reorganization of the \nexecutive branch and then to determine how best to implement those.\n  Over the August recess--a time that is typically just a recess and \npeople are back at home with constituents in their States--Congress \nheld over two dozen committee hearings. In the Senate, four committees \nworked through August and heard testimony from roughly two dozen \nwitnesses. Those committees included the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the Intelligence Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the \nArmed Services Committee. Each carefully examined the recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Report, and each brought in expert testimony to review past \nperformance and future reforms.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, led by Chairman Susan Collins and \nSenator Joe Lieberman, is taking the lead to determine how we can best \nreorganize and revitalize intelligence agencies and activities in the \nexecutive branch. This is a complicated undertaking. It is a serious \nundertaking but one which is absolutely vital to the security of our \ncountry.\n  Much work has been done over the last 6 weeks after the 9/11 \nCommission Report, but we have a huge amount of work to do in the next \nseveral weeks.\n  The second issue is the CIA Director. As with the President, the \nSenate's highest priority is to protect the American people. Our top \nconcern must be ensuring that we are as effective as possible in \ndealing with the threat of terrorism. That is why we must act promptly \nin this body to confirm Congressman Porter Goss to the currently vacant \npost of CIA Director. It is obvious that we need a permanent CIA \nDirector, and it is time for this body to act. The nomination has been \nmade. With the schedule that will be outlined in the next several days, \nwe must act on this important position. At a time of homeland general \ninsecurity with the threat of terrorism, whether it is in the homeland \nor international, we should not allow this critical post to remain \nvacant.\n  Congressman Goss, I might add, is an outstanding choice to lead the \nagency. As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a former \nCIA agent, he has long experience in the field of intelligence. He \nknows clearly the challenges ahead. We must confirm Congressman Goss \nwithout delay. There is no time to lose.\n  Thirdly, Senate oversight. I mentioned the relationship with the \nexecutive branch, which the Governmental Affairs Committee addressed. \nSecond, I mentioned the importance of our responsibility to go ahead \nand move this nomination of Congressman Goss. The third issue is what \nwe do in the U.S. Senate in terms of our appropriate responsibility and \nin terms of oversight.\n  In a separate effort regarding the 9/11 Commission Report response \nfrom the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Daschle and I \nestablished a task force to evaluate the September 11 Commission \nproposals and to offer specific reforms as they relate to Senate \nintelligence in homeland security oversight. Senator McConnell and \nSenator Reid are cochairs of this task force. Their work is underway.\n  This is a pivotal moment to make over the Senate so it operates \nefficiently, effectively, more responsibly, and more transparently in \noverseeing the security of our homeland. We cannot lose this \nopportunity. We should not lose this opportunity. There will be the old \nbattles, I am sure, that will play out again and again in terms of \njurisdiction, in terms of power, in terms of prestige, or in terms of \nthe way we have been locked in in the past in this body in dealing with \nintelligence oversight.\n  Our national defense requires no less than a new unified bipartisan \neffort to transform the Senate to meet these new threats. Time is of \nthe essence. It is not my intent that the task force spend months and \nmonths and months reviewing options and then see time run out on this \nCongress. We need to act deliberately, give a lot of thought to it, \ndebate it, and then act decisively. I know from conversations the \nDemocratic leadership agrees with this as well.\n  As we move forward to strengthen our national security, I will shift \ngears\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\na bit from the agenda of the next several weeks and turn to the issue \nof protecting America's taxpayers. Four important family tax revisions \nare set to expire at the end of this year. They include the increase in \nthe child tax credit to $1,000, marriage penalty tax relief, expansion \nof the 10-percent tax bracket, and the increase in the alternative \nminimum tax exemption. Each of these provisions impacts families. Each \nhas helped ease the burden on millions of American families.\n  If we do not act in this body to extend the provisions, millions of \nhard-working American families will pay the price. They will be \nunfairly penalized. If we do not act, their taxes will go up and their \nhousehold budgets will shrink. They will have less freedom and less \nability to make ends meet.\n  For example, if we do not act, 70 million women will see their taxes \nincrease on average $660. If we do not act, 46 million married couples \nwill each pay on average a whopping $900 more in taxes. It we do not \nact, 38 million families with children will pay $900 more, on average. \nIf we do not act, 8 million single women with children will see their \ntaxes increase by nearly $370. If we do not act, 11 million elderly \nwould each have to pay $383 more. If we do not act, 23 million small \nbusiness owners would incur tax increases averaging $784. Nearly 2 \nmillion individuals and families who currently have no income tax \nliability would once again become subject to the income tax.\n  That is what is at stake. That is what is before the Senate. That is \nsimply unacceptable. We cannot allow the American people to suffer an \nautomatic and totally unavoidable tax hike because we in this body fail \nto act.\n  There is bipartisan consensus to take action to extend these family \ntax provisions and to protect the American family. Protecting the \nhomeland, protecting the American family, are tall goals, but they are \nabsolutely crucial to the security and the well-being of our country.\n  Meanwhile, we also have a responsibility to deliberate on the \nPresident's judicial nominees under the previous order at 5:30 today. \nWe will have two votes on the two district judge nominations, Virginia \nMaria Hernandez Covington of Florida and Michael H. Schneider, Sr. of \nTexas. Both are exceptional nominees. Both enjoyed bipartisan support. \nFollowing these votes, we will consider another excellent nominee, \nDistrict Judge Michael Watson. His nomination will not require a \nrollcall vote.\n  Judge Hernandez Covington is a Florida native and currently serves on \nthe Second District Court of Appeals. She stands before us as a nominee \nto the middle district court of Florida as an appellate judge. \nHernandez Covington authored over 110 opinions and has heard more than \n1,000 cases. The American Bar Association unanimously rated judge \nHernandez Covington well-qualified for the U.S. District Court.\n  The second judge under consideration today is Michael Schneider. He \ncurrently presides on the Texas Supreme Court. President Bush has \nnominated Judge Schneider to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas. As an appellate and trial judge, Justice Schneider \nhas heard civil and criminal matters from across the State. He was \nhonored in 1994 as the Texas trial judge of the year. In 2001 he was \nawarded Texas's appellate judge of the year. Judge Schneider received \nthe ABA's highest rating, unanimously well-qualified.\n  Our third nominee, Judge Michael Watson, has been an appellate and \ntrial court judge in the Ohio State courts for over 8 years. He \ncurrently serves on the Tenth District Court of Appeals. The American \nBar Association has rated Judge Watson qualified to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court.\n  Each of these candidates is indeed outstanding. I expect their votes \nto go smoothly this afternoon.\n  I would be remiss, however, if I did not mention the fact that 10 \nother nominees are still in limbo. Since 2003, seven appellate court \nnominees have been filibustered. They have been denied something very \nsimple: an up-or-down vote by each Senator in the Senate. They have \nbeen denied that through filibusters. We believe that is wrong. We \nbelieve the obstruction tactics to which these individuals have been \nsubjected is harmful and unfair. They are unfair to the nominees--\npublic servants all--and they are harmful to the judicial system and to \nthe Senate which is charged by the Constitution to do something very \nsimple; that is, advice and consent. That means an up-or-down vote: Yes \nor no. If they want to vote no, they should be able to vote no. And if \nthey want to vote yes, they should be able to vote yes. They deserve a \nvote.\n  I ask my colleagues to stop the obstruction and to allow an up-or-\ndown vote on all these nominees. A simple up-or-down vote: Yes or no.\n  In closing, as we all know, President Clinton had heart surgery, and, \nas so many people have done, we offer our best wishes to the President \nfor a speedy recovery. He underwent coronary bypass grafting and by all \naccounts has done very well. This is something that is very close to \nme. The coronary bypass grafting is an operation I performed routinely, \nan operation I did every day before coming to the Senate. It is \nroutine. Now there are 330,000 done a year, about 1,000 a day--even \nmore than that. About 500,000 were done before the new technology of \nstints and angioplasty came in. Although it is a routine procedure for \nmany hospitals, postcoronary artery bypass grafting is a big operation. \nIt is like being hit by a truck in terms of the recovery. It takes a \nfew days.\n  President Clinton, by all accounts, has done very well. We heard last \nnight from the surgeons. Obviously, we all have had the opportunity to \nextend our thoughts and prayers to our colleague, Senator Clinton, here \nand to their entire family over the last several days.\n  I also briefly mention in early August we tightened security around \nthe Capitol significantly. Over the recess, Senator Daschle and I met \nwith the Sergeant at Arms and other law enforcement and intelligence \npeople. We agreed that new information regarding potential threats \nrequired our Capitol to establish some temporary perimeter security \ncheckpoints at all streets leading into the complex, as well as a \nnumber of other security measures.\n  That said, we are working closely with the Capitol police and the \nDistrict of Columbia to minimize any inconvenience.\n  We look forward to a busy session, a productive session over the next \ndays and weeks. We will address legislation that is absolutely critical \nto the security of our homeland, to the security of the United States, \nand to the well-being of our fellow Americans. We will vote on, and I \nam confident we will pass, the supplemental appropriations bill for the \nState of Florida to help them respond to the devastation of Hurricanes \nCharley and Frances.\n\n  By working in a bipartisan manner--and as I said when we opened, I \nknow the environment, and the larger environment, is going to be very \npolitically charged, but if we in this body can work in a bipartisan \nmanner, a focused manner, I am convinced we can accomplish the goals \nthat are set out and move America forward. We will strengthen our \nsecurity, we will strengthen our homes, and we will lend a hand to our \nneighbors as we confront the challenges ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8819-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8819-S8820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS FOR FLORIDA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nthe comforting statement that we will take up the emergency \nappropriations for FEMA to meet the first of two crisis we have had in \nthe State of Florida over the course of the last few weeks.\n  If I might inquire of the majority leader, is it still the \nunderstanding of the majority leader that the House bill may come \ntonight, or are we looking at tomorrow in which we could pass this \nemergency supplemental appropriations?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, even since I completed my remarks, I was \njust inquiring. It depends entirely when we get the language from the \nHouse. I think we still have a shot of doing it later tonight. But we \nwill be in session with the votes on the judges. If we need to stay in \na little bit later to do it tonight, we will do it. I am very hopeful \nwe will have language here within an hour and a half or 2 hours, in \nwhich case we will go to all the appropriate\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\npeople in the body to make sure the language is agreeable.\n  So I think we still have a good shot of doing it tonight. As I told \nthe Senator from Florida, I recognize the importance of getting this \nmoney as quickly as possible in the people's hands, where they are not \nworried about money coming in. They are going to be able to take care \nof the people in Florida and emergencies around the country.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. As the Senator and I discussed last night, I \nwas told by the Director of FEMA they are basically running out of \nmoney. By the end of the week, they are not going to have any cash to \nexpend. So I think that ups the urgency of this appropriations.\n  I also appreciate the statement by the majority leader that this is \njust a first step. When we look at the needs, just for FEMA, from the \nfirst hurricane, Charley, it is going to exceed the $2 billion request \nby the President. And that does not include all of the other agencies, \nsuch as the Department of Agriculture, the Small Business \nAdministration, the Economic Development Administration, the Defense \ncosts. NASA has costs. You can go on down the list.\n  For example, compared to Hurricane Andrew 12 years ago, the FEMA cost \nthen was $2.9 billion. But the overall cost to the Federal Government, \nincluding all of the other agencies, was over $6 billion. And that was \njust one hurricane, a magnitude greater than Charley, but now we have \ntwo. And Lord help us if we have three. But we are dealing in a range \nof probably $4.5 billion out of these two.\n  So is it my understanding from the majority leader that it would be \nhis intention, as he had discussed last night in our telephone \nconversation, that we would take up additional emergency appropriations \nnext week?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from Florida, I \nwant to make it very clear, it is impossible to determine what the real \nrequirement is going to be in Florida. The important thing is to look \nat this supplemental as a first major step to keep the emergency care, \nthe shelters, the response flowing, and that there will be another \nsupplemental. I will not have quite the sense of time urgency, meaning \nin hours. As you said, with FEMA not having sufficient funds by \ntomorrow, it means we need to act tonight or first thing in the \nmorning. And we will follow up with appropriate deliberations as \ninformation comes forward and there are accurate requests being made \nand we can assess the full extent of the damage. But even with that, we \nneed to do it quickly. It is not something we want to push way off into \nthe future.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the majority leader and the minority \nleader for their cooperation because clearly the State of Florida is \nreeling under this one-two punch to which we have been subjected. As a \nresult, we have to act and act quickly.\n  I had a number of people in the press down in Florida asking me where \nthe money was going to come from. If there is a reason for the Federal \nGovernment, it is to respond in times of emergency, whether that be a \nnational emergency such as a war or a national emergency in times of \nnatural disaster.\n  We have always done it. I remember when I came to Congress in 1979, \none of the first votes I cast was in relation to the eruption of Mount \nSt. Helens in the State of Washington. That place needed a great deal \nof Federal assistance to overcome all of the deficiencies that had \nhappened to that society in the midst of that natural disaster.\n  Now we have not only the disaster of one hurricane but having the \nState crisscrossed with a big X over the center of the State almost \nlike a bull's eye by the second hurricane. And thank the Good Lord it \nwas not a category 4, which a day out it was a category 4. In this \nparticular case, it had winds up to 145 miles an hour. Well, by the \ntime it hit, it had subsided to a category 2, with winds up to 105 \nmiles an hour. There is a huge difference in the destructive force of \nthe winds going from 105 to 145 miles an hour. The destructive \npotential of that wind goes up exponentially as you raise the wind \nspeed.\n  But what happened with Frances, even though it subsided to having \nwinds up to 105 miles an hour when it hit the coast, with gusts up to \n120 miles per hour, it lingered, it slowed, it stalled, it wobbled, and \nit was so massive it covered up the entire State of Florida so that \nparts that were thought to be immune from this hurricane because of the \ntrack of the hurricane, suddenly were engulfed in fierce winds and \ndriving rain which has caused enormous flooding problems.\n  So it will be my intention, once we pass this emergency supplemental \nof $2 billion--which is not going to anywhere cover just the costs for \nFEMA for the first hurricane--to come back for appropriate additional \nfunds for the first hurricane as well as the second hurricane.\n  For example, besides FEMA, there are the expenses of the Department \nof Agriculture. We are going to have huge crop losses from Charley and \nnow also from Frances. There is also the Small Business Administration, \nwhich has a number of relief programs in addition to low-interest \nloans; the Economic Development Administration in the Department of \nCommerce; and the millions of dollars to assist the Department of \nTransportation, as well as the American Red Cross.\n  I mentioned some damage done to the Department of Defense, and NASA, \nfor that matter. As a matter of fact, from the first hurricane, NASA \nincurred costs of $750,000, and the hurricane only just scraped the \nedge of the space center. This one did significant damage, taking out \n1,000 very large panels on the vehicle assembly building, which is the \nlargest building in volume where the space shuttle is stacked \nvertically. When we come together as the Federal Government, it is time \nto respond.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their favorable consideration of this \nrequest. I remind them that we are not through yet. We have some major \nadditional emergency supplemental appropriations. When we compare this \nto another major natural disaster such as Andrew, we can see the \nFederal Government spent over $6 billion on the cost of recovery from \nAndrew. It won't be that much for these two storms, but it will be \nsubstantial.\n  I am very grateful to the Senate for listening to the pleas of the \ntwo Senators from Florida as we ask for its help in this time of need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I expect most Senators feel as do I: \nWhatever resources are needed by the citizens of Florida to recover \nshould be provided by the Senate. I certainly will be one Senator who \nwants to support the $2 billion emergency supplemental that is \nnecessary now and whatever additional resources are needed to help \nFloridians recover from these devastating storms. The storm season is \nnot even over at this point. Most of us do not understand, perhaps, the \nexperience of the citizens of Florida. I did want to make the point \nearlier that when we do the second piece, there are some other parts of \nthe country that are going to have to be dealt with. That was the point \nI was making.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands: Whatever resources are \nneeded by the citizens of Florida, I believe the Senate should stand \nready to say to them, you are not alone; this country wants to help in \ntimes of need and in times of emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8820-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8820-S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NETWORK COVERAGE OF CONVENTIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the two political \nconventions. My speech will not be about the politics of the \nconventions but about the coverage of the conventions.\n  Senator Lott and I have worked all of this year and the major part of \nlast year on an issue dealing with the concentration of broadcast \nownership in a rule that was crafted by the Federal Communications \nCommission that would allow even greater concentration in broadcast \nownership. That rule would have allowed in the larger cities for one \ncompany to purchase three television stations, eight radio stations, \nthe cable system, and the largest newspaper, and that would be fine.\n  Many Republicans and Democrats don't think that is fine. We think the \nconcentration of ownership of media\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nproperties will mean that fewer and fewer Americans, probably fewer \nthan a handful of Americans, will determine what the rest of the \nAmerican people see, hear, and read. We don't think that is helpful.\n  A Federal court has overturned the rule the FCC developed and sent it \nback to them, saying ``redo it.'' Senator Lott and I and others hope \nthe FCC will do this the right way. The right way would be to promote \nmore economic opportunity and broader ownership, not concentrated \nownership in radio and television and newspapers.\n  This relates to the coverage of the Republican and Democratic \nConventions. I thought it was interesting this year that the coverage \nof the two political conventions was so spartan as to almost be \nnonexistent with respect to the major networks.\n  Michael Copps, a commissioner at the FCC, wrote an op-ed piece on the \nsubject. I ask unanimous consent to print it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 30, 2004]\n\n                         Show Me the Convention\n\n                         (By Michael J. Copps)\n\n       As a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Communications \n     Commission, I may not agree with many positions taken by \n     speakers this week at the Republican National Convention. \n     Even so, I believe our broadcast media owe us more coverage \n     of an event that remains an important component of the \n     presidential campaign. Yet tonight, if people around the \n     country tune in to the commercial broadcast TV networks, most \n     will not see any live convention coverage. That's not right.\n       Let's remember that American citizens own the public \n     airwaves, not TV executives. We give broadcasters the right \n     to use these airwaves for free in exchange for their \n     agreement to broadcast in the public interest. They earn huge \n     profits using this public resource. During this campaign \n     season broadcasters will receive nearly $1.5 billion from \n     political advertising.\n       What do we get in return for granting TV stations free use \n     of our airwaves? Unfortunately, when it comes to coverage of \n     issues important to our nation, the answer is less and less. \n     Coverage of the 2000 presidential election on the network \n     evening news dropped by a third compared to reporting on the \n     1996 election. During the last election cycle we heard \n     directly from presidential candidates for an average of 9 \n     seconds a night on the news. Local races? Forget it. In \n     2002--the most recent midterm elections--more than half of \n     local newscasts contained no campaign coverage at all. Local \n     coverage has diminished to the point that campaign ads \n     outnumber campaign stories by four to one. What coverage \n     there is focuses inordinately on polls and handicapping the \n     horse race.\n       TV executives tell us that the convention and campaign \n     coverage provided by the cable channels is sufficient. I \n     don't think so. Around 35 million Americans don't get cable, \n     often because they cannot afford it. To put it in \n     perspective, that's more than the combined populations of \n     Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Furthermore, \n     broadcasters legally undertake to serve the public interest \n     themselves in exchange for free spectrum--their licenses \n     don't allow them to pass the buck to cable. Remember also \n     that the vast majority of cable channels are national, not \n     local. So don't look for local campaign coverage on cable, \n     except in the few towns where local cable news exists. Most \n     Americans still must look to their local broadcaster for news \n     of local campaigns and issues.\n       The F.C.C. is doing nothing to help as the situation \n     deteriorates. It has weakened almost every explicit duty \n     stations once had for serving the public interest, like \n     ensuring that stations cover local issues and offer viewers a \n     diversity of opinion. Just as bad, the commission eliminated \n     protections against media consolidation last year, even \n     though critics warned that this would result in even less \n     local coverage. Luckily a federal court rejected this \n     decision, so we have another chance to save these rules.\n       The F.C.C. has also failed to set guidelines for how \n     broadcasters will meet their public interest responsibilities \n     when digital TV and multicasting become more widespread. To \n     make matters worse, the F.C.C. now practically rubber-stamps \n     TV license renewals, usually without auditing station records \n     to determine whether licensees are fulfilling their public \n     interest responsibilities or checking with communities to \n     ensure that stations are meeting local needs.\n       Whether we are Democrats, Republicans or independents, we \n     all can agree that democracy depends on well-informed \n     citizens. So as you flip through the channels tonight while \n     the convention is largely ignored, consider whether TV \n     broadcasters, sustained by free access to the public airwaves \n     in exchange for programming in the public interest, are \n     holding up their end of the deal.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Copps makes the point that we give broadcasters the \nright to use the airwaves in exchange for their agreement to broadcast \nin the public interest. They don't own the airwaves. They are licensed \nto use them in exchange for broadcasting in the public interest. They \nalso earn substantial money in broadcasting properties from advertising \nduring television campaigns. It is expected they will earn nearly $1.5 \nbillion from political advertising.\n  What do we get in return? We get almost no coverage any longer, very \nspartan coverage of the two political conventions. Television and other \nexecutives say: That is because people can watch the conventions on \ncable television. Well, there are more channels. There is cable. But 35 \nmillion Americans don't get cable television.\n  Let me take a look at what has happened, as Mr. Copps describes it in \nhis piece. On Monday, August 30, the Republican Convention was held in \nNew York. This is a Monday evening. None of the networks decided they \nwould cover the Republican Convention. It is strange for me to be \nprotesting that, but nonetheless I think the networks have a \nresponsibility and should have had a responsibility to provide \nextensive coverage of both political conventions. So on Monday night, \nthey did not show the American people the speech by Senator McCain, our \ncolleague. Incidentally, I think that speech should have been heard by \nthe American people. They didn't air the speech by Rudy Giuliani. The \nAmerican people should have heard that speech. Why is it they couldn't \nhave done that?\n  Let me show you what they were airing on Monday evening. They had \n``Access Hollywood.'' That was important. Then they went to ``Fear \nFactor.'' That is where you sometimes tune in and you see people eating \na bowl of maggots or whatever other disgusting thing happens on ``Fear \nFactor.'' I have seen it as I have used the remote control to change \nthe channels. ``Complex Malibu,'' they aired--eight couples begin the \ncompetition by working on a master bedroom--and NFL preseason, and the \n``Last Comic Standing.''\n  The American people couldn't get the Republican Convention that \nevening because this is what was aired on television. This was a Monday \nevening, the first evening of the convention.\n  What about the Democratic Convention? The networks decided they \nwouldn't broadcast on Tuesday evening of the Democratic Convention. \nThey broadcast three nights, 1 hour each evening for three nights. On \nTuesday evening, July 27, the keynote speaker Barak Obama spoke, Teresa \nHeinz spoke. The American people didn't get to listen to those \nspeeches. They should have been able to.\n  Here is what was going on. They aired that evening ``Trading Spouses, \nMeet Your New Mommy,'' ``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``Last Comic Standing,'' \n``Quintuplets,'' ``The Amazing Race,'' eight teams travel from \nArgentina to St. Petersburg, Russia. The networks were too busy. They \ndidn't want to put on 2 hours a night for four nights, or four hours a \nnight, they used to do that.\n  Some people say the conventions are staged. Really? Well, there are a \nlot of stories at the conventions. But those stories are not covered \nthese days by the major broadcast networks. Why? Because they are only \nbroadcasting 1 hour a night, three nights; 3 hours, total 6 hours, for \nboth the Republican and the Democratic National Conventions; 6 hours \nevery 4 years. How does that relate to the obligation to serve in the \npublic interest? How does that relate to what Senator Lott and I and \nothers have been talking about, how a few people decide what the \nAmerican people read or hear? How many people do you think made the \ndecision we will only offer 3 hours to the American people of the \nRepublican National Convention on the major networks? How many people \ndo you think made the decision we will only offer 3 hours of the \nDemocratic Convention?\n  I think both the Republican Convention and the Democratic Convention \nwere shortchanged. Why do I say that? Because the fact is, we make \ndecisions in the political process. Our major national conventions are \na significant part of the process. The dialog, the discussion, the \ndebate in those conventions is a significant part of showing and \ntelling the American people what these political parties are about. I\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\nknow we get plenty of television in politics. But most of it is 30-\nsecond incendiary, negative ads talking about who is the worst rather \nthan who is the best. Very few of them have any ideas or talk about \nissues.\n  The question is, as Commissioner Copps points out in his editorial \npublished in the New York Times, are the networks serving this \ncountry's interests by deciding they shall air only 3 hours every 4 \nyears of a major political convention?\n  In 1976, the three major television networks provided more than 50 \nhours of television convention coverage. In 1996, 20 years later, that \nhad dropped to 12 hours. This year it dropped to 6 hours.\n  The New York Daily News said that before cable and satellite, ABC, \nCBS, and NBC turned over their prime time to the conventions as a \nmatter of civic duty.\n  It is interesting to me that these conventions are staged so tightly. \nOne of the reasons they are created as tightly as they are with respect \nto agenda is to fit into the very short time period the networks now \noffer for the coverage of the conventions.\n  Mr. President, the issue of broadcast ownership and the concentration \nof broadcast ownership remains at the FCC. The question is, what will \nthey do with these rules and how will the rules affect what people see \nand hear in the future? How does concentration of economic ownership in \nbroadcast properties affect what we saw this year, the coverage of only \n3 hours of the Republican and Democratic Conventions? I have described \nsignificant speakers the American people did not have an opportunity to \nsee or hear. Someone made a decision it wasn't worth it. This is what \nSenator Lott and I and others have been concerned about for a long \nwhile--about the concentration of ownership in broadcast properties.\n  Again, I am not against big in every circumstance. I don't think big \nis always bad or small is always beautiful. But in broadcast \nproperties--radio, television, and newspapers--I think broad-based \neconomic ownership best serves this democracy. I think when we see more \nand more concentration, where you have fewer and fewer people--in some \ncases a handful--deciding what the American people will see, hear, and \nread, frankly, I think that is unhealthy. One sign of that is what they \ndecided to air at a time when they decided the two political \nconventions by the national Republican party and the national \nDemocratic party were unworthy. I think it goes without saying that \nthey have shortchanged the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ncompletion of my remarks Senator Harkin be recognized for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8822-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8822-S8827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISSUES BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been quite a while since the Senate \nhas been in session. I spent the entire time traveling up and down my \nState learning a lot from my people, as I always do. I am coming back \nhere ready to work for as long as it takes to protect the American \npeople, to do what we can about the health care crisis, Medicare, and \nthe rest. How much we get done is going to be up to us. Of course, the \nleadership around here has to go to the bills that will make us safe, \nhelp our seniors, take up the issue of health care, and will get the \ndeficits under control. That is their job. We will see what happens.\n  I hope we go to Homeland Security appropriations because there is a \nlot of work we need to do on that bill to make sure it truly does \nprotect the American people.\n\n\n                Best Wishes to Former President Clinton\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to use this opportunity to send my \nbest wishes to President Clinton as he recovers from very serious \nsurgery, which, thank the Lord, appears to be successful. I know the \nfirst few days are the toughest. We have had a number of calls into our \noffice from my constituents. I wanted to say that if they want to send \na message to President Clinton, they should, if they have access to a \ncomputer, go to the following site: www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org. \nThen they can go to the right side of the page and there is a link \nwhere they can send personal best wishes to President Clinton.\n  As usual, President Clinton is going to teach the country something \nabout heart disease. I thought I would take a moment to say this is \nsomething I have been working on for years, since 1997. I introduced \nthe Women's Cardiovascular Disease Research and Prevention Act. I was \nproud to do it with Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Together, we wrote \nthis bill and it was to expand and coordinate the efforts of fighting \nheart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women.\n  A lot of women don't think cardiovascular disease--heart attack and \nstroke--is a threat to them. Yet, if you look at the numbers, nearly \n500,000 women die of cardiovascular disease each year. The number is \nfar less for breast cancer. Of course, we live in fear of breast \ncancer, which kills far fewer. But cardiovascular disease in women is \nthe biggest killer. More than 20 percent of Americans have some kind of \ncardiovascular disease, with over half being women.\n  So President Clinton, I know, is going to do very well. He has taught \nus so many things about issues and I know he will teach us a lot about \nhow to prevent heart disease and how to make sure, if you have a family \nhistory, you take the right exams so that you find out early if you \nhave it. I am proud my bill became law in 1998 as part of a larger bill \non women's health.\n\n\n                        American Deaths in Iraq\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, according to CNN this morning, there have \nbeen 999 total U.S. deaths in Iraq. We are one away from 1,000 deaths. \nWhen the President stood on the carrier with the ``mission \naccomplished'' sign behind him, 138 of our soldiers had died. That was \nMay 1, 2003. Since the President declared mission accomplished--and he \ndid it, as many of us said on both sides of the aisle, without a plan \nfor the aftermath of the war, which was brilliantly executed--we have \nlost 861 more soldiers.\n  When I was home, I met with veterans from this war and the one in \nAfghanistan. Mr. President, 6,916 Americans have been injured in Iraq. \nAccording to a report in the L.A. Times, 57 percent have been injured \nso severely that they are unable to return to duty. I asked what the \nsuicide rate was in Iraq. I learned from the military that the suicide \nrate is very high--64 percent higher than the suicide rate in our \ncountry, and it is 34 percent higher than in any other war theater. So \nwe better be ready for the veterans who are coming back from that war, \nwith 6,916 wounded.\n  The Washington Post got hold of the veterans budget of this \nadministration, and what did they learn? They learned that the Bush \ndraft budget for 2006 includes an overall VA cut of $910 million. If we \nlove our soldiers--and I believe we all do--how could we possibly cut \nthe VA budget at a time when we are getting close to, at this point, \n7,000 injured vets coming home?\n  The total of California's deaths is 254. I have paid tribute to each \nand every one of those who died from California--those who were either \nborn in California, lived in California, or went to Iraq or Afghanistan \nfrom a California base. Today, I want to pay tribute to 48 more \ncasualties that happened between the time we left 6 weeks ago and now.\n  This relates to those killed in Iraq, not Afghanistan, since July 5. \nAll of them are from California or based in California. So I will go \nthrough these names.\n  LCpl John Vangyzen, age 21. Lance Corporal Vangyzen died on July 5 as \na result of enemy action in Al Anbar Province.

We are within a score of having a thousand deaths in Iraq. \nI say to my friend from California, I appreciate it so much because I \nhave been on the Senate floor where I have lamented the fact and have \nreferred to major newspapers around the country where the deaths of our \nservicemen have been relegated to page 14 and page 7 of newspapers \naround the country. Each one of these 254 deaths involves the sons, \ndaughters, husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, cousins, and neighbors, \npeople who will long remember those who died in service to their \ncountry.\n  We cannot take for granted what is happening in Iraq.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator wanted to be notified when she \nused another 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes after \nmy additional 5, so it would be an additional 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I simply want to say that it is important to me to do what \nwe can to recognize what is going on in Iraq. It is a situation that is \nextremely difficult and desperate. It appears now that we have not \nsolved the Sadr problem. We have moved from Najaf to where we lost 7 \nMarines last night in Sadr City where he now resides, with more than 2 \nmillion people residing in that city.\n  So I again want the record to reflect my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom California for giving recognition to these gallant servicemen who \nhave lost their lives in Iraq. I wish she would continue to do so. At \nthe very least, the relatives and friends of these gallant soldiers \nshould have their names recognized. They deserve more than that, but \ncertainly that is a step in the right direction.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could respond to my friend, and also say to my \nfriend from Iowa, I have found there is so little focus on these young \nmen and women who are sacrificing. We do not see them when they come \nhome. We do not hear about them and the ones who are wounded. I say to \nmy friend, and he may not be aware of this, one more soldier and we are \ngoing to see a thousand dead. It is 999 today.\n  Mr. REID. I did not realize that. The last number I saw was about \n978.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right, 999. Now is the time, if ever there were a time, \nto reflect on this policy. Now, President Bush says we are not turning \nback. One has to ask themselves: What does that mean? We are not \nturning back from what? We are not turning back from a war without a \nplan?\n  Well, I hope we will get a plan. We need a plan. Just as we had a \nmilitary plan, we need a plan. Things are at a state now where I have \nto come and take the time to do this. There is discontent on the other \nside. It takes a long time to read 48 new names of Californians. Is \nthat not the least we can do? I have talked about what the potential of \neach of them was. These are the sons and daughters of our people.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We are focused today, and certainly I support the Senator \nin doing so, on the soldiers who are dead. As the Senator indicated, it \nis now 999. The one thing we do not focus on is this war is different \nthan any war we have ever had. The ratio of deaths to casualties is \nmuch different. The casualties in this war--those people being \nwounded--are very severe although they have the use of body armor and \nother protections included in most of the vehicles. We have many severe \nburns, people being blinded, paralyzed, losing limbs. These are people \nwho are nameless, hundreds and hundreds, into the thousands now, of \npeople who have been severely wounded, not wounded but severely \nwounded. I wish there were some way we could recognize the suffering \nthat is going on.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, when I opened up my remarks, I stated \nthat 6,916 Americans have been injured in Iraq. My friend is right, it \nis an enormous number. According to a report in the L.A. Times, 57 \npercent have been injured so severely that they are unable to return to \nduty. These are very severe injuries.\n  My point is, is this the time, then, to have a budget that the \nPresident--we found out about it because The Washington Post got a \ncopy--cuts VA by $910 million? There are these many Americans, and God \nknows what the total will be by the end of the month.\n  ``We are not turning back.'' The President says that over and over \nagain. ``We are staying the course.'' Well, why do we not look at this \ncourse? Why do we not look at these policies? Why do we not see if \nthere are ways to better handle this, to internationalize this, to take \nthe burden off of the backs of our young people, as Senator Kerry has \nsaid? Where is the plan?\n  I yield to my friend.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator to yield. I thank the Senator for her \nvery perceptive and very sensitive approach on this issue of what is \nhappening with our troops in Iraq. The Senator from Nevada is \nabsolutely right about this, that this war is different than any we \nhave ever had. I suppose the good news is we are saving a lot more \nlives than we have ever in the past. We are there with our medical \nequipment, as the Senator said, as well as because of body armor and a \nlot of other things. But what we are also experiencing, as the Senator \nfrom California pointed out, is a higher level of individuals with \nsevere injuries, injuries that not only won't allow them to return to \nactive duty but will mean they are going to carry their burdens the \nrest of their natural lives, for them and their families.\n\n  What is unanswered, among all the other things that are unanswered--\nhow we are going to get out of Iraq, how we are going to protect our \ntroops better, how we are going to get other countries to come in, how \nwe are going to pay for it, endless questions--the one nagging \nquestion, which I believe the Senator from California has just put her \nfinger on, is: Will we, will this administration, and will this \nCongress commit itself to ensuring that these young men and women who \nhave been so severely injured will have the supporting mechanisms, the \neducational benefits, the kind of things that are needed so they can \nlive a full, rich, productive life here in America? That has never been \ncommitted to by this administration.\n  When the President says he wants to stay the course, is that one \ncourse on which he wants to stay, I ask my friends, that we will not \ncommit ourselves to making sure these brave young men and women are \ntaken care of, that all their medical needs are met, but more important \nthat they are able to lead full, productive lives here in America?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. The sad truth is we got a copy of their \nbudget.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. President Bush, this is going to be an issue. People are \ngoing to take a look at this. It is one thing to send our troops to \nwar; it is another thing to not be there with what they need when they \ncome back. And we are going to make that an issue.\n  There is one other thing we need to make an issue because there are \nsome things going on in this country that are on the wrong track. I \nknow my friend agrees with this. The seniors in this country just got \nhit with a 17.4-percent increase in their Medicare premiums. I say to \nmy friend from Iowa, who is a champion not only of veterans but of \nseniors and children and education and all these other issues, how are \nour elderly going to handle this? This is the largest single premium \nincrease in nearly 40 years of history with Medicare.\n  My friend and I know why. The No. 1 reason is this: This \nadministration worked on a Medicare bill that has a $14 billion slush \nfund to the HMOs, to ``convince them,'' to convince them to take \nMedicare patients. That is $14 billion.\n  What else? Medicare is prohibited from negotiating for lower drug \nprices. I say to my friend, if you walked down the street in Des Moines \nor anywhere in your State, and you went up to someone and said: Guess \nwhat. The Government is telling you you can't shop around for the best \nprice. If you want to go around and buy a bike for your kid, you have \nto go to Mike's bike shop, not Ray's bike shop or Barbara's bike shop.\n  Your constituents would say: Senator, if that is the kind of \nGovernment I have, hey, this is not the country I know it is.\n  Yet and still, this administration, backed by the majority party, \ntied Medicare's hands. Now our people are paying through the nose and \nthey are frightened.\n  I have been home for the last 2 months, and my senior citizens--first \nof all, they say this is the worst prescription drug benefit they ever \nsaw. They don't understand it. The only time they can take advantage of \nit is if they fit a certain profile. Most of them don't even want it. \nNow they have to pay for something they didn't want because it is built \ninto these premiums. That is what the administration says. They are \ngiving you a great new benefit. Now you pay for it. And they are paying \nfor a slush fund for the HMOs.\n  Here is the deal. This President says we are not going back; we are \nnot changing course. All well and good if the course is working. But \nwhen it is not working, when we are paying the cost of Iraq, 90 percent \nof it both in the injuries and in the pocketbook, and we are spending \nnow in excess of $200 billion over there and the deficits are--what are \nthey now, $400 billion plus? The highest ever in the history of our \ncountry? Stay the course? Don't turn back from debts that are falling \non our people? Don't turn back from Medicare premium increases?\n\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. One additional minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So it is one thing to stand in front of a microphone and \nsay don't turn back, if you have policies that are working. But when \nyou have policies that are costing us lives in Iraq, 90 percent of the \ncasualties, 90 percent of the cost, and then you turn your back on our \nallies? When the President landed on that ``mission accomplished'' \ncarrier, our allies begged to help us in Iraq. Oh, no, we weren't going \nto share the spoils of this with them. The rebuilding was just going to \nHalliburton folks.\n  That is the price our people are paying. I love them dearly and I \nwant to see them come back home and be relieved by people from all over \nthe world. And I want to see our senior citizens not have to choose \nbetween medicine and food. This is wrong.\n  So, hopefully, we will see some changes in this country. I think you \nand I agree they are sorely needed. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California for her very clear \npresentation today. What is happening to make America weaker? We are \ngetting weaker all the time. As the Senator from California pointed \nout, we are getting weaker because our seniors now are denied the \nmedical care they need and ought to have. We are getting weaker because \nour deficits are going up at an alarming rate. We are getting weaker \nbecause we are getting sucked further and further into the quagmire of \nIraq with no end in sight. We are getting weaker in this country \nbecause the middle class is getting squeezed. The wealthy are getting \nthe tax breaks.\n  I am beginning to think that George W. Bush stands for George Weaker \nBush. Weakening America, that is what is happening in this country. We \nare weaker than what we were.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her very perceptive analysis \nand for her continued progressive views on turning our country in the \ncorrect direction.\n  I like the expression, what the Senator from California said about \nPresident Bush, saying he wants to stay the course or don't turn back. \nDon't turn back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It seems to me, if you are on a highway in a car, and you \nare headed towards a cliff and there is a bend in the road that you can \ntake and it will save you, what sense does it make to keep going \nstraight off the cliff?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Good one.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That seems to me what the President is saying: Stay in \nthe car with me. I do not change course.\n  We are already kind of over the cliff. We are going to go down it.\n  We could make some changes in our economic policy, our fiscal policy. \nCertainly, we can make changes in our foreign policy, in our policy in \nIraq, to turn this country so we do not continue to go off the cliff.\n  I guess the President says that he knows where he is going. There is \none thing about being resolute in one's determination to do certain \nthings. But there comes a point where you are stubborn in the face of \nfacts and reality. I am afraid this President does not realize the \ndifference between being resolute and carrying out policies, and being \nstubborn when those policies are hurting America and making us weaker.\n  I want to change the focus of the discussion. I want to talk about \nthe economy. This morning the Congressional Budget Office announced it \nnow\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\nprojects this year's budget deficit will rise to $422 billion, an all-\ntime high. Actually, if you look at this chart, if you look at the red, \nthat is the budget deficit of $422 billion for 2004. But if you exclude \nSocial Security surplus, the budget deficit is really $574 billion.\n  Bear in mind, this comes from a President who originally pledged he \nwould not run deficits and he would protect Social Security surpluses. \nTalk about flip-flopping, this is the flip-flop of all time.\n  Now we see these deficits are not only huge but they are going to \ncontinue as far as the eye can see. It is shocking when we look at \nwhere we were 4 years ago when we had an all-time-high budget surplus \nand we could see these surpluses continuing on through this decade when \nwe were strong in the world, when we had other countries supporting us, \nand now to see where we have come in 4 short years.\n  Right now our operating budget deficit, without counting the Social \nSecurity surplus, is about 5 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  Last year the President's Council of Economic Advisers predicted \nnormal job growth would be 228,000 jobs a month, about the average \nlevel during the Clinton administration. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers said the job growth would be even more if we passed the 2003 \ntax bill which was done. It said we would create 305,000 jobs a month. \nUnfortunately, over the past 3 months job creation has been about one-\nthird that rate. A million jobs have been lost since Mr. Bush took \noffice.\n  It seems to me the appropriate question to ask is are we better off \ntoday than we were 4 years ago as a nation? Again, look back. It seems \nalmost like a distant utopia when I read the figures. We were the envy \nof the world in 2000, with 23 million new jobs created and the largest \nbudget surplus in U.S. history--$236 billion in 1 year. But now, 4 \nyears later, we are weaker in almost every respect in this country.\n  Data released by the Census Bureau paints a very disturbing picture. \nSince Mr. Bush took office, real median household income has fallen by \n$1,535. During the Clinton administration the real median household \nincome went up $5,489. Look at the difference. Median income up under \nthe Clinton administration, median income down $1,535 a year under the \nBush administration.\n  Then look at poverty. The number of Americans living in poverty has \nrisen by 4.3 million under President Bush through 2003. During the \nClinton administration, 6.4 million Americans were lifted out of \npoverty. In 4 years of Bush, 4.28 million have been driven into \npoverty.\n  Is that progress? We should stay the course? We should not turn back? \nI would love to turn back to the economic policies of the Clinton \nyears. No. This President says no, stay the course.\n  In every single way we are weaker.\n  The number of Americans without health insurance has gone up 5.2 \nmillion in the last 4 years. The policies of this administration have \nweakened our economy. They have depleted our Federal Treasury. They \nhave made America a weaker country.\n  Now look at taxes. A new study by the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us the real story. The share of taxes borne by those making more \nthan $1 million a year was reduced by 10 percent thanks to the tax cuts \nof this administration. But the share of taxes borne by the middle-\nincome taxpayers actually increased by almost 5 percent. Meanwhile, \ninterest on the public debt because of these huge deficits will nearly \ndouble in the next 4 years. By 2009, every year we will be paying \n$1,000 in interest for every man, woman, and child in America. That is \n$4,000 for a family of four. It is making our future weaker.\n  We hear a lot of talk from this administration about doing away with \nthe so-called death tax, the tax on accumulated wealth--so-called \nestate taxes--the idea being that we don't end up with those with \nbillions of dollars being able to pass it all on while average \nAmericans have to face more and more debt. The Bush administration says \nthey want to get rid of the estate tax.\n  What about the birth tax? What about the tax this administration is \nleveling on every child who is going to be born in America in the \nfuture? Every child born in the United States henceforth will have \n$1,000 taxes put on his or her head as soon as they are born. No one is \ntalking about the birth tax. We ought to be talking about that rather \nthan trying to have the wealthy pay a little bit more fair share of \ntheir taxes in this country.\n\n  Again, because of the interest on the national debt, a family of \nfour, as I said, will be paying $4,000 a year. Guess what? That is one \ntax that cannot be cut. Who is going to be paying it? Middle-income \ntaxpayers, $4,000 a year. That is a new birth tax on every child born \nin America. But no, we do not hear the administration talking about \nthat.\n  The real reason the economy is so weak is that for 4 years the Bush \nadministration has been preaching fiscal conservatism, but has been \npracticing a reckless ``damn the torpedoes'' brand of fiscal \nradicalism. We have had a radical fiscal policy over the last 4 years. \nThe Bush team sees cutting taxes as the be-all and end-all of their \npolitical existence. For them, cutting taxes is not an economic plan; \nit is not even an ideology. It is a theology of one size fits all. If \nthe economy is weak, you cut taxes. If the economy is strong, you cut \ntaxes. If there is a surplus, you cut taxes. If there are huge \ndeficits, you cut taxes. You have a war on terrorism, cut taxes.\n  How many Americans realize that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are \nthe first wars in American history to be paid for and financed by tax \ncuts? In the past, we have always asked the American people to help \nfight our wars by paying increased taxes. Now tax cuts for the wealthy, \nbirth tax on the kids of middle-income taxpayers, more costs for \nmedical health for the elderly, and the deficit continues to go up.\n  As I said, this year it is really $577 billion, not $422 billion--\n$577 billion. That is because you have to count the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  The President says stay the course, don't turn back. For 4 years this \nPresident and his team have pursued policies that have led to deficits, \ndebt, drift, and decline. He is leaving a dramatic and weakened economy \nand Treasury to his successor and to the next generation.\n  We have to do better. We can do better. The answer is not to stay \nwith the driver of the car who is going to drive you over the cliff \nbecause he is too stubborn to recognize what is weakening America. The \nanswer is to modify our policies, change our course to build a brighter \nand a stronger and better America for our children and grandchildren. \nVice President Cheney famously asserted that ``deficits don't matter.'' \nI couldn't disagree more. So do all mainstream economists. The truth is \ndeficits do matter and they matter profoundly. Chronic, long-term \ndeficits that we now see mean the Federal Government must accumulate \nhuge and growing debt held in bonds. That means the Government is \ncompeting with limited dollars and crowding out other borrowers. This \nputs other pressure on interest rates. That is bad for job creation.\n  Second, as the Government's debt increases, it is harder to find \nresources to make investments here at home in our roads and our \nbridges, our schools and educational systems. That means a less \nefficient transportation system and as less skilled workforce. That is \nbad for business.\n  Third, as we are already seeing, a far larger share of our \nGovernment's bonds are being bought up by foreign governments. Japan, \nChina, and South Korea have particularly heavy purchases of our bonds.\n  Should that be a worry? It means their future decisions can have a \nmajor impact on our economy. In the long term, sooner or later we have \nto expect the dollar to fall dramatically if our policies don't change. \nThat will hurt our economy by driving up inflation as we pay more for \nthe imports that come into our country.\n  Lastly, as I have said before and I will keep repeating it, it is \nespecially troubling for the young people in America for them and their \nfuture; for our obligations that we have to meet the obligations of the \nbaby boomers who will soon retire and make sure we keep our commitment \nto them to meet their health needs and to make sure Social Security is \nsound.\n\n  We do not make Social Security sound by driving us further and \nfurther into debt. We do not solve the problem by privatizing Social \nSecurity. We already see in the private sector more\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\nand more retirement plans under fire. United Airlines and others. Now \nthey want to take Social Security and put it out there on the stock \nmarket, too.\n  Lastly, our incomes are down in America. We know that. What is the \nanswer of this President? Cut overtime. A couple weeks ago the \nPresident put into effect administration rules that will take away \novertime pay protection for over 6 million Americans. Before that rule \nwas promulgated by the administration, they never had one public \nhearing.\n  Thanks to the Senator from Pennsylvania, we did have a couple of \nhearings--two or three--in the Senate, but that was after the horse was \nout of the barn. At least we had the hearings. Every time we had the \nhearings, it became clear the overtime rules were going to hurt working \nAmericans; that they were not going to clear up, as they said, \nambiguous rules that already existed; that, in fact, this was an \nassault on overtime. It was a way of allowing employers the ability to \nredefine what you do as a worker, to reclassify you, have you work over \n40 hours a week, and not have to pay you overtime. That is what is \nhappening.\n  Lastly, the income tax of this country is moving away from being an \nincome tax. It is under this Administration becoming a wage tax. If you \nwork and you make wages, you get taxed. However, if you have investment \nincome, dividend income, and a bunch of other things such as that, \nwell, under the President's plans, you will not have to worry too much \nabout paying taxes anymore.\n  So what we will have in America is a work tax. If you work for a \nliving and make a wage, you will pay taxes. You pay the full brunt of \ntaxes. But if you are a very high income person, and most of your \nincome is off of dividends, your taxes have already been sharply \nreduced and if the President's wishes come to pass, you do not pay much \nin taxes.\n  We are robbing our kids. We are hurting our elderly. We are making \nAmerica weaker and weaker as every day, every week goes by in this \ncrazy economic policy of this administration. I cannot think of any \nother word for it other than to say it is beyond the pale. I don't mind \nan administration that takes a chance, that has maybe a new economic \ntheory to test. OK, fine. But when it proves, year after year after \nyear that it does not work, why keep doing it?\n  Someone once defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over \nagain and expecting a different result. Why do we keep trying the same \neconomic policy year after year after year? We see the same results: \nhigher unemployment, less family income, more people in poverty, higher \ndeficits, higher debt. Yet the President says: Keep me as your driver, \nstay in the car, as we continue to make America weaker and drive over a \ncliff.\n  It is time to change course in this country. It is time to put our \ncountry back on a fiscally sound basis in this country or else this \ncountry is going to be facing even larger deficits, bigger debts, more \nforeign countries buying more bonds. As the old saying goes, he who \npays the piper calls the tune. I am afraid a country that owns all of \nour debt will call our tune and that will be the ultimate weakness for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain, Mr. Specter, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Bayh \npertaining to the introduction of S. 2774 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, across this land, our people are driving \nup to the gasoline pumps, and they are filling their tank. In the last \n6 or 8 months, every time they filled up their tank, the amount went \nup, up, and up. It peaked for a while, but still, in some parts of \nAmerica, it is $2 a gallon, $1.90, $1.96.\n  Everybody understands that America has no energy policy. A few months \nago, we had a blackout--remember--in the northeastern part of America, \nsomething a country such as ours should not have unless somebody \nintentionally and physically destroyed power lines or big connectors. \nBut it happened because of overload, and it happened because we do not \nhave an energy policy.\n  Natural gas, our most plentiful fuel and the one that is best for \nAmerica's future, we thought we had enough for anything forever and \never. It turns out that unless we do something to increase our supply, \nit, too, is going to be in short supply. As a matter of fact, as tough \nas it is to admit this, unless we bring some huge new natural gas \nsupplies on in America, this great land will go from dependence on \ncrude oil to another state of dependence: dependence on foreign sources \nfor natural gas.\n  We have solar. We have all the renewables. And at this time in our \nhistory, they are stalemated. The reason they are stalemated is because \nthey need an energy policy. They need the Energy bill that is sitting \nup at that desk. It has production credits that existed before for all \nthe renewables, for clean coal and its development. All of those are in \nthis bill. The Energy bill is up there at the desk.\n  Rising oil prices and the fact we have no energy policy is dangerous \nfor our national security, for our environment, for jobs, and for the \npersonal prosperity of our people and our consumers.\n  Around the world, we are seeing increased demands for energy, \nincreasingly thin reserves of fossil fuels, and increased instability \nof oil-producing countries. Demand for oil is growing. The price goes \nup and down, not so much because of supply but because there is no \nassurance of supply--interruptions, revolutions--and so America sits by \nand we look at it all, and I guess we would all like to say somebody \nelse is to blame.\n  I hear in the campaign that nobody wants to talk too much about \nenergy. One of the candidates said we have to stop being dependent on \nforeign oil. I am not standing here saying that Energy bill at the desk \ndoes that because we are already 60--and going up--percent dependent, \nand I defy anybody to have a plan to get rid of that. I guess if you \nwant to order Americans to get rid of all their cars and buy little \nones that get 100 miles to a gallon or 60, you might do something. But \nnobody will vote for that.\n\n  Is my time running out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  So here is what we have to do. We have to look at ourselves and say: \nWhat can we do to produce all kinds of new alternative fuels that will \ngive us a chance to prove to the world that we are not going to sit by \nand do nothing? We are going to say we are going to do something big \nabout natural gas. This bill says some of the available outer \ncontinental gas, which is not environmentally precluded, can be gotten. \nWe are going to say there is a huge supply from Alaska. Not the one \neverybody objects to. I should not say everyone. Some do, but I don't. \nBut other natural gas can be brought to the central part of America, to \nChicago, and in a few years it will provide another great source.\n  We have language in this bill that will stabilize electricity, in \nterms of regions. It will put in some standards. Yes, from everything \nwe understand, it has a real chance of doing two things: encouraging \ninvestment in electricity, which we need desperately; second, seeing \nthat we do not have any blackouts in the future.\n  Frankly, for the past 21 months--not alone but with other people--we \nhave worked to develop a consensus on an energy bill. The other side, \nthe Democrats, have insisted, because they filibustered the Energy \nbill, that we get 60\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nvotes. Actually, the bill at the desk has been recrafted, so it seems \nto us it should get 60 votes.\n  It is not so good that we have to get 60. Americans used to think \nthat 51 votes would win, right? They look at television and they say: \nWhat do you mean you lost that bill? You got 58 votes.\n  If we are filibustering, we need 60. We took out the portion of this \nbill that was most objectionable, and it is not in there anymore. I am \nnot going into detail about it. Everybody in here knows it has to do \nwith a piece of legislation that was in the original bill that held \ncertain companies harmless from a fuel additive that was prescribed, \nmandated by the Federal Government, and OK'd by the Federal Government. \nThen when it got out in the field, if people caused it to leak or \ndropped it on the ground, it caused damage. So people want to make the \ncompanies that did it liable. In this body we don't want to say to \nthose companies, ``You are OK.'' So we took that out. It is not in \nthere.\n  The House of Representatives has done their thing. After we passed \nthe bill big in conference, within 48 hours they passed it. It came \nhere. We got 48 votes. As everyone knows, we had to try to fix it. We \ndid. The Senator occupying the chair helped. He did a yeoman's job \nhelping us, as did many other Senators. We tried to bring it up. \nSenators said: We will filibuster again. If we don't filibuster, we \nhave scores of amendments to add to it.\n  Let me tell you, the Energy bill could do the following. Anybody who \nis interested in jobs ought to be for it. It would create more than \n800,000 jobs. It would revitalize rural America by encouraging \nrenewable fuels such as ethanol. It would increase the production of \nrenewables of every kind--wind, solar, geothermal, and the like. It \nwould build an Alaskan natural gas pipeline, encourage production of \ndomestic natural gas besides Alaska, and domestic oil.\n  I am not overstating the oil. We can't produce ourselves out of \ndependence, but we can produce more than we are producing.\n  It can strengthen the future of the nuclear energy option, promote \nclean coal technology, promote hydrogen--which the President said we \nstart with a $5 billion program because hydrogen may indeed be the fuel \nof the future; promote energy efficiency, increase our research and \ndevelopment in various technologies.\n  On electricity, I have stated it in generalities, but let me be very \nprecise. It establishes mandatory reliability rules for the electricity \ngrid and promotes investment and expansion of the electricity grid.\n  We have labored for years. There has not been an energy bill in 12 \nyears. I don't know how comprehensive it was, but it was hard to get \ndone, and it did a lot of things. Now we have many sound concepts in \nthis bill. If we can reach agreement to limit debate to an agreeable, \nreasonable number of amendments--I suggest anything reasonable. Come \ndown here and say 10 amendments on each side and then vote. I would \nlike to try that. I will bet there are some on the other side who would \nobject.\n  Why would they object? Is not 10 amendments enough for anybody to get \ntheir ideas to change this bill considered and get on with voting on \nit? I think it is. But let's hear something positive. I hope we can try \nthat. Then at least Americans will know we tried. Americans will know, \nas we said, we need a policy to move forward.\n  Energy is a complex and multifaceted problem. To approach it as a \nsingle-issue problem is very small thinking and not the best way to \nmove this country forward. The Energy bill is about big thinking, \nforward-looking principles that would guide us to better technologies, \nmore secure energy, more secure resources that deal with energy and the \nsafest operation of our energy assets. I suggest the Energy bill is a \ngood place to start, and we ought to start soon. There is no other way.\n  I know my time is quickly running out, but I want to close by saying \nto the Democrats, to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman: Why \ndon't you let us vote? There are many Farm Belt Senators. You would \nthink they would be for this bill. They should be. I spoke of ethanol. \nIt is in here. Some people don't like it, but at least it is a product. \nIt is energy that is produced here. It is renewable to a great extent, \nand the farmers of America would very much have another serious crop.\n  Add it all together, I can't understand why those on the other side, \nthe Democrats, would like to kill it. At least during this week, next \nweek, and the week after, those concerned about renewables--clean coal, \nnatural gas--everything I have spoken about today, they are going to \nknow it wasn't the Republicans, it wasn't the President. It is those on \nthat side of the aisle who do not want to let us do anything.\n  Mr. President, I hope I am wrong. I hope after all these months we \nwill see something positive happen. If not, we will keep insisting that \nwe ought to vote and get something done.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, the new deficit numbers came out today \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. They show that we will now run \nthe largest deficit in the history of the country--some $422 billion. \nThat is nearly $50 billion more than last year, and it should alarm \nevery Member of this body and certainly every Member of the Congress. \nWe are headed in a direction that is utterly unsustainable.\n  When the President was asked about this in a recent interview on NBC, \nthe questioner said this to him:\n\n       Let me ask you about deficits. This year, $445 billion, \n     ballpark. Do you think that's pretty good?\n\n  The President said:\n\n       Yes. I do. I do.\n\n  When you are running the worst deficits in the history of the \ncountry, to think that is good news I find unusual. This is not good \nnews. It reminds me a little of the captain of the Titanic when the \nship is going down saying: Well, there is good news here because the \nship is not sinking as fast as I thought it would.\n  We can't continue with deficits of this magnitude. This President ran \non the promise that he was going to be fiscally responsible. But look \nat his record compared to the previous three Presidents: President \nReagan ran a large deficit; President Bush 1 ran large deficits--in \nfact, the largest deficit in history in his final year; under President \nClinton, we had deficit improvement each and every year. We climbed up \nout of the red ink, and for several years--in fact, 4 years--we were \ndeficit free. Now President Bush took over, and each and every year the \ndeficits have gotten worse. In fact, we can all recall that he \ninherited a substantial budget surplus--$127 billion. Then each and \nevery year the deficits have gotten much worse.\n  One of the things that is most alarming and ought to concern people \nthe most is that the amount of deficit this year--$422 billion--is not \nthe amount by which the debt will increase. I think there is a lot of \nconfusion.\n  I taught economics classes at the universities in my State during the \nbreak. I find there is a lot of confusion between the deficit and the \ndebt. The deficit, of course, is the annual difference between what we \nraise and what we spend. That is the annual difference. The debt is the \naccumulation of all the deficits over time. But it is also true that \nthe deficits printed in the newspapers badly understate how much the \ndebt is increased. The biggest reason for that is they leave Social \nSecurity in the calculation. Of course, Social Security is supposed to \nbe separate, it is supposed to be apart, and even by law Social \nSecurity is supposed to be separate. But that is not the way we have it \ntreated in the newspaper. They put everything into one pot. When you do \nthat, you hide the fact that they are going to borrow this year nearly \n$150 billion from Social Security. That gets added onto the debt, but \nit doesn't count as deficit.\n  It is kind of a bizarre way we do accounting here in Washington. \nThere is no other institution in the country that would be able to do \nwhat we do\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\nhere--take retirement funds of employees and use it to pay the \noperating expenses of the Federal Government--but that is what we are \ndoing under the President's plan. That is what we will do every year \nfor the next 10 years under the President's plan. In fact, we will not \njust borrow $149 billion from Social Security; over the next 10 years \nunder the President's plan, $2.4 trillion will be borrowed from Social \nSecurity with no plan to pay it back.\n  If you look at just this year, the official deficit now they are \nestimating at $422 billion, but what will be added to the debt will be \nwell over $630 billion. I hope someone is listening out there. The debt \nof the United States in 1 year is going to increase by over $630 \nbillion, $422 billion of deficits plus $149 billion borrowed from the \nSocial Security trust fund, every penny of which has to be paid back.\n  The President has no plan to do it.\n  On top of that, another $60 billion from other trust funds the \nPresident is borrowing. That is not the only place the President is \nborrowing. He has borrowed over $600 billion from Japan, over $150 \nbillion from China. He has even borrowed tens of billions of dollars \nfrom South Korea.\n  This is a course that is utterly unsustainable.\n  If we look to the future, the President is telling the American \npeople he has a plan to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. \nMy advice to the American people is, do not believe it, because it will \nnot happen. The only way the President comes up with that calculation \nis he leaves big chunks of spending out of the calculation. He leaves \nout the war cost beyond another $25 billion. We all know it will be \nmuch more than that. On top of that, he leaves out the necessity of \nfixing the alternate minimum tax which right now affects 3 million \npeople. By 2010, the Congressional Budget Office says it will affect 30 \nmillion people. Boy, are they in for a big surprise. They thought they \nwould get a tax cut, but they have coming at them a big tax increase. \nIt costs over $600 billion to fix it. The President does not have any \nmoney in his budget beyond next year to deal with it.\n  If we put back in all these things the President is leaving out, here \nis what we see is the long-term outlook for the deficit. We do not see \nit being cut in half because we put back the need to fix the \nalternative minimum tax, the war costs, the President's proposal for \nmore and more tax cuts. What we see by 2014 is the operating deficit of \nthis country will be approaching $800 billion. That is an utterly \nunsustainable course.\n  There was an item in this morning's Washington Post that I thought \nwas a bit of a warning shot across the bow. This was a report from the \nU.S. Navy that says they plan to buy fewer ships. In fact, many fewer \nships because of the budget pressure.\n  It is time to connect the dots. It is time to recognize these large \nbudget deficits that are mushrooming as we look ahead to future years \nunder the President's plan, because the President says spend more on \ndefense, spend more on homeland security, both of which, undoubtedly, \nare necessary, but he couples with that massive additional tax cuts \nwhen we already have record deficits. How is it possible for any of \nthis to add up? It does not add up, and it threatens fiscally our long-\nterm economic security.\n  The Navy is planning to buy fewer ships. That is only the Navy. We \nwill find the Air Force will be under pressure, the Army will be under \npressure. In fact, every element of Federal operations will be under \npressure because fundamentally we cannot be strong if we are \nfinancially weak.\n  This country now is running such massive deficits and adding such \nenormous sums to the debt--the biggest numbers we have ever seen in the \nhistory of the country--that it fundamentally threatens the long-term \neconomic security of this country.\n  I submit to my colleagues and the American people that the President \nhas us on the wrong course. It is time for everyone, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to get together, to come up with a plan to get us back on fiscal \ntrack, a fiscal track that will ultimately lead to balanced budgets. \nThere is no time to spare because the baby boom generation will start \nto retire in 2008. It is hard to believe, but those baby boomers who \nwere born after World War II are getting ready to retire. They will \ndramatically increase the number of people eligible for Social Security \nand Medicare. That is one reason Chairman Greenspan has urged us to cut \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Is that the course we want to go down? That is where the President's \nbudget plan is taking us. He has run up the biggest deficits in the \nhistory of the country and there is no end in sight. All of this at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire. What are the \nresults? What are the implications of this plan and policy?\n\n  In the warning of Chairman Greenspan we see the implication that the \nnatural conclusion, the natural result of the President's policies is \nto force cuts in Social Security and Medicare and much of the rest of \nthe Government as we know it. That is because the President's plan is \nso badly out of balance. The difference between revenue and expenditure \nis so big--and that is before the baby boomers retire; that is before \nthe number of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare double--\nthis is a course that cannot be sustained.\n  The quicker we deal with it, the better. Everyone knows when you have \na problem, the faster you deal with it, the easier it is to solve. The \nmore time you delay, the more time you wait, the bigger the problem \nbecomes.\n  I am here in the Senate to say the Congressional Budget Office has \nsent us a very clear signal. We have the biggest deficit this year we \nhave ever seen in the country's history. And we can see for the future, \nif the President's plan is followed, these deficits can only grow as \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  This President may have left town by that time. But the rest of us \nwho are here--maybe some of us will be gone, as well--but those who are \nhere are going to inherit an extraordinary problem. It is our \nobligation now to begin to address it. That is the right thing to do \nfor the country. It is the honorable thing to inform the country of how \nbig this challenge is, how deep this deficit chasm has become, and how \nthreatening it is for our future economic security.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the high honor and great \npersonal privilege of coming to the Chamber this afternoon to extend my \ncongratulations to everyone at ESPN. All of us who are ESPN sports fans \nand viewers and those at the network itself are celebrating 25 years of \nexcellence by this remarkable group of people in sports broadcasting.\n  As a sports fan and a Senator from Connecticut, I speak as one who is \nvery proud that this American dream has occurred in our State, located \nin Bristol, CT, and a tremendous citizen of the State which brought \nalmost 3,000 jobs to Connecticut. We are very proud in a very direct \nsense and very grateful to ESPN for all they contribute to Connecticut.\n  I must say, when I have been traveling, and at the end of a long day \nwhen I get to the hotel room and turn on the TV, there is nothing more \ncomforting than turning on ESPN and knowing that signal is coming to me \nright from Bristol, CT.\n  I say this is an American dream story because ESPN was the idea of \ntwo people, a father and son, the Rasmussens, who thought originally \nthat they would like to find a way to broadcast University of \nConnecticut sports events to people around the State on cable. \nConsulting some experts I believe at RCA, they found they could buy \nsatellite time to do that, and then one of the folks at RCA said to \nthem: Incidentally, it will cost you the\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\nsame amount of money to broadcast around America and the world via \nsatellite as it will in Connecticut. And that began 25 years ago ESPN, \nthe Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, which is today the \nworldwide leader in sports. It started small and ended big, going \nstrong, and all as a result of hard work and a lot of innovation.\n\n  I had the privilege of visiting ESPN's studios in Bristol, CT, last \nweek. It is really a campus now. I had the thrill of touring the ESPN \nnew digital center. This was about as good as it gets for someone who \ngrew up not dreaming of being a Senator but dreaming of being a Major \nLeague baseball player, a center fielder, for that matter--not a \npreference for political inclinations, not a left fielder or right \nfielder but a center fielder.\n  The closest I got to that dream is what I did that day sitting at the \nanchor desk on the brandnew, very impressive sports center studio set \nwith none other than the closest thing the sports world has to Walter \nCronkite, the honorable Chris Berman. It was a lot of fun and a great \ntreat. I also got the chance to look at the new studio we will soon be \nseeing on the NFL programming and then next year on the baseball \nprogramming. There is a lot of excitement there.\n  As we celebrate ESPN's 25th anniversary, I offer my congratulations \non a magnificent first 25 years to George Bodenheimer, ESPN's \npresident, and to the almost 3,000 employees of ESPN who have changed \nour lives as sports fans and changed so much for the better in the life \nof the greater Bristol community.\n  Chris Berman, in addition to my comparison--perhaps a little \noverstated--to Walter Cronkite, has been the great originator of \nnicknames. The most famous and the one I love best is when he called a \nparticular baseball player Bert ``Be Home'' Blyleven. I could go on.\n  I watched the ESPN retrospective on their first 25 years last night. \nI did notice in the show that one fan held up a sign that kind of got \neven with Chris Berman, and it said: ``Chris, beast of Berman.'' Let \nthat speak for itself.\n  In any case, probably the best tribute one could pay to this \nextraordinary network and the people who work at it is that as you look \nback at the 25 years, to paraphrase Berman himself, no one could have \nguessed that this network could go all the way. It has gone all the \nway, and it will just keep on going for the next 25 years, more \nsuccessful than the first 25 years, and beyond. So thanks and \ncongratulations to all the people at ESPN.\n  I think the most fitting one-word tribute I can use to close a \ncelebration on the Senate floor of ESPN's first great 25 years is to \nsay simply and enthusiastically: Booyah.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is still on the floor of the Senate, I commend him for his \nremarks. The real success, of course, is due to NASCAR. I hope the \nSenator appreciates that. In any event, I share his sentiments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8830-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8830-S8831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON PRESENT DANGER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to remark on something Senator \nLieberman and I had been hoping to launch and then discuss in a little \nmore detail, a subject on all of our minds, and that is the kind of \nchallenge we face as the leading country in the world in this current \nwar on terrorism.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Lieberman has joined with me and \nothers, or I with him--I think he was the first and I was the second, \nto put it that way, to correct the record--in a reinstitution of the \nCommittee on Present Danger. This is the third iteration of that \ncommittee, twice begun during the cold war--during the first stages of \nthe cold war and then the later stages of the cold war--to ensure that \nAmerica understood and was willing to face the threat of Communists and \ncommunism in a way that would result ultimately in victory.\n  There were times in the beginning of the war where I think there was \nan inadequate appreciation of the nature of that threat and how long a \nstruggle it would be and how we prepared and how Americans would have \nto persevere in order to win that cold war, and then at a midpoint in \nthe war when it seemed as if detente and acceptance of a permanent \nstatus of communism was really the only way the United States could \nensure we would have peace in the future began to creep into our policy \nin so many ways that, again, the committee was formed and, under new \nleadership, said there is an evil in the world--communism--and we \ncannot coexist in it. In the end, it will have to face its demise, and \nwe will have to win.\n  President Reagan embodied that spirit in calling the Soviet Union \n``the evil empire,'' in both saying and doing that which enabled people \nto appreciate there could be a winner and a loser against communism, \nthat it was a failed idea, and that we in the United States and the \nWest generally could defeat it, and we did.\n  Along comes the war against the Islamic radicals who have committed \nterrorism across the globe, most recently in Russia. But on 9/11, all \nof the previous attacks of those terrorists who were brought into focus \nhad been treated as a matter of law enforcement. On 9/11, President \nBush understood that something much greater was at stake, an \nexistential threat to the United States specifically and to our \ncivilization generally that had to be met with firm resolve because the \nenemy was not content to seek some kind of peace negotiations or \nextract some temporary commitments, but rather by its own declarations \nwas in a fight to the finish: Either they win or we win; either they \ndie or we die.\n  This existential threat would have to be faced by a nation that was \nwilling to engage in the fight as long as it took with whatever it \ntook, regardless of the costs, because nothing more or less than our \nsurvival was at stake.\n  So this third iteration of the Committee on Present Danger was \nformed. Senator Lieberman and I have been honored to be the honorary \nchairmen of this effort, to remind Americans and to educate the rest of \nthe world to the seriousness of this threat, to the fact that this is a \nwar, and in war everyone must make sacrifices.\n  We send brave young men and women to do military missions that could \ncost their lives. A couple of my colleagues were on the floor earlier \nlamenting the cost of this war and the casualties among those who have \nserved. Indeed, each one of us grieves for each one of those \ncasualties, and the families and friends of all involved.\n  But the President has reminded us that in this case our security is \nnot free and that sacrifices will have to be made.\n  The point of this committee is to remind everyone what is at stake, \nhow difficult the battle will be, how, although we Americans are \ngenerally very impatient people who see a problem, want to get on it, \nsolve it and move on, in this case, as with other wars, we have to be \nin it until the end, whatever the cost. In this case, like the cold war \nspecifically, it is probably going to be a long conflict that will test \nour patience and our resolve, but that in the end ironically it is \npatience and resolve demonstrated to the enemy that are most likely to \ncreate the condition for our victory.\n  In this case, being in some respects a battle of ideas and resolve, \nif the enemy views us to be a weak horse, as Osama bin Laden has called \nus, then they will be emboldened to continue the battle and to bring it \nto the United States. On the other hand, if they view us as a strong \nhorse, then they may appreciate the fact that in the end they cannot \nprevail. That will, more than anything else, permit us to win this war.\n  So with Senator Lieberman, I point out to my colleagues that in the \nensuing weeks we will be engaged in this discussion in an effort to lay \nout all of the facts about the enemy that we face and the kind of war \nthat we are going to have to be prepared to fight and the sacrifice \nthat is going to be required not just of the men and women whom we \nplace in harm's way for their military mission but the people involved \nin all of the other contexts of this battle, whether it be military, \nintelligence, law enforcement, and even right at home. There are many \nthings Americans can do to help win this war.\n  My last point is simply this: The best thing that Americans can do to \nwin\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nthis war is to demonstrate our resolve not only to the enemy but also \nto our friends and allies, and most importantly to the people in harm's \nway, our men and women in the military and others who we have put on \nthe front lines of the battle, to demonstrate to them that as a nation, \nwhile we may have some disagreements about the specifics of how we \nproceed with this conflict, we are united as a people in believing one \nmain thing, and that is that the battle is worth it. So that whatever \ncasualties do exist no one ever need be in doubt, be it the families, \nthe friends, the colleagues in arms, or the service men and women, that \ntheir sacrifice was worth the price, whatever that price is.\n\n  If we ever begin to create the idea that this is not a war worth \nwinning, that it is not a war worth sacrifice by Americans, then we \nwill have done a great disservice not only to our overall war effort, \nbecause the enemy will surely pick up those signals, but also to the \nfamilies and to the people in the military who are laying their lives \non the line. They must continue to know that all of us believe this is \na sacrifice worth making and that their sacrifice will not have been in \nvain.\n  I hope as time goes on, in debating the nuances of how we proceed \nwith this conflict, all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats and \neveryone else in this great Nation, will understand the importance of \nreaffirming to those we have put in harm's way that whatever sacrifice \nthey make, it is worth the sacrifice for the security of the people \nback home, for the opportunities they are creating for others and for \nthe defeat of this insidious foe. That is something we will be talking \nabout, especially as we move into the final phase of this legislative \nsession and fund our homeland security effort, reform our intelligence \ncommunity and our congressional oversight of that community, and do \nwhatever we can do right now to help win this war, that we ensure that \nall Americans understand how they can contribute to the victory. Right \nnow their biggest contribution can be to support the effort so the \npeople who we have sent in harm's way will appreciate that their \nsacrifices, whatever they may be, are not in vain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These hurricanes and disasters that \nhave been hitting our country, particularly in Florida, which has \nnaturally gotten the most attention, but also Tropical Storm Gaston \nthat had such a terrible impact in the Richmond area.\n  We will be voting shortly on H.R. 5005, which is an emergency \nsupplemental disaster relief appropriations measure.

There are a lot of small shops \nthere, small stores, restaurants. There are people who have lived there \nsince the renovation of Shockoe Bottom. There are a lot of \nmanufacturers up into the Shockoe valley that were also devastated. In \nChesterfield County, an overflowing creek came through and they \nactually had to demolish two big apartment areas and residences. Just \nin Chesterfield County alone, 47 people's lives were saved by the \nfirefighters and police. There were eight people who lost their lives \nfrom Tropical Storm Gaston in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  In addition to lives lost, which of course is the worst thing to \nhappen, people lost all of their possessions, photographs of loved \nones, their important documents and files. People lost all of their \nclothing from the mud slides that came in and the water that rose so \nquickly.\n\n  There was one fellow at the disaster relief center that opened up \nyesterday afternoon. He had pants that were covered with paint and a T-\nshirt covered with paint. Those were the only clothes he had. All the \nrest of his clothes had been ruined. He was a painter. That is why he \nhad so much paint on him. We saw others who were wondering where they \nwere going to live and where they could get assistance. We saw small \nbusinesses--there were 35 businesses, 25 restaurants, hundreds of \nresidences that were made uninhabitable.\n  One of the best things I saw of the evidence of how this flood came \nin, particularly in the Shockoe Bottom area, was a person who had a \nlaptop and on it was a videotape of the flood waters coming in. Within \n15 minutes, it had gone from nothing on the floor in the restaurant--\nthis was at Bottoms Up Pizza--and it went up to well over 5 feet just \nin 15 minutes. People did not have time to do much of anything other \nthan get up on different places to get out of the water.\n  The cleanup is going to be painstaking. A lot of work has been done. \nA lot of efforts have been made. It is a lot to clean out that mud, to \ndisinfect, to dry it out and get back in business. In some of the \nplaces all the elevators, of course, were wrecked. In one facility, \nthey had to take mud out of the basement by buckets and take it up \nsteps. They did a phenomenally good job doing it but that gives us the \nsense of what has to be done.\n  In another small restaurant they were taking all the screws apart of \na coffee roaster to make sure they could be dried off and oiled. Of \ncourse, all the furniture is wrecked. As far as the restaurants are \nconcerned, they also have to make sure all the walls are sanitary and \ncleaned out for health reasons.\n  We saw trucks and vehicles all wrecked. There is one Virginia \nGuardsman who is actually over in Kosovo, his truck was swamped and of \ncourse made useless as well.\n  The point is, FEMA needs money. They need a lot of money because of \nthese disasters. The President has acted. This country is going to \nprovide billions of dollars to make sure FEMA has the money. In \naddition, when you talk about small businesses, they get assistance \nfrom SBA for very low interest loans. Those low-interest loans can help \na lot of those businesses get back on their feet.\n  There is a lot of work, a lot of despair. Yesterday I was with \nMelanie Sabelhaus, who is the Deputy Administrator for the SBA. You see \npeople's eyes light up for the opportunities they will receive.\n  I know the time has expired. May I speak in that time for 3 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia speaking as long as the time for the vote does \nnot change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business has expired.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 3 \nminutes and have that time allocated to the Republican side for the \ndebate on judges so the vote continues at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, again, this is important in that this bill \nwe will be voting on after the judge votes, H.R. 5005, provides $2 \nbillion to replenish FEMA's disaster relief account. Included in there, \nwhich is very important, as Melanie Sabelhaus said, we are making \npromises of loans to folks, and we have run out of funds. So it is \nimportant we all work as quickly as possible to make sure these funds \nare there because there is an allocation in here of up to $30 million \nwhich may be transferred to the Small Business Administration's efforts \nto carry out disaster loans authorized by section 7(b) of the Small \nBusiness Act.\n  The point is, we have a lot of people hurting in this country, in \nFlorida, and obviously I am talking about Virginia. It is important we \nall come together quickly, efficiently, and as expeditiously as \npossible to assist these individuals who have a lot of pain, a lot of \nwork to do, but also a great deal of spirit. In the Shockoe Bottom, \nwhat encouraged me the most was folks cleaning and going through all \nthat work--which is very tedious work. The smells and the mold and all \nthat is almost overwhelming at times. But there is a great deal of \nhistory in the Shockoe Bottom of Richmond. It is one\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\nof the oldest neighborhoods in one of the oldest cities in the country. \nIt has a lot of history. This is going to be adding to the lore. I \nthink, as they clean up and get back in business, it will be stronger \nthan ever.\n  I am very pleased that all of us, the executive branch and \nlegislative branch, are making sure the funds are there to help those \nsmall business owners, men and women, get back on their feet, get their \ncustomers in those doors again, keep those people working.\n  I thank you all for this effort. I hope this will pass unanimously \nafter we dispose of the action on judges shortly.\n  I look forward to making sure we work together to get America--\nwhether in Florida or Virginia or elsewhere--moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8832-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SCHNEIDER, SR., TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nominations.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Virginia \nMaria Hernandez Covington, of Florida, to be United States District \nJudge for the Middle District of Florida, and Michael H. Schneider, \nSr., of Texas, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the last 5 minutes \nof debate be granted to the two Senators from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be counted against the time for \nthe majority; is that right?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is turning its attention \nto the confirmation of judges this evening. The record will note that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has worked hard to ensure President \nBush's judicial nominees have been given the appropriate scrutiny. I \nhave also made every effort to ensure fair treatment of the nominees. \nWhile there has been a bit of obstructionism in the advice and consent \nprocess, including unprecedented filibusters, we have made significant \nprogress.\n  During the 107th Congress, during which the Democrats held the \nmajority for most of the Congress, the Senate confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees. Thus far, in the 108th we have confirmed 98, \nand with the expected confirmation of these judges, we will match the \nrecord established by Senator Leahy. I recognize him for the good work \nhe has done on many of the nominees and thank him for his cooperation \nas ranking member. There is still some work to be done, and I am \nhopeful that additional nominees will be confirmed by this Senate. Our \nSenators certainly deserve that kind of consideration.\n  Today I rise in support of the nomination of Virginia Maria Hernandez \nCovington to the United States District Court for the Middle District \nof Florida. Judge Covington is the first Cuban-American woman ever \nappointed to Florida's appellate courts and is currently the highest-\nranking Hispanic woman serving in Florida's judiciary.\n  After graduating from Georgetown University Law Center, where she was \nthe editor of the Tax Lawyer law review, Judge Covington began her \ncareer in public service as a trial attorney for the Federal Trade \nCommission. She then moved to Florida to work as an assistant state \nattorney for Hillsborough County, FL. In 1983, she was appointed \nAssistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, and \neventually was promoted to Chief of that District's asset forfeiture \nsection. In 2001, Governor Jeb Bush appointed her to Florida's Second \nDistrict Court of Appeal, where she has served with great distinction.\n  While serving as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Judge Covington lectured \nextensively on asset forfeiture, money laundering, and complex \nprosecutions to prosecutors and law enforcement personnel throughout \nthe United States. She also lectured, taught and participated in \nseminars on trial advocacy practice and procedure with prosecutors, law \nenforcement personnel, and judges in Chile, Argentina, Mexico, \nVenezuela, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Honduras. As a U.S. Department of \nJustice liaison, she also helped the Bolivian government establish its \nnarcotics-related asset forfeiture program.\n  Judge Covington's professional and civic work has won her respect and \nrecognition throughout central Florida. Most recently, she was honored \nas the 2003 Hispanic Woman of the Year by Tampa Hispanic Heritage \nIncorporated.\n  Judge Covington was reported from our Committee without opposition, \nand I am confident that she will serve with distinction as a Federal \njudge. The ABA Committee agrees, unanimously rating her ``Well \nQualified'' for the Federal bench. There is absolutely no reason to \ndelay her confirmation to the Middle District of Florida, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting to confirm her.\n  I am also pleased to speak in support of Michael H. Schneider, Sr., \nwho has been nominated to the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Texas.\n  Judge Schneider has had a distinguished legal career. He began his \ncareer more than 30 years ago as an assistant district attorney in the \nHarris County District Attorney's Office, with a particular emphasis on \neconomic crimes. After 4 years there, he entered the private sector, \nworking for various industries--including the Union Pacific Railroad \nCompany where he served as its General Solicitor. In 1989, he joined \nthe law firm of McFall & Sartwelle, LLP, as a trial attorney. He \nlitigated cases involving products liability defense, commercial torts \nand commercial fraud cases. To date, he has tried approximately 150 \ncases to a verdict. That is more than most attorneys even dream of \ntrying.\n  In 1990, Judge Schneider became the presiding judge of the 157th \nDistrict Court in Harris County, TX. From 1996 until 2002, he served as \nthe chief justice of the Texas First Court of Appeals in Houston. In \n2002, Governor Rick Perry appointed him to the Supreme Court of Texas. \nJustice Schneider was subsequently elected to a term that expires in \n2008.\n  Judge Schneider brings a wealth of experience to the federal bench. \nAside from a law degree from the University of Houston, he also earned \nhis LLM from the University of Virginia School of Law. The ABA has \nrated him unanimously ``Well Qualified,'' and I am confident that he \nwill be an excellent addition to the federal bench in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas.\n  Following the two scheduled rollcall votes this evening, we will turn \nto the confirmation of Michael Watson, who has been nominated to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. I am \nhopeful that we can quickly conclude debate on this nomination and move \npromptly to a vote of approval for Judge Watson.\n  Judge Michael Watson began his legal career as a law clerk and \nbailiff to the Honorable Tommy L. Thompson of the Franklin County Court \nof Common Pleas in Ohio. He litigated a broad range of civil and \ncriminal cases before joining the Ohio Department of Commerce as its \nchief legal counsel, where he served until 1992. He then joined the \nstaff of the Office of the Governor as deputy chief legal counsel, and \nwas promoted to chief legal counsel in 1994.\n  On January 1, 1996, then-Governor George Voinovich appointed Judge\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\nWatson to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Judge Watson was \nsubsequently re-elected and, in 2003, Governor Bob Taft appointed him \nto Ohio's Tenth District Court of Appeals, where he currently serves.\n  Judge Watson brings a wealth of trial and appellate experience to the \nfederal bench. A substantial majority of the ABA Committee rated him \n``Qualified'' for this nomination to the federal bench, and I am \nconfident that he will make a fine jurist. I urge my colleagues to vote \nto confirm him to the Southern District of Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the last 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in executive session.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is reserved for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I will not \nuse all of that time because I know a score of Senators support the \nnomination of Judge Covington. All Democratic members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted in favor of her nomination.\n  The selection of Judge Covington is an example of what happens when \nthe judicial nominations process works as it should. She was \ninterviewed and recommended by a Florida bipartisan judicial selection \ncommission. Both Republicans and Democrats supported her. Her two home-\nState Senators strongly support her, and I do too.\n  Today Democrats and Republicans join together in considering the \nnomination of Virginia Maria Hernandez Covington to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Middle District of Florida. The Florida Senators support \nthe nomination of Judge Covington and all Democratic Members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of her nomination.\n  The selection of Judge Covington to be the nominee for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida serves as an example of how the judicial \nnominations process should work. She was interviewed and recommended by \nFlorida's bipartisan judicial selection commission. This selection \ncommission was created by Senators Graham and Nelson in a negotiated \nagreement with the White House and it has produced talented and well-\nrespected attorneys for the lifetime appointments on the district \ncourts in Florida. I congratulate the Senators from Florida for their \nefforts to maintain this important mechanism for promoting experienced \nand consensus candidates for the federal bench, despite the resistance \nof the White House to this time-tested procedure for finding qualified \nand consensus nominees.\n  Judge Covington currently serves as Judge for the Second District \nCourt of Appeals in Florida, one of five appellate districts in \nFlorida. She has served as an appellate judge since her appointment by \nGovernor Bush in September 2001. She previously worked as a federal \nprosecutor and spent nearly 20 years with the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the Middle District of Florida.\n  Judge Covington is highly regarded. I supported her nomination in the \nJudiciary Committee and I voted to report her nomination favorably from \nthe Judiciary Committee. This is a nomination that was reported \nunanimously. Although it is after Labor Day and well past the time when \nRepublicans traditionally shut down the judiciary confirmation process \nunder the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I expect that Democrats will continue our \ngood faith efforts.\n  With today's unanimous consent agreement for votes on Judge Covington \nand another judicial nominee from Texas, the Senate will have confirmed \n200 judicial nominees of President Bush. In 17 months of a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees, and \nnow with a total of 26 months of Republican control of the Senate, \nanother 100 of Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed.\n  Despite all of the complaining by the President and his partisans, \nthe fact of the matter is that with today's votes the Senate will have \napproved 200 of his judicial nominees. He has appointed more judges \nthan President Ronald Reagan did in his first term, more than his \nfather did in his presidency and more than President Clinton did in his \nmost recent term in office. Thanks to the bipartisanship demonstrated \nby Senate Democrats, we have reached the lowest number of vacancies in \nthe federal courts since the Reagan era. With today's confirmation \nvotes there will be only 26 open seats in the entire federal bench, and \nthere are more federal judges serving today than at any time in our \nhistory.\n  The Senate has withheld its consent from some of this President's \nmost extreme and unfair nominations but nowhere near the number of \nmoderate Clinton nominees that Republicans stalled in recent years.\n  Democrats have supported the swift confirmation of 20 of President \nBush's Latino nominees, including three Latinos to the circuit courts, \nJudge Carlos Bea, Judge Consuelo Callahan, and Judge Edward Prado. \nIndeed, it was Senate Democrats who pressed for votes on Judge Prado \nand Judge Callahan while Republicans delayed them. Republicans also \nblocked four of President Clinton's Hispanic judicial nominees from \never being considered and delayed others for hundreds of days. Judge \nRichard Paez was forced to wait more than 1,500 days--longer than any \nnominee in history--to get a vote on his nomination. President Clinton \nnamed 11 Latino nominees for the circuit courts and Republicans blocked \nthree of them, Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine Arguello, as \nwell as district court nominee Ricardo Morado.\n  Less than 10 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees are \nLatino, even though this is a diverse ethnic group which constitutes a \nlarger and growing percentage of the U.S. population. In fact, \nPresident Bush has nominated more people who have been involved with \nthe Federalist Society than Latinos, African Americans, and Asian \nAmericans combined. This disparity demonstrates that this President is \nless concerned about creating a federal judiciary of excellent, fair \njudges who reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our people and \nmore concerned about ideological purity and finding nominees who are \nlikely to side with the President on his political agenda. It is \nnotable that over the last year this President has failed to nominate a \nsingle Hispanic to the circuit court positions he prizes. By contrast \nat least six of the nine circuit court nominations this President has \nmade during the last year are affiliated with the Federalist Society. \nThis Administration has shown that it is committed to packing the \ncourts with individuals who will shape the bench according to narrow \nideological goals. Democrats have resisted this President's most \nextreme nominees to preserve federal courts that are fair, balanced and \nindependent.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about Texas Supreme \nCourt Justice Michael Schneider, who has been nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas. I first met him when \nI served as the State's Attorney in Chittenden County.\n  As I rushed back here for the votes, I ran into Justice Schneider, \nwho reminded me of the day we first met. I recall the day very well and \nwhen he was here for his hearing earlier this summer I told my staff \nabout his work as a fellow prosecuting attorney years ago. I remember \nthe time he and my dear friend Carol Vance, who was the district \nattorney in Harris County, came to Vermont in 1974. We had a meeting of \nthe National District Attorneys Association and the consumer fraud \nunits at Sugar Bush in Vermont. I recall talking with him about the \nproblem of fraud and other white-collar crimes.\n  I would also noted that the district attorney of Harris County was a \nclose friend of mine and spoke very highly about then Mr. Schneider's--\nJustice Schneider's--reputation as a conservative but fair-minded \njudge. His confirmation will fill the last remaining vacancy currently \nopen on the Federal district courts in Texas.\n  I wish the White House would recognize that so many of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including Texans, have been confirmed in \ncontrast to the treatment of judicial nominees by members of the \nPresident's party who blocked more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees including Texans whose nominations were subject to\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\nlengthy delays or defeated by delays by the Republicans. The \ndistinguished chairman will recall how the Republicans many times by \njust a one-person filibuster within committee delayed and defeated the \nnominations of Enrique Moreno, Judge Jorge Rangel, Ricardo Morado, and \nJudge Michael Schattman. None of these four nominees from Texas ever \ngot a vote in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor. I mention that \nbecause it was my intention not to treat President Bush's nominees \nunfairly, and today's vote on the nomination of Justice Schneider \ndemonstrates that we have been far more fair. That is why I have gone \nforward with Michael Schneider.\n  Today, September 7, the Senate considers the nomination of Michael \nSchneider to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. \nJustice Schneider has served on the Supreme Court of Texas for two \nyears. Including his 12 years of service as a trial and appellate judge \nand his part-time position at a municipal court, Justice Schneider has \nserved as a judge in one capacity or another for 25 years.\n  Justice Schneider served as Assistant District Attorney for Harris \nCounty, from 1971 to 1975. I also remember first meeting this nominee \nwhen I was serving as State's Attorney for Chittenden County and Mr. \nSchneider was a defense attorney working on cases involving fraud, \norganized crime and other white collar crimes. Throughout his career, \nJustice Schneider has demonstrated a commitment to serving those less \nfortunate, by developing a mock trial program at a school in an \nimpoverished neighborhood, participating in Habitat for Humanity \nprojects, establishing alternative dispute resolution programs, and \nworking with the State Bar of Texas to increase access to justice.\n  Justice Schneider has a reputation as a conservative, but fair-minded \njudge. In general, his opinions have focused on statutory \ninterpretation, proper trial procedures, and the rule of law. Justice \nSchneider's confirmation will mark the 16th district court nominee of \nPresident Bush's from the State of Texas who has received a hearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee and has been confirmed. This \nnomination will fill the last remaining vacancy on the Texas federal \ndistrict courts. Of course, we have not heard and likely will not hear \na single word of appreciation from the White House that all 16 men and \nwomen the President has nominated to the federal trial courts in Texas \nhave been confirmed by the Senate.\n  Our bipartisanship toward his nominees stands in marked contrast to \nthe fate of many of President Clinton's nominees from Texas, who were \nblocked and delayed by the Republican majority, including Enrique \nMoreno and Judge Jorge Rangel, Ricardo Morado; and Judge Michael \nSchatt- man. While Republicans blocked these Texas nominees along with \nmore than 60 other Clinton judicial nominees, Senate Democrats have by \ncontrast acted fairly and expeditiously toward President Bush's \njudicial nominees. The treatment of Judge Schneider's nomination stands \nin stark contrast to how Texans nominated by President Clinton were \ntreated.\n  After Judge Jorge Rangel, disappointed with his treatment at the \nhands of the Republican majority, asked President Clinton not to \nresubmit his nomination for endless delay, President Clinton nominated \nEnrique Moreno, a distinguished attorney in private practice in El \nPaso, Texas and a native of Mexico. Mr. Moreno is a graduate of Harvard \nUniversity and the Harvard Law School. He was given the highest rating \nof unanimous ``Well Qualified'' by the ABA. Mr. Moreno's nomination \nlanguished for 15 months, with President Clinton renominating him at \nthe beginning of 2001. President Bush missed one of many opportunities \nfor bipartisanship when he withdrew that nomination and, instead, sent \nthe Senate the divisive nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  In addition to defeating the district court nomination of Judge \nMichael Schattman by inaction, Republicans delayed confirmation of \nJudge Hilda Tagle for more than two a half years with no explanation \nfor their actions. When Ricardo Morado was nominated to the district \ncourt by President Clinton on May 11, 2000, Republican Senators \nindicated that this was just too late in an election year for him to be \nconfirmed. In contrast, Justice Schneider was nominated later in the \nyear than Richard Morado, on May 17, 2004. Senate Democrats are, again, \ndemonstrating their extraordinary good faith with respect to this \nnomination in light of recent Republican excesses.\n  This confirmation is taking place in September of a presidential \nelection year, which is long past the deadline for action under the \n``Thurmond Rule.'' In July 1980, Republican presidential candidate \nRonald Reagan asked Senate Republicans, then in the minority, to stop \nconfirming the judicial nominees of President Carter. Senator Strom \nThurmond, who was then the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, \nwas happy to oblige. Republicans were able to accomplish this blockade \nwith only a few exceptions that required Republican consent. Senate \nRepublicans have adhered to this rule with a Democratic President, \nwhether they were in the minority, as in 1980, or the majority, as in \n1996 and 2000. Although vacancies were much higher in those years than \ntoday, Republicans insisted on maintaining judicial vacancies to be \nfilled by the President elected in the coming fall election.\n  With today's unanimous consent agreement for votes on two district \ncourt nominees including Judge Schneider, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 200 judicial nominees of President Bush. In 17 months of a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 100 of his judicial \nnominees, and now with a total of 26 months of Republican control of \nthe Senate another 100 judicial nominees have been confirmed.\n  Despite all of the complaining by the President and his partisans, \nthe fact of the matter is that with today's votes the Senate will have \napproved 200 of his judicial nominees. He has appointed more judges in \nhis first term than President Ronald Reagan did in his first term, more \nthan his father did in his presidency and more than President Clinton \ndid in his most recent term in office. Thanks to the bipartisanship \ndemonstrated by Senate Democrats, we have reached the lowest number of \nvacancies in the federal courts since the Reagan era. With today's \nconfirmation votes, there will be only 26 open seats in the entire \nfederal bench, and there are more federal judges serving today than at \nany time in our history.\n  The Senate has withheld its consent from some of this President's \nmost extreme and unfair nominations but no where near the number of \nmoderate Clinton nominees that Republicans stalled in recent years.\n  I congratulate Justice Schneider and his family on his confirmation.\n  Finally, I note today is the 7th day of September and we are way \nbeyond what is called the ``Thurmond Rule.'' It was back in July of \n1980 when Ronald Reagan, who was not yet President but was running for \nthat office sought to stop any more judicial nominees of President \nCarter from being confirmed. The Republicans were actually in the \nminority in the Senate but candidate Reagan asked Senator Thurmond, who \nwas the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee which was led \nby Chairman Kennedy, to block any more nominees from being confirmed \nfor the remainder of the year. Senator Thurmond happily obliged and \nfrom July 1980 until the end of the year the only judicial nominees \nconfirmed were those who had the consent of the Majority Leader and the \nMinority Leader and the Chairman and Ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. All of President Carter's other judicial nominees \nwere blocked and defeated without votes.\n  The ``Thurmond Rule'' is that after July or the nominating \nconventions no more judges will be confirmed in a Presidential election \nyear unless there is consent. Today's vote on Justice Schneider \nactually will be one of the last votes, as we all know. But it is an \ninteresting thing. I note that every year where there has been a \nDemocratic President, Republicans have adhered to the Thurmond rule as \nthough it was handed down from on Mount Olympus. The Olympian heights \nof that standard, precedent and history somehow have changed when there \nwas a Republican in the White House. Now that there is a Republican in \nthe White House, we have heard little about this precedent from \nRepublicans even though it was sheer gospel to them\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nwhen there was a Democratic President.\n  Having said that, I fully support the confirmation of Judge Virginia \nMaria Hernandez Covington and that of Justice Michael Schneider.\n  I withhold the remainder of time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime run equally.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to reserve the right of the two \nSenators from Texas, if my friend will permit it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are trying to reserve time for the Senator from \nFlorida. I am sure between the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nVermont we can make the appropriate unanimous consent request. It is \nobvious the Senator from Texas should be heard, and obviously the \nSenator from Florida should be.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I agree with that. We can work it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe nomination of Justice Michael Schneider to serve on the District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas.\n  First, I say thank you to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, as well as the ranking member, Senator Leahy, for \nworking with us to try to fill this important vacancy in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas.\n  The vacancy that will be filled by this nomination was created by the \nuntimely passing of Chief Judge John H. Hannah, Jr. Judge Hannah was a \ngood man and a distinguished jurist. His family's loss was also a great \nloss to the State of Texas.\n  I have enjoyed working with Judge Hannah throughout his career. I \nrecall working with him on a variety of matters when he served as \nsecretary of state of Texas from 1991 to 1994. And Senator Hutchison \nand I worked closely with him just last year on legislation to \nauthorize the Eastern District of Texas to hold court in the city of \nPlano. That bill, S. 1720, was important to Judge Hannah, who always \nworked hard to serve the citizens of the Eastern District. He passed \naway the day after the President signed that legislation into law.\n  The death of Judge Hannah leaves some big shoes to fill, but \nPresident Bush could not have filled them better than with the \nnomination of Texas Supreme Court Judge Michael Haygood Schneider.\n  Justice Schneider will bring to the Federal district court the \nwisdom, judgment, and experience of over a quarter century of service \non the bench. He understands--as any good judge must--that the duty of \na judge is to interpret the law, not to legislate from the bench.\n  Justice Schneider has held virtually every position in the State \ncourt system that Texas has to offer. From 1978 to 1990, he served on \nthe West University Place Municipal Court. Then, he served on the 157th \nDistrict Court of Texas, located in Houston, until 1996. Next, he \nbecame Chief Justice of the First Court of Appeals in Houston. He \nserved there until 2002, when he was appointed Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of Texas, where I once served. He has been honored as both Trial \nJudge of the Year and Appellate Judge of the Year by the Texas \nAssociation of Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists.\n  In addition to this extraordinary record of judicial service, Justice \nSchneider also served the people of Texas in the role of Assistant \nDistrict Attorney for Harris County. Justice Schneider is a graduate of \nStephen F. Austin State University, the University of Houston College \nof Law, and--more recently--the LL.M. program of the University of \nVirginia Law School. And he has a distinguished record of civic \ninvolvement.\n  Justice Schneider's reputation as an exceptional jurist and a true \ngentleman is well known throughout the State of Texas. It is also well \nknown by the American Bar Association, which gave him its highest \nrating, when its standing committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously certified him as ``well qualified'' for the Federal bench. \nAnd his nomination enjoys broad bipartisan support across the State of \nTexas. For example, Susan Hays, who chairs the Dallas County Democratic \nParty, has written a strong letter of support.\n  Justice Schneider is also a humble man. His profile on the Texas \nSupreme Court's website points out that ``[h]e held a variety of jobs \nduring college and law school,'' including ``searching titles at a \nmajor oil company, managing apartments, driving ambulances, operating a \nschool bus for disabled children, working at a funeral home, teaching \nschool, delivering milk, clerking for a law firm, managing a college \ncafeteria, serving as a waiter, bell hopping at a hotel, and serving as \nan intern at the United States Attorney's Office.'' I'm tempted to ask \nhim which of these jobs best prepares him for life as a Federal \ndistrict judge.\n  I am pleased that the President has nominated Justice Schneider to \nserve on the Eastern District of Texas, and I look forward to his \nservice on the Federal bench in the great State of Texas.\n  Daniel Webster said that justice is the greatest desire of man on \nEarth. It is, I suppose, the reverence we have for the aspiration of \njustice that we honor men and women by allowing them to wear a black \nrobe and to judge us.\n  Justice Schneider, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has \nalready noted, has had a distinguished judicial career of having served \nat all levels of the Texas State judiciary. Beyond that, Justice \nSchneider has a reputation for being a gentleman, being an honorable \nperson and one who will do well in this important position.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this nomination. I say how delighted I \nam, given this late point in the year when many judicial nominations \nwould not ordinarily be brought up, that there has been bipartisan \nconsensus that this good man and this good judge be put up for an up-\nor-down vote.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the \nDallas County Democratic Party.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Dallas County Democratic Party,\n\n                                                     July 6, 2004.\n     Chairman Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n     Re Nomination of Michael H. Schneider, Sr. for the United \n         States District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas\n\n       To the Members of the Committee: I write to encourage you \n     to confirm the nomination of Justice Schneider. As the Dallas \n     County Democratic Chair, I supported Justice Linda Yanez, \n     Justice Schneider's opponent in his 2002 race for the Texas \n     Supreme Court. During that election season I learned a great \n     deal about Justice Schneider, namely how well-regarded and \n     well-respected he is by the bench and the bar in Texas. Even \n     the plaintiff's bar in Houston, Justice Schneider's home \n     base, supported his race out of respect for his dedication to \n     following the law.\n       During his tenure on the Texas Supreme Court I have \n     followed his performance closely. (I served as a law clerk on \n     the court during the 1997-1998 term, and specialize in civil \n     appellate work in my law practice.) While on the Court he has \n     been a voice of moderation and judicial conservatism. In the \n     many conversations I have had with Texas appellate lawyers--\n     of all political persuasions--the overwhelming consensus is \n     that Justice Schneider has done a wonderful job on the Court \n     and fully deserves to be elevated to the federal bench. \n     Justice Schneider is dedicated to the rule of law and the \n     integrity of the judicial system. The only reservation I have \n     about his nomination is that I hate to lose his influence on \n     the Texas Supreme Court. In addition to being a Democrat, I \n     am a member of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association and the \n     Dallas Trial Lawyers Association. Speaking both as a Democrat \n     and as a plaintiff's lawyer, I urge the Committee to confirm \n     Justice Schneider.\n       While much has been made in the press about partisan \n     gridlock over judicial nominations, as a partisan leader and \n     as a lawyer I know there are times the parties should come \n     together to support a nominee. This is such a time. I urge \n     the Committee to vote on Justice Schneider's nomination at \n     Wednesday's hearing. A quick vote is critical this late in an \n     election year. if you have any questions about my support of \n     his nomination, please call me at 214-557-4819.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Susan Hays,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased the distinguished \nSenator from Texas on the Judiciary Committee has spoken. I am happy to \nadd my remarks.\n  I particularly thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember. Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy have tried on this nomination \nand the ones we are voting on today to get these judicial nominations \nthrough. I very much appreciate it.\n  We know this is late in the year and sometimes we get hung up on \nthings. I have not agreed with everything that has happened in the \nJudiciary Committee, but on this nomination I appreciate everyone's \nword being kept. I had very much hoped we could have this nomination \nconfirmed. I hope there will be a few others, as well. We do have \nanother Texan coming up later this week.\n  I am happy to support my friend, a fellow Texan, Justice Michael \nSchneider. I have known Mike and his wife Mary for years. I know this \nman. I know his wife. I know their family. I know they will be \nexemplary public servants.\n  In February, I, along with Senator Cornyn, recommended him to \nPresident Bush for the eastern judicial district. He has exemplified \nwhat we want in Federal judges. For 25 years, he has sat on the bench \nfrom the bottom to the top. Here is a man who knows the judiciary. He \nwas in West University Place, which is a small town near Houston, TX, \non the municipal court. Then he was on the district bench in Houston, \nHarris County. Then he was the chief justice of the first Texas Court \nof Appeals, once again in Harris County, before he rose to the Supreme \nCourt of Texas where he has served since 2002.\n  He has also served as assistant district attorney of Harris County \nand he has served in the private sector. He earned his bachelor's \ndegree from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1965, in Nacogdoches, \nTX, and also earned a law degree from the University of Houston College \nof Law in 1971 and a master of law degree from the University of \nVirginia School of Law in 2001.\n  He has been honored judge of the year twice by the Texas Association \nof Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists and by the Houston Police \nOfficers Association.\n  We have a judge who is known to the community, all sides of the bar. \nHe is certainly respected by all. This is virtually unanimous. It is \nunanimous. The ABA rating was the highest that could be given. I \nbelieve we will have a unanimous vote today based on his great \nqualifications. I am happy to recommend him to my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to ask unanimous \nconsent that we request the yeas and nays on both Ms. Covington and Mr. \nSchneider and I would ask for the yeas and nays with one show of hands \nas a request for the yeas and nays on both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I commend the distinguished Senator from Florida. It was \nhis use of a bipartisan commission to make sure that we had this \nexemplary nominee.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVermont. I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their \nbipartisanship. I compliment the Senators for their bipartisanship.\n  We already had this agreement on the number of judges we were going \nto do, proffered some months ago. The fact that a judicial nominee of \nthe quality of Judge Covington from Tampa, FL, would come to the \ncommittee in a bipartisan fashion--members were very kind to move a \nnominee such as this. Indeed, this is the way the Senate ought to be \nworking. I am grateful the judge I was recommending was the beneficiary \nof that bipartisanship.\n  Indeed, Judge Virginia Hernandez Covington, a product of Tampa, a \nproduct of the University of Tampa, both bachelor's and master's \ndegree, and Georgetown Law, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for almost 20 years, with 70 commendations while \nthere, was then appointed to our State court system to the district \ncourt of appeals where she is now serving her 6-year term.\n  She has lectured extensively on a whole host of complex legal \nsubjects. When our office called her to give her the good news that her \nnomination, thanks to these two distinguished Senators, was scheduled \nfor a vote, she was down practicing her fluent Spanish in South America \nwhere she was teaching earlier this year.\n  This is the kind of bipartisanship and nominee we want. What do we \nwant? It is clear to me what I want in a judge. I want someone who has \njudicial temperament. I want someone who is going to be openminded and \nwho will look at the facts and will apply the law. Outstandingly, Judge \nCovington represents that particular example of what a judge should be.\n  She is going to have a tremendous success as a Federal judge. She is \ngoing to make an excellent addition to the high quality of judges we \nhave been very fortunate in Florida to have. I congratulate Judge \nCovington because her nomination will be confirmed within a few \nmoments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one last thing I mention to my colleague on \nthe other side. I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the two rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Virginia Maria Hernandez Covington, of Florida, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Middle District of Florida?

WATSON TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                     THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael H. \nWatson, of Ohio, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to speak about Judge \nMichael H. Watson, who is from my home State of Ohio. He is from \nColumbus. As my colleagues are aware, President Bush nominated Judge \nWatson to serve as a Federal judge in the Southern District of Ohio.\n  I would like to take a moment to tell my Senate colleagues why I \nbelieve so strongly in his nomination. Judge Watson is exactly the sort \nof person we ought to have serving on the Federal bench. He has had a \nlong and distinguished career as a public servant. He has been a judge \non the 10th District Court of Appeals in Franklin County since Governor \nBob Taft appointed him in May 2003.\n  From 1996 to 2003, Judge Watson served on the Franklin County Common \nPleas Court, a position he was appointed to by then-Governor George \nVoinovich and to which he was re-elected twice.\n  In Ohio, the Common Pleas Court is the highest trial bench. It is the \ncourt that tries all the major civil and criminal cases. During his \nlast 3 years on the trial court, Judge Watson served as administrative \njudge with responsibility of the administrative management of the 16-\nmember court and its staff. He dealt with, literally, thousands of \ncases during his time as a State trial court judge.\n  Before serving on the bench, Judge Watson worked for the office of \nthen-Governor George Voinovich--first as Deputy Chief Legal Counsel and \nthen, from 1994 to 1995, as Chief Legal Counsel. Prior to that, he was \nChief Legal Counsel to the Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce. \nJudge Watson also spent several years in private practice, focusing \nprimarily on personal injury litigation, employment disputes, workers' \ncompensation, and criminal defense.\n  Without question, Judge Watson has had an impressive legal career. \nBut what really impresses me about him is how hard he has worked \nthroughout his life. Judge Watson has genuinely lived the American \ndream by working hard and overcoming the odds.\n  Not long after high school, the Judge enlisted in the Air Force and \nserved for over 3 years. When he was discharged, he enrolled at the \nOhio State University and continued his service in the military in the \nAir National Guard. While in college, he married his high school \nsweetheart, Lori, and they had their first son when Judge Watson was a \njunior in college. During all this time, Judge Watson was working full-\ntime in the Franklin County prosecuting attorney's office. That's \nright, Mr. President; Judge Watson was enrolled at OSU full-time, \nraising a family, serving in the Air National Guard, and working full-\ntime.\n  When Judge Watson finished college, he enrolled in a law school night \nprogram at Capital University Law School. During the day, Judge Watson \nworked full-time as a court bailiff for a well-known Franklin County \njudge. That job evolved into a law clerk position, in which Judge \nWatson remained for his entire 4 years of law school.\n  If someone in my family or I ended up in a Federal court, I would \nwant a judge who could relate to me. I would want a judge who knows \nwhat the real world is like for most Americans. I would want a judge \nwho knows what it is like to struggle and what it is like to be faced \nwith the real world. Judge Watson is that kind of judge.\n  Of course, I would also want a judge who knows what he is doing and \nwho will enforce the law--and Judge Watson has clearly proven he is \nqualified for the job in that respect. But what Judge Watson has that \nmakes him really outstanding, in my view, is his ability to make \ndecisions with compassion and with a true understanding of what it is \nlike in the real world.\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\n  Judge Watson will be a fine addition to the District Court. In his \ntime on the Ohio Court of Common Pleas and on the Ohio Court of \nAppeals, Judge Watson has distinguished himself through his thoughtful \nlegal reasoning and his great integrity. This experience and his \ntemperament make Judge Watson highly qualified for the Federal District \nCourt.\n  Senator Voinovich and I have known Michael Watson for a number of \nyears. As I said, this is a man who is eminently qualified to serve on \nthe Federal bench. Mike Watson currently serves on the court of appeals \nin Ohio. For 7 years prior to that he served on our common pleas court \nbench, which in Ohio is our highest trial bench. Prior to that, among \nother jobs, he was the chief legal counsel for then-Governor George \nVoinovich.\n  Mike Watson is an Air Force veteran. He worked his way through night \nlaw school while serving at the same time as the court bailiff in \nFranklin County.\n  This is a man who is respected by his peers and respected by the men \nand women who practice law in front of him. If you talk to people who \npracticed law in front of Judge Watson during the 7 years he served on \nthe common pleas court bench, they will tell you this is a man of great \nintegrity. They will tell you this is a man of great common sense, a \nman who works very hard, and a man of great courtesy. This is a man who \nhas the right judicial temperament to serve on our Federal bench.\n  I am proud to be here this evening to recommend to my colleagues that \nwe confirm this nomination. I am very proud to be in the Senate to \nspeak in favor of the nomination of Michael Watson.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the \nnomination of Judge Michael Watson for a lifetime seat on the United \nStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Judge Watson \nenjoys the strong support of Senator DeWine and Senator Voinovich, for \nwhom he worked in the Ohio Governor's office.\n  I noted when this matter was considered by the Judiciary Committee \nthat proceedings on it had been rushed and highly irregular. Corners \nhad been cut at every stage, from the noticing of his hearing late on \nFriday of a holiday recess for a day when the majority was told no \nDemocratic Senators could attend, to the promise that the hearing would \nbe postponed if his rating was negative--it was and the hearing was \nnot. Then, of course, there was the premature listing of his nomination \non the agenda before Members had a fair opportunity to review his \nanswers to written questions.\n  A few minutes before a committee meeting a lengthy letter arrived \nfrom a Republican former colleague of Judge Watson attempting to \naddress some of the ethics concerns that had been raised, and then \nduring the meeting another letter was mentioned from the nominee \npromising not to use his judicial campaign donations to buy tickets to \npartisan political events, which he had previously said he might do.\n  It also seems clear from the incompleteness of the Senate \nquestionnaire submitted by this nominee in the late spring that his \nanswers to some of our standard questions were not vetted to determine \nif they were fully responsive. They were not and, in essence, we have \nbeen told that we have received all the information this nominee is \ngoing to give. At the same time we have heard that this nominee has \nbeen telling people in Ohio that he has been promised that his \nconfirmation is a done deal, and if that were true then what incentive \nwould he have to provide us with more complete information.\n  Surely, for example, the lack of information about some of the cases \nhandled by this nominee or the names of opposing counsels familiar with \nhis work made it difficult for the American Bar Association to speak \nwith anyone but loyal friends and colleagues. Nevertheless, the ABA--\nwhich has been exceedingly generous to President Bush's judicial \nnominees--gave Judge Watson a partial `not qualified' rating. This is \ncause for concern, because the ABA usually gives sitting judges \nnominated by George Bush a minimum rating of unanimously ``qualified,'' \nand often a rating of ``well qualified.''\n  When such a red flag is raised, it is our practice to seek input from \nthe legal community in the nominee's home State about whether there is \nany cause for concern, since the ABA does not tell us the basis of its \nvotes. Indeed, the credibility of the ABA's ratings has been called \ninto question regarding some of the inflated ratings given to some \nnominees, despite serious issues such as inexperience or lack of \ncompliance with attorney or judicial codes of conduct.\n  It does appear that Judge Watson has many fans but it is also true \nthat some, from both parties, have expressed serious concerns that he \nis simply too political to be rewarded with a lifetime seat on the \nFederal bench.\n  I have been concerned that he is not the type of consensus nominee \nwho should be moving so quickly or at all at this stage in a \npresidential election year. I would note that in 2000, 13 of President \nClinton's district court nominees nominated as late as Judge Watson or \nlater never got a hearing or a vote in committee, and the only district \ncourt nominees who received committee votes in July of that election \nyear were those who moved by consent. I can recall no nominee with a \npartial ``not qualified'' rating getting through in July 2000. In fact, \nI know that anyone President Clinton nominated after the first quarter \nof 2000 for which there was a single objection by any Senator never got \na vote.\n  Similarly, in 1996, the last time a President was running for \nreelection, more than half of the district court nominees sent to the \nSenate as late or later in the year as Judge Watson never got a vote in \ncommittee. When a Democrat was in the White House, only consensus \nnominees moved this late in the year as part of a package or agreement, \nand Judge Watson was nominated too late to be part of the package \nagreed to earlier this year for confirmation votes.\n  The Senate has already confirmed three district court nominees and \ntwo circuit court nominees of President Bush from Ohio, some of whom \nhave been extremely controversial and divisive. We moved forward with \nthose nominations even though two of President Clinton's nominees to \nOhio were blocked by Republican Senators, Steve Bell and Professor Kent \nMarkus.\n  Steve Bell, an expert in environmental law, waited more than 16 \nmonths and never was allowed a hearing or a vote on his nomination. No \none questioned Bell's legal qualifications, and unlike Judge Watson, he \ndid not receive a partial rating of not qualified, yet he never got a \nhearing or a vote. Mr. Bell is the son of U.S. District Court Judge Sam \nBell of Silver Lake, a Republican appointee to the Federal courts. Mr. \nBell was formerly the assistant law director in the City of Akron under \nRepublican Mayor Roy L. Ray from 1981 to 1984 and an assistant U.S. \nattorney, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, from 1984 to 1988. \nBecause he moved to northern Ohio to prevent any appearance of \nimpropriety from practicing before his father's colleagues, this was \nused as the basis for blocking him from getting a hearing on his \nnomination to a seat in southern Ohio, where he was born and raised and \nwhere he practiced law for much of his career. He never got a hearing \nor a vote by Republicans.\n  Similarly, Professor Kent Markus, who leads the Dave Thomas Adoption \nLaw Center at Capital University and previously served as an assistant \nto Lee Fisher and Janet Reno, never got a hearing or a vote. According \nto Professor Markus' testimony at a hearing about Democratic nominees \nwho never got a hearing, Senator DeWine told him in 2000 that there \nwere no objections to the merits of his nomination but that no Clinton \nnominees would be confirmed to the sixth circuit for ``political \nreasons.'' Yet here we are with a Bush judicial nominee in Ohio in \nSeptember of this election year, who some consider to be too political, \nbeing pushed forward to confirmation. This is such a double standard.\n\n  As I noted in committee, I have found some of Judge Watson's answers \nto questions unsettling. Why was information about Judge Watson \ncurrently running for office in a partisan race not made available from \nthe outset? While being up for election is not disqualifying, we are \njustifiably wary after another nominee of President Bush, Ron Clark of \nTexas, continued to run for election in a partisan race after\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\nhe was confirmed by the Senate. According to press accounts, even \nthough his seat was a so-called ``judicial emergency,'' Mr. Clark asked \nthe President not to sign his commission for office until he finished \nhis race and sat for another session in the Texas legislature so that \nhe could help elect a Republican speaker of the house and vote on \nthings like redistricting, and President Bush delayed signing Clark's \nappointment papers. After information surfaced about the White House's \nwillingness to delay the appointment of Mr. Clark, he stepped out of \nthe race but told voters that they could still vote for him, and he \nwon. This was shocking and inappropriate behavior by a man confirmed to \nsit as a Federal judge.\n  In Judge Watson's situation we have heard that he is actively seeking \ndonations for his State race while also telling donors that he expects \nto be confirmed shortly. In his written answers, he states that he has \n``informed [his] contributors that [he is] in the confirmation \nprocess.'' I was troubled by his initial response to my question about \nwhat he will do with the funds he has amassed if he is confirmed. He \nstated that he has not determined whether, if he is confirmed, he will \nreturn the money to donors, contribute it to charity or use the money \nto ``purchase individual tickets to other political events.'' This \noption is clearly prohibited by Canon 7 of the Code of Conduct for \nUnited States judges, which applies to nominees, and bans such partisan \nactivities as buying tickets to partisan events.\n  Judge Watson's friend subsequently wrote a letter to the Senate \nclaiming that the Code of Conduct for United States judges does not \napply to nominees, but anyone who reads Canon 1 of the Code would see \nthat it says, ``the Code is designed to provide guidance to judges and \nnominees for judicial office.'' That letter also asserts that nominees \nhave one year ``to come into full compliance with its terms,'' which is \nsimply incorrect. There is a narrow exemption related to divesting from \nprofit-sharing or deferred compensation arrangements that is wholly \ninapplicable to the mandate of Canon 7 prohibiting political activity. \nThe letter is similarly misguided when it asserts a wholly new \ninterpretation on the restriction against soliciting campaign funds, by \nclaiming that Federal judges or nominees could solicit such funds as \nlong as they did not do so ``personally'' and instead used agents to do \nso. This novel interpretation would create a gaping hole in the Federal \nprohibition against such partisan activity. Fortunately, the approach \nadvocated by the letter has not been embraced or adopted by the Federal \ncourts.\n  Admittedly, the ethical rules are rules of reason. In rare instances, \nlike Judge Watson's, an individual is not required to choose between \nthe possibility of a Federal judgeship and the possibility of a State \njudgeship. At the same time, given the vital importance of the ethical \nconstraints to the public confidence in the fairness of our courts, \nsuch a person must exercise extra caution to steer clear of conduct \nthat could call into question his or her impartiality under the Federal \nrules. If Judge Watson were following the advice and interpretations \noffered in the letter of his friend, he would be unlikely to comport \nhis conduct with the Code of Conduct for United States judges which \nexpressly applies to nominees such as him.\n  I do appreciate that, despite the justifications offered by his \nfriend, Judge Watson has informed Senator DeWine that if he is \nconfirmed he has decided to donate his campaign funds ``to a charity \ndedicated to the protection of the health and welfare of children,'' in \ncompliance with ``State election laws.'' I am happy that Senator DeWine \nhas been able to get the nominee to make these assurances and promise \nthat he and his campaign committee will disclose the names and amounts \nof his donors.\n  In addition to the assurances of Senator DeWine, who I hold in high \nesteem, we have also heard positive things about the nominee from \nprominent members of the legal community in Ohio since a vote on his \nnomination in committee was postponed. Some came from unexpected \nsources. I remain troubled but given the support of the Senators from \nOhio and lawyers from Ohio, I will not oppose this nomination.\n  I congratulate Judge Watson and his family on his confirmation. He is \nbeing given a position of great public trust, and I hope that he will \nlive up to the assurances he has given to the Senate and be fair and \nnon-partisan as a Federal judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question \nis, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Michael H. \nWatson, of Ohio, to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate, that the Senate may \nreceive from the House the supplemental appropriations bill, the text \nof which is at the desk; that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; the bill be read the third time, and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I applaud \nthe effort made by the majority leader and all Members of Congress to \nrespond as quickly and as comprehensively as we can to the \nextraordinary disaster we have now witnessed in Florida. Our hearts and \nprayers go to all of those people who have experienced this remarkable \nset of circumstances.\n  There are other areas of the country which have not had the same \ndegree of direct adverse weather but have suffered adversely the \neffects in many parts of the country with regard to drought, in \nparticular, in certain areas. The two Senators from North Dakota, \nSenators Dorgan and Conrad, in particular, have been very vocal about \nthe extraordinary impact it has had. South Dakota has also been very \nadversely affected. We have had terrible drought. We have not been able \nto address it satisfactorily. There are some people now who are \nactually having to sell their farms and ranches because they are unable \nto cope any longer with the drought circumstances.\n  I ask that we might modify the consent to provide for a single \namendment which would provide disaster assistance primarily to \nagricultural producers in Florida and throughout the country in an \neffort to address those needs, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and then I \nthink the Senator from Mississippi may want to comment, as we discussed \nearlier today, the $2 billion supplemental is coming from the House \nlater tonight, almost certainly later tonight or in the morning. The \npurpose of passing the bill as it comes from the House, which this will \nin effect do, will allow the President to sign it very quickly because, \nas we know, tomorrow FEMA is actually in deficiency and does not have \nthe money. The purpose is for us to get this bill passed through the \nHouse, the Senate, and signed by the President tomorrow. Such \nmodification would mean we would not be able to do that.\n\n  As we discussed earlier, there are going to be other opportunities. \nAs I mentioned directly to the Senator from Florida, we do not know \nwhat the total cost will be, even for Florida; and there very likely \nwill be another supplemental, at which time consideration of other \nSenators' interests could be expressed.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  I will turn to the Senator from Mississippi who will be managing the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, \nthe leader is absolutely correct when he suggests there may very well \nbe another supplemental request submitted. This request that is being \npresented to the Senate tonight is in response to a direct request from \nthe President for $2 billion to replenish a fund that has run out of \nmoney, or will be exhausted in the morning.\n  The House is acting tonight to approve the request of the President \nfor the additional $2 billion. The Senate should act tonight also, \nwithout getting into discussions of additional funding for other \ndisasters or other needs around the country, because this situation is \nan ongoing disaster in Florida. Without these funds being made \navailable tonight, in response to the President's request, they will \nnot be able to continue the debris removal, providing shelter and food \nfor those disaster victims who need those benefits. The disaster relief \nfund will be exhausted.\n  So my hope is we can consider additional requests, such as the one \nbeing suggested by the distinguished leader from South Dakota. We will \ncarefully consider any other requests, but tonight is not the time to \nget into the business of picking out which other amendments or \nadditions should be included in this dire emergency request we are \nbeing called upon to make to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will quickly respond. It is certainly \nnot my intention to object to this request. I think both Senators have \nspoken very accurately about the need to expeditiously consider this \nsupplemental funding request. I will say, however, that the ongoing \ndisasters--especially in the Dakotas but around the country--in areas \naffecting agriculture will have to be addressed. We cannot ignore it \nindefinitely. We can certainly understand the need for urgent action \ntonight on this particular request, but I do hope we can come back at a \nlater date, in the not-too-distant future, to address in a more \ncomprehensive way other disasters as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I object to the proposed modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I ask \nthe majority leader, what are the factors that decide whether a \nparticular disaster merits this kind of expedited action and which ones \ndo not? I certainly want to agree with what the Democratic leader just \nsaid because my State, which is adjacent to his, has suffered for the \nlast 4 years now from various disasters. After the first 2 years, we \nwere finally able to get the administration to relent and allow for one \nof those 2 years to be covered for farmers, many of whom lost their \nentire crop in our State.\n\n  Last year, we had another round of natural disasters, and there was \nno disaster relief provided or authorized by the Congress or agreed to \nby the administration. Now, this year, my State has just experienced a \nfrost that has cost $190 million in damages, and it is likely to mount.\n  Again, when the majority leader--I respect his candor--says that \nfurther requests or supplementals may be forthcoming, that is not much \nconsolation to my farmers and constituents; whereas, now in the State \nof Florida--and I share the Democratic leader's sympathies for that \nState because there are many Minnesota residents who are affected who \nhave part-time residencies in the State of Florida--but on behalf of \nthose who live all the time in Minnesota, they are not going to be as \nsympathetic when their needs continue to be ignored and right away \nFlorida gets this kind of expedited assistance.\n  I wonder, again, what are the criteria and are they going to apply to \nany State other than Florida?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will make a very brief response because I \ntalked about it a couple times on the floor today. FEMA is out of \nmoney--FEMA is out of money--beginning in about 12 hours. So without \ntrying to go through each request by each Senator, certain criteria can \nbe applied. FEMA will be out of money tomorrow. We are talking about \nFEMA generally. That is why this $2 billion is being expedited tonight \nat the request of the President of the United States. I understand \nthere can be many individual requests, but the criteria are the agency \nin charge of emergency management broadly will be out of money \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I do respect the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The farmers in my State are out of money. There are farmers in my \nState who were out of money last year who have been forced into \nbankruptcy. How do they make the necessary appeal to the President to \nget on his list? Is it required that the Governor of the State be the \nbrother of the President? How is this going to be handled? Because \nbased on the most recent hurricane, Frances--again, I am sympathetic to \nthose affected, which includes Minnesotans, but we are going to have \nanother request. Can we have an assurance there will be an opportunity \nat that time, as the Democratic leader is trying to obtain, so we can \noffer amendments to have the Senate consider other requests for \ndisaster aid? Is that something on which we could get a concurrence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will sort of restate what to the \nDemocratic leader we tried to say. There will be opportunities to \nconsider individual States. Right now we have an emergency for the \nagency which responds to all of our emergencies--FEMA.\n  We have a deadline. The President made this specific request last \nnight. There will be opportunities to talk about particular Senators' \ninterests in representing their constituents as to what are legitimate \nconcerns. But I do plead, for the sake of people around the country, \nincluding in Florida, as we speak, that we do not, in essence, defund \nour Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, when we have this \nopportunity to take a bill that is coming from the House, going to the \nSenate floor, requested by the President of the United States, so \npeople can have shelter and can have food and emergency services \nbecause the deficiency is that tomorrow they will be out of money.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just one more time propound the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object to say that \nI will not object in this case but with the understanding that the next \ntime, as the majority leader said, there will be opportunities. If \nthere is another supplemental request, I will insist on the opportunity \nto at least have these other requests considered. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the bill (H.R. 5005) is printed in today's Record under \n``Message from the House during Adjournment.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8840-S8841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4567\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I further ask consent that \nthe only first-degree amendments in order be related to the text of the \nbill, homeland security, natural disasters, or Government security \ncontracts, and that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments to\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nthe first degree to which they are offered. Finally, I ask consent that \nfollowing passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House of Representatives on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ncertainly will not object, but I wish to clarify the matter pertaining \nto going to conference. I have had a conversation with the majority \nleader, and he has given me his assurance that this would not be used \nas a vehicle for debt limit, and we do not intend for this legislation \nto be a larger omnibus bill. I know some colleagues perhaps on both \nsides of the aisle have expressed that concern. I think we can say with \nconfidence that is not the intent.\n  It is also my hope that this unanimous consent agreement would be the \nfirst installment perhaps of a series which would also include a finite \nlist, perhaps within the next 24 hours or so, that would give us a \nclear understanding of what these amendments may be. But we would ask \nfor cooperation on both sides of the aisle in that there will be plenty \nof opportunities and other circumstances to offer amendments that may \nexceed the bounds of this agreement. But I am real hopeful we can get \ngood bipartisan cooperation and complete the work on time.\n  But I would ask the majority leader if he could confirm the \nclarification with regard to intent when we go to conference.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is an extension of a conversation we \nhave had. Again, we have been talking over the course of the day as to \nhow we can, as quickly as possible, address the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill that the distinguished manager will be talking to \nshortly, sort of introducing what we will be talking about tomorrow.\n  Indeed, the Democratic leader is correct. This will not be a vehicle \neither for addressing the debt limit or for an omnibus appropriations \ntype bill. We will work together on this very important bill to \nefficiently, effectively, and deliberately consider amendments that are \nappropriate for homeland security and then bring this to closure after \nappropriate debate and amendment. His understanding is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Homeland Security appropriations \nlegislation is the bill that we will be going to first thing tomorrow. \nIt is a bill that is important. It is a bill that we need to address \nfor the safety and security of the American people. I am very hopeful \nwe can address both concerns and debate the amendments in an \nexpeditious way so we can complete the bill and get it to the President \nas soon as possible.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi is going to want to make some comments at some point \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD.

Also in the planning stage is the televising of the \n     New England Whaler road games.\n       ``We've had two exploratory meetings with the Whalers and \n     we have a full-blown proposal in the works,'' said Ed Eagan, \n     president of Cable Promotions. ``We could be televising more \n     Whaler games than have ever been on television before.''\n       Other sports events scheduled to be shown in the first \n     phase of the project, which will run from September 9 to \n     Memorial Day, are a sports magazine show, which will feature \n     such topics as hot air ballooning and hang gliding, a Gordie \n     Howe instructional hockey series, and a talk show with \n     Colleen Howe.\n       ESP will be offering these programs to the 20 cable \n     television companies throughout Connecticut. It will be up to \n     the individual companies whether or not they want to carry \n     the package and if they will charge extra for it to its \n     subscribers.\n       ``We've talked informally to three cable companies and so \n     far they are very receptive to our idea,'' said Bill \n     Rasmussen, the vice-president in charge of programing. \n     Rasmussen was formerly the Communications Director for the \n     Whalers.\n       Scott Rasmussen will serve as Production Director and WTIC \n     announcers Arnold Dean and Lou Palmer will handle the play-\n     by-play.\n       The series is scheduled to get underway September 9 with a \n     college football game. It is also probable that the company \n     will carry the scholastic basketball and hockey \n     championships, according to Eagan.\n       Although the company will be based in Plainville, it is not \n     affiliated with any cable company. It will attempt to sell \n     its sports programing to the individual companies.\n\n  Mr. DODD. That story was the harbinger of what has become one of the \ngreat stories of the media in the last 100 years or longer.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that ESPN has radically changed the \nway we see, hear, and follow sports, not only here in America, but \naround the world. The network has truly become, as its slogan \nproclaims, ``The Worldwide Leader in Sports.''\n  Over the past quarter-century, ESPN has transformed itself from a \nminuscule cable television network to one of the leading names in \nnational media, reaching over 94 million Americans each week. If ESPN \nwere an athlete, it would be the little-known draft pick from a small \nschool who made it all the way to the Hall of Fame.\n  It is hard to believe it today, but in those early years, ESPN found \nit difficult to fill up its schedule with sports. The June 27, 1978 \nissue of one of our local newspapers, the Journal-Inquirer, under the \nheadline ``Network Planning TV Sports,'' reported the modest goals of a \nnew station that would televise ``up to 20 hours a week of both \nprofessional and amateur local sports programming.''\n  Today, to say that ESPN has managed to fill its schedule is an \nunderstatement. Today, if one is asked the question, ``What's on \nESPN,'' the most appropriate response might be, ``Which ESPN do you \nmean?'' There is ESPN, the flagship network. There is ESPN2. There is \nESPNEWS, the 24-hour sports news station. There is ESPN Classic, where \nnostalgic sports fans can relive the exploits of Mickey Mantle, Jim \nBrown, Muhammad Ali, and countless others. There is ESPN Deportes, a \n24-hour Spanish-language sports network, not to mention ESPN \nInternational and ESPN Radio. And, of course, there is ESPN.com, which \nhas become one of the most popular sites on the internet, much to the \ndismay of office managers everywhere.\n  ESPN has truly lived the corporate version of the American dream. As \nits announcers might say, when it comes to sports broadcasting, you \ncan't stop ESPN; you can only hope to contain it.\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\n  Yet even as it has transformed itself into a media giant, for 25 \nyears now, ESPN has called only one place home--the city of Bristol, in \nmy home State of Connecticut.\n  Some might question why a network of ESPN's stature might prefer a \nquiet city of only 60,000 people to the glitz and glamour of New York \nCity or Hollywood. But, those of us who live in Connecticut aren't the \nleast bit surprised that ESPN's executives, workers, and broadcasters \nhave chosen not only to work in central Connecticut, but to buy homes \nand raise their families there as well.\n  We are also especially proud of our ``homegrown talent,'' those ESPN \nbroadcasters who first made a name for themselves at local stations in \nConnecticut. Most notably, of course, there is my friend Chris Berman, \na native of Greenwich. Back when I was a member of the House of \nRepresentatives, Chris was a weekend anchor with WVIT-TV, Channel 30, \nin Hartford. His head of hair was much fuller then, and mine was much \ndarker. In the two-and-a-half decades since, Chris has become one of \nESPN's most well-known and beloved on-air personalities.\n  Over the course of its 25 years, ESPN has set records, reached \nnumerous milestones, become a household name, and revolutionized sports \ncoverage as we know it.\n  Whenever a major event takes place in the world of sports, fans know \nthat ESPN will bring them the latest news, the first interviews, and \nthe deepest coverage. Thanks to ESPN, fans across the Nation watched \nlive when Cal Ripken passed Lou Gehrig, when Mark McGwire tied Roger \nMaris, and when the World Cup was played in the United States for the \nvery first time. ESPN has also made countless innovations in the world \nof sports broadcasting, introducing techniques like the ``helmet-cam,'' \nthe ``K Zone,'' the ``player mike,'' and ultra-slow-motion replay.\n  Of course, one can't discuss ESPN without mentioning their most well-\nknown news program, SportsCenter. Watched by as many as 88 million \npeople each month, SportsCenter is a phenomenon within a phenomenon, a \nprogram that has carved out its own niche in American culture.\n  By combining all-star coverage with a knack for wit, SportsCenter has \nbecome the model that all other sports programs emulate. Its announcers \nhave perfected a style that is, as one of them might put it, ``as cool \nas the other side of the pillow.'' Professional athletes admit that \nthey stay up late after game nights to watch their own highlights on \nthe 1 a.m. SportsCenter. Even in games of sandlot baseball or pickup \nbasketball, players have adopted the lingo of ESPN announcers, calling \nexceptional plays ``SportsCenter highlights'' or ``web gems.''\n  There is a great deal of uncertainty in our Nation today. We have an \nelection in less than two months. Our troops are on the ground in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere. We are fighting a global campaign against \nterrorism.\n  But even during these difficult times, sports have the power to \ncapture our attention. It is an inescapable fact that sports are woven \ninto the fabric of American life. The spirit of competition; the \nimportance of fair play; courage in the face of adversity--these are \nall American values that we can and do celebrate with our enthusiasm \nfor sports.\n  Sports have the power to inspire us all to strive for greater and \nloftier heights. Who can forget Willis Reed limping onto the floor at \nMadison Square Garden in 1970, or the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team's \n``Miracle on Ice,'' or the American women's team winning the 1999 World \nCup?\n  True, sports can inspire fierce rivalries. We in Connecticut, who \nlive on the front lines of the Yankee-Red Sox divide, know that better \nthan anyone. But more significantly, sports can unite us. At no time \nwas that clearer than in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, \nwhen the sight of baseball and football players taking the field helped \nrestore a sense of normalcy, and in a small way, helped our Nation \nbegin to heal.\n  For the past 25 years, ESPN has helped bring the exciting, emotional, \nand magical world of sports into the living rooms of millions and \nmillions of Americans. And in doing so, they have become a part of \nAmerican history.\n  I wish everyone at ESPN a very happy 25th anniversary, and I wish \nthem nothing but success in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8842-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  MADD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and thank \nthe members, volunteers, and sponsors of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, \nor MADD. MADD and its mission ``to stop drunk driving, support victims \nof this violent crime and prevent underage drinking'' has become the \nlargest crime victims' assistance organization in the world, with more \nthan 3 million members and supporters.\n  This month marks the 20th anniversary of South Dakota's Pennington \nCounty chapter of MADD. MADD Pennington County shares this anniversary \nwith the enactment of the National Uniform 21 Minimum Drinking Age Act, \none of the organization's greatest victories. Since the law was passed \nin 1984, over 20,000 young lives have been saved from highway crashes. \nMuch of that success is thanks to MADD's efforts to change public \nattitudes and raise social awareness of the dangers of impaired \ndriving.\n  We still have much to do. Since 2000, about half of all the traffic \nrelated deaths in South Dakota were alcohol related. In the face of \nthis challenge, the MADD chapter of Pennington County has been active \nin outreach, coordinating with the police department to educate the \nowners and staffs of restaurants and bars, as well as high school and \ncollege students.\n  Two women in particular have made a difference, and they deserve \nspecial recognition. Lila Doud, who is the current Chapter President, \nand Janice Morehouse, the Secretary/Treasurer, have been working with \nthe MADD Pennington County chapter since its inception 20 years ago. \nAll the volunteers and sponsors of MADD Pennington County have much to \nbe proud of and I am grateful for their commitment to public safety, \nvictim services, and education. All of South Dakota owes them a great \ndebt and we thank them for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8842-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8842-S8843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE RIGHT COURSE FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I always find it of interest when a \nprominent member of corporate America steps forward to offer a \nrefreshing perspective on the economic challenges our country faces \ntoday.\n  To that end, I would like to call the Senate's attention to two \npieces of commentary written by Leo Hindery, Jr. and published over the \nsummer recess.\n  Mr. Hindery, as many of my colleagues are aware, has served as the \nCEO of TCI and AT Broadband, and more recently as the chairman of the \nYES Network. He has a keen understanding that corporations have \nobligations both to their shareholders, but also to the communities in \nwhich they operate, and the American economy they fuel.\n  Mr. Hindery's first piece is on the subject of outsourcing, and he \nargues that offshoring of jobs is not inevitable, nor is it often the \nbest long-term strategy for American companies.\n  His second talks about the need to see through the sky-is-falling \nclaims of some interest groups and weigh both policy and electoral \ndecisions on a simple standard--what is the best thing to do, not just \nfor a few who are well-off and well-connected, but for the economy as a \nwhole?\n  Again, I think these pieces of insight and analysis would be of \ninterest to those of us who are entrusted to make decisions about the \npolicies America adopts, and I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\n             [From the San Jose Mercury News, Aug. 5, 2004]\n\n          When Outsourcing Takes Your Job, Then It Will Matter\n\n                         (By Leo Hindery, Jr.)\n\n       A recession is when someone else loses his or her job; a \n     depression is when you lose your job. I was reminded of this \n     adage when a recent report by three Bay Area groups said we \n     shouldn't worry about outsourcing of good jobs to other \n     countries. Those losing their jobs would beg to differ.\n       Throwing in the towel, one of the report's sponsors asid, \n     ``Offshoring is here to stay.'' That's particularly troubling \n     when a UC-Berkeley analysis found that one-in-six jobs are at \n     risk of being exported from Silicon Valley.\n       But voters aren't buying the lines coming from think tanks \n     and Washington. First, they were told that he few jobs lost \n     would be quickly replaced. They weren't. Then President \n     Bush's economic adviser said outsourcing jobs was actually \n     good in the long run. Displaced workers know better. And now, \n     it seems, the new line is that nothing should be done. Voters \n     don't buy inaction, either.\n       Offshoring of jobs is not inevitable. There's much \n     government can do, and it should act before more good jobs \n     disappear and the middle class shrinks even more.\n       First, we must ensure that free trade is also fair trade. \n     How can we keep manufacturing jobs in America when foreign \n     competitors often employ children, pay pennies, provide \n     little or no benefits and ignore environmental standards? \n     Likewise, how can we keep high-quality customer and \n     technical-service jobs here when employees in Bangalore, \n     India, earn $200 to $300 a month for jobs that pay Americans \n     $2,000-$3,000?\n       America has a responsibility to the rest of the world, \n     especially developing countries, to foster responsible free \n     trade. But we can no longer condone--or support--practices \n     that pay subsistence wages, violate child labor standards and \n     degrade the environment.\n       Second, we must responsibly use our nation's corporate tax \n     laws to provide incentives for American businesses to keep \n     high-quality jobs here. Today, corporations take advantage of \n     tax benefits by shipping operations overseas, shielding \n     profits earned there. Sen. John Kerry has rightly proposed \n     eliminating that loophole, which is a glaring incentive to \n     move operations overseas and keep them abroad by reinvesting \n     profits there.\n       We should also adopt a levy on corporations that use \n     loopholes to escape taxation. That would help redress the \n     imbalance between job retention and untaxed overseas profits, \n     and aid workers who lose jobs in part because of skewed tax \n     policies.\n       Part of the bargain that was supposed to accompany ``free \n     trade'' was help for workers who lose their livelihood \n     through no fault of their own. Workers need retraining for \n     new careers when industries disappear. They need unemployment \n     benefits and medical benefits.\n       Action on outsourcing would be far less urgent if enough \n     jobs were being created here at home. But today's lukewarm \n     economic recovery provides no place for laid-off workers to \n     go.\n       None of this is ``protectionism,'' except that it will \n     protect foreign workers and nations from exploitation, the \n     U.S. tax code from encouraging companies to offshore jobs, \n     and American workers from the unchecked whims of \n     globalization.\n       Corporate leaders need to work smarter. Having served as a \n     CEO, I know the pressures to outsource can be intense. But \n     business executives must look beyond the short-term, cost-\n     cutting gains that outsourcing sometimes provides and focus \n     instead on the long-term costs and devastation to employees \n     and our national economy.\n       And political candidates will have to show they understand \n     the voters' call for action. Because this election should be \n     about getting the economy moving and about who will best \n     protect the middle class and those striving to join it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Aug. 10, 2004]\n\n                  Bush's Economy Is for the Elite Few\n\n                            (By Leo Hindery)\n\n       Within an hour of John Kerry's selection of John Edwards as \n     his running mate, the US Chamber of Commerce said it was \n     forced to abandon its position of ``neutrality'' because Mr \n     Edwards was ``hostile to business'' I could almost hear the \n     laughter in corporate boardrooms across the country. To argue \n     that the Chamber intended to be, or has ever been, \n     politically ``neutral'' reminds me of the film Casablanca \n     when Claude Rains expresses shock that gambling was taking \n     place in Rick's Cafe.\n       The line revealed the dirty little secret of the US Chamber \n     of Commerce. It is run by the wealthy chief executives of the \n     nation's biggest companies.\n       It is easy to see why enormously rich businessmen believe \n     more personal income and lower taxes are good for them. But \n     what is good for an individual chief executive's wallet does \n     not translate into being ``good for business'' or for the \n     nation's economy.\n       What businesses and the economy need are full employment, \n     or as full as possible, and strong consumer demand, generated \n     by a combination of consumer confidence and fair \n     compensation. The Bush-Cheney ticket is failing that test. \n     They adopt ``anything-goes-for-big-business'' policies, \n     continue to push for ever-lower tax rates for the wealthiest \n     Americans, defend self-serving executive compensation \n     packages and condone benign regulation of corrupt practices.\n       The latest sign of how what is really good for ordinary \n     citizens and the economy is being flipped on its head is \n     George W. Bush's spin on sluggish job-growth numbers. Now, he \n     contends, that bad is good. In response to the far lower than \n     expected employment numbers for June, he said: ``Steady \n     growth. That's important. We don't need boom-or-bust-type \n     growth.''\n       But when the number of new jobs created this year fails to \n     keep up with the growth in the adult population--a trend \n     confirmed by last Friday's job numbers for July--a little \n     more boom and a little less steady stagnation would certainly \n     be helpful.\n       Certainly the unemployed and businesses that need to sell \n     products and services to people with incomes are getting \n     weary of the disappointing growth. For the first time in more \n     than seven decades, there are fewer jobs at this point in an \n     election year than there were when the current president \n     was inaugurated. A net 2.6m manufacturing jobs have been \n     lost since 2001.\n       And anyone whose job has been outsourced to other countries \n     should appreciate Mr. Kerry's call to end tax loopholes and \n     benefits that provide an incentive for shipping jobs overseas \n     and keeping the profits there.\n       Compounding the problem, far too many of the jobs being \n     created are low-wage positions with few benefits. Overall, \n     wages for non-supervisory workers have failed to keep up with \n     inflation over the past year.\n       But jobs and wages are not all that matters. Instead of Mr. \n     Bush's big tax cuts for the top 2 percent of Americans, the \n     Kerry-Edwards ticket would reform healthcare. That would make \n     health insurance more available and affordable for millions \n     of Americans and cheaper for businesses. The other 98 percent \n     of Americans and the businesses whose healthcare costs would \n     be lower should welcome the choice between better healthcare \n     and tax cuts for the wealthy.\n       The business community has also traditionally, and rightly, \n     been concerned about massive government borrowing. But under \n     the Bush administration, we have seen huge budget surpluses \n     turned quickly into crushing deficits. That, too, takes a \n     toll on consumer and business confidence.\n       Make no mistake about it. There is a big distinction \n     between the US Chamber and local Chambers. The local Chambers \n     honestly focus on what is good for their communities. They \n     understand that jobs and wages are essential for their \n     business members to have customers and for their cities and \n     regions to thrive.\n       Yes, the US Chamber would like to distract attention from \n     the economy and scare Americans about the Democratic ticket. \n     But in this election year, voters must make a distinction \n     between policies that will create jobs and value for \n     shareholders and organizations that speak and act at the whim \n     of entrenched management and the economic elite.\n       Today, the Bush administration and the US Chamber are \n     trying to twist even the questionable adage of Calvin \n     Coolidge that ``the business of America is business'' into \n     something far worse, namely that ``the business of America is \n     about super-rich CEOs and executives''. Instead, we need a \n     team who will, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt did, ``save \n     capitalism from the capitalists''.\n       Americans have a fundamental choice to make in November, \n     and the economy will be an important issue. The US Chamber \n     hopes voters will--ignoring the facts, history and the \n     candidates' records--assume that Republicans are better for \n     the economy than Democrats. But the voters should avoid this \n     knee-jerk reaction, and make the distinction between what is \n     good for the elite few and what is good for the economy as a \n     whole. Then it will be clear who will really do the best job \n     of looking out for them and who will get our economy moving \n     again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8843-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8843-S8844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHIEF OLIVER RED CLOUD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on August 7, I had the privilege of \nhonoring Chief Oliver Red Cloud at an important gathering in South \nDakota, the Oglala Lakota Nations Pow-wow. Chief Red Cloud has led an \namazing exemplary life from which all of us could learn. I want to \nshare with my colleagues my thoughts on this outstanding leader and ask \nunanimous consent that my August 7 remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He is a well known and respected traditional leader. \n     He is Chief Oliver Red Cloud.\n       As a fourth generation descendent of Makhpiya-Luta, Chief \n     Red Cloud carries on a\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n     honorable tradition. Like his great-grandfather, he has a \n     proud history of maintaining the traditional ways of his \n     peoples, and fights tirelessly to improve living standards on \n     the reservation. In 1870, Chief Red Cloud's great-grandfather \n     spoke in New York City, saying, ``We do not want riches, we \n     do not ask for riches, but we want our children properly \n     trained and brought up.'' Chief Red Cloud continues to carry \n     out that call, preserving the Lakota way of life, so that \n     young children will have the opportunity to embrace their \n     language and culture.\n       As many of you know, he gives unselfishly of himself to \n     help those in need. He is generous with his knowledge--\n     offering guidance to those who seek it. I know this, because \n     even as I visited him in the hospital to offer him my \n     support, he was offering me his wisdom.\n       Chief Red Cloud offers guidance to those who seek it, and I \n     am thankful to be a recipient of his wisdom. Because of his \n     wisdom and his passion, Chief Red Cloud has been able to \n     bridge differences, find creative solutions to problems \n     facing the Great Sioux Nation, and make sure the voices of \n     his people are heard. In so doing, he has earned the respect \n     of Indian nations and strengthened this Nation's independence \n     and sovereignty.\n       As Makhpiya-Luta once said, ``All I want is right and \n     just.''\n       We have challenging times ahead of us, breaking down \n     barriers that have existed for far too long; but by working \n     together we can build a society where each individual and \n     community becomes whole.\n       That, too, is what is right and just.\n       Please join me in honoring Chief Red Cloud for his \n     leadership, counsel and guidance.

Parker, Jr., 21, of Heber Springs was one of four marines \nkilled June 21 in Ramadi, Iraq. He was serving with a sniper platoon of \nthe First Marine Division out of Camp Pendleton, CA.\n  Tommy was a 2001 graduate of Triple S Christian Academy. The Rev. \nJohn Bishop, who taught Tommy, praised his devotion to his faith, \nsaying that even when surrounded by tough marines he was not too shy to \ngive witness to his beliefs. As Tommy prepared to leave for Iraq, \nBishop said Parker's wife told him, he remarked that the experience was \nbringing him closer to God.\n  Tommy is survived by his wife, Carla Parker; his daughter, Lara; and \nhis parents, Tommy and Renatta.\n  Tommy's sacrifice is a shining example of the commitment that is \nnecessary to keep this Nation free. When his Nation called, he \nanswered. Our prayers and gratitude go out to his family for the great \nservice that Tommy rendered to our Nation.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Dustin W. Peters\n\n  Mr. President, today I also wish to pay tribute to a brave Arkansan \nwho gave his life for the cause of freedom. Air Force SSgt Dustin W. \nPeters was killed July 11 when his convoy was hit by homemade bombs \nabout 150 miles north of Baghdad.\n  Dustin was born August 22, 1978, in Texarkana, TX. He attended high \nschool in El Dorado, KS, and in Shirley, AR, before going into the Air \nForce in 1997. Dustin received the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart \nposthumously. The Bronze Star Medal is given to individuals who \ndistinguish themselves by heroism, outstanding achievement or \nmeritorious service while serving in a combat theater, according to \nbase officials. Dustin received his for heroism.\n  Dustin is survived by his son, Dalton, of El Dorado, KS; his mother, \nLinda Benning, of Shirley, AR; and his father, Dennis, of Enid, OK.\n  His fellow airmen said of Dustin that ``you could count on . . . his \nservice to our country and others always came ahead of his own needs \nand desires. His loss has touched us deeply, and we will miss him.'' \nNot only will his fellow airmen miss him but a grateful Nation will \nmiss him. His sacrifice will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                        Private Van Ryan Marcum\n\n  Mr. President, today I also wish to pay tribute to a brave young \nArkansan who lost his life training to become a member of the United \nStates Army. PVT Van Ryan Marcum, 21, a native of Prescott, AR, was \nelectrocuted June 19 during an infantry basic training exercise when he \ntouched a metal structure electrically charged by a faulty light \nfixture.\n  Van Ryan Marcum was memorialized at Fort Benning, GA. Joining the 220 \nsoldiers from Charlie Company, with whom Marcum served, were his \nmother, grandmother, uncle and other family members invited to witness \nthe tribute to the young man so interested in becoming an Army Ranger. \nAs the ceremony unfolded, some soldiers grieved silently with bowed \nheads; others could not suppress quiet sniffles as the music played and \nthe tributes were delivered.\n  CPT Kevin Salge, commander of Charlie Company, was quoted as saying \nthat it was an honor to count among his unit's soldiers a trooper such \nas Marcum, who had a bright future in the military. ``As soon as he \ncompleted a task he was ready for another. He carried his weight and \nmore,'' Salge said. ``He would have been a great addition to the \nArmy.''\n  Van's desire to defend his Nation is a tribute to his courage and \ndedication. We honor the sacrifice he made in the service of his \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8844-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8844-S8846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPECIALIST DONALD R. McCUNE II\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who grew up \nin South Bend, IN. SP Donald R. McCune II, 20 years old, died on August \n5 in a hospital in Landstuhl, Germany from injuries sustained after an \nexplosive device detonated near his patrol vehicle in Balad, Iraq. With \nhis entire life before him, Donald chose to risk everything to fight \nfor the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway \naround the world.\n  Donald spent his early childhood through part of high school in South \nBend before moving to Michigan. He joined the Army National Guard \nshortly thereafter, following a long family tradition of military \nservice. According to family and friends, enlisting was something he \nfelt he needed to do. Donald was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 161st \nInfantry Regiment, Army National Guard, Moses Lake, WA. Previously, he \nserved with an Army Reserve unit based in Fraser for almost 2 years. \nThis past spring, Donald was deployed to Iraq, where he bravely fought \nfor 3 months before sacrificing his life for the worthy cause of \nfreedom. Rick Monier, Donald's grandfather told the Detroit Free Press, \n``It was sad he had to pass away--he or any other soldier--but it was \nfor freedom, and he believed in the cause.''\n  Donald was the thirty-first Hoosier soldier to be killed while \nserving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his mother, Darcy Lewis; his stepfather Benjamin \nLewis; his father, Donald McCune; his sister, Casandra Karczewski; his \nbrother, Josh McCune; his grandmother, Gladys Gilbert; his grandfather, \nRick Monier; his step-grandmother, Dianne Ronier; and his maternal \ngreat-grandmother, Beth Gilbert.\n  Today, I join Donald's family, his friends and all Americans in \nmourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this \ntremendous loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nDonald, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Donald was known for his dedicated spirit and his love of country. \nWhen looking back on the life of her late son and his plans for the \nfuture, Darcy told the Detroit Free Press, ``He knew the risks of \nfighting and had even talked about returning to Iraq after his stint \nwas over and doing security work.'' Today and always, Donald will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Donald's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\ncertain that the impact of Donald's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Donald R. McCune II in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Donald's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Donald.\n\n\n                   Private First Class Luis A. Perez\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who grew up in East \nChicago, IN. PFC Luis A. Perez, 19 years old, died on August 16 when \nthe fuel truck he was driving struck a land mine in Iraq. With his \nentire life before him, Luis chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n  Luis spent his early childhood in East Chicago where he attended \nMcKinley Elementary School before moving to Hammond and attending \nMorton High School. He joined the Army Reserves shortly after \ngraduating from high school, following in his father's footsteps of \nmilitary service. Luis was assigned to the 223rd Transportation \nCompany, United States Reserve, Norristown, PA. This summer, Luis was \ndeployed to Kuwait and from there was sent to Iraq, where he bravely \nfought before sacrificing his life for the worthy cause of freedom.\n  Luis was the thirty-third Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his wife, Theresa; his mother, Maria Miranda; his father, Jose; \nhis grandmother, Clara Madrigal; and two sisters.\n  Today, I join Luis' family, his friends and all Americans in mourning \nhis death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this tremendous \nloss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to \nmake the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of \ncharacter that people will remember when they think of Luis, a memory \nthat will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and \ngrief.\n  Luis was known for his dedicated spirit and his love of country. \nAccording to family and friends, enlisting was something Luis had \nwanted to do since he was very young. His grandmother, Clara Madrigal \ntold the Times of Northwest Indiana that she remembers Luis as a boy \nsaying that he wanted to grow up and be a ``green man.'' When Clara \ninquired as to what a ``green man'' was, her grandson responded, ``A \nsoldier, like my father.'' Aside from being a soldier, Luis enjoyed \nplaying video games and basketball and writing poetry. Today and \nalways, Luis will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made \nwhile dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Luis' sacrifice, I am \nreminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of \nthe fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Luis' actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Luis A. Perez in the official \nrecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.

SGT David M. \nHeath, 20 years old, died on August 16 in the Sadr City district of \nBaghdad when his patrol came under a small arms and rocket-propelled \ngrenade attack. With his entire life before him, David chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  David attended New Prairie High School until 10th grade before moving \nto nearby LaPorte. There, he met his wife Donna, and in September 2001 \ndecided to join the military to support his family and make his father \nproud. After his first 10-month assignment in Iraq in 2003, David \nreturned home but decided to re-enlist expecting to move to Germany. \nInstead, his orders were to report to another tour of duty in Iraq. \nDavid's stepfather, Ed Modjeska, told the Laporte Herald-Argus that \nDavid realized his second trip overseas would be dangerous, ``but he \nknew he had to go, it was his job. . . .  He wanted to serve his \ncountry.''\n  David was the 32nd Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his wife Donna Heath; his son Derek; and his stepdaughter, \nAngela Riffel. May David's children grow up knowing that their father \ngave his life so that young Iraqis will some day know the freedom they \nenjoy.\n  Today, I join David's family, his friends and the entire LaPorte \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nDavid, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  David, a fourth-generation soldier, was known for his dedication to \nfamily and his love of country. When looking back on David's life, \nfamily friend Robin Dingman told WSBT-TV of South Bend that ``He loved \nhis kids, he loved his wife, he love NASCAR, but that was a given. As \nbad as this is, he died nobly, and that is a great honor.'' Today and \nalways, David will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made \nwhile dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring David's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Eric Knott of Grand Island, NE, a Petty Officer 3rd Class in the \nU.S. Navy. Petty Officer Knott was killed in Iraq on September 4 in a \nmortar attack while working at a construction site. He was 21 years \nold.\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\n  Petty Officer Knott will be remembered as a proud individual \ndedicated to serving his country. He joined the U.S. Navy in 2001 after \ngraduating from Grand Island Senior High School and became a Navy \nSeabee so he could learn specialty welding and help others. Petty \nOfficer Knott spent about 9 months in Iraq last year and was recently \nredeployed in August. He had just been promoted and was overseeing a \nthree-person unit.\n  Petty Officer Knott is survived by his parents Randy Knott of Grand \nIsland and Vera Thorpe of Hastings; step-mother, Teri Knott of Grand \nIsland; step-father Steve Thorpe of Hastings; brothers William and Tim \nof Seward; sister Angela of Lincoln; and grandparents Lyle and Arlene \nKnott and Masel Anderson, all of Grand Island. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with them at this difficult time. America is proud of Eric Knott's \nservice and mourns his loss.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring Petty Officer 3rd Class Eric Knott.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8846-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO INDIANAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER TIMOTHY LAIRD\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and honor the \nremarkable life of Timothy ``Jake'' Laird, an Indianapolis police \nofficer who was killed in the line of duty on August 18, 2004 by a \ngunman terrorizing an Indianapolis neighborhood.\n  During the early morning of August 18, Officer Laird left his own \npatrol area to come to the aid of fellow police officers in a nearby \nneighborhood who were facing a dangerous man armed with multiple \nassault weapons. Laird, a 4-year veteran of the Indianapolis Police \nDepartment, went out of his way to protect the citizens of Indianapolis \nby knowingly putting himself in danger, a selfless act that would cost \nhim his life. Officer Laird, 31 years old, was the first Indianapolis \npolice officer to die in the line of duty in 16 years.\n  Officer Laird graduated from Warren Central High School in 1991. \nAfter graduating from high school, he joined the Marines and married \nhis high school sweetheart, Jennifer Lyn Reno, in 1992. Officer Laird \nserved 8 years in the Marines before joining the Indianapolis Police \nDepartment in 2000, where he quickly distinguished himself as a \nconfident, hardworking policeman who could be counted on by his fellow \nofficers.\n  During his time with the Indianapolis Police Department, Officer \nLaird received two letters of commendation, though these respected \nsymbols of official praise pale in comparison to the words his family \nand fellow officers used to describe his work. Those who knew him \nremember Officer Laird as a perfectionist who demanded the most of \nhimself on the job but was the first to laugh at himself during lighter \nmoments. He was known as the kind of officer that others wanted with \nthem on patrol, and his willingness to put his life in danger to help \nanother officer is the ultimate proof of the kind of man he was.\n  Officer Laird was a devoted family man who relished his time with \nloved ones. He leaves behind his wife, Jennifer; his daughter, Kaylee; \nhis father, Tim Althouse; and his stepmother, Barb; his mother and \nstepfather, Debbie and Michael Laird; his two brothers, one sister and \ntwo stepbrothers.\n  In the wake of his death, friends, neighbors and fellow officers came \ntogether to praise Officer Laird's bravery, selflessness and love for \nhis family. According to his father, Jake had wanted to be a police \nofficer ever since he was a little boy. Officer Laird was a role model \nnot only for his family, but for all who knew him and whose lives he \ntouched. He dedicated his life to the noblest of causes; his family, \nhis job and keeping others safe. May his daughter grow up knowing that \nher father was a brave, hard-working and loving man.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Timothy ``Jake'' Laird into \nthe United States Congressional Record. As Officer Laird rests with God \nin eternal peace, let us never forget the courage and sacrifice he \ndisplayed when he laid down his life on August 18, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8846-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Scotty Joe Weaver, an 18-year-old gay Alabama man was beaten, \nstabbed, and his body burned in woods near his mobile home on July 18, \n2004. Robert Porter, 18, Christopher Ryan Gaines, 20, and Gaines' \ngirlfriend, Nichole Kelsay have been charged with the July 18 killing, \nwhich police believe was motivated by hate.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues \nin support of this request for additional disaster assistance in the \nwake of Hurricanes Charley and Frances, and the devastation they have \nbrought on the State of Florida. I, along with my Nebraska \nconstituents, send our thoughts and prayers to those in Florida dealing \nwith the physical and emotional impact of these hurricanes.\n  In Nebraska, we sympathize with the victims of natural disasters, \nwhether they be caused by hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes. Presently, \nmy State is facing its fifth straight year of record drought, which as \nyou know has a damaging effect on the agricultural industry, as well \nthe mainstreet of every Nebraska community. Multiple years of drought \nhave cost our Nation billions of dollars in economic losses and has \nmany farmers wondering whether they will be able to carry on. They are \nnot in this position because of poor planning or some unfortunate \nweather incident but rather as the result of a continuous natural \ndisaster that once again has turned upside down the hopes and work that \nwent into planting this spring.\n  This drought is a disaster--it is been a disaster for agriculture and \na disaster for rural communities, which depend so much on agriculture. \nI think that going home over the August recess certainly gave all of us \nfrom States hit by drought even more reason to seek assistance. I do \nnot want to detract from the importance of sending disaster assistance \nto those in Florida. However, I believe that my colleagues must join me \nin casting a greater spotlight on the importance of helping our \nNation's farmers and ranchers recover from the impacts of the current \ndrought.\n  Therefore, I would like to join the Senator from South Dakota in \ncalling on the President and the Congress to support funding for \ndrought aid for our farmers and ranchers, and to fully fund the crop \nand livestock disaster programs so critical to Nebraska's farmers and \nranchers.\n  A drought relief package is of the utmost importance to farmers and \nranchers in Nebraska and across all those rural America parts suffering \nfrom this natural disaster. It will make the difference between keeping \ntheir farms or being forced out of agriculture--to the detriment of all \nof us who depend on the ``breadbasket of the world.'' We must seek this \nassistance in order to ensure that our rural communities are not \nallowed to wither under the worst conditions in over half of a century.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting drought \nassistance this year. Like any other natural disaster, this drought has \nhurt the very livelihoods of good, hardworking people who struggle \nevery day to stay afloat even under normal conditions. It is imperative \nthat we respond to this crisis in rural America.\n  I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to address an issue of \ngreat importance to my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8846-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8846-S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PASSAGE OF U.S.-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently the Senate passed S. 2610, the \nUnited States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The \nU.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which will be implemented by this \nlegislation, will provide many benefits to\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\nU.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers. U.S. consumers will \nclearly gain from it as well. This agreement will also further cement \nour friendship with Australia, a long-time ally and our strong partner \nin the war on terrorism.\n  The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is an example of the \nimportance of Trade Promotion Authority. It has been almost 2 years \nsince Trade Promotion Authority was signed into law as part of the \ntrade act of 2002. During this time, the United States has signed free \ntrade agreements with Chile, Singapore, and now Australia. The \nimplementing bills for each of these agreements passed the Congress \nwith strong support, so Congress clearly recognizes the benefits of \ntrade promotion authority.\n  Many people worked hard to see that this vote became a reality. First \nand foremost, this would not have happened without the leadership of \nPresident George W. Bush. President Bush is committed to building the \nU.S. economy by opening the world's markets to U.S. goods and services, \nand the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement is just the latest of the \ntrade accomplishments he has made possible.\n  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick deserves strong \ncommendation for his efforts in negotiating this agreement. His \ncommitment to expanding U.S. trade opportunities is steadfast.\n  I would also like to thank chief U.S. agricultural negotiator Allen \nJohnson for his willingness not only to listen, but also to act, upon \nthe concerns of U.S. farmers and ranchers during the negotiations. Many \nothers at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative deserve my thanks \nas well.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Finance Committee for their interest \nin seeing that the agreement was concluded and that the implementing \nbill was passed. I would like to extend a special thanks to the ranking \nmember of the Committee, Mr. Baucus. We have worked together over the \nyears to expand trade to the benefit of U.S. workers, farmers, and \nconsumers, and I am pleased with the outcome of our current efforts \nwith the passage of this implementing bill.\n  My staff on the Finance Committee has worked diligently over the past \nweeks on the implementing bill and other materials connected with it. \nMy goal was to have this legislation passed prior to the August recess, \nand they were instrumental in making this happen. Moreover, my Finance \nCommittee staff was engaged in consultations with officials from the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative throughout the negotiations, \nwhich began way back in March 2003, so this has been a long process for \nthem. I greatly appreciate their hard work.\n  My Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Kolan Davis, deserves \nrecognition. His talent in managing many legislative issues, including \ntrade, is readily apparent.\n  The Chief International Trade Counsel of the Committee, Everett \nEissenstat, worked tirelessly to see that the passage of this \nlegislation would actually occur, so today's vote is yet another \ntestament to his skills. I would also like to thank the rest of my \ntrade staff--David Johanson, Stephen Schaefer, Dan Shepherdson, and \nZach Paulsen--for all of their hard work and dedication to the Finance \nCommittee's work and to the people of Iowa.\n  Mr. Baucus's Finance Committee staff also deserves recognition. Russ \nSullivan and Bill Dauster, respectively staff director and deputy staff \ndirector of Mr. Baucus's Finance Committee staff, worked well with my \nstaff throughout the process.\n  I also appreciate the efforts of Tom Punke--Mr. Baucus's chief \ninternational trade counsel--and Sara Andrews, Shara Aranoff, John \nGilliland, Pascal Niedermann, and Brian Pomper.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Polly Craighill of the office of the \nSenate Legislative Counsel for the many hours she put into drafting the \nimplementing bill. Without her patience, hard work, and skills, today's \nvote would not have been possible.\n  I look forward to the signing of this legislation into law by \nPresident Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8847-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8847-S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESOLVE, THE NATIONAL INFERTILITY ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commend \nRESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, on its three decades of \naccomplishment and for the many activities it has planned to observe \nNational Infertility Awareness Week, which will be celebrated this year \nduring the week of September 26 to October 2, 2004.\n  For 30 years, RESOLVE has compassionately and effectively served the \nneeds of the nearly seven million Americans comprising our Nation's \ninfertile community, and has been a leading force in efforts to educate \nthe broader public about this devastating condition. Infertility is \nrecognized as a disease and medical condition that has devastating \nphysical, social and psychological consequences.\n  RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, was incorporated by \nBarbara Eck Menning, in 1974, to aid and support individuals with \ninfertility. RESOLVE is a nonprofit organization, governed by a \nvolunteer board of directors, many of whom are individuals with first-\nhand personal experience with the physical, emotional, and social \nchallenges accompanying infertility. They are citizens who have \novercome these challenges through assisted reproductive technologies \nand adoption or determined that their lives would be childless. \nRegardless of their resolution, RESOLVE helped them to reach it with \ninformation, education, and support. RESOLVE's leaders are also members \nof the professional community who address these issues including \nNational Institutes of Health funded researchers, attorneys, \nphysicians, nurses, and other representatives from the health care \nindustry and related businesses. RESOLVE has a database of more than \n40,000 individuals and providers, and a network of more than 40 \nchapters providing support services, information and grassroots \nadvocacy in local communities nationwide.\n  National Infertility Awareness Week focuses attention on the fact \nthat infertility affects approximately 6.6 million people in the United \nStates, a figure which represents 1 in 10 couples in which the woman is \nof reproductive age. These are only the reported cases. Millions go \nunreported because of the stigma attached to infertility and recent \nsurveys suggest that nearly three-quarters of those who can be helped \ndo not seek medical or other assistance because of, among other things, \ntheir fears and lack of awareness of the resources available to them \nand the limited insurance coverage to assist them. The National \nInstitutes of Health, most particularly the National Institute for \nChild Health and Development, spends approximately $300 million a year \non biomedical research focused on reproductive health, treatments, and \ncures of reproductive disorders. This important research will advance \nour understanding of infertility-associated diseases and the \navailability of more effective and affordable treatments that will be \nrespected by insurers and employers as a routine benefit for all those \ninsured.\n  I am proud that my state of Hawaii and 14 other states have enacted \nlaws that require insurance companies to provide some level of coverage \nfor infertility treatment. Like the thousands of individuals working as \npart of the RESOLVE network, a dedicated community of Americans, I am \ncommitted to helping to ensure that those struggling with the multiple \nchallenges of infertility have regular access to appropriate and \naffordable health care coverage to address their health care needs.\n  I applaud the work of RESOLVE, The National Infertility Association, \nand commend the many ongoing efforts and special activities throughout \nthe country aimed to educate and inform the public about the issue of \ninfertility, during National Infertility Awareness Week, September 26 \nto October 2, 2004.\n\n\n                            ``FOUR TRIALS''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we approach the end of this Congress, we \nwill reach a point when a number of us will make statements reflecting \non those who will not be returning to the Senate next year. I will miss \na number of Senators who have chosen not to seek reelection. Today, I \nwant to focus on a Senator who is responding to the country's call by \njoining with another extraordinary American leader, John Kerry, in this \nyear's national campaign. I speak, of course, of John Edwards, whose \nenergy, optimism and good sense have been a great asset to the Senate \nover the last 6 years.\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n  I read that political partisans at corporate business and insurance \norganizations have established a ``November Fund'' of $10 million to \nseek to smear John Edwards. I hope that before the American people or \nthe media fall prey to these attacks, they consider the facts. In that \nregard, I urge Americans to read ``Four Trials''. This extraordinary \nbook is an autobiographical account of John Edwards's life and some of \nthe cases in which he represented ordinary citizens who had suffered \ngrievous wrongs. John is rightly proud of his hard work as the lawyer \nrepresenting E.G. Sawyer, Jennifer Campbell, Josh Howard, Valerie Lakey \nand so many other middle class and working class families against \npowerful interests that both harmed them and then refused to \nacknowledge responsibility for causing that harm.\n  I wish that those preparing to launch attacks against John Edwards \nand other trial lawyers would read ``Four Trials.'' It has recently \nbeen released in paperback, so now for only $13 they may save \nthemselves millions in negative attack ads. No one who knows the story \nof John Edwards's legal career can have anything other than admiration \nfor what he was able to achieve through hard work, persistence and \nbelief in the American people who serve on our Nation's juries. That \nfaith in ordinary Americans and commitment to justice is what he is now \nbringing to American voters across the Nation.\n  My plea may be futile when addressed to the rabid partisans who, \nagain this year, will apparently stop at nothing. Those who will foster \nand promote attacks on John Kerry's military service and on John \nEdwards's representation of injured, ordinary citizens in need of a \nvoice have likewise savagely attacked John McCain during the Republican \nprimaries 4 years ago and Max Cleland 2 years ago.\n  They promote attacks to divide us. They lessen America by fostering \nsquabbles for partisan gain. I was pleased to see John Kerry and John \nEdwards issue a call at the Democratic nominating convention in August \nfor the Republican ticket and its supporters to abandon negative \nattacks. I am disappointed that Republican partisans have not risen to \nthat challenge but continue to engage in what is rightfully termed a \n``smear and fear'' campaign. George Bush could have and should have \ncalled a halt to the scurrilous attacks upon John Kerry's heroic \nmilitary service but seems more than willing to see Karl Rove's well-\nknown smear tactics dominate this fall's campaign.\n  The upcoming wave of attacks against John Edwards will be one \nfinanced by those who oppose lowering drug prices for seniors, oppose a \nreal patients' bill of rights and oppose accountability for misconduct \nthat shatters the lives of ordinary Americans. Let them tell David and \nSandy Lakey that John Edwards, and lawyers like him who fight for \nvictims, should not be allowed to seek justice in America.\n  I urge fair-minded Republicans and independents as well as Democrats \nto consider John Edwards's life and work and to read ``Four Trials.'' \nIt will make you cry. It will remind you that good-hearted people like \nJohn and Elizabeth Edwards do the right thing and seek to help their \nneighbors. It will make you proud to live in a country where ordinary \nAmericans can take on the powerful with the help of a committed legal \nadvocate and achieve some measure of justice.\n  I look forward to the days and weeks ahead when more and more of the \ncountry will have the opportunity to get to know John Edwards. I have \nevery confidence that come the inauguration in January, John will \nreturn as President of the Senate as a part of his duties as Vice \nPresident of the United States. It has been a pleasure and a privilege \nto serve with him, and I look forward to working with him on behalf of \nthe American people in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8848-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE U.S. COMMISSION ON OCEAN POLICY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to note the April 20th release of \nthe Preliminary Report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. This \ncomprehensive report, the first of its kind in 35 years, lays out an \nocean blueprint for the 21st century for implementation by the Congress \nand the Administration. The Ocean Commission, led by former Chief of \nNaval Operations and Secretary of Energy, Admiral James D. Watkins, USN \n(Ret.), is to be congratulated for its diligence and dedication to its \nmandate to make recommendations for a comprehensive and coordinated \nnational ocean policy for the United States.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia has always had a strong connection to \nthe ocean. From the arrival of settlers in Jamestown in the early \n1600's, to the current day when the ports of Norfolk, Portsmouth and \nNewport News play a vital role in our Nation's economy and security, \nVirginia has always depended on the oceans. While the Commonwealth has \nlong recognized the importance of the oceans, one of the most valuable \ncontributions of the Ocean Commission's report is its finding that \noceans and their resources are important to all States, and that we all \nhave a role to play in their protection and management.\n  The Ocean Commission's preliminary report represents the culmination \nof 2\\1/2\\ years of work, including 15 public meetings around the \ncountry, 17 site visits to gather more detailed information, and input \nfrom 445 witnesses, resulting in nearly 1,900 pages of testimony. The \nreport is over 400 pages long and contains almost 200 recommendations \ndesigned to improve the Federal governance structure, enhance and \nincrease ocean science and research, improve coastal water quality, \nsustain our Nation's fisheries, and improve the stewardship of our \noceans through an expanded education and outreach program.\n  An overarching theme of the report is the need at the Federal, \nregional and State levels to move toward an ecosystem-based management \napproach that acknowledges the complexities of both ecosystems and \nhuman needs. This approach recognizes the relationships among all \necosystem components and requires fundamental changes in governance and \ngreatly improved science and education. Through its active \nparticipation in the Chesapeake Bay Program, Virginia understands the \nmany advantages to be gained by developing regional, ecosystem-based \napproaches to address the complex inter-relationships of activities in \nmany States that impact the Bay.\n  As the former Chief of Naval Operations under President Reagan, \nAdmiral Watkins well knows the role oceans have played in protecting \nUnited States national security interests. The Ocean Commission's \npreliminary report, while not focused primarily on national security \nissues, contains recommendations on ports and marine transportation, \nvessel operations, increased ocean research and exploration, improved \nmanagement of our ocean resources, and accession to the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea--all of which will contribute to our \nNation's security and future well-being.\n  As the Commission finalizes its report I look forward to working \ntogether with the administration and my associates in this body and in \nthe House as we take advantage of the opportunity presented by the work \nof the Ocean Commission to implement a new vision for the future of our \nNation's oceans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8848-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8848-S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I take a few moments to comment on S. 2468, \nthe Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which will reform the \npostal laws of the United States to guarantee its success into the 21st \ncentury. The United States Postal Service faces several long-term \nfinancial challenges unless something is done. In the last 5 years \nalone, the first-class mail, which accounts for over half of all postal \nrevenue, has dropped dramatically. The continued downward spiral of the \nPostal Service is linked to the increased use of faxes and e-mails to \ncommunicate. As these different ways of communicating and doing \nbusiness increase, it is important to preserve delivery to every \naddress--making it a universal service--which this bill guarantees. As \na rural State, Montana is a primary example of a State that needs this \nassurance. The Postal Service is the only service provider available in\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\nmany parts of Montana and allows Montana residents to stay in contact \nwith the rest of the country and the world.\n  Additionally, the Postal Service faces such problems as reacting to \nneeded price changes. Currently, the Postal Service takes 18 months to \nreact to price changes, which makes it impossible to respond to market \nconditions. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act would allow \nthe Postal Regulatory Commission the power to institute emergency price \nincreases due to unexpected circumstances. An Anthrax attack, that \nrecently occurred, is an example of this circumstance. In addition, \nthis bill would free up $78 billion over a period of 60 years by \nrepealing the provision of the Public Law 108-18, which states that \noverpayment to the Postal Service must be kept in an escrow account. By \nreleasing these funds, the Postal Service would be able to diminish \nrate increases, help pay off the debt owed to the U.S. Treasury and \nhelp fund health care liabilities for their employees. These funds are \nalso need to be put toward employee salaries and benefits, which make \nup 76 percent of the Postal Service costs.\n  One Montanan wrote me recently saying, ``Postal Reform is critical to \nthe nearly 3000 Postal Employees in Montana and the thousands of others \nwho rely on the USPS as a foundation for their occupation.'' I could \nnot agree more. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act of 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8849-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL MOLITOR\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is truly an honor and a \nprivilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Paul Molitor, an \nincredible individual and a tremendous baseball player from the city of \nSaint Paul, MN. Paul will forever be remembered as one of the greatest \nto ever play the game, but most of all he will be remembered as a \nhometown hero to many Minnesotans. In recognition of his achievements \nand dedication to the sport, Paul has been inducted into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY. This is a tribute not only to \nhis abilities on the field, but also to his commitment to the \ncommunity. It is my great privilege to highlight his accomplishments \nbefore the United States Senate and this Nation.\n  Paul's humble beginnings were that of many young Minnesotans. At the \nage of four, it was clear that a passion for baseball was developing in \nthe heart of this young Midwestern boy. Every where he went, Paul would \ncarry his mitt with him. He shined as a star athlete for the Raiders of \nCretin-Derham Hall High School in Saint Paul. For his college \neducation, he stuck close to home and became a Golden Gopher by \nattending the University of Minnesota. At the U of M, Paul was a three-\nyear starter and a two-time All-American before he made the decision to \nsign with the Milwaukee Brewers as the third overall pick in the 1977 \nMajor League Baseball draft.\n  After only a short time in the minor leagues, Paul earned a role as \nthe starting shortstop and leadoff hitter for the Brewers. This \nposition would be one of many that this versatile athlete would play \nthroughout his record-breaking career. Paul reached many milestones \nthat few players would ever meet. He is one of only five players with \nover 3,000 hits and over 500 steals, the others being legendary players \nTy Cobb, Honus Wagner, Eddie Collins, and Lou Brock. Paul is in the top \nten all-time in at-bats, hits, singles, and doubles, and in the top \ntwenty all-time in runs scored, triples, and stolen bases. Paul also \ntops the list as the only player in Major League Baseball history with \n3,000 hits, 500 stolen bases, and 200 home runs. All of these are great \naccomplishments, but perhaps his greatest feat came in 1993, when the \nToronto Blue Jays won the World Series and Paul was recognized as the \nmost valuable player.\n  Outside of baseball, Paul is well-known as one that actively gives \nback to his community. In 1998, he was honored with the Branch Rickey \nAward, which is given to baseball players that show unparalleled \ndevotion to serving their community. In addition to this, Paul was also \nrecognized for his strength of character when he was awarded the Lou \nGehrig Memorial Award, given to those who best exemplify the giving \ncharacter of Lou Gehrig, another hall-of-famer.\n  Paul Molitor has come a long way from the sandlots of Saint Paul to \nthe ballparks of Major League Baseball. In twenty-one seasons, Paul \nplayed with three major league clubs, before coming back home to play \nfor his hometown team, the Minnesota Twins, in 1996. It is quite clear \nthat Paul Molitor is a person whose dedication and hard work brought \nhim to the pinnacle of Major League Baseball. His talent, commitment, \nand love for the game have led to his selection into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame. It is my distinct pleasure to recognize his \nachievements before the United States Senate, and I wish him all the \nbest in his future endeavors.\n  Paul, you have made many proud--your fans, teammates, and the State \nof Minnesota. You are a true hometown her. Congratulations on your \ninduction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8849-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING ROY SNYDER\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I honor a great public servant, Roy \nSnyder. Roy Snyder is retiring after 27 years of providing exemplary \nservice to America. His career began in 1962, with the Bureau of Land \nManagement. He then served our Country for over 10 years in the United \nStates Army where he attained the rank of Captain. He then turned his \nabilities to Corps of Engineers. For the last 15 years, it has been \nMontana's fortune to have Roy as Operations Manager at Fort Peck Lake. \nHe assumed this position with the determination to make changes that \nwould benefit the public. He accomplished that mission. Fort Peck Lake \nsaw many positive changes under Mr. Snyder's oversight. Without his \nsupport and encouragement, Fort Peck would still be a little known and \nlittle used recreation site.\n  It has been my honor and privilege to work with him on significant \nprojects that have benefited not just Montanans, but all recreational \nusers of Fort Peck. With Roy's help the roads around Fort Peck have \nbeen improved, the campgrounds have been improved, there is a \nbreakwater, Lewis and Clark sites, fishing access sites, a fish \nhatchery, the Interpretive Center. All of these are due in large part, \nto Roy's tenacious ability to make things happen.\n  Even more important, he has created relationships between users that \nnever existed before. People who didn't realize they had anything in \ncommon are now working together. He has worked to turn a lack of \ncommunication into an open line that benefits everyone who uses Fort \nPeck.\n  Even in times of adversity, Roy has been a stalwart supporter of the \nrecreational users. He put the public's need before all others and \nworked to ensure they had the chance to make the most of Fort Peck \nLake. It is my honor to commend Roy Snyder for his 27 years of service. \nIt is even more of an honor for me to refer to Roy as my friend. Roy, \nthank you for everything you have done to make Fort Peck Lake what it \nis today. We will all miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8849-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8849-S8850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF J. IRWIN MILLER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of my \nfellow Hoosier, Joseph Irwin Miller, who died on Monday, August 16, at \nthe age of 95. J. Irwin Miller was a leading industrialist who used his \nbusiness success as an opportunity to give back to his community by \nhelping Hoosiers in need, advancing greater social change through \nexample and turning Columbus, IN, into an architectural landmark.\n  Joseph Irwin Miller was a fourth-generation Hoosier, born in 1909 to \nHugh and Nettie Miller. He graduated from Yale University in 1931 and \njoined his family's bank 3 years later. His family also owned Cummins, \na local diesel maker that Miller would transform into a Fortune 500 \ncompany recognized around the world. On his watch, Cummins increased \nits sales five times over, to $100 million by 1955. From a small-town \ncompany with 60 employees, J. Irwin Miller grew Cummins into\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nan industry giant with 25,000 employees from around the world.\n  These economic accomplishments are remarkable, but they are far \noutmatched by Miller's work in public service and social activism. J. \nIrwin Miller was a visionary whose impact reached far beyond Cummins, \naffecting the entire State of Indiana and indeed many nations, through \nhis innovative leadership, personal convictions and legendary \nphilanthropy.\n  During the long fight for greater civil rights, Miller led by \nexample, first by eliminating segregation at Cummins and later by \nhelping organize the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, civil rights \nmarch. J. Irwin Miller was a man who stood by his beliefs no matter \nwhat the cost. To protest apartheid in South Africa, Miller closed the \nCummins plant located there and helped write legislation that led to \neconomic sanctions against the country. Such dedication to one's \nbeliefs and commitment to do what is right is especially commendable \ntoday, in light of recent corporate scandals and failings.\n  J. Irwin Miller was a man of international importance and influence, \nbut he never forgot his roots in Indiana. His love for his hometown is \nevident throughout Columbus, where today visitors can find examples of \nthe finest architecture in the world. Because of his efforts, Columbus \nbecame known as the ``Athens of the Prairie,'' with schools and public \nbuildings designed by such world-renowned figures as I. M. Pei and \nEliel Saarinen.\n  With the passing of J. Irwin Miller, I hope that these buildings \nbecome more than architectural landmarks, but symbols of the true \npublic spirit demonstrated by Miller in every aspect of his life. J. \nIrwin Miller was a true leader in business and in life, and he will be \ngreatly missed.\n  It is my honor to enter the name of Joseph Irwin Miller into the \nCongressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8850-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NORTH AMERICAN EXPLORATION\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and to \nextend my congratulations to a great Utah company, North American \nExploration, which recently celebrated its 40th anniversary of service \nto the mining industry. For the last 25 of these years, North American \nhas been head- \nquartered in the City of Kaysville in my home State of Utah.\n  Over the last four decades, North American has provided mineral \nexploration and mine development services on countless projects \nthroughout Utah and the Mountain West, producing jobs for hundreds of \nUtahns in the process. North American is typical of so many small \nbusinesses that are truly the silent engines behind our economy.\n  As a former businessman myself and as a member of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, I am well aware of the challenges involved in \nbuilding and managing a successful enterprise. North American has been \nvery fortunate to be aided in this endeavor by the leadership of Jay \nGatten, who has been their chief executive since 1979.\n  So let me conclude by again offering my congratulations to Jay and \nTora Gatten, Brian Vinton, and the rest of the North American team for \nthe successes they have enjoyed and by offering them every best wish \nfor continued prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8850-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THOMAS A.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Thomas A. \nGrau, CPCU, who will be installed as the 100th president of the \nNation's largest insurance association--the Independent Insurance \nAgents & Brokers of America, IIABA--this October in Orlando. He was \nelected to IIABA's Executive Committee in September 1999, and was \ninaugurated as president-elect during the association's convention in \nLas Vegas last fall. Tom is an executive with the Cogswell Agency in \nGreat Falls, MT.\n  Tom has been active on the local, state, regional and national levels \nof the insurance industry throughout his career. In 1991, he began his \n6-year tenure as the Independent Insurance Agents of Montana \nrepresentative to the IIABA National Board of Directors. In 1997, he \nwas appointed chairman of IIABA's Finance Committee. Tom also served on \nIIABA's Audit and Direction, and Resource Coordination Committees.\n  He also was active in the regional Far West Agents Conference, \nserving as its chairman in 1986.

Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the town of Scotland, SD. The town \nof Scotland has a proud past and promising future.\n  Like many towns in South Dakota, Scotland got its start with help \nfrom the railroad. Scotland was originally founded in 1870 on a site \nnear Dawson Creek. However, in 1879, with the approach of the Chicago, \nMilwaukee,and St. Paul Railroad, it became necessary for Scotland to be \nrelocated to the upland prairie. The town still stands on this second \nsite.\n  General Charles T. Campbell and John Stafford are credited with the \nfounding of Scotland. General Campbell was of Scottish ancestry and \nthat's how the name came about. He was a distinguished soldier in both \nthe Mexican and Civil Wars. In 1867, he was assigned to Dakota \nTerritory as an inspector for Indian agencies. It was at this time, \nwhile traveling for his duties as inspector, that General Campbell \ndiscovered the ideal location on Dawson Creek to build a trading post \nand inn on the Firesteel Stage Coach line that ran between Firesteel, \nnear present-day Mitchell, and Yankton. General Campbell's original \nbuildings established the nucleus from which the town of Scotland soon \nevolved.\n  John Stafford arrived with his family from Canada in 1872. Mr. \nStafford is important to the development of Scotland because he donated \neighty acres of land for the new town site. In the next decade, more \nthan 100 families moved to the area, and most of them were of English, \nespecially Scottish, descent. The relocation of the town in 1879 \nescalated the growth of Scotland. The year 1873 heralded the arrival of \na large population of German-Russian immigrants. The years from 1885-\n1891 was the golden age of development for Scotland. During that time \nScotland boasted the largest flax market in the United States and the \nworld's largest tow mill. Scotland is also proud to be the hometown of \nUnited States astronaut Charles Gemar. Currently, about 1,000 people \nreside in Scotland. It is with great honor that I advise my colleagues \nof the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8850-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8850-S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING THE CITY OF AVON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Avon, SD. The city of \nAvon looks back on a proud history and looks forward to a promising \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\n  Taking its name from a post office run out of the nearby home of Mr. \nand Mrs. George Phoenix, the city of Avon grew out of the 1879 \nexpansion of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. Prosperous \nagriculture in the western part of Bon Homme County led farmers and \nranchers to seek expanded markets for their goods. Railroad officials, \nin turn, recognized the value of building a branch line from Napa to \nPlatte to serve this need, and some 500 workers began the arduous task \nof laying the new line through the area. The start of work was closely \nfollowed by the opening of a saloon by Joe Sterba that would find its \nhome in Avon's first permanent commercial building by 1900. Other \nbusinesses quickly joined the saloon, and Avon was soon a thriving \ncommunity serving the agricultural region that surrounded it.\n  For most of its 125 years, the city of Avon has been served by the \nweekly newspaper, the Avon Clarion, which began publication in the \nwinter of 1901. In an article that year, the paper boasted that Avon \nhad, ``without exception, the brightest and most encouraging future of \nany town along this line.'' In the 125 years since its founding, Avon \nhas proven its ability to thrive and serve farmers and ranchers in the \nregion. Currently, more than 550 people live in the city of Avon. It is \nwith great honor that I advise my colleagues of the achievements made \nby this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8851-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING THE TOWN OF BURKE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the town of Burke, SD. The town of \nBurke has enjoyed a proud past and looks forward to a bright future.\n  Founded in 1904, the town of Burke took its name from Charles Burke \nof Pierre, who served in the South Dakota legislature, U.S. Congress, \nand later as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Burke was platted as \na government townsite and surveyed by Sam Chilton. On August 4, \nhomesteaders gathered in the center of the townsite and raced on foot, \non horseback and with wagons to lay their claims to plots in the town. \nThough the town was born with the sound of the pistol that day, Burke \ndid not experience the boom that many of the other towns in the area \ndid. Burke's growth was slow and purposeful. Early settlers faced and \novercame the hardships of South Dakota winters, tedious trips to the \nnearest railroad town for supplies, the devastation of tornadoes, and \neven terrorization from gamblers and thugs that had made their way into \ntown. The citizens of Burke cleaned up the rough element and earned a \nreputation as one of the most peaceable and law-abiding towns in the \ncounty.\n  Since 1917, Burke has served as the county seat of Gregory County. \nThe town lies about 30 miles west of the Missouri River in a region of \nfertile farmland and gently rolling hills. Currently, more than 650 \npeople live in Burke. The town celebrated its centennial birthday with \nfestivities during the first week of August. Among the many events \nduring the 5-day celebration were an alumni golf tournament, a \ncentennial farm dance, a parade, an alumni banquet, a centennial coin \nauction, and a ballroom dance. It is with great honor that I advise my \ncolleagues of the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8851-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THE TOWN OF TYNDALL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the town of Tyndall, SD. The town \nof Tyndall is a spirited and self-reliant county seat with a proud past \nand promising future.\n  In 1879, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway chose to enter \nBon Homme County. Dan Currier build the first home and store along the \nrailroad route in Tyndall, so-named for the English physicist John \nTyndall who first explained what makes the sky blue. In 1884, Dan \nCurrier opened the Grand Central Hotel, referred to as the greatest \nhotel this side of Chicago at the time. Mr. Currier remained active in \nthe town's growth and became the first mayor in 1887. The first \nsettlers in Tyndall were predominately German, Czech, and Irish. Their \nmeeting halls were some of the first building in the town of Tyndall \nand many are preserved today.\n  A major attraction opened in Tyndall in 1989: the Soukup and Thomas \nBalloon Museum. The museum exhibits one of the best displays of \nballooning history, including the first balloon basket to fly over the \nSoviet Union. The museum also houses a rare collection from the \nHindenburg Airship as well as examples of balloon mail, lithographs, \njewelry, trophies, and other collectibles. Tyndall hosted the 6th World \nGas Balloon Championship and the 1st World Roziere Balloon Championship \nin 1990. The second annual International Balloon Rally was held in 1991 \nin Tyndall.\n  Though the railroad which gave birth to the town of Tyndall is no \nlonger operational, the town continues to thrive, relying on friendly \nlocal business and aggressive agriculture. Currently 1,200 people \nreside in this progressive community. It is with great honor that I \nadvise my colleagues of the achievements made by this great \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8851-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE TOWN OF LAKE ANDES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the town of Lake Andes, SD. Lake \nAndes has experienced a proud century and looks forward to a promising \nfuture.\n  Founded in 1904, the town of Lake Andes sits on the southwest shore \nof its namesake. Measuring twelve miles in length and a mile and a half \nwide, Andes Lake is one of the most popular destinations for hunters \nand fishers in the State and sits at the center of one of the richest \nand most fertile sections of South Dakota.\n  Though it was platted in 1901, the town was not officially \nestablished until three years later, when town lots were sold on May \n18, 1904. In 1911, the town welcomed the construction of a Carnegie \nLibrary, which still stands and has since been designated a historical \nstructure for the State of South Dakota. Lake Andes became the county \nseat of Charles Mix County in 1916, prompting growth and prosperity \nthat would lead to more than 80 years of stability in the town.\n  Currently, more than 800 people reside in the town of Lake Andes. In \nearly June, Lake Andes held centennial festivities that coincided with \nthe town's Fish Days celebration, an annual tradition that began in \n1915, continued through 1969, and was reestablished in 1988. A parade, \ncarnival, quilt show, and firemen's water fight were among the many \ncelebratory events that weekend. It is with great honor that I advise \nmy colleagues of the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8851-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THE TOWN OF HERRICK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I honor and publicly recognize the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the town of Herrick, SD. The town \nof Herrick has a strong sense of its past and anticipates a bright \nfuture.\n  Though it was originally named Willette, the town adopted the name of \nprestigious homestead lawyer Samuel Herrick soon after its 1904 \nfounding. From 1906 to 1907, Herrick experienced a period of growth as \nit served as a stop along the railroad. Many of the original buildings \nin the town still stand, including the Town Hall built in 1913, which \nhas been restored and is in use, and the old saloon, which has since \nbecome a family restaurant and bar. Two other structures find \nthemselves on the National Register of Historic Places: the Herrick \nSchool House and Herrick Elevator.\n  Herrick's 105 proud residents and friends of the community celebrated \nthe centennial at the end of July with festivities including an all-\nschool reunion, the annual Squeal Meal celebration, and a hayride \nfeaturing buildings and homes that were built around the time of the \nfounding. It is with great honor that I advise my colleagues of the \nachievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8851-5", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8851-S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING JEFFREY LEE NELSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I congratulate Jeff Nelson of \nMadison, SD,\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\nfor recently celebrating 30 years of distinguished service at East \nRiver Electric.\n  Jeff Nelson understands the word dedication. Mr. Nelson was born and \nraised in Marion, SD, where he attended high school. After graduating \nfrom South Dakota State University in 1971 with a degree in electrical \nengineering, he entered the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany. \nFrom 1971 to 1974, he served as an officer in the U.S. Army's Armored \nDivision. After honorably serving, he and his wife, Trudi, relocated to \nMadison where he started working for East River Electric.\n  I know first hand that Jeff has done a great deal to improve the \nlives of countless South Dakotans. He is a tremendously talented man \nwith a great deal of energy and ambition. He is not only a good friend, \nbut a person who may staff and I deal with closely. As general manager \nof East River Electric since 1990, he has earned the respect and \nadmiration of all those who have had the opportunity to work with him.\n  East River Electric is a power supply cooperative which serves \nwholesale electricity to 22 member systems, which in turn serve over \n82,000 homes and businesses. The 36,000 square mile service area covers \n41 counties in Eastern South Dakota and nine counties in western \nMinnesota.\n  Jeff's friendly demeanor and wealth of knowledge have helped him \ndevelop close relationships with his colleagues and with community \nleaders throughout our State. This friendly attitude has led to \nnumerous elected posts and honors. He is currently the president of the \nMid-West Electric Consumers Association board of directors, Upper Great \nPlains Region Affiliate of Western States Power Corporation board of \ndirectors, chairman of the Power and Water Resources Standing Committee \nof the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and vice \npresident of the Western States Power Corporation board of directors. \nAmong his many philanthropic efforts are the organizer of the Lake \nCounty Food Pantry, treasurer of the East Central South Dakota Habitat \nfor Humanity, and he is on the board of directors for the Lake Area \nImprovement Corporation.\n  Through it all, Jeff's devotion to his family is his number one \npriority. Even as his responsibilities at East River Electric changed \nand grew, his commitment to his family never wavered. Jeff and Trudi \nhave two children, Erik and Katie. Erik and his wife, Stacy, live in \nSioux Falls, while Katie resides in nearby Marshall, Minnesota.\n  I congratulate Jeff Nelson for his 30 years of distinguished service. \nIt is with great honor that I share his impressive accomplishments with \nmy colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8852-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8852-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United Stats submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8852-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 7, 2003, the following \nenrolled bills were subsequently signed by the President pro tempore \n(Mr. Stevens) on July 23, 2004:\n\n       H.R. 1572.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to insure zero-downpayment mortgages; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to further the cause of \naffordable homeownership in America. I am proud of all that we have \ndone to increase opportunities for homeownership, however I hope that \nno member of this body makes the mistake of believing\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\nthat the fight is over. I am very proud of the 68.6 percent rate of \nhomeownership we enjoy in America today but millions of American \nfamilies are unable to take advantage of the many benefits of \nhomeownership. One of the greatest obstacles for these Americans is the \nminimum down payment. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides \nloans to many 1st time homebuyers who otherwise would struggle to \nqualify, yet many working class families are still overwhelmed at the \nprospect of saving thousands of dollars for the 3 percent minimum down \npayment. This legislation will help make homeownership become a reality \nfor those Americans.\n  The Zero Downpayment Act of 2004 will allow families who seek FHA-\ninsured loans to include the downpayment in their loan amount. These \nborrowers will still have to meet FHA credit qualifications and will \npay a slightly higher annual interest rate to cover the cost of the \nprogram. Borrowers will also be required to receive counseling to \nensure they are ready for the financial responsibilities associated \nwith homeownership. This legislation provides a wonderful opportunity \nfor those Americans who are on the edge of homeownership to begin \nbuilding better lives and neighborhoods all over the country.\n  As members of the United States Senate we each spend a good amount of \ntime meeting with people of all walks of life. I am introducing this \nlegislation today, because it can change lives, and give people a \nchance to experience a better life. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin the fight to give every American the opportunity to become a \nhomeowner. The Zero Downpayment Act of 2004 is an important step in \nthat process and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nimmediately following my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8864-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8864-S8916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2774. A bill to implement the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this week marks the third anniversary of \nthat terrible day in 2001 when terrorists attacked America's commercial \nand governmental capitals. On that occasion, in the largest attack ever \non American soil, 2,973 innocent individuals lost their lives. The \nvictimization of America went beyond this astounding number, with \nphysical injuries to many, damage to our Nation's economy, and \npsychological trauma among millions who witnessed these shocking \nevents.\n  While nothing we do can erase this pain, we can honor and pay tribute \nto those who have suffered by ensuring that terrorists never again \nattack our land. We have come a long way since 2001 in enhancing this \ncountry's ability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, but, as \nthe 9/11 Commission said in its final report, we are not yet safe. \nIncreasing our safety against terrorist attack requires new strategies, \nnew ways of thinking, and new ways of organizing our government.\n  Today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman, Specter, Bayh, \nGraham of South Carolina, Daschle, and Clinton in introducing \nlegislation designed to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \nwhich were issued just prior to the August recess. Governor Tom Kean \nand Representative Lee Hamilton have endorsed this bill, and assured us \nthat it accurately reflects the Commission's intent.\n  With the introduction of this bill, the Senate now has before it \nlegislation that addresses each of the Commission's 41 recommendations, \nwhich together are designed to build unity of effort across the U.S. \nGovernment--all in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks. The \nprovisions of this bill outline the shape and objectives of a global \ncounterterrorism strategy, and suggest a reconfiguration of our \nnational security and homeland security apparatus within the U.S. \nGovernment. As anyone who reads the legislation will quickly see, it \nalso cuts across jurisdictional lines with respect to the Senate \ncommittee prerogatives. There are portions of this bill that deal with \nintelligence, foreign affairs, defense, border security and commerce, \ntransportation security, and more. In normal times, naysayers would \ncaution that this fact alone could paralyze this body. But these are \nnot normal times. International terrorism poses a real and present \ndanger to the United States, and it is our responsibility as elected \nofficials to take action on the Commission's recommendations.\n  I would like to highlight some of the major aspects of the bill, and \nI know that the other sponsors also will provide details on the bill's \nstructure.\n  The largest section of this bill concerns the reorganization of our \nintelligence community. This legislation establishes a National \nIntelligence Authority to unify the efforts of the community, and this \nnew entity would be headed by a National Intelligence Director, NID. \nThe NID also would act as the principal intelligence advisor to the \nPresident, taking over this function from the Director of Central \nIntelligence. The NID would have direct budgetary authority and \nsignificant personnel authority over all of the intelligence agencies, \nexcept those that generate intelligence that falls under the purview of \none department alone, such as tactical military intelligence. The NID \nwould have influence over the budgets for these other entities that do \nprovide this very specific intelligence. Assisting the NID would be \nfour deputies, including a principal deputy, another that serves \ncurrently as the CIA Director and would handle foreign intelligence, a \ndeputy that also serves as the Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence, and a fourth that handles domestic intelligence.\n  Also established in this bill is a National Counterterrorism Center \nto oversee all of the U.S. Government counterterrorism operations, \nincluding analysis, net assessments, and guidance for joint \ncounterterrorism operations. The center would be headed by a deputy-\nlevel official who can adjudicate policy disagreements among the \nagencies and, if need be, bump them up to the National Security Council \nfor a decision. In addition to the National Counterterrorism Center, \nthe bill authorizes the NID to establish ``National Intelligence \nCenters'' that will address particular geographic or functional areas. \nThese centers will, like the NCTC, bring together the full range of \nreporting and analysis on particular topics so that no one with a need \nto know is cut out of the loop. There are also provisions designed to \nensure that increased centralization of the intelligence community does \nnot lead to a reduction in the range of analytical views available to \npolicymakers.\n  Finally in the intelligence title, the bill codifies the critical \nreforms that Director Mueller has begun at the FBI, including his \nefforts to improve the FBI's intelligence capabilities and develop a \npersonnel cadre that specializes in national security issues.\n  In its report, the 9/11 Commission found that the biggest impediment \nto ``connecting the dots'' among diverse sources of homeland security \ninformation is the widespread resistance to sharing. To address this \nproblem, the Commission recommended that the President create a new \n``trusted information network'' modeled on a framework developed by a \nMarkle Foundation task force. This bill directs the President to create \nan information network among all Federal departments and agencies with \nresponsibilities for homeland security, among State and local \nauthorities, and among relevant private sector entities. The \nlegislation describes key attributes that should be incorporated into \nthe network and sets forth an ambitious schedule for development and \nimplementation.\n  The Commission report stated that, ``Of all our recommendations, \nstrengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult \nand important. So long as oversight is governed by current \ncongressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people \nwill not get the security they want and need. The United States needs a \nstrong, stable, and capable congressional committee structure to give \nAmerica's national intelligence agencies oversight, support, and \nleadership.''\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\n  The Commission offered several options for how Congress should be \nrestructured to best provide for strong oversight over both \nintelligence and homeland security. With respect to intelligence, it \nrecommended that Congress create either a joint committee modeled after \nthe Joint Atomic Energy Committee or House and Senate Committees with \ncombined authorizing and appropriating powers. With respect to homeland \nsecurity, it recommended that Congress create a single, principal point \nof oversight and review, noting that DHS officials now appear before 88 \ndifferent committees and subcommittees.\n  Late last month, the Senate leadership tasked a bipartisan working \ngroup with examining how best to implement these recommendations and \nasked it to report back to the leadership as soon as possible. In \nrecognition of this ongoing review, our bill does not propose the \ncommittee structures we believe should be adopted, but instead includes \na Sense of the Congress that both houses of the 108th Congress adopt \nall necessary rule changes so that the committee structures for the \n109th Congress are revised in accordance with one of the options \nrecommended by the Commission.\n  It is incumbent on each member to put aside jurisdictional power \nstruggles and take action that is in the interest of securing our \nhomeland. We should strive to never again read a report that calls \nCongressional oversight ``dysfunctional.'' We simply must heed the \nCommissions call to action and fundamentally overhaul Congressional \noversight for intelligence and homeland security. As the Commission \nstated, ``tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient.''\n  As recommended by the Commission, we have included provisions to help \nensure that an incoming President-elect can start putting together his \nnational security team during a transition between administrations. Our \nlegislation would establish procedures for expediting security \nclearances and Senate consideration of top national security \nappointees, as well as any necessary clearances for presidential \ntransition team members. In addition, it directs the President to \nconsolidate security clearance responsibilities in a single Federal \nagency, and to work with the new NID to set uniform standards for \ngranting security clearances so that they are accepted by all Federal \nagencies.\n  One lesson from the Commissions report is that no one set of \nstrategies is sufficient to prevent future terrorist attacks. The \nUnited States must use all of the instruments at our disposal to \ncounter the short and long-term threats posed by international \nterrorism. For this reason, we have devoted an entire title of the bill \nto the role of diplomacy, foreign aid, and the military. The \nlegislation would renew the U.S. commitment to Pakistan's future, in \nlight of the critical role that country plays in the war on terror, and \nauthorizes a substantial increase in aid to Afghanistan. It addresses \nour relations with Saudi Arabia and suggests establishing an \ninternational contact group to develop a multilateral counterterrorism \nstrategy. Other provisions in our bill will enhance America's ability \nto fight the war of ideas by promoting universal values of democracy, \ntolerance, and openness. It authorizes increased funding for U.S. \nbroadcasts to Muslim countries and would ramp up the scale of education \nand exchange programs.\n  This bill notes that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis a grave and gathering threat to this country, and suggests ways to \nstrengthen our nonproliferation programs. And, since portrayals of \nmistreatment of captured terrorists hinders our ability to engage in \nthe wider struggle against them, this legislation both reiterates \nstandards for their humane treatment once captured, and calls on the \nU.S. Government to develop a common approach to detainee treatment, \nalong with its coalition partners.\n  One significant way to prevent future terrorist attacks on American \nsoil is to stop terrorists from entering the country in the first \nplace. This bill contains a number of provisions that would enhance the \nsecurity of our borders, transportation systems and critical \ninfrastructure. For example, our legislation requires the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to work with multiple government agencies to develop \na unified strategy to intercept terrorists, find terrorist \nfacilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility both domestically and \ninternationally. In addition, to efficiently screen persons entering \nthe United States, we must integrate the multiple terrorist screening \nsystems already in place. This bill would require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to develop a comprehensive screening system that \nbrings together an integrated network of screening points, and to work \nto fully implement the entry and exit functions of the U.S. VISIT \nsystem at all ports of entry as quickly as possible.\n  The Commission also pointed out what appears to be a gaping hole in \nour border security. I am referring to the ability of people who claim \nto be United States citizens to orally attest to their citizenship when \npassing from Canada or Mexico into the United States. Numerous reports, \nincluding a recent GAO study, point to our porous borders as potential \nterrorist entryways into this country. Our legislation would require \neveryone entering the U.S. to present a passport, at a minimum.\n  Of course, travel documents only work insofar as they are authentic \nand can be authenticated by our officials. Our bill requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to establish uniform Federal standards \nfor driver's licenses and birth certificates. It is long past time that \nwe take action to protect these documents from being used to commit \nidentity theft, terrorism, and other criminal acts.\n  Although there has been considerable progress in tightening \ntransportation security since September 11, the Commission made several \nrecommendations to further improve the system. For example, the \ncomputer systems and protocols used to vet passengers before they board \na plane are not substantially different than the systems that failed to \nprevent the 9/11 hijackers from boarding their flights. Therefore in \nthis legislation we require the Transportation Security Administration \nto take over and improve the no-fly list process, and to improve the \nscreening of air passengers for explosives and the screening of air \ncargo. In addition, we require DHS to set risk-based priorities for \ndefending various transportation assets, and then figure out a plan and \nbudget to get the job done.\n  Mr. President, I am in full agreement with the Commission that we \nneed to broadly address transportation security vulnerabilities. In \nfact, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has \nalready reported several legislative measures designed to improve the \nsecurity of other transportation modes. A maritime security bill was \nsigned into law in 2002, and we reported a subsequent maritime security \nmeasure earlier this year. We also reported, and the Senate has passed, \na bus security bill, and our rail security legislation is pending on \nthe Senate Calendar. These measures must be enacted before we adjourn.\n  The Commission made a number of recommendations to further our \nnational preparedness and emergency response efforts. Its report states \nthat ``homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \nassessment of risks and vulnerabilities,'' and implores that ``Congress \nshould not use this money as a pork barrel.'' I heartily agree. In \nfollowing this recommendation, the legislation directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to allocate assistance based on the threats, risks, \nand vulnerabilities facing a community, along with its population and \nother specific criteria. It also establishes an expert advisory panel \nto develop benchmarks for assessing the homeland security needs and \ncapabilities of various communities, and rescinds the current formula \nfor homeland security grants.\n  The bill would also require certain broadcasters to vacate their \ntelevision channels in a crisis so that their airwaves are available to \nfirst responders, and ensure that public safety organizations have \naccess to this spectrum no later than January 1, 2007. In addition, it \ndirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with other officials \nin developing effective communications capabilities, including back-up \nsupport. These steps are vital for closing the existing gaps in \ninteroperability of emergency communications systems.\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\n  The Commissioners pointed out that the private sector controls 85 \npercent of the critical infrastructure in the Nation. Our bill directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to promote \nprivate sector preparedness for terrorism and other emergencies. It \nalso directs the Secretary to report to Congress regularly on the \nadequacy of the government's plans to protect our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure.\n  All of us who are concerned with threats to this Nation's security \nalso wish to ensure that our efforts to protect Americans do not \ninfringe on our civil liberties. After all, giving up the way of life \nwe have fought so hard to defend is not an acceptable price for greater \nsecurity. We must find a way to balance the two, and that is what this \nbill proposes to do. It creates a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, as \nwell as designated privacy and civil liberties officers within relevant \nFederal agencies, to analyze actions the enhanced security measures \ntaken by our government and to ensure that civil liberties are \nappropriately considered as these policies are developed. The Board, \nwhich would reside within the Executive Office of the President, would \nadvise the President and Federal agencies on the privacy and civil \nliberties implications of proposed and extant laws, as well as \nauthority to oversee Federal agencies to ensure that civil liberties \nare being protected.\n  In addition, the legislation requires certain agency heads to \ndesignate senior officers to serve as privacy and civil liberties \nresources and watchdogs. Among these officers' responsibilities is \nensuring that their agency has a process in place to receive, \ninvestigate, and respond to complaints from people who report privacy \nor civil liberties violations.\n  Having described the bill we are introducing today, I'd like to \nreiterate that it addresses each of the Commission's recommendations--\nnot more, not less. The sponsors all recognize that other legislative \nproposals will be offered that address the security of our Nation in \nthe face of terrorist threats. In particular, I want to acknowledge the \nefforts by Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Government Affairs Committee. That \nCommittee has a key leadership role in this area, and it is one that I \ngreatly respect. I know that they are working to report a bipartisan \nreform proposal to reform the Intelligence community in the days ahead \nand look forward to Senate debate on their proposal.\n  The sponsors of today's legislation remain open to all proposals, and \nin fact, will have additional suggestions of our own. But the \nintroduction of our legislation today ensures that the commendable work \nof the 9/11 Commission has a real opportunity to be debated, amended, \nand adopted. Despite the short and crowded legislative calendar, we \nurge the leadership to allow for debate on this and other proposals to \naddress the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Even in an election \nyear, there is no higher priority than defending the American people \nagainst threats to their security.\n  Mr. President, there has been much talk over recent months about the \nimportance of firm resolve in the face of threats to America's security \nand its integrity. This legislation presents the Congress with an \nopportunity this year to exhibit some resolve of our own. While we will \nact in the shadow of the dark hours of September 11, we can show the \nAmerican people--and the world--that this government is committed to \nfacing down the worst threats that face us today. We can move forward--\nyes, in an election year, yes, by actually finding agreement regardless \nof party or committee assignment--to better protect and preserve the \nsecurity of this Nation. With the Senate's serious and thorough \nconsideration of the Commission's recommendations, we will honor those \nwho have been patient enough to afford us this opportunity to change.\n  I will make two additional comments. One, we need to reform the \ninstitutions of government. This blueprint which outlines in \nlegislative form the recommendations of the September 11 Commission are \nexactly that, a blueprint. I am confident that the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, under the outstanding leadership of the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, working with Senator Lieberman, Senator \nSpecter, and other members of the committee, will produce a legislative \nproduct of which everyone can be very proud. They have already begun a \nseries of hearings, and I have complete confidence in their \ndeliberations and their results.\n  Let me also say that one of the most difficult aspects of reform will \nbe reform of the institutions here and in the other body. There is no \ndoubt that either one of the two committee recommendations--that there \nbe a joint committee along the lines of the now defunct Joint Committee \non Atomic Energy or two separate permanent committees. Those committees \nhave to have budgetary authority. They must be able to appropriate. If \nnot, those committees will be debating societies and they will not have \nthe influence or power necessary or authority necessary to supervise \nAmerica's intelligence operations.\n  There are many other areas and many other ideas, including those of \nthe White House and the executive branch that need to be taken into \nconsideration. But I think this is a good start because if there is one \nthing all of us can agree on it is that the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission have been embraced by virtually one and all, clearly, with \nsome reservations because it is not a perfect document. But overall, \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans expect that we should act on \nthis blueprint as a blueprint, but, second of all, that we should act--\nthat we should act.\n  There is no disagreement that our intelligence agencies and our \nability to obtain the vital information that is necessary to maintain \nour national security and prevent another terrorist attack require us \nto act in an expeditious fashion.\n  I understand the majority leader, in consultations with Senator \nDaschle, has laid out a schedule for the Governmental Affairs Committee \nto report out the last week in September. I think that is a very \nworthwhile cause.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is good to see you after the recess. \nI thank my colleague and dear friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, for \nhis comments. I support him in substance and in spirit, which is to say \nthe urgency of Congress reacting to the report of the 9/11 Commission.\n  It was shortly after September 11 that Senator McCain and I \nintroduced legislation, with Senators Specter, Bayh, and others, \ncreating the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \nStates. We believed--and we know so many others agreed--that the Nation \nneeded to know as clearly and definitively as possible what had \nhappened, why it had happened, and what could be done to prevent such a \nheinous attack from ever happening again.\n  In particular, most understandably and movingly, the families of the \n9/11 victims rightly demanded that we learn all we could from the \ntragedy that took their loved ones from them. In its 20-month \nexistence, the Commission, headed by Governor Thomas Kean and \nCongressman Lee Hamilton, brought a laser focus to its task. The \nCommission insisted on talking to the people and seeing the documents \nthat could help them understand and tell the full story. The result is \nnot only a definitive account of what happened on September 11, but \nalso a very thoughtful and compelling analysis of why it happened and \nwhere we must go from here. And I take it to be a sign of not only \ntribute to the Commission but of the public concern and interest in \nwhat the Commission had to say, that the published volume of its \nreport, unlike any I have known of in a long time, remains a bestseller \nthroughout our country.\n  So today, Senator McCain, Senator Specter, Senator Bayh, and I join \ntogether again to introduce the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation \nAct of 2004. This legislation embraces and expresses in legislative \nlanguage all 41 of the recommendations in the Commission's final \nreport. Some of those, involving calls to restructure the intelligence \ncommunity, have already been the focus of extensive debate. Others, \nsuch as the proposals to crack down on fraudulent identification \ndocuments or to build new bridges to the Muslim world, have gotten less \ndiscussion. But\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\nthey are all--each and every one of them--the product of the \noutstanding and diligent work of the Commission and therefore deserve, \nindeed command, our attention. We did not attempt to pick and choose \nwhich of the 41 recommendations should be considered or legislated, or \nto edit the Commission's policy conclusions. Indeed, there are one or \ntwo areas where I might take a different approach to the concerns the \nCommission has raised. But the Commission's recommendations should be \nour starting point. And I believe in many cases, probably most, they \nshould be our ending point as well.\n  Introducing this legislation is the fulfillment of the promise we \nmade on the day the Commission issued its report: that we would express \nits proposals in legislation. At that time we had no idea whether \nanything would happen on the Commission report in August or September \nor October. It was that night that Senators Frist and Daschle, our \nbipartisan leadership, asked our Governmental Affairs Committee to \nassume responsibility for considering the Commission's report and \nmaking a set of proposals to the Senate no later than October 1.\n  This proposal we now introduce today will go to the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, formally or informally, to inform the work it is \ndoing. The Governmental Affairs Committee now has the ball and will \nreport to Congress, and is on a schedule, I am pleased to say, to \nreport in advance of the deadline set by Senators Frist and Daschle, in \nadvance of October 1.\n  So what does the Commission and therefore this legislation call for? \nThe Commission's final report depicts a nation that was woefully \nunprepared for the attacks of September 11. As the Commission \nconcludes: We need a new strategic vision to confront terrorism and a \nnew unified effort to carry out that strategy. Such unity can only be \nachieved through a dramatic transformation of the status quo of our key \norganizations and policies. That is the first order of business.\n  The Commission has described how, in the course of its investigation, \nit repeatedly asked this question: Who was in charge prior to September \n11, and who is in charge today? And it never received a satisfactory \nanswer. In fact, Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton testified to us \nbefore our Governmental Affairs Committee that they still cannot point \nto some one individual in charge of the American intelligence effort, \nits enormous human and technological assets, and, therefore, no one who \nis personally accountable.\n  This is unacceptable. This legislation rightly creates a national \nintelligence director to serve as head of the intelligence community \nand principal adviser to the President for national intelligence \nmatters. The director will have strong budget, resource, and personnel \nauthority to shape priorities and break down the kinds of turf barriers \nand stovepipes that stood in the way of our Government pulling together \nin one place all the information we knew prior to September 11--\ninformation that might well have prevented the attacks of September 11 \nfrom occurring.\n  These powers are far stronger than the current authorities exercised \nby the Director of Central Intelligence. This will create the \ncapability and the accountability for someone to truly lead a unified \nintelligence effort that will, in turn, greatly benefit the specific \nfight against terrorism. This intelligence director will operate \nthrough a new agency, to be called the National Intelligence Authority. \nThis is not a large new bureaucracy, but rather a command, control and \ncoordination center to achieve a unified intelligence effort. Although \nthe Commission originally called for this office to be created within \nthe White House, numerous experts counseled against this and the \nCommissioners themselves now agree with that counsel. As a result, this \nlegislation creates the National Intelligence Authority as an \nindependent entity.\n  To help guarantee the government-wide antiterrorism cooperation that \ndid not exist pre-9/11, the legislation also creates a National \nCounterterrorism Center, patterned on the joint commands of the \nDepartment of Defense, drawing on expertise from throughout the \nintelligence community. This center will serve as an analytic fusion \ncenter on terrorism, and will also have responsibility to develop \noperational plans for counterterrorism initiatives, and then to track \nand monitor the operations' implementation. As such, the center will \nbuild on the promise of the new multi-agency Terrorist Threat \nIntegration Center it would replace, but go beyond that model to create \nan even more robust center that combines analytical and operational \ncapabilities.\n  As recommended by the Commission, the legislation also provides for \nthe creation by the National Intelligence Director of a number of \nnational intelligence centers focused on either specific topics like \nweapons of mass destruction or specific geographic areas such as the \nMiddle East. These centers will bring together the most experienced \nintelligence experts from across the intelligence community on a given \nissue or region, and can be created or eliminated as needed, giving us \nthe flexibility to hone in on evolving priorities.\n  I am pleased these intelligence reform proposals have already been \nthe focus of numerous hearings, and these issues, as I have said, will \nbe under active consideration in the Governmental Affairs Committee in \nthe coming days.\n  The work on this legislation and the work that the Governmental \nAffairs Committee is doing has proceeded distinctly, separately, but \ncollaboratively, and work on each has informed and, I believe, \nstrengthened the other.\n  I hope--I know the cosponsors of this legislation share that hope--\nthe package we are introducing today will be of real help to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as it frames the legislation it--we--\nwill report out to the Senate. I am confident the Senate can actually \nbegin to consider it well before the end of September.\n  The intense debate over the Commission's recommendations on \nintelligence reform may have obscured the sweeping proposals the \nCommission made in other areas--very strong and important proposals on \nborder and transportation security, on information sharing, on national \npreparedness and congressional oversight.\n  Those proposals are included in this legislation as well. As a \nresult, we hope its introduction will jump-start debate and \nconsideration of those other vital reforms.\n  First, the Commission stressed we must do all we can to stop this \nproblem at the source--that is, to alter the conditions and dynamics \nthat give rise to terrorism in the first place. This legislation \nincludes the recommendations to strengthen our efforts to fight \ninternational terrorism using such tools as diplomacy and foreign aid. \nFor instance, the legislation would increase U.S. foreign assistance to \nAfghanistan and renew our commitment to Pakistan. It would enhance our \noutreach to the Muslim world through U.S. broadcasts to the region, \neducational exchange programs and a fund to boost educational \nopportunities for Muslim youth.\n  This will be a long and difficult challenge, however, and we must \nassume international terrorism will be with us for years to come and \nprepare accordingly. In addition to the intelligence community reforms \nI have already mentioned, the Commission calls for a range of new \nprograms and policies to combat terror.\n  Information sharing is one such critical step. Terrorism has made the \nhomeland part of the frontlines, but too many government officials \nstill believe information related to terrorist threats must be \ncarefully hoarded among a select group. Even colleagues within the \nintelligence community are often not trusted with vital information, \nmuch less officials outside the national security elites or in state \nand local government. We must break down these information barriers and \nengage a far broader community in the task of fighting terrorism. This \nwill would create an urgently needed information sharing network to \nbreak down the information stovepipes that currently hamper our efforts \nto stay one step ahead of the terrorists. The network, which is modeled \non a proposal by a task force of the Markle Foundation, would consist \nof policies and information technology designed to facilitate and \npromote sharing of terrorism information throughout the Federal \ngovernment, with state and local agencies and, as appropriate, the \nprivate sector.\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nThe President will be required to submit an implementation plan to \nCongress, including clear deadlines, assignment of responsibilities and \nbudget requirements. The proposal includes safeguards for privacy and \ncivil liberties.\n  The bill includes critical provisions to restrict terrorist travel--\nthe strategies and methods by which terrorists can, and did, come to \nthis country and position themselves for attacks. It would expand our \nefforts to collect and utilize intelligence regarding terrorist travel \nstrategies and methods. The legislation also requires an integrated \nscreening system to ensure adequate screening at the nation's entry \npoints and to access transportation systems and critical \ninfrastructure. Complementary provisions in the bill require stronger \ndocument requirements for all travelers, including citizens, to enter \nthe United States; acceleration of the automated biometric entry and \nexit system known as U.S.-Visit; and improved security for \nidentification documents such as driver licenses and birth \ncertificates.\n  In the area of transportation security, the 9/11 Commission warned \nagainst the government's heavy focus on passenger aviation to the near \nexclusion of other modes of transportation. As its Final Report states, \n``[o]ver 90 percent of the nation's $5.3 billion annual investment in \nthe [Transportation Security Administration] goes to aviation--to fight \nthe last war.'' Yet we are investing little in protecting the 14 \nmillion Americans who use transit systems each weekday, or safeguarding \nour port systems that handle millions of shipping containers each year. \nWhat is lacking, the Commission states, is ``a forward-looking \nstrategic plan systematically analyzing assets, risks, costs and \nbenefits.'' Following its recommendations, this legislation calls for a \ncomprehensive transportation security strategy to assess risks and set \npriorities across all modes of transportation. It also seeks to close \nongoing gaps in aviation security by requiring the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, rather than the airlines, to screen passenger \nnames against a consolidated terrorist watchlist. Additional aviation-\nrelated measures include explosives screening for all passengers and \ntheir carry-on bags, accelerated research and deployment of explosives \ndetection technologies, and measures to improve the security of cargo \ntraveling on passenger aircraft.\n\n  To help deter terrorist attacks and minimize the effect of any \nattacks that do occur, we must improve our preparedness capabilities \nand this legislation includes the Commission's recommended steps to do \nso. The bill would require that homeland security preparedness grants \nbe distributed solely on the basis of criteria related to threat and \nrisk, eliminating the per state minimum in current law. It would \nfacilitate first responder communications by assigning certain radio \nspectrum to public safety agencies for their use--an important step \ntoward solving the critical challenge of enabling first responders to \ntalk to one another during an emergency. Fighting terrorism is a \nchallenge for our entire national community and the Commission also \nstressed the importance of preparedness within the private sector. This \nlegislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to promote a \nvoluntary preparedness standard for the private sector. It also presses \nthe Secretary of DHS to complete efforts to inventory the nation's \ncritical infrastructure, assess the threats and vulnerabilities \nregarding these critical assets, and ensure there are measures to \nprotect them.\n  The Commission recognized that these new policies and programs will \nraise important issues regarding privacy and civil liberties and called \nfor a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure the \nprotection of these liberties as laws and policies are developed and \nimplemented to protect the nation from terrorism. This legislation \ncreates such a board, which will consist of five individuals appointed \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition to advising \nthe President and federal agencies, the board will have strong \nauthority to conduct investigations and oversight of government actions \nin the war on terror.\n  Finally, as we look to the changes the Commission has urged for \nexecutive branch structures and programs, we cannot neglect the \nCommission's call to reform our own structures and its indictment of \nthe status quo of congressional oversight of intelligence. We have to \nclean and reshape not only the executive branch, but we have to clean \nout and reshape our own house.\n  The Commission concluded that the Intelligence Committees of the \nHouse and Senate are not organized currently to provide the necessary \nleadership and oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism, and \nthat jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security is also too \nbroadly dispersed.\n  The legislation we are introducing today incorporates the mandate of \nthe Commission that each Chamber reform its rules to create a more \npowerful Intelligence Committee and to consolidate oversight of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in a single committee in each Chamber.\n  Clearly, we have our work cut out for us. But nothing is more \nimportant than to respond not just in a timely but in an urgent way to \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and to do so, as the \nCommission itself did, in a way that puts partisanship aside and our \nnational security first. The group of us introducing this legislation--\nSenators McCain, Specter, Bayh, and I--stand shoulder to shoulder \nacross party lines to achieve a safer nation, to protect the American \npeople at home.\n  We are confident, as we go forward, that our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle will join us. There will be differences of opinion. It \nwould be shocking if there were not. Because the recommendations of the \nCommission represent bold change and dramatically alter the status quo, \ndifferences of opinion will naturally occur. They ought to occur. But I \nam confident in the end they will not be partisan. In the end, we will \nact and act quickly to implement much of the 9/11 Commission's report \nso that we can say to the American people, particularly those who lost \nloved ones on September 11, that we have taken action, done whatever we \npossibly could to prevent a terrorist attack such as the one that \noccurred on September 11, 2001, from ever happening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues--\nSenators McCain, Lieberman, and Bayh--in introducing this legislation \ntoday which codifies the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The 9/\n11 Commission has accomplished a very important mission in stimulating \nthe demand of the American people that action be taken to put all of \nour intelligence agencies under one command authority. Had this been \ndone prior to 9/11, it is my judgment that 9/11 could have been \nprevented.\n  There was the famous FBI report from Phoenix about the suspicious \ncharacter who wanted to learn to fly an airplane but wasn't interested \nin learning to take off or land. There were the suspicious people in \nKuala Lumpur who turned out to be two of the terrorists known by the \nCIA to be al-Qaida, but it was not told to the INS to keep them out of \nthe country. There was the information on Zacarias Moussaoui and the \nwork of the FBI field office in Minneapolis with the 13-page, single-\nspaced report filed by Agent Coleen Rowley. Those factors and others \ngave clear-cut clues to what was happening or about to happen. Had they \nbeen pursued and investigated, the chances are good that 9/11 could \nhave been prevented.\n  The Commission, in focusing public attention on the absolute \nnecessity to have one commander, has accomplished something which had \nnot been accomplished up until the present time. I served on the \nIntelligence Committee back in 1987, when we had the investigation of \nthe Iran Contra affair. At that time I introduced legislation for a \nnational intelligence director looking more to oversight at that time. \nIn 1996, when I was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \nintroduced legislation which would have provided budget and hiring \nauthority under the CIA Director. Technically, the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency has for some time--I believe going back to \n1947--the overall direction of the intelligence community. But without \nbudget authority and without hiring and firing, it has been virtually \nmeaningless. But in 1996, I proposed that legislation.\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\n  In 2002, we moved for the creation of an Office of Homeland Security. \nSenator Lieberman and I introduced, 30 days after 9/11, legislation to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security. But there were various \nobjections to it, and the issue was not taken up seriously until mid-\n2002. There was a real effort made in that legislation to have all of \nthe intelligence agencies under one command authority. The House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill in October and left town, which they do \nfrom time to time, leaving us with the option of either taking their \nbill or not having a bill until the following spring.\n  At that time I had an amendment prepared to give the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority to direct all of the other intelligence \nagencies. As I have said on the record before, and it is worth \nrepeating briefly, I had a conversation that afternoon with Secretary \nRidge who urged me not to offer the amendment. I told him I thought it \nhad to be done. And when I declined to accept his recommendations, I \ngot a call from Vice President Cheney who urged the same course. When I \nagain declined, I later talked to the President that afternoon and \ndecided that I would await a later date to press for having that \nauthority to direct. But this has been a gaping hole in \nthe intelligence apparatus forever.\n\n  The Scowcroft Commission filed a report, still in confidential form \nbut widely reputed to create an individual in charge of the overall \nintelligence agency. So, finally, we are coming to the point where we \nare thinking very seriously about having one person in charge, a \nnational director of intelligence, thanks to the focus of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  The Government Affairs Committee on which I serve, with the \nleadership of Senator Collins, the chairman of the committee, and \nSenator Lieberman, the ranking member, did something very unusual. We \nreturned in the first week of the recess on July 30 and held additional \nhearings. In reviewing the work of the 9/11 Commission at that time, I \nexpressed for the record and would repeat now briefly the concerns I \nhave about the so-called double hatting. The 9/11 Commission has \nrecommended that the counterintelligence unit, for example, of the FBI \nstay under the direction of the Director of the FBI but report also to \nthe national intelligence director so that the Director of the FBI \ncounterintelligence unit would be so-called double hatted.\n  Well, I do not think that can work under the very basic principle \nthat no one can serve two masters.\n  The same kind of concept is present on double hatting with the CIA \nDirector for the Department of Defense intelligence agencies. During \nthe course of the Governmental Affairs hearings, I asked Congressman \nLee Hamilton, cochairman of the 9/11 Commission, about the possibility \nof creating the director with a 10-year term, modeled after the FBI \nDirector, to be able to have someone who would outlast the tenure of \nPresidents. I think that is also a concept which ought to be \nincorporated.\n  When the Governmental Affairs Committee was considering this issue \nand legislation, I prepared a draft bill which I submitted to the \nmembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee back on August 3 of this \nyear.\n  I think it would be useful to put it into the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of that draft proposal be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. There are other proposals that have been made. The \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Roberts, has \nproposed legislation. So we have a great many ideas to choose from. As \nI sat at the Governmental Affairs hearing in early August, it was my \nhope that we would report out a bill early. I am pleased to say \nChairman Collins has listed a markup for the week of September 20th, so \nthat we should have a bill to present to the Senate early on. Then it \nis my hope we will act on this matter and act expeditiously. We have to \nget it right.\n  These are complicated matters. We have been studying them for a very \nlong time. We have been studying them, to my personal knowledge, going \nback to 1987 in legislation I introduced, and again in 1996, and with \nthe very extensive consideration of the legislation on homeland \nsecurity in 2002. So I think we are ready to move ahead and make the \nkinds of judgments that are tough decisions, but that is the pay grade \naround here. I think the time has come to act.\n  It may not be a perfect bill. I have been in the Senate for 24 years \nnow and I have not seen a perfect bill. The risks of inaction, in my \nview, are much greater than the risks of action. We know enough to make \na sound judgment as to how to put the entire intelligence community \nunder one umbrella.\n  I see my colleague Senator Bayh on the floor. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Timely and accurate information about the activities, \n     capabilities, plans, and intentions of foreign powers, \n     organizations, and persons, and their agents, is essential to \n     the national security of the United States. All reasonable \n     and lawful means must be used to ensure that the United \n     States receives the best intelligence available.\n       (2) The National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et \n     seq.) created a formal structure under an official who would \n     lead the Central Intelligence Agency and, in a separate role \n     as Director of Central Intelligence, the intelligence \n     community of the United States Government, and serve as the \n     principal adviser to the President on intelligence.\n       (3) Executive Order 12333 (December 4, 1981; 46 F.R. 59941) \n     states that ``the United States intelligence effort shall \n     provide the President and the National Security Council with \n     the necessary information on which to base decisions \n     concerning the conduct and development of foreign, defense \n     and economic policy and the protection of United States \n     national interests from foreign security threats. All \n     departments and agencies shall cooperate fully to fulfill \n     this goal''.\n       (4) The intelligence community of the United States is \n     supposed to function as a single corporate enterprise, \n     supporting those who manage the strategic interests of the \n     United States, whether political, economic, or military.\n       (5) The United States has suffered through an escalating \n     cycle of intelligence failures, especially since the end of \n     the Cold War, while witnessing the onset of new and emerging \n     global threats such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (6) The Director of Central Intelligence has no genuine \n     influence over elements of the intelligence community other \n     than the Central Intelligence Agency because, among other \n     things, the Director controls only a small portion of the \n     funds, personnel, and related assets of the intelligence \n     community. There is no structural mechanism to enforce the \n     mandate of Executive Order 12333 that all elements of the \n     intelligence community must fully cooperate with one another.\n       (7) As such, the existing intelligence structure is \n     dysfunctional, and not organized to effectively respond to \n     new and emerging threats. In fact, the intelligence apparatus \n     of the United States has for decades grown more cumbersome \n     and unaccountable and may now properly be characterized as a \n     Cold War model in an era of terrorism.\n       (8) The existing dysfunctional structure of the \n     intelligence community has severe consequences, as the \n     Director of Central Intelligence--or those ostensibly under \n     the Director's control--missed, ignored, or failed to connect \n     numerous warnings which could have averted the terrorist plot \n     of September 11, 2001. Similar errors may have caused the \n     Director to mislead the President on the nature of weapons of \n     mass destruction threats as the Administration weighed \n     military action against Iraq.\n       (9) Despite the best efforts of the Administration of \n     President George W. Bush, Congress, and the American people, \n     much of the dysfunction in the intelligence community--\n     including the lack of common terrorist watchlists and the \n     inability to detect and apprehend terrorists traveling in the \n     United States--has not been remedied in the three years since \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n       (10) The final report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, while making \n     certain recommendations on the restructuring of the \n     intelligence community to meet new and emerging terrorist \n     threats, leaves much discretion to Congress in determining \n     the scope and nature of the restructuring of the intelligence \n     community.\n       (11) President George W. Bush on August 2, 2004, \n     specifically requested that Congress create a national \n     intelligence director in a ``free-standing entity similar to \n     a cabinet agency or an agency'' and ``who will have a great \n     deal of budget authority'' and will have ``the same \n     relationship to the White House and the President that the \n     Secretary of Defense would have, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, [or] \n     the Secretary of the Treasury would have.'' The Executive \n     Orders issued on August 27, 2004, while properly focusing on \n     strengthened management of the intelligence community, \n     strengthening information sharing, and the creation of a \n     National Counterterrorism Center, also leaves a great deal of \n     discretion to Congress to codify these matters in law and \n     determine the scope and nature of the restructuring of the \n     intelligence community.\n       (12) To effectively counter the grave threat of \n     transnational terrorism, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \n     recently conceded, as he must, that ``strong, entrenched \n     agencies must be willing to give up some of their turf and \n     authority in exchange for a stronger, faster, more efficient, \n     government-wide effort''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide for fundamental reform of the intelligence \n     community of the United States Government involving a robust \n     Department of Intelligence and Director of Intelligence with \n     control over the budgets, personnel, and related assets of \n     the intelligence community.\n       (2) To compel the elements of the intelligence community to \n     work together to accomplish their common mission, much as the \n     Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of \n     1986 (Public Law 99-433) fostered ``jointness'' among the \n     various Armed Forces, in conformance with the requirements of \n     law and Executive orders.\n       (3) To facilitate the provision to the President and the \n     National Security Council of the necessary information on \n     which to base decisions concerning the development and \n     conduct of foreign policy, defense policy, and economic \n     policy, and the protection of United States national \n     interests from security threats, including threats related to \n     transnational terrorism.\n       (4) To ensure that all means, consistent with United States \n     laws, Executive orders, and regulations and with full \n     consideration of the rights of United States persons, are \n     used to develop intelligence for the President and the \n     National Security Council.\n       (5) To create a structure for the intelligence community \n     that will better serve the President in his duty under the \n     Constitution of the United States to protect the security of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to join my esteemed \ncolleague Senator Specter from Pennsylvania and Senators Lieberman and \nMcCain in this effort to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations \nto defend our country.\n  This is a bipartisan undertaking. We have proven we can rise above \npartisan politics. It remains to be seen whether we can rise above the \nbureaucratic inertia, gridlock, and turf jealousy that all too often \nafflict the Federal Government. I believe we must and I believe we can, \nif we are to uphold the weighty responsibility placed on us by our \nfellow American citizens.\n  The most important thing we can bring to this task is a sense of \nurgency. What began as a wake-up call on September 11 may not be \nanswered following this November 2, unless we maintain the momentum \ngenerated by the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. All too often \nthe country's attention, this body's attention, can be diverted into \nother arenas, keeping us from taking a difficult but necessary action \nthat sustained focus and attention can achieve.\n  So I am very insistent that we regain the momentum, bring a sense of \nurgency and purpose to this calling, because it is what will be \nnecessary to break down some of the barriers that too often in the past \nhave kept us from doing what we now know to be important in terms of \ndefending this country.\n  Our proposal is the most comprehensive one before the Congress. It \naddresses not only identifying and cracking down on terrorists who \nwould threaten to do harm to the American people; it is also the only \nproposal that deals with the causes--the environment that gives rise to \nthose violent individuals in the first place. We have to do both. If \nthere is one thing I am absolutely certain of, it is no matter what \nresources, focus, and new structure we bring to the challenge of \ndefending our country, we will not be able to identify and bring to \njustice every individual who wishes us harm. We have to prevent them \nfrom being created in the first place. We need to do both. That is what \nthis calls for.\n  We emphasize accountability and this is vitally important. If you \nlook at the failings that occurred before 9/11, and at some of the \nweaknesses exposed by the search for weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq, you can see there were some significant problems with our \nintelligence system. Yet, as far as I know, no individual has been \nadmonished, no individual has been demoted, no individual has been \nfired. George Tenet fell on his sword and took responsibility. But as \nfar as I know, that is as far as it goes.\n  Is this the best we can do in terms of having a structure that \nassigns missions and holds people accountable for successfully \nfulfilling them? I don't believe it is. This proposal we have placed \nbefore this Congress insists upon clearly delineated lines of \nauthority, holds people clearly accountable for carrying out tasks, \nwith consequences that will be easier to impose if people do not do the \njob we have a right to expect of them. If I were the President asking \nwho was responsible or in charge or accountable for this, you would \nhave a half dozen different individuals. But the only individual you \ncan look at and say this person is in charge of a national \nsecurity apparatus in this country is the President himself.\n\n  Well, that is not good enough because with all the President has to \nbe responsible for, he needs to have someone subordinate to him, who is \nclearly identifiable, to bring coherence and accountability to the \nnational security apparatus. That is what our proposal would put into \nplace.\n  Finally, let me say two things. We need to increase the amount of \ninformation available to our country in order to provide for our \ndefense. No matter what structure we provide, no matter how \ncomprehensive or how much we emphasize accountability, we simply need \nto know more about dangerous individuals, dangerous places, and what \nthey are doing in an attempt to harm America. There are glaring blind \nspots today, when it comes to intelligence, that will make us unable to \ndefend our country. We are in the process of trying to correct some of \nthose blind spots, but more needs to be done.\n  This report focuses like a laser, particularly on improving the level \nof human intelligence that will augment our technology, and other \nsources at our disposal to provide for the common defense.\n  In conclusion, let me say this. I am reminded of the old adage, \n``Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.'' It is no \nlonger possible to deny there are glaring weaknesses in the national \nsecurity intelligence apparatus that sprung up following World War II. \nIt was designed for a different time and a different challenge. We must \nseize this opportunity and put into place truly transformational change \nthat will enable us to defend our country against the threats of the \n21st century, not those that threatened us in the recent past.\n  Those who would temporize, equivocate, and those who would unduly \ncompromise will bear a very heavy burden indeed should another tragedy \nstrike this country. Now is the time for bold action. Now is the time \nto put aside the bureaucratic turf jealousies, inertia, and divisions \nthat afflict the Congress and the executive branch and unite \npolitically, unite across branches of Government, unite in a common \npurpose of truly bold reform and change, so that those who follow in \nour footsteps will know we have done everything humanly possible to \nprotect this country.\n  Some of the sacrifices need to start with this Congress. Too often \npeople have committee jealousies and they want to protect turf. We need \nto put that aside and unite as one people, one Congress, to protect \nthis Nation. That is what this legislation does. So I am pleased to \njoin with my colleagues in a bipartisan spirit to move the intelligence \nsystem forward and defend America.\n  I will conclude with a saying I once read. I am a member of the \nIntelligence Committee. At one of the briefings, we got what was \nactually a cover sheet of the budget for the intelligence community a \ncouple of years ago. The budget is classified, but this is not. It was \na quote from Napoleon Bonaparte, which I found interesting. Napoleon \nBonaparte once said ``a well-placed spy is worth at least two \ndivisions.'' Well, today a well-placed spy and access to timely, \naccurate information could be worth two American cities; it could mean \nthe difference between hundreds of thousands of lives saved or lost.\n  Let us not get embroiled in political, bureaucratic, or other \ndisputes when the fate of our Nation hangs in the balance. Now is the \ntime to act. I am honored to join with my colleagues in proposing that \nwe do exactly that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Central Intelligence Agency \n     should retain responsibility for the direction and execution \n     of clandestine and covert operations. The Central \n     Intelligence Agency should also concentrate on building \n     capabilities to carry out such operations and on providing \n     personnel who will be directing and executing such operations \n     in the field.\n       (2) The reconstitution of the analytic and human \n     intelligence collection capabilities of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency requires the undiverted attention of the \n     head of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n       (b) Transformation of Central Intelligence Agency.--The \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall transform \n     the intelligence and intelligence-related capabilities of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency by--\n       (1) building the human intelligence capabilities of the \n     clandestine service;\n       (2) building the analytic capabilities of the Agency;\n       (3) developing a stronger language program;\n       (4) renewing emphasis on the recruitment of operations \n     officers of diverse background who can blend in more easily \n     in foreign cities;\n       (5) ensuring a seamless relationship between human source \n     collection and signals collection at the operational level; \n     and\n       (6) providing for a better balance between unilateral \n     operations and liaison operations.\n       (c) Retention of Responsibility for Clandestine and Covert \n     Operations.--The Central Intelligence Agency shall retain \n     responsibility for the direction and execution of clandestine \n     and covert operations as authorized by the President or the \n     National Intelligence Director and assigned by a national \n     intelligence center.\n\n     SEC. 164.

INFORMATION SHARING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n       (1) Network.--The term ``Network'' means the Information \n     Sharing Network described in subsection (c).\n       (2) Terrorism information.--The term ``terrorism \n     information'' means all information, whether collected, \n     produced, or distributed by intelligence, law enforcement, \n     military, homeland security, or other activities, relating \n     to--\n       (A) the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, \n     intentions, vulnerabilities, means of finance or material \n     support, or activities of foreign or international terrorist \n     groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or individuals \n     involved in transnational terrorism;\n       (B) threats posed by such groups or individuals to the \n     United States, United States persons, or United States \n     interests, or to those of other nations;\n       (C) communications of or by such groups or individuals; or\n       (D) information relating to groups or individuals \n     reasonably believed to be assisting or associated with such \n     groups or individuals.\n       (b) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The effective use of information, from all available \n     sources, is essential to the fight against terror and the \n     protection of our homeland. The biggest impediment to all-\n     source analysis, and to a greater likelihood of ``connecting \n     the dots'', is resistance to sharing information.\n       (2) The United States Government has access to a vast \n     amount of information, including not only traditional \n     intelligence but also other government databases, such as \n     those containing customs or immigration information. But the \n     United States Government has a weak system for processing and \n     using the information it has.\n       (3) In the period leading up to September 11, 2001, there \n     were instances of potentially helpful information that was \n     available but that no person knew to ask for; information \n     that was distributed only in compartmented channels; and \n     information that was requested but could not be shared.\n       (4) Current security requirements nurture \n     overclassification and excessive compartmentalization of \n     information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure \n     opposes sharing, with risks, including criminal, civil, and \n     administrative sanctions, but few rewards for sharing \n     information.\n       (5) The current system, in which each intelligence agency \n     has its own security practices, requires a demonstrated \n     ``need to know'' before sharing. This approach assumes that \n     it is possible to know, in advance, who will need to use the \n     information. An outgrowth of the cold war, such a system \n     implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure \n     outweighs the benefits of wider sharing. Such assumptions are \n     no longer appropriate. Although counterintelligence concerns \n     are still real, the costs of not sharing information are also \n     substantial. The current ``need-to-know'' culture of \n     information protection needs to be replaced with a ``need-to-\n     share'' culture of integration.\n       (6) A new approach to the sharing of terrorism information \n     is urgently needed. An important conceptual model for a new \n     ``trusted information network'' is the Systemwide Homeland \n     Analysis and Resource Exchange (SHARE) Network proposed by a \n     task force of leading professionals assembled by the Markle \n     Foundation and described in reports issued in October 2002 \n     and December 2003.\n       (7) No single agency can create a meaningful information \n     sharing system on its own. Alone, each agency can only \n     modernize stovepipes, not replace them. Presidential \n     leadership is required to bring about governmentwide change.\n       (c) Information Sharing Network.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish an \n     information sharing network to promote the sharing of \n     terrorism information, in a manner consistent with national \n     security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n       (2) Attributes.--The Network shall promote coordination, \n     communication and collaboration of people and information \n     among all relevant Federal departments and agencies, State, \n     tribal, and local authorities, and relevant private sector \n     entities, including owners and operators of critical \n     infrastructure, by using policy guidelines and technologies \n     that support--\n       (A) a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated \n     environment that connects existing systems where appropriate \n     and allows users to share information horizontally across \n     agencies, vertically between levels of government, and, as \n     appropriate, with the private sector;\n       (B) building on existing systems capabilities at relevant \n     agencies;\n       (C) utilizing industry best practices, including minimizing \n     the centralization of data and seeking to use common tools \n     and capabilities whenever possible;\n       (D) employing an information rights management approach \n     that controls access to data rather than to whole networks;\n       (E) facilitating the sharing of information at and across \n     all levels of security by using policy guidelines and \n     technologies that support writing information that can be \n     broadly shared;\n       (F) providing directory services for locating people and \n     information;\n       (G) incorporating protections for individuals' privacy and \n     civil liberties;\n       (H) incorporating mechanisms for information security; and\n       (I) access controls, authentication and authorization, \n     audits, and other strong mechanisms for information security \n     and privacy guideline enforcement across all levels of \n     security, in order to enhance accountability and facilitate \n     oversight.\n       (d) Immediate Steps.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the President, through the Director \n     of Management and Budget and in consultation with the \n     National Intelligence Director, the Attorney General, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of State, the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Director of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, and such other Federal officials as the President \n     shall designate, shall--\n       (1) establish electronic directory services to assist in \n     locating in the Federal Government terrorism information and \n     people with relevant knowledge about terrorism information; \n     and\n       (2) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency \n     capabilities, including a baseline inventory of current \n     Federal systems that contain terrorism information, the money \n     currently spent to maintain those systems, and identification \n     of other information that should be included in the Network.\n       (e) Guidelines.--As soon as possible, but in no event later \n     than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall--\n       (1) in consultation with the National Intelligence Director \n     and the Advisory Council on Information Sharing established \n     in subsection (g), issue guidelines for acquiring, accessing, \n     sharing, and using terrorism information, including \n     guidelines to ensure such information is provided in its most \n     shareable form, such as by separating out data from the \n     sources and methods by which they are obtained;\n       (2) in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board established under section 901, issue \n     guidelines that--\n       (A) protect privacy and civil liberties in the development \n     and use of the Network; and\n       (B) shall be made public, unless, and only to the extent \n     that, nondisclosure is clearly necessary to protect national \n     security;\n       (3) establish objective, systemwide performance measures to \n     enable the assessment of progress toward achieving full \n     implementation of the Network; and\n       (4) require Federal departments and agencies to promote a \n     culture of information sharing by--\n       (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing, \n     including overclassification of information and unnecessary \n     requirements for originator approval; and\n       (B) providing affirmative incentives for information \n     sharing, such as the incorporation of information sharing \n     performance measures into agency and managerial evaluations, \n     and employee awards for promoting innovative information \n     sharing practices.\n       (f) System Design and Implementation Plan.--Not later than \n     270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a system design and \n     implementation plan for the Network. The plan shall be \n     prepared by the President through the Director of Management \n     and Budget and in consultation with the National Intelligence \n     Director, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and such other \n     Federal officials as the President shall designate, and shall \n     include--\n       (1) a description of the parameters of the proposed \n     Network, including functions, capabilities, and resources;\n       (2) a description of the technological, legal, and policy \n     issues presented by the creation of the Network described in \n     subsection (c), and the ways in which these issues will be \n     addressed;\n       (3)(A) a delineation of the roles of the Federal \n     departments and agencies that will participate in the \n     development of the Network, including--\n       (i) identification of any agency that will build the \n     infrastructure needed to operate and manage the Network (as \n     distinct from the individual agency components that are to be \n     part of the Network); and\n       (ii) identification of any agency that will operate and \n     manage the Network (as distinct from the individual agency \n     components that are to be part of the Network);\n       (B) a provision that the delineation of roles under \n     subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) be consistent with the authority of the National \n     Intelligence Director, under this Act, to set standards for \n     information sharing and information technology throughout the \n     intelligence community; and\n       (ii) recognize the role of the Department of Homeland \n     Security in coordinating with State, tribal, and local \n     officials and the private sector;\n       (4) a description of the technological requirements to \n     appropriately link and enhance existing networks and a \n     description of the system design that will meet these \n     requirements;\n       (5) a plan, including a time line, for the development and \n     phased implementation of the Network;\n       (6) total budget requirements to develop and implement the \n     Network, including the estimated annual cost for each of the \n     5 years following the date of enactment of this Act; and\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\n       (7) proposals for any legislation that the President \n     believes necessary to implement the Network.\n       (g) Advisory Council on Information Sharing.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established an Advisory \n     Council on Information Sharing (in this subsection referred \n     to as the ``Council'').\n       (2) Membership.--No more than 25 individuals may serve as \n     members of the Council, which shall include--\n       (A) the National Intelligence Director, who shall serve as \n     Chairman of the Council;\n       (B) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n       (C) the Secretary of Defense;\n       (D) the Attorney General;\n       (E) the Secretary of State;\n       (F) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency;\n       (G) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       (H) the Director of Management and Budget;\n       (I) such other Federal officials as the President shall \n     designate;\n       (J) representatives of State, tribal, and local \n     governments, to be appointed by the President;\n       (K) individuals from outside government with expertise in \n     relevant technology, security and privacy concepts, to be \n     appointed by the President; and\n       (L) individuals who are employed in private businesses or \n     nonprofit organizations that own or operate critical \n     infrastructure, to be appointed by the President.\n       (3) Responsibilities.--The Council shall--\n       (A) advise the President and the heads of relevant Federal \n     departments and agencies on the implementation of the \n     Network;\n       (B) ensure that there is coordination among participants in \n     the Network in the development and implementation of the \n     Network;\n       (C) review, on an ongoing basis, policy, legal and \n     technology issues related to the implementation of the \n     Network; and\n       (D) establish a dispute resolution process to resolve \n     disagreements among departments and agencies about whether \n     particular terrorism information should be shared and in what \n     manner.\n       (4) Inapplicability of Federal Advisory Committee Act.--The \n     Council shall not be subject to the requirements of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Consistent with the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) The American people are not served well by current \n     congressional rules and resolutions governing intelligence \n     and homeland security oversight.\n       (2) A unified Executive Branch effort on fighting terrorism \n     will not be effective unless it is matched by a unified \n     effort in Congress, specifically a strong, stable, and \n     capable congressional committee structure to give the \n     intelligence agencies and Department of Homeland Security \n     sound oversight, support, and leadership.\n       (3) The intelligence committees of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives are not organized to provide strong \n     leadership and oversight for intelligence and \n     counterterrorism.\n       (4) Jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security, \n     which is scattered among many committees in each chamber, \n     does not allow for the clear authority and responsibility \n     needed for effective congressional oversight.\n       (5) Congress should either create a new, joint Senate-House \n     intelligence authorizing committee modeled on the former \n     Joint\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n     Committee on Atomic Energy, or establish new intelligence \n     committees in each chamber with combined authorization and \n     appropriations authority.\n       (6) Congress should establish a single, principal point of \n     oversight and review in each chamber for the Department of \n     Homeland Security and the report of the National Commission \n     on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States stated that \n     ``Congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee \n     should have jurisdiction over this department and its \n     duties.''.\n       (7) In August 2004, the joint Senate leadership created a \n     bipartisan working group to examine how best to implement the \n     Commission's recommendations with respect to reform of the \n     Senate's oversight of intelligence and homeland security, and \n     directed the working group to begin its work immediately and \n     to present its findings and recommendations to Senate \n     leadership as expeditiously as possible.\n\n     SEC. 302. REORGANIZATION OF CONGRESSIONAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       The 108th Congress shall not adjourn until each House of \n     Congress has adopted the necessary changes to its rules such \n     that, effective the start of the 109th Congress--\n       (1) jurisdiction over proposed legislation, messages, \n     petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the \n     Department of Homeland Security shall be consolidated in a \n     single committee in each House and such committee shall have \n     a nonpartisan staff; and\n       (2) jurisdiction over proposed legislation, messages, \n     petitions, memorials, and other matters related to \n     intelligence shall reside in--\n       (A) either a joint Senate-House authorizing committee \n     modeled on the former Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, or a \n     committee in each chamber with combined authorization and \n     appropriations authority; and\n       (B) regardless of which committee structure is selected, \n     the intelligence committee or committees shall have--\n       (i) not more than 9 members in each House, who shall serve \n     without term limits and of which at least 1 each shall also \n     serve on a committee on Armed Services, Judiciary, and \n     Foreign Affairs and at least 1 on a Defense Appropriations \n     subcommittee;\n       (ii) authority to issue subpoenas;\n       (iii) majority party representation that does not exceed \n     minority party representation by more than 1 member in each \n     House, and a nonpartisan staff; and\n       (iv) a subcommittee devoted solely to oversight.\n\n                   TITLE IV--PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION\n\n     SEC. 401. PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION.\n\n       (a) Services Provided President-Elect.--Section 3 of the \n     Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding after subsection (a)(8)(A)(iv) the following:\n       ``(v) Activities under this paragraph shall include the \n     preparation of a detailed classified, compartmented summary \n     by the relevant outgoing executive branch officials of \n     specific operational threats to national security; major \n     military or covert operations; and pending decisions on \n     possible uses of military force. This summary shall be \n     provided to the President-elect as soon as possible after the \n     date of the general elections held to determine the electors \n     of President and Vice President under section 1 or 2 of title \n     3, United States Code.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g);

REPORT ON THE USE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO COMBAT \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While terrorism is not caused by poverty, breeding \n     grounds for terrorism are created by backward economic \n     policies and repressive political regimes.\n       (2) Policies that support economic development and reform \n     also have political implications, as economic and political \n     liberties are often linked.\n       (3) The United States is working toward creating a Middle \n     East Free Trade Area by 2013 and implementing a free trade \n     agreement with Bahrain, and free trade agreements exist \n     between the United States and Israel and the United States \n     and Jordan.\n       (4) Existing and proposed free trade agreements between the \n     United States and Islamic countries are drawing interest from \n     other countries in the Middle East region, and Islamic \n     countries can become full participants in the rules-based \n     global trading system, as the United States considers \n     lowering its barriers to trade with the poorest Arab \n     countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a comprehensive United States strategy to counter \n     terrorism should include economic policies that encourage \n     development, open societies, and opportunities for people to \n     improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects \n     for their children's future;\n       (2) 1 element of such a strategy should encompass the \n     lowering of trade barriers with the poorest countries that \n     have a significant population of Arab or Muslim individuals;\n       (3) another element of such a strategy should encompass \n     United States efforts to promote economic reform in countries \n     that have a significant population of Arab or Muslim \n     individuals, including efforts to integrate such countries \n     into the global trading system; and\n       (4) given the importance of the rule of law in promoting \n     economic development and attracting investment, the United \n     States should devote an increased proportion of its \n     assistance to countries in the Middle East to the promotion \n     of the rule of law.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the efforts of the United States \n     Government to encourage development and promote economic \n     reform in countries that have a significant population of \n     Arab or Muslim individuals.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under this subsection \n     shall describe--\n       (A) efforts to integrate countries with significant \n     populations of Arab or Muslim individuals into the global \n     trading system; and\n       (B) actions that the United States Government, acting alone \n     and in partnership with other governments in the Middle East, \n     can take to promote intra-regional trade and the rule of law \n     in the region.\n\n     SEC. 511. MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for fiscal year 2005 $200,000,000 for the \n     Middle East Partnership Initiative.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     given the importance of the rule of law and economic reform \n     to development in the Middle East, a significant portion of \n     the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) \n     should be made available to promote the rule of law in the \n     Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 512. COMPREHENSIVE COALITION STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of \n     the United States relies on international cooperation.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of \n     United States Government contacts with foreign governments \n     concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but \n     such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a \n     comprehensive and unified approach.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n       (b) International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President--\n       (A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of \n     other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and \n     uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop \n     with those other governments a comprehensive coalition \n     strategy to fight Islamist terrorism; and\n       (B) to that end, should seek to establish an international \n     counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of \n     governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism \n     efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim \n     populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international \n     means for discussing and coordinating the development of \n     important counterterrorism policies by the participating \n     governments.\n       (2) Authority.--The President is authorized to establish an \n     international counterterrorism policy contact group with the \n     leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for \n     purposes as follows:\n       (A) To develop in common with such other countries \n     important policies and a strategy that address the various \n     components of international prosecution of the war on \n     terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address \n     military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, \n     and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to \n     interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-\n     related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating \n     to terrorist sanctuaries.\n       (B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President \n     and leaders of other participating governments determine \n     appropriate, such long-term issues as economic and political \n     reforms that can contribute to strengthening stability and \n     security in the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 513. DETENTION AND HUMANE TREATMENT OF CAPTURED \n                   TERRORISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Carrying out the global war on terrorism requires the \n     development of policies with respect to the detention and \n     treatment of captured international terrorists that is \n     adhered to by all coalition forces.\n       (2) Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment \n     of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3316) was specifically designed for cases in which the usual \n     rules of war do not apply, and the minimum standards of \n     treatment pursuant to such Article are generally accepted \n     throughout the world as customary international law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.--\n     The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment \n     or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, \n     or 14th amendment to the Constitution.\n       (2) Geneva conventions.--The term ``Geneva Conventions'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at \n     Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);\n       (B) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at \n     Sea, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);\n       (C) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners \n     of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n       (D) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3516).\n       (3) Prisoner.--The term ``prisoner'' means a foreign \n     individual captured, detained, interned, or otherwise held in \n     the custody of the United States.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       (5) Torture.--The term ``torture'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should engage countries that are \n     participating in the coalition to fight terrorism to develop \n     a common approach toward the detention and humane treatment \n     of captured international terrorists; and\n       (2) an approach toward the detention and humane treatment \n     of captured international terrorists developed by the \n     countries participating in the coalition to fight terrorism \n     could draw upon Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the \n     Treatment of Prisoners of War, the principles of which are \n     commonly accepted as minimum basic standards for humane \n     treatment of captured individuals.\n       (d) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to treat any prisoner humanely and in accordance with \n     standards that the Government of the United States would \n     determine to be consistent with international law if such \n     standards were applied to personnel of the United States \n     captured by an enemy in the war on terrorism;\n       (2) if there is any doubt as to whether a prisoner is \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, to provide the prisoner such protections until \n     the status of the prisoner is determined under the procedures \n     authorized by paragraph 1-6 of Army Regulation 190-8 (1997); \n     and\n       (3) to expeditiously prosecute cases of terrorism or other \n     criminal acts alleged to have been committed by prisoners in \n     the custody of the United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, in order to avoid the indefinite detention of such \n     prisoners.\n       (e) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment.--\n       (1) In general.--No prisoner shall be subject to torture or \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is \n     prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Relationship to geneva conventions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the status of any person under the \n     Geneva Conventions or whether any person is entitled to the \n     protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n       (f) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe the \n     rules, regulations, or guidelines necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the prohibition in subsection (e)(1) by the \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States and by any \n     person providing services to the Department of Defense on a \n     contract basis.\n       (2) Report to congress.--The Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress the rules, regulations, or guidelines prescribed \n     under paragraph (1), and any modifications to such rules, \n     regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications; and\n       (B) in a manner and form that will protect the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (g) Report on Possible Violations.--\n       (1) Requirement.--The Secretary shall submit, on a timely \n     basis and not less than twice each year, a report to Congress \n     on the circumstances surrounding any investigation of a \n     possible violation of the prohibition in subsection (e)(1) by \n     a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or by a \n     person providing services to the Department of Defense on a \n     contract basis.\n       (2) Form of report.--A report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in a manner and form that--\n       (A) will protect the national security interests of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) will not prejudice any prosecution of an individual \n     involved in, or responsible for, a violation of the \n     prohibition in subsection (e)(1).\n       (h) Report on a Coalition Approach Toward the Detention and \n     Humane Treatment of Captured Terrorists.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     efforts of the United States Government to develop an \n     approach toward the detention and humane treatment of \n     captured international terrorists that will be adhered to by \n     all countries that are members of the coalition against \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 514. PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make weapons of mass \n     destruction since 1994 or earlier.\n       (2) The United States doubtless would be a prime target for \n     use of any such weapon by al Qaeda.\n       (3) Although the United States Government has redoubled its \n     international commitments to supporting the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs, nonproliferation experts continue to \n     express deep concern about the United States Government's \n     commitment and approach to securing the weapons of mass \n     destruction and related highly dangerous materials that are \n     still scattered among Russia and other countries of the \n     former Soviet Union.\n       (4) The cost of increased investment in the prevention of \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     dangerous materials is greatly outweighed by the potentially \n     catastrophic cost to the United States of use of weapons of \n     mass destruction or related dangerous materials by the \n     terrorists who are so eager to acquire them.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) maximum effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, wherever such proliferation may occur, \n     is warranted; and\n       (2) the programs of the United States Government to prevent \n     or counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     including the Proliferation Security Initiative, the programs \n     for Cooperative Threat Reduction, and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs, should be expanded, improved, and better \n     funded to address the global dimensions of the proliferation \n     threat.\n       (c) Requirement for Strategy.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress--\n       (1) a strategy for expanding and strengthening the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative, the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction, and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs; and\n       (2) an estimate of the funding necessary to execute that \n     strategy.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n       (d) Report on Reforming the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     Program and Other Non-Proliferation Assistance Programs.--Not \n     later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report \n     evaluating whether the United States could more effectively \n     address the global threat of nuclear proliferation by--\n       (1) establishing a central coordinator for the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction;\n       (2) eliminating the requirement that the President spend no \n     more than $50,000,000 annually on programs for Cooperative \n     Threat Reduction and other non-proliferation assistance \n     programs carried out outside the former Soviet Union; or\n       (3) repealing the provisions of the Soviet Nuclear Threat \n     Reduction Act of 1991 (22 U.S.C. 2551 note) that place \n     conditions on assistance to the former Soviet Union unrelated \n     to bilateral cooperation on weapons dismantlement.\n\n     SEC. 515. FINANCING OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While efforts to designate and freeze the assets of \n     terrorist financiers have been relatively unsuccessful, \n     efforts to target the relatively small number of al Qaeda \n     financial facilitators have been valuable and successful.\n       (2) The death or capture of several important financial \n     facilitators has decreased the amount of money available to \n     al Qaeda, and has made it more difficult for al Qaeda to \n     raise and move money.\n       (3) The capture of al Qaeda financial facilitators has \n     provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to \n     continue the cycle of disruption.\n       (4) The United States Government has rightly recognized \n     that information about terrorist money helps in understanding \n     terror networks, searching them out, and disrupting their \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the primary weapon in the effort to stop terrorist \n     financing should be the targeting of terrorist financial \n     facilitators by intelligence and law enforcement agencies; \n     and\n       (2) efforts to track terrorist financing must be paramount \n     in United States counter-terrorism efforts.\n       (c) Report on Terrorist Financing.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report evaluating the effectiveness of United \n     States efforts to curtail the international financing of \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     evaluate and make recommendations on--\n       (A) the effectiveness of efforts and methods to track \n     terrorist financing;\n       (B) ways to improve international governmental cooperation \n     in this effort;\n       (C) ways to improve performance of financial institutions \n     in this effort;\n       (D) the adequacy of agency coordination in this effort and \n     ways to improve that coordination; and\n       (E) recommendations for changes in law and additional \n     resources required to improve this effort.\n\n           TITLE VI--TERRORIST TRAVEL AND EFFECTIVE SCREENING\n\n     SEC. 601. COUNTERTERRORIST TRAVEL INTELLIGENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as \n     weapons since terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, \n     train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack sites.\n       (2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists \n     because they must surface to pass through regulated channels, \n     present themselves to border security officials, or attempt \n     to circumvent inspection points.\n       (3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to \n     travel, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, \n     specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt \n     government officials, human smuggling networks, supportive \n     travel agencies, and immigration and identity fraud.\n       (4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency \n     systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies. If an \n     agency had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways \n     in which the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been \n     systematically, but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our \n     border security since the early 1990s.\n       (5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to \n     interception by border authorities. Analyzing their \n     characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could \n     have allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers \n     and a more effective use of information available in \n     Government databases could have identified some of the \n     hijackers.\n       (6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the \n     aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting \n     against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and \n     opportunities.\n       (7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since \n     September 11, 2001, have not been adequately integrated into \n     the front lines of border security.\n       (8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence \n     collection and analysis program currently in place has \n     produced useful results and should be expanded.\n       (b) Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to Congress unclassified and classified versions \n     of a strategy for combining terrorist travel intelligence, \n     operations, and law enforcement into a cohesive effort to \n     intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and \n     constrain terrorist mobility domestically and \n     internationally.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry \nout a program of outreach to veterans of World War II and the Korean \nconflict on the nature and availability of benefits for veterans, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today which would direct the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) to provide a new, targeted program of outreach to \nveterans of World War II and the Korean conflict. The purpose of the \nprogram would be to inform these veterans, most of whom are now over \nthe age of 70, of the veterans benefits to which they may be entitled, \nand to encourage them to apply for those benefits. The center piece of \nthe new outreach program would be a $35 million nationwide public \nservice announcement campaign through various print, radio, and \ntelevision media outlets. I believe such a campaign would be the most \neffective, and efficient, way to ``get the word out'' about VA benefits \nand services, but my legislation gives VA flexibility to devise other \nmeans if appropriate.\n  I am concerned that there are a number of older veterans who served \nduring World War II and the Korean conflict, and who are entitled to \nbenefits from VA, are simply not aware of that fact. A recent article \nin the Philadelphia Inquirer told the story of a World War II veteran \nfrom Missouri who filed a claim for benefits in 1947 for a cold-weather \ninjury suffered while wading through an icy French harbor. The claim \nwas denied, but because of intensive outreach conducted the State of \nMissouri over 50 years later, the veteran recently was awarded 100 \npercent disability compensation. The same article cities survey data \nfrom VA which suggest that over one-half million veterans might be \neligible for VA compensation benefits--if only they would file claims. \nA similar inference can be drawn from data from the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration Fiscal year 2003 Annual Benefits Report which show that \neven though veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict comprise \n31.6 percent of the total veteran population, only 23.2 percent of the \ntotal number of veterans actually receiving VA disability compensation \nare veterans of WWII and the Korean conflict. Further, it is a fact \nthat Korean conflict and World War II veterans who are receiving \ncompensation are compensated for fewer disabilities, on average, than \nare later generations of veterans.\n  I suspect that one reason for these discrepancies might be found in \nthe fact that VA and the Department of Defense (DoD) now do a far \nbetter job than in prior years of educating service members of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. This year, VA compiled a report on \nits outreach activities--a report that was requested by Senator Russ \nFeingold and me--which outlines at great length programs--all laudable \nprograms--of outreach specifically targeting service members and \nveterans recently discharged from service. For example, VA has a \npresence at 136 military installations which enables service members to \nreceive complete medical examinations and disability ratings prior to \ndischarge from service. VA and DoD also cooperate in providing \nintensive transition workshops for departing service members. I commend \nboth VA and DoD for their outreach activities, particularly for such \nactivities that target service members returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Clearly, VA and DoD have made great strides in informing \nservice members and veterans of their benefits at the point in their \nlives when such information is most useful, namely, at discharge from \nservice. However, the intensity and breadth of outreach activities that \nare now the norm for the current generation of newly discharged \nveterans simply were not undertaken when World War II and Korean \nconflict veterans left service.\n  The Nation recently honored the World War II generation with the \ndedication of the World War II Memorial in Washington, and with \ncelebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. Just \nlast year, we marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the Korean \nconflict. While the fan fare surrounding these events has waned, our \nefforts on behalf of veterans of these wars must not. It is imperative \nwe make final attempts to let them, and their families, known of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. The legislation provides a first \nstep to that end. I ask my colleagues for their support, and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROGRAM OF OUTREACH TO VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II \n                   AND KOREAN CONFLICT ON VETERANS BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict \n     represent 31.6 percent of the current population of veterans. \n     However, veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict \n     represent only 23.2 percent of the total number of veterans \n     currently receiving disability compensation from the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (2) Veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict who \n     receive disability compensation have, on average, 1.94 and \n     2.12 disabilities per veteran, respectively, whereas veterans \n     of the Vietnam era and the Persian Gulf War who receive \n     disability compensation have, on average, 2.88 and 3.48 \n     disabilities per veteran, respectively.\n       (3) Advances in medical science and technology have \n     improved the understanding of the origins of diseases and \n     disabilities which are associated with military service, \n     including diseases and disabilities that manifest long after \n     the completion of military service.\n       (4) Unlike veterans of later periods, veterans of World War \n     II and the Korean conflict did not have the benefit of \n     extensive transition assistance and outreach services now \n     routinely provided by the Department and other government \n     agencies.\n       (5) Veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict are \n     dying at the aggregate rate of 1,400 per day.\n       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the Secretary \n     make every effort to inform veterans of World War II and the \n     Korean conflict of the benefits to which they may be \n     entitled.\n       (b) Outreach.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     carry out a program to provide outreach to veterans of World \n     War II and of the Korean conflict on the nature and \n     availability of benefits for veterans.\n       (2) The purpose of the program is to make veterans of World \n     War II and of the Korean conflict aware of the veterans \n     benefits to which they may be entitled and to encourage such \n     veterans to apply for such benefits.\n       (3)(A) The program shall include a nationwide public \n     service campaign consisting of such elements, and appearing \n     in and through such media, as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate for the program.\n       (B) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     subsection (e) for the program, $35,000,000 shall be \n     available for the public service campaign described in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (4) As part of the program, the Secretary shall establish \n     performance measures for the outreach under the program to \n     permit the on-going evaluation of the extent and success of \n     the outreach under the program.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 24 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the program under this section. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the program, including a detailed \n     description of the outreach conducted under the program.\n       (2) A statement of the amount expended on the program.\n       (3) An assessment of the effectiveness of the program.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``World War \n     II'' and ``Korean conflict'' have the meanings given such \n     terms in section 101 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/07/senate-section/article/S8864-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8864-S8916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bayh, \n        Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2774. A bill to implement the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, and for other \npurposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this week marks the third anniversary of \nthat terrible day in 2001 when terrorists attacked America's commercial \nand governmental capitals. On that occasion, in the largest attack ever \non American soil, 2,973 innocent individuals lost their lives. The \nvictimization of America went beyond this astounding number, with \nphysical injuries to many, damage to our Nation's economy, and \npsychological trauma among millions who witnessed these shocking \nevents.\n  While nothing we do can erase this pain, we can honor and pay tribute \nto those who have suffered by ensuring that terrorists never again \nattack our land. We have come a long way since 2001 in enhancing this \ncountry's ability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, but, as \nthe 9/11 Commission said in its final report, we are not yet safe. \nIncreasing our safety against terrorist attack requires new strategies, \nnew ways of thinking, and new ways of organizing our government.\n  Today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman, Specter, Bayh, \nGraham of South Carolina, Daschle, and Clinton in introducing \nlegislation designed to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \nwhich were issued just prior to the August recess. Governor Tom Kean \nand Representative Lee Hamilton have endorsed this bill, and assured us \nthat it accurately reflects the Commission's intent.\n  With the introduction of this bill, the Senate now has before it \nlegislation that addresses each of the Commission's 41 recommendations, \nwhich together are designed to build unity of effort across the U.S. \nGovernment--all in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks. The \nprovisions of this bill outline the shape and objectives of a global \ncounterterrorism strategy, and suggest a reconfiguration of our \nnational security and homeland security apparatus within the U.S. \nGovernment. As anyone who reads the legislation will quickly see, it \nalso cuts across jurisdictional lines with respect to the Senate \ncommittee prerogatives. There are portions of this bill that deal with \nintelligence, foreign affairs, defense, border security and commerce, \ntransportation security, and more. In normal times, naysayers would \ncaution that this fact alone could paralyze this body. But these are \nnot normal times. International terrorism poses a real and present \ndanger to the United States, and it is our responsibility as elected \nofficials to take action on the Commission's recommendations.\n  I would like to highlight some of the major aspects of the bill, and \nI know that the other sponsors also will provide details on the bill's \nstructure.\n  The largest section of this bill concerns the reorganization of our \nintelligence community. This legislation establishes a National \nIntelligence Authority to unify the efforts of the community, and this \nnew entity would be headed by a National Intelligence Director, NID. \nThe NID also would act as the principal intelligence advisor to the \nPresident, taking over this function from the Director of Central \nIntelligence. The NID would have direct budgetary authority and \nsignificant personnel authority over all of the intelligence agencies, \nexcept those that generate intelligence that falls under the purview of \none department alone, such as tactical military intelligence. The NID \nwould have influence over the budgets for these other entities that do \nprovide this very specific intelligence. Assisting the NID would be \nfour deputies, including a principal deputy, another that serves \ncurrently as the CIA Director and would handle foreign intelligence, a \ndeputy that also serves as the Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence, and a fourth that handles domestic intelligence.\n  Also established in this bill is a National Counterterrorism Center \nto oversee all of the U.S. Government counterterrorism operations, \nincluding analysis, net assessments, and guidance for joint \ncounterterrorism operations. The center would be headed by a deputy-\nlevel official who can adjudicate policy disagreements among the \nagencies and, if need be, bump them up to the National Security Council \nfor a decision. In addition to the National Counterterrorism Center, \nthe bill authorizes the NID to establish ``National Intelligence \nCenters'' that will address particular geographic or functional areas. \nThese centers will, like the NCTC, bring together the full range of \nreporting and analysis on particular topics so that no one with a need \nto know is cut out of the loop. There are also provisions designed to \nensure that increased centralization of the intelligence community does \nnot lead to a reduction in the range of analytical views available to \npolicymakers.\n  Finally in the intelligence title, the bill codifies the critical \nreforms that Director Mueller has begun at the FBI, including his \nefforts to improve the FBI's intelligence capabilities and develop a \npersonnel cadre that specializes in national security issues.\n  In its report, the 9/11 Commission found that the biggest impediment \nto ``connecting the dots'' among diverse sources of homeland security \ninformation is the widespread resistance to sharing. To address this \nproblem, the Commission recommended that the President create a new \n``trusted information network'' modeled on a framework developed by a \nMarkle Foundation task force. This bill directs the President to create \nan information network among all Federal departments and agencies with \nresponsibilities for homeland security, among State and local \nauthorities, and among relevant private sector entities. The \nlegislation describes key attributes that should be incorporated into \nthe network and sets forth an ambitious schedule for development and \nimplementation.\n  The Commission report stated that, ``Of all our recommendations, \nstrengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult \nand important. So long as oversight is governed by current \ncongressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people \nwill not get the security they want and need. The United States needs a \nstrong, stable, and capable congressional committee structure to give \nAmerica's national intelligence agencies oversight, support, and \nleadership.''\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\n  The Commission offered several options for how Congress should be \nrestructured to best provide for strong oversight over both \nintelligence and homeland security. With respect to intelligence, it \nrecommended that Congress create either a joint committee modeled after \nthe Joint Atomic Energy Committee or House and Senate Committees with \ncombined authorizing and appropriating powers. With respect to homeland \nsecurity, it recommended that Congress create a single, principal point \nof oversight and review, noting that DHS officials now appear before 88 \ndifferent committees and subcommittees.\n  Late last month, the Senate leadership tasked a bipartisan working \ngroup with examining how best to implement these recommendations and \nasked it to report back to the leadership as soon as possible. In \nrecognition of this ongoing review, our bill does not propose the \ncommittee structures we believe should be adopted, but instead includes \na Sense of the Congress that both houses of the 108th Congress adopt \nall necessary rule changes so that the committee structures for the \n109th Congress are revised in accordance with one of the options \nrecommended by the Commission.\n  It is incumbent on each member to put aside jurisdictional power \nstruggles and take action that is in the interest of securing our \nhomeland. We should strive to never again read a report that calls \nCongressional oversight ``dysfunctional.'' We simply must heed the \nCommissions call to action and fundamentally overhaul Congressional \noversight for intelligence and homeland security. As the Commission \nstated, ``tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient.''\n  As recommended by the Commission, we have included provisions to help \nensure that an incoming President-elect can start putting together his \nnational security team during a transition between administrations. Our \nlegislation would establish procedures for expediting security \nclearances and Senate consideration of top national security \nappointees, as well as any necessary clearances for presidential \ntransition team members. In addition, it directs the President to \nconsolidate security clearance responsibilities in a single Federal \nagency, and to work with the new NID to set uniform standards for \ngranting security clearances so that they are accepted by all Federal \nagencies.\n  One lesson from the Commissions report is that no one set of \nstrategies is sufficient to prevent future terrorist attacks. The \nUnited States must use all of the instruments at our disposal to \ncounter the short and long-term threats posed by international \nterrorism. For this reason, we have devoted an entire title of the bill \nto the role of diplomacy, foreign aid, and the military. The \nlegislation would renew the U.S. commitment to Pakistan's future, in \nlight of the critical role that country plays in the war on terror, and \nauthorizes a substantial increase in aid to Afghanistan. It addresses \nour relations with Saudi Arabia and suggests establishing an \ninternational contact group to develop a multilateral counterterrorism \nstrategy. Other provisions in our bill will enhance America's ability \nto fight the war of ideas by promoting universal values of democracy, \ntolerance, and openness. It authorizes increased funding for U.S. \nbroadcasts to Muslim countries and would ramp up the scale of education \nand exchange programs.\n  This bill notes that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nis a grave and gathering threat to this country, and suggests ways to \nstrengthen our nonproliferation programs. And, since portrayals of \nmistreatment of captured terrorists hinders our ability to engage in \nthe wider struggle against them, this legislation both reiterates \nstandards for their humane treatment once captured, and calls on the \nU.S. Government to develop a common approach to detainee treatment, \nalong with its coalition partners.\n  One significant way to prevent future terrorist attacks on American \nsoil is to stop terrorists from entering the country in the first \nplace. This bill contains a number of provisions that would enhance the \nsecurity of our borders, transportation systems and critical \ninfrastructure. For example, our legislation requires the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to work with multiple government agencies to develop \na unified strategy to intercept terrorists, find terrorist \nfacilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility both domestically and \ninternationally. In addition, to efficiently screen persons entering \nthe United States, we must integrate the multiple terrorist screening \nsystems already in place. This bill would require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to develop a comprehensive screening system that \nbrings together an integrated network of screening points, and to work \nto fully implement the entry and exit functions of the U.S. VISIT \nsystem at all ports of entry as quickly as possible.\n  The Commission also pointed out what appears to be a gaping hole in \nour border security. I am referring to the ability of people who claim \nto be United States citizens to orally attest to their citizenship when \npassing from Canada or Mexico into the United States. Numerous reports, \nincluding a recent GAO study, point to our porous borders as potential \nterrorist entryways into this country. Our legislation would require \neveryone entering the U.S. to present a passport, at a minimum.\n  Of course, travel documents only work insofar as they are authentic \nand can be authenticated by our officials. Our bill requires the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to establish uniform Federal standards \nfor driver's licenses and birth certificates. It is long past time that \nwe take action to protect these documents from being used to commit \nidentity theft, terrorism, and other criminal acts.\n  Although there has been considerable progress in tightening \ntransportation security since September 11, the Commission made several \nrecommendations to further improve the system. For example, the \ncomputer systems and protocols used to vet passengers before they board \na plane are not substantially different than the systems that failed to \nprevent the 9/11 hijackers from boarding their flights. Therefore in \nthis legislation we require the Transportation Security Administration \nto take over and improve the no-fly list process, and to improve the \nscreening of air passengers for explosives and the screening of air \ncargo. In addition, we require DHS to set risk-based priorities for \ndefending various transportation assets, and then figure out a plan and \nbudget to get the job done.\n  Mr. President, I am in full agreement with the Commission that we \nneed to broadly address transportation security vulnerabilities. In \nfact, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has \nalready reported several legislative measures designed to improve the \nsecurity of other transportation modes. A maritime security bill was \nsigned into law in 2002, and we reported a subsequent maritime security \nmeasure earlier this year. We also reported, and the Senate has passed, \na bus security bill, and our rail security legislation is pending on \nthe Senate Calendar. These measures must be enacted before we adjourn.\n  The Commission made a number of recommendations to further our \nnational preparedness and emergency response efforts. Its report states \nthat ``homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \nassessment of risks and vulnerabilities,'' and implores that ``Congress \nshould not use this money as a pork barrel.'' I heartily agree. In \nfollowing this recommendation, the legislation directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to allocate assistance based on the threats, risks, \nand vulnerabilities facing a community, along with its population and \nother specific criteria. It also establishes an expert advisory panel \nto develop benchmarks for assessing the homeland security needs and \ncapabilities of various communities, and rescinds the current formula \nfor homeland security grants.\n  The bill would also require certain broadcasters to vacate their \ntelevision channels in a crisis so that their airwaves are available to \nfirst responders, and ensure that public safety organizations have \naccess to this spectrum no later than January 1, 2007. In addition, it \ndirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with other officials \nin developing effective communications capabilities, including back-up \nsupport. These steps are vital for closing the existing gaps in \ninteroperability of emergency communications systems.\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\n  The Commissioners pointed out that the private sector controls 85 \npercent of the critical infrastructure in the Nation. Our bill directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to promote \nprivate sector preparedness for terrorism and other emergencies. It \nalso directs the Secretary to report to Congress regularly on the \nadequacy of the government's plans to protect our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure.\n  All of us who are concerned with threats to this Nation's security \nalso wish to ensure that our efforts to protect Americans do not \ninfringe on our civil liberties. After all, giving up the way of life \nwe have fought so hard to defend is not an acceptable price for greater \nsecurity. We must find a way to balance the two, and that is what this \nbill proposes to do. It creates a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, as \nwell as designated privacy and civil liberties officers within relevant \nFederal agencies, to analyze actions the enhanced security measures \ntaken by our government and to ensure that civil liberties are \nappropriately considered as these policies are developed. The Board, \nwhich would reside within the Executive Office of the President, would \nadvise the President and Federal agencies on the privacy and civil \nliberties implications of proposed and extant laws, as well as \nauthority to oversee Federal agencies to ensure that civil liberties \nare being protected.\n  In addition, the legislation requires certain agency heads to \ndesignate senior officers to serve as privacy and civil liberties \nresources and watchdogs. Among these officers' responsibilities is \nensuring that their agency has a process in place to receive, \ninvestigate, and respond to complaints from people who report privacy \nor civil liberties violations.\n  Having described the bill we are introducing today, I'd like to \nreiterate that it addresses each of the Commission's recommendations--\nnot more, not less. The sponsors all recognize that other legislative \nproposals will be offered that address the security of our Nation in \nthe face of terrorist threats. In particular, I want to acknowledge the \nefforts by Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Government Affairs Committee. That \nCommittee has a key leadership role in this area, and it is one that I \ngreatly respect. I know that they are working to report a bipartisan \nreform proposal to reform the Intelligence community in the days ahead \nand look forward to Senate debate on their proposal.\n  The sponsors of today's legislation remain open to all proposals, and \nin fact, will have additional suggestions of our own. But the \nintroduction of our legislation today ensures that the commendable work \nof the 9/11 Commission has a real opportunity to be debated, amended, \nand adopted. Despite the short and crowded legislative calendar, we \nurge the leadership to allow for debate on this and other proposals to \naddress the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Even in an election \nyear, there is no higher priority than defending the American people \nagainst threats to their security.\n  Mr. President, there has been much talk over recent months about the \nimportance of firm resolve in the face of threats to America's security \nand its integrity. This legislation presents the Congress with an \nopportunity this year to exhibit some resolve of our own. While we will \nact in the shadow of the dark hours of September 11, we can show the \nAmerican people--and the world--that this government is committed to \nfacing down the worst threats that face us today. We can move forward--\nyes, in an election year, yes, by actually finding agreement regardless \nof party or committee assignment--to better protect and preserve the \nsecurity of this Nation. With the Senate's serious and thorough \nconsideration of the Commission's recommendations, we will honor those \nwho have been patient enough to afford us this opportunity to change.\n  I will make two additional comments. One, we need to reform the \ninstitutions of government. This blueprint which outlines in \nlegislative form the recommendations of the September 11 Commission are \nexactly that, a blueprint. I am confident that the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, under the outstanding leadership of the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, working with Senator Lieberman, Senator \nSpecter, and other members of the committee, will produce a legislative \nproduct of which everyone can be very proud. They have already begun a \nseries of hearings, and I have complete confidence in their \ndeliberations and their results.\n  Let me also say that one of the most difficult aspects of reform will \nbe reform of the institutions here and in the other body. There is no \ndoubt that either one of the two committee recommendations--that there \nbe a joint committee along the lines of the now defunct Joint Committee \non Atomic Energy or two separate permanent committees. Those committees \nhave to have budgetary authority. They must be able to appropriate. If \nnot, those committees will be debating societies and they will not have \nthe influence or power necessary or authority necessary to supervise \nAmerica's intelligence operations.\n  There are many other areas and many other ideas, including those of \nthe White House and the executive branch that need to be taken into \nconsideration. But I think this is a good start because if there is one \nthing all of us can agree on it is that the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission have been embraced by virtually one and all, clearly, with \nsome reservations because it is not a perfect document. But overall, \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans expect that we should act on \nthis blueprint as a blueprint, but, second of all, that we should act--\nthat we should act.\n  There is no disagreement that our intelligence agencies and our \nability to obtain the vital information that is necessary to maintain \nour national security and prevent another terrorist attack require us \nto act in an expeditious fashion.\n  I understand the majority leader, in consultations with Senator \nDaschle, has laid out a schedule for the Governmental Affairs Committee \nto report out the last week in September. I think that is a very \nworthwhile cause.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is good to see you after the recess. \nI thank my colleague and dear friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, for \nhis comments. I support him in substance and in spirit, which is to say \nthe urgency of Congress reacting to the report of the 9/11 Commission.\n  It was shortly after September 11 that Senator McCain and I \nintroduced legislation, with Senators Specter, Bayh, and others, \ncreating the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \nStates. We believed--and we know so many others agreed--that the Nation \nneeded to know as clearly and definitively as possible what had \nhappened, why it had happened, and what could be done to prevent such a \nheinous attack from ever happening again.\n  In particular, most understandably and movingly, the families of the \n9/11 victims rightly demanded that we learn all we could from the \ntragedy that took their loved ones from them. In its 20-month \nexistence, the Commission, headed by Governor Thomas Kean and \nCongressman Lee Hamilton, brought a laser focus to its task. The \nCommission insisted on talking to the people and seeing the documents \nthat could help them understand and tell the full story. The result is \nnot only a definitive account of what happened on September 11, but \nalso a very thoughtful and compelling analysis of why it happened and \nwhere we must go from here. And I take it to be a sign of not only \ntribute to the Commission but of the public concern and interest in \nwhat the Commission had to say, that the published volume of its \nreport, unlike any I have known of in a long time, remains a bestseller \nthroughout our country.\n  So today, Senator McCain, Senator Specter, Senator Bayh, and I join \ntogether again to introduce the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation \nAct of 2004. This legislation embraces and expresses in legislative \nlanguage all 41 of the recommendations in the Commission's final \nreport. Some of those, involving calls to restructure the intelligence \ncommunity, have already been the focus of extensive debate. Others, \nsuch as the proposals to crack down on fraudulent identification \ndocuments or to build new bridges to the Muslim world, have gotten less \ndiscussion. But\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\nthey are all--each and every one of them--the product of the \noutstanding and diligent work of the Commission and therefore deserve, \nindeed command, our attention. We did not attempt to pick and choose \nwhich of the 41 recommendations should be considered or legislated, or \nto edit the Commission's policy conclusions. Indeed, there are one or \ntwo areas where I might take a different approach to the concerns the \nCommission has raised. But the Commission's recommendations should be \nour starting point. And I believe in many cases, probably most, they \nshould be our ending point as well.\n  Introducing this legislation is the fulfillment of the promise we \nmade on the day the Commission issued its report: that we would express \nits proposals in legislation. At that time we had no idea whether \nanything would happen on the Commission report in August or September \nor October. It was that night that Senators Frist and Daschle, our \nbipartisan leadership, asked our Governmental Affairs Committee to \nassume responsibility for considering the Commission's report and \nmaking a set of proposals to the Senate no later than October 1.\n  This proposal we now introduce today will go to the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, formally or informally, to inform the work it is \ndoing. The Governmental Affairs Committee now has the ball and will \nreport to Congress, and is on a schedule, I am pleased to say, to \nreport in advance of the deadline set by Senators Frist and Daschle, in \nadvance of October 1.\n  So what does the Commission and therefore this legislation call for? \nThe Commission's final report depicts a nation that was woefully \nunprepared for the attacks of September 11. As the Commission \nconcludes: We need a new strategic vision to confront terrorism and a \nnew unified effort to carry out that strategy. Such unity can only be \nachieved through a dramatic transformation of the status quo of our key \norganizations and policies. That is the first order of business.\n  The Commission has described how, in the course of its investigation, \nit repeatedly asked this question: Who was in charge prior to September \n11, and who is in charge today? And it never received a satisfactory \nanswer. In fact, Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton testified to us \nbefore our Governmental Affairs Committee that they still cannot point \nto some one individual in charge of the American intelligence effort, \nits enormous human and technological assets, and, therefore, no one who \nis personally accountable.\n  This is unacceptable. This legislation rightly creates a national \nintelligence director to serve as head of the intelligence community \nand principal adviser to the President for national intelligence \nmatters. The director will have strong budget, resource, and personnel \nauthority to shape priorities and break down the kinds of turf barriers \nand stovepipes that stood in the way of our Government pulling together \nin one place all the information we knew prior to September 11--\ninformation that might well have prevented the attacks of September 11 \nfrom occurring.\n  These powers are far stronger than the current authorities exercised \nby the Director of Central Intelligence. This will create the \ncapability and the accountability for someone to truly lead a unified \nintelligence effort that will, in turn, greatly benefit the specific \nfight against terrorism. This intelligence director will operate \nthrough a new agency, to be called the National Intelligence Authority. \nThis is not a large new bureaucracy, but rather a command, control and \ncoordination center to achieve a unified intelligence effort. Although \nthe Commission originally called for this office to be created within \nthe White House, numerous experts counseled against this and the \nCommissioners themselves now agree with that counsel. As a result, this \nlegislation creates the National Intelligence Authority as an \nindependent entity.\n  To help guarantee the government-wide antiterrorism cooperation that \ndid not exist pre-9/11, the legislation also creates a National \nCounterterrorism Center, patterned on the joint commands of the \nDepartment of Defense, drawing on expertise from throughout the \nintelligence community. This center will serve as an analytic fusion \ncenter on terrorism, and will also have responsibility to develop \noperational plans for counterterrorism initiatives, and then to track \nand monitor the operations' implementation. As such, the center will \nbuild on the promise of the new multi-agency Terrorist Threat \nIntegration Center it would replace, but go beyond that model to create \nan even more robust center that combines analytical and operational \ncapabilities.\n  As recommended by the Commission, the legislation also provides for \nthe creation by the National Intelligence Director of a number of \nnational intelligence centers focused on either specific topics like \nweapons of mass destruction or specific geographic areas such as the \nMiddle East. These centers will bring together the most experienced \nintelligence experts from across the intelligence community on a given \nissue or region, and can be created or eliminated as needed, giving us \nthe flexibility to hone in on evolving priorities.\n  I am pleased these intelligence reform proposals have already been \nthe focus of numerous hearings, and these issues, as I have said, will \nbe under active consideration in the Governmental Affairs Committee in \nthe coming days.\n  The work on this legislation and the work that the Governmental \nAffairs Committee is doing has proceeded distinctly, separately, but \ncollaboratively, and work on each has informed and, I believe, \nstrengthened the other.\n  I hope--I know the cosponsors of this legislation share that hope--\nthe package we are introducing today will be of real help to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as it frames the legislation it--we--\nwill report out to the Senate. I am confident the Senate can actually \nbegin to consider it well before the end of September.\n  The intense debate over the Commission's recommendations on \nintelligence reform may have obscured the sweeping proposals the \nCommission made in other areas--very strong and important proposals on \nborder and transportation security, on information sharing, on national \npreparedness and congressional oversight.\n  Those proposals are included in this legislation as well. As a \nresult, we hope its introduction will jump-start debate and \nconsideration of those other vital reforms.\n  First, the Commission stressed we must do all we can to stop this \nproblem at the source--that is, to alter the conditions and dynamics \nthat give rise to terrorism in the first place. This legislation \nincludes the recommendations to strengthen our efforts to fight \ninternational terrorism using such tools as diplomacy and foreign aid. \nFor instance, the legislation would increase U.S. foreign assistance to \nAfghanistan and renew our commitment to Pakistan. It would enhance our \noutreach to the Muslim world through U.S. broadcasts to the region, \neducational exchange programs and a fund to boost educational \nopportunities for Muslim youth.\n  This will be a long and difficult challenge, however, and we must \nassume international terrorism will be with us for years to come and \nprepare accordingly. In addition to the intelligence community reforms \nI have already mentioned, the Commission calls for a range of new \nprograms and policies to combat terror.\n  Information sharing is one such critical step. Terrorism has made the \nhomeland part of the frontlines, but too many government officials \nstill believe information related to terrorist threats must be \ncarefully hoarded among a select group. Even colleagues within the \nintelligence community are often not trusted with vital information, \nmuch less officials outside the national security elites or in state \nand local government. We must break down these information barriers and \nengage a far broader community in the task of fighting terrorism. This \nwill would create an urgently needed information sharing network to \nbreak down the information stovepipes that currently hamper our efforts \nto stay one step ahead of the terrorists. The network, which is modeled \non a proposal by a task force of the Markle Foundation, would consist \nof policies and information technology designed to facilitate and \npromote sharing of terrorism information throughout the Federal \ngovernment, with state and local agencies and, as appropriate, the \nprivate sector.\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nThe President will be required to submit an implementation plan to \nCongress, including clear deadlines, assignment of responsibilities and \nbudget requirements. The proposal includes safeguards for privacy and \ncivil liberties.\n  The bill includes critical provisions to restrict terrorist travel--\nthe strategies and methods by which terrorists can, and did, come to \nthis country and position themselves for attacks. It would expand our \nefforts to collect and utilize intelligence regarding terrorist travel \nstrategies and methods. The legislation also requires an integrated \nscreening system to ensure adequate screening at the nation's entry \npoints and to access transportation systems and critical \ninfrastructure. Complementary provisions in the bill require stronger \ndocument requirements for all travelers, including citizens, to enter \nthe United States; acceleration of the automated biometric entry and \nexit system known as U.S.-Visit; and improved security for \nidentification documents such as driver licenses and birth \ncertificates.\n  In the area of transportation security, the 9/11 Commission warned \nagainst the government's heavy focus on passenger aviation to the near \nexclusion of other modes of transportation. As its Final Report states, \n``[o]ver 90 percent of the nation's $5.3 billion annual investment in \nthe [Transportation Security Administration] goes to aviation--to fight \nthe last war.'' Yet we are investing little in protecting the 14 \nmillion Americans who use transit systems each weekday, or safeguarding \nour port systems that handle millions of shipping containers each year. \nWhat is lacking, the Commission states, is ``a forward-looking \nstrategic plan systematically analyzing assets, risks, costs and \nbenefits.'' Following its recommendations, this legislation calls for a \ncomprehensive transportation security strategy to assess risks and set \npriorities across all modes of transportation. It also seeks to close \nongoing gaps in aviation security by requiring the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, rather than the airlines, to screen passenger \nnames against a consolidated terrorist watchlist. Additional aviation-\nrelated measures include explosives screening for all passengers and \ntheir carry-on bags, accelerated research and deployment of explosives \ndetection technologies, and measures to improve the security of cargo \ntraveling on passenger aircraft.\n\n  To help deter terrorist attacks and minimize the effect of any \nattacks that do occur, we must improve our preparedness capabilities \nand this legislation includes the Commission's recommended steps to do \nso. The bill would require that homeland security preparedness grants \nbe distributed solely on the basis of criteria related to threat and \nrisk, eliminating the per state minimum in current law. It would \nfacilitate first responder communications by assigning certain radio \nspectrum to public safety agencies for their use--an important step \ntoward solving the critical challenge of enabling first responders to \ntalk to one another during an emergency. Fighting terrorism is a \nchallenge for our entire national community and the Commission also \nstressed the importance of preparedness within the private sector. This \nlegislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to promote a \nvoluntary preparedness standard for the private sector. It also presses \nthe Secretary of DHS to complete efforts to inventory the nation's \ncritical infrastructure, assess the threats and vulnerabilities \nregarding these critical assets, and ensure there are measures to \nprotect them.\n  The Commission recognized that these new policies and programs will \nraise important issues regarding privacy and civil liberties and called \nfor a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure the \nprotection of these liberties as laws and policies are developed and \nimplemented to protect the nation from terrorism. This legislation \ncreates such a board, which will consist of five individuals appointed \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. In addition to advising \nthe President and federal agencies, the board will have strong \nauthority to conduct investigations and oversight of government actions \nin the war on terror.\n  Finally, as we look to the changes the Commission has urged for \nexecutive branch structures and programs, we cannot neglect the \nCommission's call to reform our own structures and its indictment of \nthe status quo of congressional oversight of intelligence. We have to \nclean and reshape not only the executive branch, but we have to clean \nout and reshape our own house.\n  The Commission concluded that the Intelligence Committees of the \nHouse and Senate are not organized currently to provide the necessary \nleadership and oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism, and \nthat jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security is also too \nbroadly dispersed.\n  The legislation we are introducing today incorporates the mandate of \nthe Commission that each Chamber reform its rules to create a more \npowerful Intelligence Committee and to consolidate oversight of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in a single committee in each Chamber.\n  Clearly, we have our work cut out for us. But nothing is more \nimportant than to respond not just in a timely but in an urgent way to \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and to do so, as the \nCommission itself did, in a way that puts partisanship aside and our \nnational security first. The group of us introducing this legislation--\nSenators McCain, Specter, Bayh, and I--stand shoulder to shoulder \nacross party lines to achieve a safer nation, to protect the American \npeople at home.\n  We are confident, as we go forward, that our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle will join us. There will be differences of opinion. It \nwould be shocking if there were not. Because the recommendations of the \nCommission represent bold change and dramatically alter the status quo, \ndifferences of opinion will naturally occur. They ought to occur. But I \nam confident in the end they will not be partisan. In the end, we will \nact and act quickly to implement much of the 9/11 Commission's report \nso that we can say to the American people, particularly those who lost \nloved ones on September 11, that we have taken action, done whatever we \npossibly could to prevent a terrorist attack such as the one that \noccurred on September 11, 2001, from ever happening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues--\nSenators McCain, Lieberman, and Bayh--in introducing this legislation \ntoday which codifies the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The 9/\n11 Commission has accomplished a very important mission in stimulating \nthe demand of the American people that action be taken to put all of \nour intelligence agencies under one command authority. Had this been \ndone prior to 9/11, it is my judgment that 9/11 could have been \nprevented.\n  There was the famous FBI report from Phoenix about the suspicious \ncharacter who wanted to learn to fly an airplane but wasn't interested \nin learning to take off or land. There were the suspicious people in \nKuala Lumpur who turned out to be two of the terrorists known by the \nCIA to be al-Qaida, but it was not told to the INS to keep them out of \nthe country. There was the information on Zacarias Moussaoui and the \nwork of the FBI field office in Minneapolis with the 13-page, single-\nspaced report filed by Agent Coleen Rowley. Those factors and others \ngave clear-cut clues to what was happening or about to happen. Had they \nbeen pursued and investigated, the chances are good that 9/11 could \nhave been prevented.\n  The Commission, in focusing public attention on the absolute \nnecessity to have one commander, has accomplished something which had \nnot been accomplished up until the present time. I served on the \nIntelligence Committee back in 1987, when we had the investigation of \nthe Iran Contra affair. At that time I introduced legislation for a \nnational intelligence director looking more to oversight at that time. \nIn 1996, when I was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \nintroduced legislation which would have provided budget and hiring \nauthority under the CIA Director. Technically, the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency has for some time--I believe going back to \n1947--the overall direction of the intelligence community. But without \nbudget authority and without hiring and firing, it has been virtually \nmeaningless. But in 1996, I proposed that legislation.\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\n  In 2002, we moved for the creation of an Office of Homeland Security. \nSenator Lieberman and I introduced, 30 days after 9/11, legislation to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security. But there were various \nobjections to it, and the issue was not taken up seriously until mid-\n2002. There was a real effort made in that legislation to have all of \nthe intelligence agencies under one command authority. The House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill in October and left town, which they do \nfrom time to time, leaving us with the option of either taking their \nbill or not having a bill until the following spring.\n  At that time I had an amendment prepared to give the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority to direct all of the other intelligence \nagencies. As I have said on the record before, and it is worth \nrepeating briefly, I had a conversation that afternoon with Secretary \nRidge who urged me not to offer the amendment. I told him I thought it \nhad to be done. And when I declined to accept his recommendations, I \ngot a call from Vice President Cheney who urged the same course. When I \nagain declined, I later talked to the President that afternoon and \ndecided that I would await a later date to press for having that \nauthority to direct. But this has been a gaping hole in \nthe intelligence apparatus forever.\n\n  The Scowcroft Commission filed a report, still in confidential form \nbut widely reputed to create an individual in charge of the overall \nintelligence agency. So, finally, we are coming to the point where we \nare thinking very seriously about having one person in charge, a \nnational director of intelligence, thanks to the focus of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  The Government Affairs Committee on which I serve, with the \nleadership of Senator Collins, the chairman of the committee, and \nSenator Lieberman, the ranking member, did something very unusual. We \nreturned in the first week of the recess on July 30 and held additional \nhearings. In reviewing the work of the 9/11 Commission at that time, I \nexpressed for the record and would repeat now briefly the concerns I \nhave about the so-called double hatting. The 9/11 Commission has \nrecommended that the counterintelligence unit, for example, of the FBI \nstay under the direction of the Director of the FBI but report also to \nthe national intelligence director so that the Director of the FBI \ncounterintelligence unit would be so-called double hatted.\n  Well, I do not think that can work under the very basic principle \nthat no one can serve two masters.\n  The same kind of concept is present on double hatting with the CIA \nDirector for the Department of Defense intelligence agencies. During \nthe course of the Governmental Affairs hearings, I asked Congressman \nLee Hamilton, cochairman of the 9/11 Commission, about the possibility \nof creating the director with a 10-year term, modeled after the FBI \nDirector, to be able to have someone who would outlast the tenure of \nPresidents. I think that is also a concept which ought to be \nincorporated.\n  When the Governmental Affairs Committee was considering this issue \nand legislation, I prepared a draft bill which I submitted to the \nmembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee back on August 3 of this \nyear.\n  I think it would be useful to put it into the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of that draft proposal be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. There are other proposals that have been made. The \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Roberts, has \nproposed legislation. So we have a great many ideas to choose from. As \nI sat at the Governmental Affairs hearing in early August, it was my \nhope that we would report out a bill early. I am pleased to say \nChairman Collins has listed a markup for the week of September 20th, so \nthat we should have a bill to present to the Senate early on. Then it \nis my hope we will act on this matter and act expeditiously. We have to \nget it right.\n  These are complicated matters. We have been studying them for a very \nlong time. We have been studying them, to my personal knowledge, going \nback to 1987 in legislation I introduced, and again in 1996, and with \nthe very extensive consideration of the legislation on homeland \nsecurity in 2002. So I think we are ready to move ahead and make the \nkinds of judgments that are tough decisions, but that is the pay grade \naround here. I think the time has come to act.\n  It may not be a perfect bill. I have been in the Senate for 24 years \nnow and I have not seen a perfect bill. The risks of inaction, in my \nview, are much greater than the risks of action. We know enough to make \na sound judgment as to how to put the entire intelligence community \nunder one umbrella.\n  I see my colleague Senator Bayh on the floor. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Timely and accurate information about the activities, \n     capabilities, plans, and intentions of foreign powers, \n     organizations, and persons, and their agents, is essential to \n     the national security of the United States. All reasonable \n     and lawful means must be used to ensure that the United \n     States receives the best intelligence available.\n       (2) The National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et \n     seq.) created a formal structure under an official who would \n     lead the Central Intelligence Agency and, in a separate role \n     as Director of Central Intelligence, the intelligence \n     community of the United States Government, and serve as the \n     principal adviser to the President on intelligence.\n       (3) Executive Order 12333 (December 4, 1981; 46 F.R. 59941) \n     states that ``the United States intelligence effort shall \n     provide the President and the National Security Council with \n     the necessary information on which to base decisions \n     concerning the conduct and development of foreign, defense \n     and economic policy and the protection of United States \n     national interests from foreign security threats. All \n     departments and agencies shall cooperate fully to fulfill \n     this goal''.\n       (4) The intelligence community of the United States is \n     supposed to function as a single corporate enterprise, \n     supporting those who manage the strategic interests of the \n     United States, whether political, economic, or military.\n       (5) The United States has suffered through an escalating \n     cycle of intelligence failures, especially since the end of \n     the Cold War, while witnessing the onset of new and emerging \n     global threats such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (6) The Director of Central Intelligence has no genuine \n     influence over elements of the intelligence community other \n     than the Central Intelligence Agency because, among other \n     things, the Director controls only a small portion of the \n     funds, personnel, and related assets of the intelligence \n     community. There is no structural mechanism to enforce the \n     mandate of Executive Order 12333 that all elements of the \n     intelligence community must fully cooperate with one another.\n       (7) As such, the existing intelligence structure is \n     dysfunctional, and not organized to effectively respond to \n     new and emerging threats. In fact, the intelligence apparatus \n     of the United States has for decades grown more cumbersome \n     and unaccountable and may now properly be characterized as a \n     Cold War model in an era of terrorism.\n       (8) The existing dysfunctional structure of the \n     intelligence community has severe consequences, as the \n     Director of Central Intelligence--or those ostensibly under \n     the Director's control--missed, ignored, or failed to connect \n     numerous warnings which could have averted the terrorist plot \n     of September 11, 2001. Similar errors may have caused the \n     Director to mislead the President on the nature of weapons of \n     mass destruction threats as the Administration weighed \n     military action against Iraq.\n       (9) Despite the best efforts of the Administration of \n     President George W. Bush, Congress, and the American people, \n     much of the dysfunction in the intelligence community--\n     including the lack of common terrorist watchlists and the \n     inability to detect and apprehend terrorists traveling in the \n     United States--has not been remedied in the three years since \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n       (10) The final report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, while making \n     certain recommendations on the restructuring of the \n     intelligence community to meet new and emerging terrorist \n     threats, leaves much discretion to Congress in determining \n     the scope and nature of the restructuring of the intelligence \n     community.\n       (11) President George W. Bush on August 2, 2004, \n     specifically requested that Congress create a national \n     intelligence director in a ``free-standing entity similar to \n     a cabinet agency or an agency'' and ``who will have a great \n     deal of budget authority'' and will have ``the same \n     relationship to the White House and the President that the \n     Secretary of Defense would have, the Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, [or] \n     the Secretary of the Treasury would have.'' The Executive \n     Orders issued on August 27, 2004, while properly focusing on \n     strengthened management of the intelligence community, \n     strengthening information sharing, and the creation of a \n     National Counterterrorism Center, also leaves a great deal of \n     discretion to Congress to codify these matters in law and \n     determine the scope and nature of the restructuring of the \n     intelligence community.\n       (12) To effectively counter the grave threat of \n     transnational terrorism, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \n     recently conceded, as he must, that ``strong, entrenched \n     agencies must be willing to give up some of their turf and \n     authority in exchange for a stronger, faster, more efficient, \n     government-wide effort''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide for fundamental reform of the intelligence \n     community of the United States Government involving a robust \n     Department of Intelligence and Director of Intelligence with \n     control over the budgets, personnel, and related assets of \n     the intelligence community.\n       (2) To compel the elements of the intelligence community to \n     work together to accomplish their common mission, much as the \n     Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of \n     1986 (Public Law 99-433) fostered ``jointness'' among the \n     various Armed Forces, in conformance with the requirements of \n     law and Executive orders.\n       (3) To facilitate the provision to the President and the \n     National Security Council of the necessary information on \n     which to base decisions concerning the development and \n     conduct of foreign policy, defense policy, and economic \n     policy, and the protection of United States national \n     interests from security threats, including threats related to \n     transnational terrorism.\n       (4) To ensure that all means, consistent with United States \n     laws, Executive orders, and regulations and with full \n     consideration of the rights of United States persons, are \n     used to develop intelligence for the President and the \n     National Security Council.\n       (5) To create a structure for the intelligence community \n     that will better serve the President in his duty under the \n     Constitution of the United States to protect the security of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to join my esteemed \ncolleague Senator Specter from Pennsylvania and Senators Lieberman and \nMcCain in this effort to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations \nto defend our country.\n  This is a bipartisan undertaking. We have proven we can rise above \npartisan politics. It remains to be seen whether we can rise above the \nbureaucratic inertia, gridlock, and turf jealousy that all too often \nafflict the Federal Government. I believe we must and I believe we can, \nif we are to uphold the weighty responsibility placed on us by our \nfellow American citizens.\n  The most important thing we can bring to this task is a sense of \nurgency. What began as a wake-up call on September 11 may not be \nanswered following this November 2, unless we maintain the momentum \ngenerated by the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. All too often \nthe country's attention, this body's attention, can be diverted into \nother arenas, keeping us from taking a difficult but necessary action \nthat sustained focus and attention can achieve.\n  So I am very insistent that we regain the momentum, bring a sense of \nurgency and purpose to this calling, because it is what will be \nnecessary to break down some of the barriers that too often in the past \nhave kept us from doing what we now know to be important in terms of \ndefending this country.\n  Our proposal is the most comprehensive one before the Congress. It \naddresses not only identifying and cracking down on terrorists who \nwould threaten to do harm to the American people; it is also the only \nproposal that deals with the causes--the environment that gives rise to \nthose violent individuals in the first place. We have to do both. If \nthere is one thing I am absolutely certain of, it is no matter what \nresources, focus, and new structure we bring to the challenge of \ndefending our country, we will not be able to identify and bring to \njustice every individual who wishes us harm. We have to prevent them \nfrom being created in the first place. We need to do both. That is what \nthis calls for.\n  We emphasize accountability and this is vitally important. If you \nlook at the failings that occurred before 9/11, and at some of the \nweaknesses exposed by the search for weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq, you can see there were some significant problems with our \nintelligence system. Yet, as far as I know, no individual has been \nadmonished, no individual has been demoted, no individual has been \nfired. George Tenet fell on his sword and took responsibility. But as \nfar as I know, that is as far as it goes.\n  Is this the best we can do in terms of having a structure that \nassigns missions and holds people accountable for successfully \nfulfilling them? I don't believe it is. This proposal we have placed \nbefore this Congress insists upon clearly delineated lines of \nauthority, holds people clearly accountable for carrying out tasks, \nwith consequences that will be easier to impose if people do not do the \njob we have a right to expect of them. If I were the President asking \nwho was responsible or in charge or accountable for this, you would \nhave a half dozen different individuals. But the only individual you \ncan look at and say this person is in charge of a national \nsecurity apparatus in this country is the President himself.\n\n  Well, that is not good enough because with all the President has to \nbe responsible for, he needs to have someone subordinate to him, who is \nclearly identifiable, to bring coherence and accountability to the \nnational security apparatus. That is what our proposal would put into \nplace.\n  Finally, let me say two things. We need to increase the amount of \ninformation available to our country in order to provide for our \ndefense. No matter what structure we provide, no matter how \ncomprehensive or how much we emphasize accountability, we simply need \nto know more about dangerous individuals, dangerous places, and what \nthey are doing in an attempt to harm America. There are glaring blind \nspots today, when it comes to intelligence, that will make us unable to \ndefend our country. We are in the process of trying to correct some of \nthose blind spots, but more needs to be done.\n  This report focuses like a laser, particularly on improving the level \nof human intelligence that will augment our technology, and other \nsources at our disposal to provide for the common defense.\n  In conclusion, let me say this. I am reminded of the old adage, \n``Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.'' It is no \nlonger possible to deny there are glaring weaknesses in the national \nsecurity intelligence apparatus that sprung up following World War II. \nIt was designed for a different time and a different challenge. We must \nseize this opportunity and put into place truly transformational change \nthat will enable us to defend our country against the threats of the \n21st century, not those that threatened us in the recent past.\n  Those who would temporize, equivocate, and those who would unduly \ncompromise will bear a very heavy burden indeed should another tragedy \nstrike this country. Now is the time for bold action. Now is the time \nto put aside the bureaucratic turf jealousies, inertia, and divisions \nthat afflict the Congress and the executive branch and unite \npolitically, unite across branches of Government, unite in a common \npurpose of truly bold reform and change, so that those who follow in \nour footsteps will know we have done everything humanly possible to \nprotect this country.\n  Some of the sacrifices need to start with this Congress. Too often \npeople have committee jealousies and they want to protect turf. We need \nto put that aside and unite as one people, one Congress, to protect \nthis Nation. That is what this legislation does. So I am pleased to \njoin with my colleagues in a bipartisan spirit to move the intelligence \nsystem forward and defend America.\n  I will conclude with a saying I once read. I am a member of the \nIntelligence Committee. At one of the briefings, we got what was \nactually a cover sheet of the budget for the intelligence community a \ncouple of years ago. The budget is classified, but this is not. It was \na quote from Napoleon Bonaparte, which I found interesting. Napoleon \nBonaparte once said ``a well-placed spy is worth at least two \ndivisions.'' Well, today a well-placed spy and access to timely, \naccurate information could be worth two American cities; it could mean \nthe difference between hundreds of thousands of lives saved or lost.\n  Let us not get embroiled in political, bureaucratic, or other \ndisputes when the fate of our Nation hangs in the balance. Now is the \ntime to act. I am honored to join with my colleagues in proposing that \nwe do exactly that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Central Intelligence Agency \n     should retain responsibility for the direction and execution \n     of clandestine and covert operations. The Central \n     Intelligence Agency should also concentrate on building \n     capabilities to carry out such operations and on providing \n     personnel who will be directing and executing such operations \n     in the field.\n       (2) The reconstitution of the analytic and human \n     intelligence collection capabilities of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency requires the undiverted attention of the \n     head of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n       (b) Transformation of Central Intelligence Agency.--The \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall transform \n     the intelligence and intelligence-related capabilities of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency by--\n       (1) building the human intelligence capabilities of the \n     clandestine service;\n       (2) building the analytic capabilities of the Agency;\n       (3) developing a stronger language program;\n       (4) renewing emphasis on the recruitment of operations \n     officers of diverse background who can blend in more easily \n     in foreign cities;\n       (5) ensuring a seamless relationship between human source \n     collection and signals collection at the operational level; \n     and\n       (6) providing for a better balance between unilateral \n     operations and liaison operations.\n       (c) Retention of Responsibility for Clandestine and Covert \n     Operations.--The Central Intelligence Agency shall retain \n     responsibility for the direction and execution of clandestine \n     and covert operations as authorized by the President or the \n     National Intelligence Director and assigned by a national \n     intelligence center.\n\n     SEC. 164.

INFORMATION SHARING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n       (1) Network.--The term ``Network'' means the Information \n     Sharing Network described in subsection (c).\n       (2) Terrorism information.--The term ``terrorism \n     information'' means all information, whether collected, \n     produced, or distributed by intelligence, law enforcement, \n     military, homeland security, or other activities, relating \n     to--\n       (A) the existence, organization, capabilities, plans, \n     intentions, vulnerabilities, means of finance or material \n     support, or activities of foreign or international terrorist \n     groups or individuals, or of domestic groups or individuals \n     involved in transnational terrorism;\n       (B) threats posed by such groups or individuals to the \n     United States, United States persons, or United States \n     interests, or to those of other nations;\n       (C) communications of or by such groups or individuals; or\n       (D) information relating to groups or individuals \n     reasonably believed to be assisting or associated with such \n     groups or individuals.\n       (b) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The effective use of information, from all available \n     sources, is essential to the fight against terror and the \n     protection of our homeland. The biggest impediment to all-\n     source analysis, and to a greater likelihood of ``connecting \n     the dots'', is resistance to sharing information.\n       (2) The United States Government has access to a vast \n     amount of information, including not only traditional \n     intelligence but also other government databases, such as \n     those containing customs or immigration information. But the \n     United States Government has a weak system for processing and \n     using the information it has.\n       (3) In the period leading up to September 11, 2001, there \n     were instances of potentially helpful information that was \n     available but that no person knew to ask for; information \n     that was distributed only in compartmented channels; and \n     information that was requested but could not be shared.\n       (4) Current security requirements nurture \n     overclassification and excessive compartmentalization of \n     information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure \n     opposes sharing, with risks, including criminal, civil, and \n     administrative sanctions, but few rewards for sharing \n     information.\n       (5) The current system, in which each intelligence agency \n     has its own security practices, requires a demonstrated \n     ``need to know'' before sharing. This approach assumes that \n     it is possible to know, in advance, who will need to use the \n     information. An outgrowth of the cold war, such a system \n     implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure \n     outweighs the benefits of wider sharing. Such assumptions are \n     no longer appropriate. Although counterintelligence concerns \n     are still real, the costs of not sharing information are also \n     substantial. The current ``need-to-know'' culture of \n     information protection needs to be replaced with a ``need-to-\n     share'' culture of integration.\n       (6) A new approach to the sharing of terrorism information \n     is urgently needed. An important conceptual model for a new \n     ``trusted information network'' is the Systemwide Homeland \n     Analysis and Resource Exchange (SHARE) Network proposed by a \n     task force of leading professionals assembled by the Markle \n     Foundation and described in reports issued in October 2002 \n     and December 2003.\n       (7) No single agency can create a meaningful information \n     sharing system on its own. Alone, each agency can only \n     modernize stovepipes, not replace them. Presidential \n     leadership is required to bring about governmentwide change.\n       (c) Information Sharing Network.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish an \n     information sharing network to promote the sharing of \n     terrorism information, in a manner consistent with national \n     security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n       (2) Attributes.--The Network shall promote coordination, \n     communication and collaboration of people and information \n     among all relevant Federal departments and agencies, State, \n     tribal, and local authorities, and relevant private sector \n     entities, including owners and operators of critical \n     infrastructure, by using policy guidelines and technologies \n     that support--\n       (A) a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated \n     environment that connects existing systems where appropriate \n     and allows users to share information horizontally across \n     agencies, vertically between levels of government, and, as \n     appropriate, with the private sector;\n       (B) building on existing systems capabilities at relevant \n     agencies;\n       (C) utilizing industry best practices, including minimizing \n     the centralization of data and seeking to use common tools \n     and capabilities whenever possible;\n       (D) employing an information rights management approach \n     that controls access to data rather than to whole networks;\n       (E) facilitating the sharing of information at and across \n     all levels of security by using policy guidelines and \n     technologies that support writing information that can be \n     broadly shared;\n       (F) providing directory services for locating people and \n     information;\n       (G) incorporating protections for individuals' privacy and \n     civil liberties;\n       (H) incorporating mechanisms for information security; and\n       (I) access controls, authentication and authorization, \n     audits, and other strong mechanisms for information security \n     and privacy guideline enforcement across all levels of \n     security, in order to enhance accountability and facilitate \n     oversight.\n       (d) Immediate Steps.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the President, through the Director \n     of Management and Budget and in consultation with the \n     National Intelligence Director, the Attorney General, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of State, the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Director of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, and such other Federal officials as the President \n     shall designate, shall--\n       (1) establish electronic directory services to assist in \n     locating in the Federal Government terrorism information and \n     people with relevant knowledge about terrorism information; \n     and\n       (2) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency \n     capabilities, including a baseline inventory of current \n     Federal systems that contain terrorism information, the money \n     currently spent to maintain those systems, and identification \n     of other information that should be included in the Network.\n       (e) Guidelines.--As soon as possible, but in no event later \n     than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall--\n       (1) in consultation with the National Intelligence Director \n     and the Advisory Council on Information Sharing established \n     in subsection (g), issue guidelines for acquiring, accessing, \n     sharing, and using terrorism information, including \n     guidelines to ensure such information is provided in its most \n     shareable form, such as by separating out data from the \n     sources and methods by which they are obtained;\n       (2) in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board established under section 901, issue \n     guidelines that--\n       (A) protect privacy and civil liberties in the development \n     and use of the Network; and\n       (B) shall be made public, unless, and only to the extent \n     that, nondisclosure is clearly necessary to protect national \n     security;\n       (3) establish objective, systemwide performance measures to \n     enable the assessment of progress toward achieving full \n     implementation of the Network; and\n       (4) require Federal departments and agencies to promote a \n     culture of information sharing by--\n       (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing, \n     including overclassification of information and unnecessary \n     requirements for originator approval; and\n       (B) providing affirmative incentives for information \n     sharing, such as the incorporation of information sharing \n     performance measures into agency and managerial evaluations, \n     and employee awards for promoting innovative information \n     sharing practices.\n       (f) System Design and Implementation Plan.--Not later than \n     270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a system design and \n     implementation plan for the Network. The plan shall be \n     prepared by the President through the Director of Management \n     and Budget and in consultation with the National Intelligence \n     Director, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and such other \n     Federal officials as the President shall designate, and shall \n     include--\n       (1) a description of the parameters of the proposed \n     Network, including functions, capabilities, and resources;\n       (2) a description of the technological, legal, and policy \n     issues presented by the creation of the Network described in \n     subsection (c), and the ways in which these issues will be \n     addressed;\n       (3)(A) a delineation of the roles of the Federal \n     departments and agencies that will participate in the \n     development of the Network, including--\n       (i) identification of any agency that will build the \n     infrastructure needed to operate and manage the Network (as \n     distinct from the individual agency components that are to be \n     part of the Network); and\n       (ii) identification of any agency that will operate and \n     manage the Network (as distinct from the individual agency \n     components that are to be part of the Network);\n       (B) a provision that the delineation of roles under \n     subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) be consistent with the authority of the National \n     Intelligence Director, under this Act, to set standards for \n     information sharing and information technology throughout the \n     intelligence community; and\n       (ii) recognize the role of the Department of Homeland \n     Security in coordinating with State, tribal, and local \n     officials and the private sector;\n       (4) a description of the technological requirements to \n     appropriately link and enhance existing networks and a \n     description of the system design that will meet these \n     requirements;\n       (5) a plan, including a time line, for the development and \n     phased implementation of the Network;\n       (6) total budget requirements to develop and implement the \n     Network, including the estimated annual cost for each of the \n     5 years following the date of enactment of this Act; and\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\n       (7) proposals for any legislation that the President \n     believes necessary to implement the Network.\n       (g) Advisory Council on Information Sharing.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established an Advisory \n     Council on Information Sharing (in this subsection referred \n     to as the ``Council'').\n       (2) Membership.--No more than 25 individuals may serve as \n     members of the Council, which shall include--\n       (A) the National Intelligence Director, who shall serve as \n     Chairman of the Council;\n       (B) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n       (C) the Secretary of Defense;\n       (D) the Attorney General;\n       (E) the Secretary of State;\n       (F) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency;\n       (G) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       (H) the Director of Management and Budget;\n       (I) such other Federal officials as the President shall \n     designate;\n       (J) representatives of State, tribal, and local \n     governments, to be appointed by the President;\n       (K) individuals from outside government with expertise in \n     relevant technology, security and privacy concepts, to be \n     appointed by the President; and\n       (L) individuals who are employed in private businesses or \n     nonprofit organizations that own or operate critical \n     infrastructure, to be appointed by the President.\n       (3) Responsibilities.--The Council shall--\n       (A) advise the President and the heads of relevant Federal \n     departments and agencies on the implementation of the \n     Network;\n       (B) ensure that there is coordination among participants in \n     the Network in the development and implementation of the \n     Network;\n       (C) review, on an ongoing basis, policy, legal and \n     technology issues related to the implementation of the \n     Network; and\n       (D) establish a dispute resolution process to resolve \n     disagreements among departments and agencies about whether \n     particular terrorism information should be shared and in what \n     manner.\n       (4) Inapplicability of Federal Advisory Committee Act.--The \n     Council shall not be subject to the requirements of the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Consistent with the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) The American people are not served well by current \n     congressional rules and resolutions governing intelligence \n     and homeland security oversight.\n       (2) A unified Executive Branch effort on fighting terrorism \n     will not be effective unless it is matched by a unified \n     effort in Congress, specifically a strong, stable, and \n     capable congressional committee structure to give the \n     intelligence agencies and Department of Homeland Security \n     sound oversight, support, and leadership.\n       (3) The intelligence committees of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives are not organized to provide strong \n     leadership and oversight for intelligence and \n     counterterrorism.\n       (4) Jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security, \n     which is scattered among many committees in each chamber, \n     does not allow for the clear authority and responsibility \n     needed for effective congressional oversight.\n       (5) Congress should either create a new, joint Senate-House \n     intelligence authorizing committee modeled on the former \n     Joint\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n     Committee on Atomic Energy, or establish new intelligence \n     committees in each chamber with combined authorization and \n     appropriations authority.\n       (6) Congress should establish a single, principal point of \n     oversight and review in each chamber for the Department of \n     Homeland Security and the report of the National Commission \n     on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States stated that \n     ``Congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee \n     should have jurisdiction over this department and its \n     duties.''.\n       (7) In August 2004, the joint Senate leadership created a \n     bipartisan working group to examine how best to implement the \n     Commission's recommendations with respect to reform of the \n     Senate's oversight of intelligence and homeland security, and \n     directed the working group to begin its work immediately and \n     to present its findings and recommendations to Senate \n     leadership as expeditiously as possible.\n\n     SEC. 302. REORGANIZATION OF CONGRESSIONAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       The 108th Congress shall not adjourn until each House of \n     Congress has adopted the necessary changes to its rules such \n     that, effective the start of the 109th Congress--\n       (1) jurisdiction over proposed legislation, messages, \n     petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the \n     Department of Homeland Security shall be consolidated in a \n     single committee in each House and such committee shall have \n     a nonpartisan staff; and\n       (2) jurisdiction over proposed legislation, messages, \n     petitions, memorials, and other matters related to \n     intelligence shall reside in--\n       (A) either a joint Senate-House authorizing committee \n     modeled on the former Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, or a \n     committee in each chamber with combined authorization and \n     appropriations authority; and\n       (B) regardless of which committee structure is selected, \n     the intelligence committee or committees shall have--\n       (i) not more than 9 members in each House, who shall serve \n     without term limits and of which at least 1 each shall also \n     serve on a committee on Armed Services, Judiciary, and \n     Foreign Affairs and at least 1 on a Defense Appropriations \n     subcommittee;\n       (ii) authority to issue subpoenas;\n       (iii) majority party representation that does not exceed \n     minority party representation by more than 1 member in each \n     House, and a nonpartisan staff; and\n       (iv) a subcommittee devoted solely to oversight.\n\n                   TITLE IV--PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION\n\n     SEC. 401. PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION.\n\n       (a) Services Provided President-Elect.--Section 3 of the \n     Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding after subsection (a)(8)(A)(iv) the following:\n       ``(v) Activities under this paragraph shall include the \n     preparation of a detailed classified, compartmented summary \n     by the relevant outgoing executive branch officials of \n     specific operational threats to national security; major \n     military or covert operations; and pending decisions on \n     possible uses of military force. This summary shall be \n     provided to the President-elect as soon as possible after the \n     date of the general elections held to determine the electors \n     of President and Vice President under section 1 or 2 of title \n     3, United States Code.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g);

REPORT ON THE USE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO COMBAT \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While terrorism is not caused by poverty, breeding \n     grounds for terrorism are created by backward economic \n     policies and repressive political regimes.\n       (2) Policies that support economic development and reform \n     also have political implications, as economic and political \n     liberties are often linked.\n       (3) The United States is working toward creating a Middle \n     East Free Trade Area by 2013 and implementing a free trade \n     agreement with Bahrain, and free trade agreements exist \n     between the United States and Israel and the United States \n     and Jordan.\n       (4) Existing and proposed free trade agreements between the \n     United States and Islamic countries are drawing interest from \n     other countries in the Middle East region, and Islamic \n     countries can become full participants in the rules-based \n     global trading system, as the United States considers \n     lowering its barriers to trade with the poorest Arab \n     countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a comprehensive United States strategy to counter \n     terrorism should include economic policies that encourage \n     development, open societies, and opportunities for people to \n     improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects \n     for their children's future;\n       (2) 1 element of such a strategy should encompass the \n     lowering of trade barriers with the poorest countries that \n     have a significant population of Arab or Muslim individuals;\n       (3) another element of such a strategy should encompass \n     United States efforts to promote economic reform in countries \n     that have a significant population of Arab or Muslim \n     individuals, including efforts to integrate such countries \n     into the global trading system; and\n       (4) given the importance of the rule of law in promoting \n     economic development and attracting investment, the United \n     States should devote an increased proportion of its \n     assistance to countries in the Middle East to the promotion \n     of the rule of law.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the efforts of the United States \n     Government to encourage development and promote economic \n     reform in countries that have a significant population of \n     Arab or Muslim individuals.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under this subsection \n     shall describe--\n       (A) efforts to integrate countries with significant \n     populations of Arab or Muslim individuals into the global \n     trading system; and\n       (B) actions that the United States Government, acting alone \n     and in partnership with other governments in the Middle East, \n     can take to promote intra-regional trade and the rule of law \n     in the region.\n\n     SEC. 511. MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for fiscal year 2005 $200,000,000 for the \n     Middle East Partnership Initiative.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     given the importance of the rule of law and economic reform \n     to development in the Middle East, a significant portion of \n     the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) \n     should be made available to promote the rule of law in the \n     Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 512. COMPREHENSIVE COALITION STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of \n     the United States relies on international cooperation.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of \n     United States Government contacts with foreign governments \n     concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but \n     such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a \n     comprehensive and unified approach.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n       (b) International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President--\n       (A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of \n     other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and \n     uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop \n     with those other governments a comprehensive coalition \n     strategy to fight Islamist terrorism; and\n       (B) to that end, should seek to establish an international \n     counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of \n     governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism \n     efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim \n     populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international \n     means for discussing and coordinating the development of \n     important counterterrorism policies by the participating \n     governments.\n       (2) Authority.--The President is authorized to establish an \n     international counterterrorism policy contact group with the \n     leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for \n     purposes as follows:\n       (A) To develop in common with such other countries \n     important policies and a strategy that address the various \n     components of international prosecution of the war on \n     terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address \n     military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, \n     and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to \n     interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-\n     related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating \n     to terrorist sanctuaries.\n       (B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President \n     and leaders of other participating governments determine \n     appropriate, such long-term issues as economic and political \n     reforms that can contribute to strengthening stability and \n     security in the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 513. DETENTION AND HUMANE TREATMENT OF CAPTURED \n                   TERRORISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Carrying out the global war on terrorism requires the \n     development of policies with respect to the detention and \n     treatment of captured international terrorists that is \n     adhered to by all coalition forces.\n       (2) Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment \n     of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3316) was specifically designed for cases in which the usual \n     rules of war do not apply, and the minimum standards of \n     treatment pursuant to such Article are generally accepted \n     throughout the world as customary international law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.--\n     The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment \n     or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, \n     or 14th amendment to the Constitution.\n       (2) Geneva conventions.--The term ``Geneva Conventions'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at \n     Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);\n       (B) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at \n     Sea, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);\n       (C) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners \n     of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n       (D) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3516).\n       (3) Prisoner.--The term ``prisoner'' means a foreign \n     individual captured, detained, interned, or otherwise held in \n     the custody of the United States.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       (5) Torture.--The term ``torture'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should engage countries that are \n     participating in the coalition to fight terrorism to develop \n     a common approach toward the detention and humane treatment \n     of captured international terrorists; and\n       (2) an approach toward the detention and humane treatment \n     of captured international terrorists developed by the \n     countries participating in the coalition to fight terrorism \n     could draw upon Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the \n     Treatment of Prisoners of War, the principles of which are \n     commonly accepted as minimum basic standards for humane \n     treatment of captured individuals.\n       (d) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to treat any prisoner humanely and in accordance with \n     standards that the Government of the United States would \n     determine to be consistent with international law if such \n     standards were applied to personnel of the United States \n     captured by an enemy in the war on terrorism;\n       (2) if there is any doubt as to whether a prisoner is \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, to provide the prisoner such protections until \n     the status of the prisoner is determined under the procedures \n     authorized by paragraph 1-6 of Army Regulation 190-8 (1997); \n     and\n       (3) to expeditiously prosecute cases of terrorism or other \n     criminal acts alleged to have been committed by prisoners in \n     the custody of the United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, in order to avoid the indefinite detention of such \n     prisoners.\n       (e) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment.--\n       (1) In general.--No prisoner shall be subject to torture or \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is \n     prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Relationship to geneva conventions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the status of any person under the \n     Geneva Conventions or whether any person is entitled to the \n     protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n       (f) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe the \n     rules, regulations, or guidelines necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the prohibition in subsection (e)(1) by the \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States and by any \n     person providing services to the Department of Defense on a \n     contract basis.\n       (2) Report to congress.--The Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress the rules, regulations, or guidelines prescribed \n     under paragraph (1), and any modifications to such rules, \n     regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications; and\n       (B) in a manner and form that will protect the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (g) Report on Possible Violations.--\n       (1) Requirement.--The Secretary shall submit, on a timely \n     basis and not less than twice each year, a report to Congress \n     on the circumstances surrounding any investigation of a \n     possible violation of the prohibition in subsection (e)(1) by \n     a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or by a \n     person providing services to the Department of Defense on a \n     contract basis.\n       (2) Form of report.--A report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in a manner and form that--\n       (A) will protect the national security interests of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) will not prejudice any prosecution of an individual \n     involved in, or responsible for, a violation of the \n     prohibition in subsection (e)(1).\n       (h) Report on a Coalition Approach Toward the Detention and \n     Humane Treatment of Captured Terrorists.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     efforts of the United States Government to develop an \n     approach toward the detention and humane treatment of \n     captured international terrorists that will be adhered to by \n     all countries that are members of the coalition against \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 514. PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make weapons of mass \n     destruction since 1994 or earlier.\n       (2) The United States doubtless would be a prime target for \n     use of any such weapon by al Qaeda.\n       (3) Although the United States Government has redoubled its \n     international commitments to supporting the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs, nonproliferation experts continue to \n     express deep concern about the United States Government's \n     commitment and approach to securing the weapons of mass \n     destruction and related highly dangerous materials that are \n     still scattered among Russia and other countries of the \n     former Soviet Union.\n       (4) The cost of increased investment in the prevention of \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     dangerous materials is greatly outweighed by the potentially \n     catastrophic cost to the United States of use of weapons of \n     mass destruction or related dangerous materials by the \n     terrorists who are so eager to acquire them.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) maximum effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, wherever such proliferation may occur, \n     is warranted; and\n       (2) the programs of the United States Government to prevent \n     or counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     including the Proliferation Security Initiative, the programs \n     for Cooperative Threat Reduction, and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs, should be expanded, improved, and better \n     funded to address the global dimensions of the proliferation \n     threat.\n       (c) Requirement for Strategy.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress--\n       (1) a strategy for expanding and strengthening the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative, the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction, and other nonproliferation \n     assistance programs; and\n       (2) an estimate of the funding necessary to execute that \n     strategy.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n       (d) Report on Reforming the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     Program and Other Non-Proliferation Assistance Programs.--Not \n     later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report \n     evaluating whether the United States could more effectively \n     address the global threat of nuclear proliferation by--\n       (1) establishing a central coordinator for the programs for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction;\n       (2) eliminating the requirement that the President spend no \n     more than $50,000,000 annually on programs for Cooperative \n     Threat Reduction and other non-proliferation assistance \n     programs carried out outside the former Soviet Union; or\n       (3) repealing the provisions of the Soviet Nuclear Threat \n     Reduction Act of 1991 (22 U.S.C. 2551 note) that place \n     conditions on assistance to the former Soviet Union unrelated \n     to bilateral cooperation on weapons dismantlement.\n\n     SEC. 515. FINANCING OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While efforts to designate and freeze the assets of \n     terrorist financiers have been relatively unsuccessful, \n     efforts to target the relatively small number of al Qaeda \n     financial facilitators have been valuable and successful.\n       (2) The death or capture of several important financial \n     facilitators has decreased the amount of money available to \n     al Qaeda, and has made it more difficult for al Qaeda to \n     raise and move money.\n       (3) The capture of al Qaeda financial facilitators has \n     provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to \n     continue the cycle of disruption.\n       (4) The United States Government has rightly recognized \n     that information about terrorist money helps in understanding \n     terror networks, searching them out, and disrupting their \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the primary weapon in the effort to stop terrorist \n     financing should be the targeting of terrorist financial \n     facilitators by intelligence and law enforcement agencies; \n     and\n       (2) efforts to track terrorist financing must be paramount \n     in United States counter-terrorism efforts.\n       (c) Report on Terrorist Financing.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report evaluating the effectiveness of United \n     States efforts to curtail the international financing of \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     evaluate and make recommendations on--\n       (A) the effectiveness of efforts and methods to track \n     terrorist financing;\n       (B) ways to improve international governmental cooperation \n     in this effort;\n       (C) ways to improve performance of financial institutions \n     in this effort;\n       (D) the adequacy of agency coordination in this effort and \n     ways to improve that coordination; and\n       (E) recommendations for changes in law and additional \n     resources required to improve this effort.\n\n           TITLE VI--TERRORIST TRAVEL AND EFFECTIVE SCREENING\n\n     SEC. 601. COUNTERTERRORIST TRAVEL INTELLIGENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as \n     weapons since terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, \n     train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack sites.\n       (2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists \n     because they must surface to pass through regulated channels, \n     present themselves to border security officials, or attempt \n     to circumvent inspection points.\n       (3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to \n     travel, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, \n     specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt \n     government officials, human smuggling networks, supportive \n     travel agencies, and immigration and identity fraud.\n       (4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency \n     systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies. If an \n     agency had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways \n     in which the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been \n     systematically, but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our \n     border security since the early 1990s.\n       (5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to \n     interception by border authorities. Analyzing their \n     characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could \n     have allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers \n     and a more effective use of information available in \n     Government databases could have identified some of the \n     hijackers.\n       (6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the \n     aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting \n     against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and \n     opportunities.\n       (7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since \n     September 11, 2001, have not been adequately integrated into \n     the front lines of border security.\n       (8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence \n     collection and analysis program currently in place has \n     produced useful results and should be expanded.\n       (b) Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to Congress unclassified and classified versions \n     of a strategy for combining terrorist travel intelligence, \n     operations, and law enforcement into a cohesive effort to \n     intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and \n     constrain terrorist mobility domestically and \n     internationally.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry \nout a program of outreach to veterans of World War II and the Korean \nconflict on the nature and availability of benefits for veterans, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today which would direct the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) to provide a new, targeted program of outreach to \nveterans of World War II and the Korean conflict. The purpose of the \nprogram would be to inform these veterans, most of whom are now over \nthe age of 70, of the veterans benefits to which they may be entitled, \nand to encourage them to apply for those benefits. The center piece of \nthe new outreach program would be a $35 million nationwide public \nservice announcement campaign through various print, radio, and \ntelevision media outlets. I believe such a campaign would be the most \neffective, and efficient, way to ``get the word out'' about VA benefits \nand services, but my legislation gives VA flexibility to devise other \nmeans if appropriate.\n  I am concerned that there are a number of older veterans who served \nduring World War II and the Korean conflict, and who are entitled to \nbenefits from VA, are simply not aware of that fact. A recent article \nin the Philadelphia Inquirer told the story of a World War II veteran \nfrom Missouri who filed a claim for benefits in 1947 for a cold-weather \ninjury suffered while wading through an icy French harbor. The claim \nwas denied, but because of intensive outreach conducted the State of \nMissouri over 50 years later, the veteran recently was awarded 100 \npercent disability compensation. The same article cities survey data \nfrom VA which suggest that over one-half million veterans might be \neligible for VA compensation benefits--if only they would file claims. \nA similar inference can be drawn from data from the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration Fiscal year 2003 Annual Benefits Report which show that \neven though veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict comprise \n31.6 percent of the total veteran population, only 23.2 percent of the \ntotal number of veterans actually receiving VA disability compensation \nare veterans of WWII and the Korean conflict. Further, it is a fact \nthat Korean conflict and World War II veterans who are receiving \ncompensation are compensated for fewer disabilities, on average, than \nare later generations of veterans.\n  I suspect that one reason for these discrepancies might be found in \nthe fact that VA and the Department of Defense (DoD) now do a far \nbetter job than in prior years of educating service members of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. This year, VA compiled a report on \nits outreach activities--a report that was requested by Senator Russ \nFeingold and me--which outlines at great length programs--all laudable \nprograms--of outreach specifically targeting service members and \nveterans recently discharged from service. For example, VA has a \npresence at 136 military installations which enables service members to \nreceive complete medical examinations and disability ratings prior to \ndischarge from service. VA and DoD also cooperate in providing \nintensive transition workshops for departing service members. I commend \nboth VA and DoD for their outreach activities, particularly for such \nactivities that target service members returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Clearly, VA and DoD have made great strides in informing \nservice members and veterans of their benefits at the point in their \nlives when such information is most useful, namely, at discharge from \nservice. However, the intensity and breadth of outreach activities that \nare now the norm for the current generation of newly discharged \nveterans simply were not undertaken when World War II and Korean \nconflict veterans left service.\n  The Nation recently honored the World War II generation with the \ndedication of the World War II Memorial in Washington, and with \ncelebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. Just \nlast year, we marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the Korean \nconflict. While the fan fare surrounding these events has waned, our \nefforts on behalf of veterans of these wars must not. It is imperative \nwe make final attempts to let them, and their families, known of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. The legislation provides a first \nstep to that end. I ask my colleagues for their support, and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Government \n     Reorganization Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     responsibility to promote the welfare of the native people of \n     the United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (4) under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm \n     treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land to address the conditions \n     of Native Hawaiians in the Federal territory that later \n     became the State of Hawaii;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes Commission \n     Act assists the members of the Native Hawaiian community in \n     maintaining distinct native settlements throughout the State \n     of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands and approximately 18,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress established \n     a public trust (commonly known as the ``ceded lands trust''), \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     an important foundation for the ability of the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     survival and economic self-sufficiency of the Native Hawaiian \n     people;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii;\n       (12) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (13) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished to the United States their claims to \n     their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (A) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (B) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians; and\n       (C) to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process as called for in the Apology Resolution;\n       (15) despite the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their \n     separate identity as a distinct native community through \n     cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination, self-governance, and economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (16) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction;\n       (xii) traditional justice programs, and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (18) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (19) this Act provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing entity for the \n     purpose of giving expression to their rights as native people \n     to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (20) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     responsibility for the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States, including Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct group of \n     indigenous, native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (21) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States' responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands that comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (22) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people who \n     exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the indigenous, native \n     people of a once-sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States; and\n       (23) the State of Hawaii supports the reaffirmation of the \n     political and legal relationship between the Native Hawaiian \n     governing entity and the United States as evidenced by 2 \n     unanimous resolutions enacted by the Hawaii State Legislature \n     in the 2000 and 2001\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\n     sessions of the Legislature and by the testimony of the \n     Governor of the State of Hawaii before the Committee on \n     Indian Affairs of the Senate on February 25, 2003.\n\n     SEC. 3.
