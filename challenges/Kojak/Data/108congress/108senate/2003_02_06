ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will return to executive session to resume consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, it is ironic that one of the arguments \nagainst Miguel Estrada, the President's nominee for the D.C. Circuit \nCourt, center around prior judicial experience. This argument is \nnothing but hollow political rhetoric aimed at obstructing the Senate's \nconstitutional duty to confirm judges. It is also a double standard of \nthe highest order. To illustrate this point, I bring a Colorado legend \nto the attention of my colleagues. Byron ``Whizzer'' White may have \npassed away almost a year ago, but the Centennial State will forever \nfeel his commanding presence. Mr. White was born in Fort Collins, CO, \nnot far from where I live and where my family lives, and was raised in \nnearby Wellington. He went on to become his high school's \nvaledictorian, All-American football star, college valedictorian, \nRhodes\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nscholar, professional football player, and a decorated World War II \nsoldier. Noting his many significant achievements, President John \nF.Kennedy nominated him to the Supreme Court in 1962, saying, Byron \nWhite ``excelled at everything he has ever attempted.'' White, at only \n44 years of age, ascended to the bench of our Nation's highest court \nand went on to serve for three decades.\n\n  Why is this significant? It is significant because had President \nKennedy adhered to such a rigid litmus test, Byron White would never \nhave been seated on the bench of the United States Supreme Court. \nAdherence to the experience litmus test would mean that five of the \neight judges currently serving on the D.C. Circuit would not have been \nconfirmed because they had no previous judicial experience--including \ntwo of President Clinton's nominees, Merrick Garland and David Tatel, \nand one appointed by President Carter, Judge Harry Edwards, who was \nyounger than Mr. Estrada currently is.\n  It is obvious that the opposition to Miguel Estrada is not concerned \nwith merit or intellect. They are more concerned with partisan \npolitics. Their work is concentrated on holding our Nation hostage to \ntheir rigid ideology, unprecedented in the consideration of judges. \nWhile caseloads in the Federal courts continue to increase dramatically \nand filings reach all-time highs, the opposition pursues an agenda of \nobstruction, aimed at disrupting the justice that is guaranteed by our \nConstitution, and creating a vacancy crisis in the Federal courts. \nChief Justice William Rehnquist recently warned that the current number \nof vacancies, combined with the rising caseloads, threatens the proper \nfunctioning of the Federal courts.\n  This is a time in our Nation's history when our courts ought to be \nfully up and functioning. It is a time when there are lots of national \nsecurity concerns centered around terrorist threats. These \nextraordinary delays must end. Miguel Estrada is a highly qualified and \nrespected individual who deserves the Senate's consideration.\n  Mr. Estrada is a man of legal experience, a man of keen intellect and \nstrong character. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court and \nhas served both as a Federal prosecutor and Assistant United States \nSolicitor General. If confirmed, he will be the first Hispanic to serve \non the DC Circuit. I think that is significant. And he will be a \nprincipal asset to our system of justice.\n  Miguel Estrada has received the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. He has received strong support from those who know him the \nbest--the Hispanic legal community, including the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation. I believe he has earned a vote in the Senate. He has \nearned my respect and my support, and I plan to vote for Miguel \nEstrada.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto proceed for 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am happy to be able to take the floor \nthis morning to argue in favor of Miguel Estrada. Miguel is one of the \nfinest lawyers in the country. He has arrived at this position and \nstatus, where he is approved by the American Bar Association as \n``unanimously well qualified,'' the highest rating that the American \nBar Association can give. He has had his critics, but only in \ngeneralized terms. He has had his critics who I don't think have a leg \nto stand on in the criticism they are raising.\n  One of the more ridiculous assertions that I have heard about Miguel \nis that he was not especially or sufficiently responsive at his hearing \nand therefore we need to have a second hearing to evaluate him. Keep in \nmind, the Democrats were in control of the Judiciary Committee. They \ncalled the hearing, they controlled the hearing, they controlled the \ntiming of the hearing, they controlled the time for questions by \nSenators. And at least one Democrat said the hearing was conducted in a \nfair and responsible manner, and I personally agree with that. Senator \nSchumer was the person who chaired that particular hearing. I give him \na lot of credit because it was a fair hearing and they asked every \nquestion they wanted to ask.\n  Secondly, after the hearing, on the Judiciary Committee we have a \nright to ask questions in writing. Only two Democrats asked questions \nin writing. Miguel Estrada had waited 631 days before he was given the \nprivilege of having a hearing. Then the hearing was held.\n  Now we are hearing the same old wornout complaints that he wasn't \nsufficiently responsive and that, therefore, we need a second hearing \nto evaluate him.\n  Since Mr. Estrada didn't say anything at the hearing that could be \nused to besmirch him--that is the real problem; they could not find \nanything wrong with him; there is not one thing that anybody has said, \nother than generalizations, that has any merit at all--since they could \nnot find anything at his hearing that could be used to criticize him, \nhis opponents resorted to the tactic of alleging that he did not say \nenough. That is ridiculous. They controlled everything. They could have \nasked him anything, and I think they did. Now, he didn't say enough.\n  The fact is that Mr. Estrada correctly refused to answer questions \nthat called upon him to prejudge issues that may very well come before \nhim as a judge. That is what every nominee with any brains has done \nfrom time immemorial. No nominee wants to have to recuse himself in a \nserious case later because of something he said before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Well, let me repeat that. The fact is that Mr. \nEstrada correctly refused to answer questions that called upon him to \nprejudge issues that may very well come before him as a judge. This \nincludes his opinion on whether established precedent was correctly \ndecided and how he would decide these cases if he were working from a \nclean slate.\n  Lloyd Cutler, who was the White House chief counsel in both the \nCarter and Clinton administrations, and one of the premier lawyers in \nthe country--certainly in this town--and one of the great public \nservants of all time, in my opinion, put it best when he said:\n\n       [I]t would be a tragic development if ideology became an \n     increasingly important consideration in the future. To make \n     ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to suggest \n     that the legal process is and should be a political one. This \n     is not only wrong as a matter of political science; it also \n     serves to weaken public confidence in the courts. Just as \n     candidates should put aside their partisan political views \n     when appointed to the bench, so too should they put aside \n     ideology.\n\n  This is Lloyd Cutler, who was chief White House counsel for \nPresidents Carter and Clinton. He goes on to say:\n\n       To retain either is to betray dedication to the process of \n     impartial judging. Men and women qualified by training to be \n     judges generally do not wish to and do not indulge in \n     partisan or ideological approaches to their work.\n\n  Mr. Cutler concluded:\n\n       Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.\n\n  I agree with him, and so did all the Democrats on the committee when \nPresident Clinton's nominees came before the committee. Now all of a \nsudden, they are applying a double standard or a different standard to \nMiguel Estrada and, I might add, other Republican nominees who are \ncoming before the committee.\n  We should be commending Mr. Estrada for refusing to take the bait and \nanswer these questions. Instead he is being criticized for it and, I \nthink, in the view of any impartial observer, is being criticized \nunfairly for one reason: They just do not want a Republican \nconservative Hispanic to sit on the Circuit Court of Appeals in this \ncountry. That is wrong. We all know it is wrong, and yet that is what \nis behind much of the antagonism toward Mr. Estrada.\n  As a fundamental matter, I am perplexed by the charges that Mr. \nEstrada's record is blank. That is what\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nwe call bullcorn out in Utah. The truth is, Mr. Estrada's record is \nreplete with material we used to evaluate his qualifications for the \nbench and how he would go about deciding cases. He has written numerous \ncomplex and thorough briefs for the courts, and he has argued on a wide \nrange of subjects.\n  His briefs, all of which are publicly available--and I know the \nDemocrat staffers have pored over every one of them--provide tremendous \ninsight into his legal reasoning and thinking on constitutional and \nstatutory interpretation. His achievement of having argued 15 cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court provides a record of how he has responded \nto focused interrogation on the most important matters to America's \nhighest court. The transcripts from these oral arguments are also \npublicly available. Where is the legitimate complaint by the other side \nabout this blank-slate business?\n  Still further, Mr. Estrada not only said at his hearing he would \nsupport established law, but he proved this when he wrote an amicus \nbrief at the Solicitor General's office in support of the National \nOrganization for Women. I do not hear any compliments from the other \nside on his work there. His support of a law that backed a reproductive \nchoice side in that case indicates there is no reason to expect he \nwould not follow Roe and Casey as a DC Circuit Court judge, and yet \nthat has underlined many of the complaints by my friends on the other \nside. They are so afraid that somebody on these Circuit Courts of \nAppeals might possibly do something to overrule Roe v. Wade or Planned \nParenthood v. Casey, two very important abortion cases.\n  I have not heard one President Bush nominee say he or she will not \nuphold the laws of this land, including Roe v. Wade and Planned \nParenthood v. Casey. The truth is, many on the other side have not even \nliked Planned Parenthood v. Casey because it does take a more moderate \nposition with regard to abortion. Now it is the law of the land and, of \ncourse, it is one of the cases they certainly do not want to have \noverruled.\n  Mr. Estrada's opponents are so eager to distort his record that they \ndo not mention this case or any one of many other cases which reveal \nhis legal reasoning and willingness to follow the law.\n  It needs to be explained to everybody that not only do they have \naccess to all these briefs he has written, both in the Supreme Court \nand other courts of the land, but they could have asked any question \nthey wanted of Mr. Estrada. Any member of the committee can do that. \nSome may be ill-advised and not very fair, but we allow them to ask any \nquestions they want. Then they can ask any questions in writing. In \nalmost every case, Mr. Estrada asked to meet with individual Senators \nbeforehand so they could meet privately and ask any questions they had.\n\n  Mr. Estrada today is known all over the country by those who really \nunderstand important lawyers and understand the success of lawyers--\nworking with one of the most important law firms in the country as a \nfull partner, and he has both Democrat and Republican partners. I might \nadd, some of the leading people in support of Mr. Estrada today are \nDemocratic attorneys--not just attorneys, but top attorneys--and we \nhave mentioned them, from Ron Klain to Seth Waxman, Klain having been \nVice President Gore's chief counsel, both as Vice President and in his \ncampaigns. Ron Klain used to work on the Judiciary Committee as one of \nthe top judiciary staff people. He is an excellent lawyer and a \nwonderful person. We all care for him. I personally care for him, and \none reason I do is because he is honest, not just honest enough to say \nhow good Miguel Estrada is and to back him, but honest in his dealings \nin legal matters as well. I have a lot of respect for him. Seth Waxman \nis one of the premier lawyers in the country, no question about it. He \nknows I have a lot of respect for him, and it is not just because of \nwork on the Judiciary Committee. He is a fine lawyer, one of the best \nand former Solicitors General of the United States in the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Some have advanced the preposterous argument that Miguel Estrada is \nnot qualified to serve on the DC Circuit because he has no prior \njudicial experience. That is one of the most ridiculous arguments of \nall. Of all the ridiculous arguments his opponents have drummed up, to \nme this is the most ludicrous. There are literally hundreds of examples \nof judicial nominees who have gone on to serve as great Federal judges \nat both the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court levels despite having no \nprior judicial experience.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist in his 2001 yearend report on the Federal \njudiciary noted:\n\n       The Federal judiciary has traditionally drawn from a wide \n     diversity of professional backgrounds with many of our well-\n     respected judges coming from private practice.\n\n  Such Justices included Louis Brandeis, who spent his whole career in \nprivate practice before he was named to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1916 \nand came to be known as ``the people's attorney'' for his pro bono \nwork.\n  Supreme Court Justice Byron White--I knew Byron White very well. He \nwas very friendly to me throughout my career. He spent 14 years in \nprivate practice and 2 years at the Justice Department before his \nappointment to the Court by President Kennedy in 1962. He is a \nwonderful man. Byron White served this country well and his memory will \nalways be a good memory. Byron White moved from the left to the center \nto even a little bit to the right on the Court, and that did not please \na lot of our friends on the other side.\n  Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall had no judicial experience \nwhen President Kennedy recess-appointed him to his first judgeship in \nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961. Justice Marshall had \nserved in private practice and as special counsel and director of the \nNAACP prior to his appointment. I do not think anybody would doubt he \nmade a very important contribution to the jurisprudence of this \ncountry.\n  Several well-respected members of the DC Circuit, including two of \nPresident Clinton's three appointments to that court, arrived with no \nprior judicial experience.\n  Merrick Garland: I have a lot of regard for Merrick Garland. I helped \nto see him get through when there was some opposition to him. He was a \nClinton appointee. He served at the Department of Justice and was in \nprivate practice. He was never on the bench prior to his appointment.\n  David Tatel, also a Clinton appointee, had served in private practice \nfor 15 years prior to his appointment. In fact, only three of 18 judges \nconfirmed to the DC Circuit before President Carter's term began in \n1977 previously served as judges.\n  For example, Abner Mikva, appointed by President Carter, was in \nprivate practice for 16 years in Chicago, served in the Illinois \nLegislature and in the U.S. Congress and had no judicial experience \nprior to his appointment in 1979 to the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  Other Democrat-appointed DC Circuit judges with no prior judicial \nexperience include Harry Edwards, Patricia Wald, and notably Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, now sitting on the Supreme Court.\n  Several other Clinton appointees to the Courts of Appeals received \ntheir appointments despite having no prior judicial experience: Ninth \nCircuit appointees Richard Tallman, Marsha Berzon, Ronald Gould, \nRaymond Fisher, William Fletcher--who was a law professor at Boalt Hall \nat Berkeley--Margaret McKeown, Sidney Thomas, and Michael Hawkins all \nhad no judicial experience prior to taking the bench.\n  Seven of these eight, all but Fletcher, were in private practice when \nthey were nominated by President Clinton.\n  Second Circuit appointees Robert Katzmann, Robert David Sack, and \nChester Straub had no judicial experience prior to their appointments. \nThird circuit nominee Thomas Ambro, Fourth Circuit nominees Robert King \nand Blane Michael, and Sixth Circuit nominee Eric Clay and Karen Moore \nalso had no prior judicial experience.\n  What is the point? Is it that it is all right for Democrat Presidents \nto appoint people without prior judicial experience, who become very \ngood judges on the bench, but it is not all right for Republican \nPresidents to do so? Is it all right to have more moderate-to-liberal \nappointees who have never had any judicial experience, but it is not \nall right to have moderate-to-conservative appointees appointed by a \nRepublican President? It is all right to have liberal\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nHispanics appointed to the courts--I agree with that--but it is not all \nright to have a Republican Hispanic who, perish the thought, Democrats \nthink may be conservative?\n  Given this illustrious group of former practitioners like Mr. \nEstrada, who were not Federal judges, I find it hard to swallow that \nMr. Estrada's lack of prior judicial service should somehow be counted \nas a strike against him.\n  I noticed this morning in the New York Times--now, I read the New \nYork Times regularly. It is a very important paper in this country, and \nI have a great deal of respect for most of the people who work at the \nNew York Times, but their editorial department has been almost \namazingly inaccurate--not almost amazingly, it has been amazingly \ninaccurate.\n  Today, they have an editorial dated February 6, 2003, entitled \n``Steamrolling Judicial Nominees.'' They say:\n\n       The new Senate Republican majority is ushering in an era of \n     conveyer-belt confirmations of Bush administration judicial \n     nominations. No matter which party holds the gavel, the \n     Federal courts are too important for the Senate to give short \n     shrift to its constitutional role of advice and consent.\n\n  I agree with that. I do not think we should give short shrift to any \ndegree. These are important positions. They are lifetime appointments. \nWe ought to do a thorough examination of them.\n  So everybody understands, and I want the New York Times editorial \nboard to understand, before a person even comes up to the Senate, that \nperson has been evaluated by the White House, by the White House \nCounsel's Office, by the Justice Department. There has been a complete \nFBI review of that person's life. The FBI interviews just about \neverybody who wants to be interviewed and some who do not want to be \ninterviewed. The interviews range from people who love the candidate or \nthe nominee to people who hate his or her guts.\n  There are people who make scurrilous comments, all kinds of anonymous \nthings. These are raw reports that come into the FBI file. They report \nit all. Then it comes to the Judiciary Committee, and the chairman and \nranking member and our staffs go through those FBI reports with a fine-\ntooth comb.\n  To the credit of both the Republicans and Democrats--or Democrats and \nRepublicans, I should say--both sides have worked very well to get rid \nof the chaff and to do what is in the best interest of this country and \nto be fair to these nominees. That is a very arduous process. The \nminute they decide to pick one of these people, or even maybe before \nsometimes, they then tell the American Bar Association--not because \nthey have a formal role in the process but because we want to have the \nleading bar association in the country involved. At least the Democrats \nhave always wanted to have them involved. I have to admit I did not \nwant to have them involved when they were not being very fair, when \nthere was bias and bigotry, but there is none of that now. I think they \nare doing a terrific job now, and as long as they do it fairly and down \nthe middle, without bias and without being political, they are going to \nhave my support, and I support them right now. But we then have the \nAmerican Bar Association look into these people and they go right into \nthe person's hometown. They talk to the attorneys who know him. They \ntalk to their top attorneys whom they know are people of integrity and \nability and leaders in the bar in their community. They talk to just \nabout everybody who has any interest in the nominee, and this has all \nbeen done for Mr. Estrada. Then they sit down and they have their \nstanding committee make an evaluation of these nominees.\n\n  These evaluations are tough evaluations, especially on those who do \nnot come out of them very well. In this case, Mr. Estrada has a \n``unanimously well-qualified'' rating from the Standing Committee of \nthe American Bar Association--I should say from the American Bar \nAssociation because they represent the whole bar. That is something \nthat does not always happen. In fact, it does not happen very often, to \nhave ``unanimously well-qualified.''\n  All of that is unbelievably difficult for the nominee. The nominee \nhas to sign a disclosure form that just about lays bare everything in \nthat nominee's life. One can see why some people do not even want to \nbecome judges anymore. Some of the greatest lawyers in the country, who \nwould serve on the bench, do not want to go through this process. The \ninvestigation of the nominee includes Finances and everything, it is \nall laid out; cases are laid out. They are asked questions that are \nvery intrusive into their lives. I think the questionnaire is too \nstrong, but it has been very difficult to change over the years. That \nis what they go through. Then they are nominated. The Judiciary \nCommittee then starts its work, and we go through every one of these \ndocuments.\n  We go through that FBI report with a fine-tooth comb. If there is \nanything left undone, we then ask the FBI to follow up. We do not leave \nanything undone to the extent that we can. If there are some particular \nproblems, we bring both sides of the Judiciary Committee together and \ntell them these are problems. We disclose it to the members of the \nJudiciary Committee. The ranking member will disclose it to his side. \nThe Chairman discloses it to his or her side.\n  Once that is done, then we set it for a hearing. The hearings usually \ndo not last days at a time for circuit court nominees or district court \nnominees. They are generally a 1-day affair, as they should be, because \nwe have all this information. Anybody can cull through all that \ninformation, and their staffs really do. Sometimes they are looking for \ndirt, looking for things they can raise that might make the process \nbetter in some cases or that might scuttle a President's nominee in \nother cases. There is a lot of partisanship sometimes. That is not all \nbad because we want the best people we can get to serve on the Federal \nbench in this country.\n  This editorial indicates this is just a steamrolling of nominees. \nNow, that is crazy. In the case of Estrada, his nomination has been \npending for 631 days, having had every aspect of his life combed over \nand because they cannot find anything to smear him with or find fault \nwith--it depends on who the person is--or to criticize, all of a sudden \nhe is being steamrolled.\n  Well, 631 days is almost 2 years. It is way too long. I have to \nadmit, there were some mistakes when I was chairman during the Clinton \nyears, but nobody should doubt for a minute that President Clinton was \ntreated fairly. President Reagan was the all-time confirmation champion \nwith 382 judges confirmed in his 8 years, and he had a Republican \nSenate to help him do it. President Clinton had virtually the same \nnumber, 377, as the all-time champion, and he had 6 years of an \nopposition party to help him do it. I know. I was the chairman during \nthat time, and I did everything I could personally to help the \nPresident because he was our President. There was only one person voted \ndown in that whole time, and I have to admit I do not feel good about \nthat. And there were less people left holding at the end than there \nwere when Democrats had control of the committee.\n  Going back to this editorial, because I want to help my friends at \nthe New York Times to be a little more accurate--frankly, I think they \ncan use some help because their editorials, especially in this area, \nhave been awful. And this is a perfect illustration.\n  Going to the second paragraph:\n\n       Republicans on the Judiciary Committee held a single \n     hearing last week for three controversial appeals court \n     nominees.\n\n  Just for information, that was Jeffrey Sutton. That was John Roberts, \nand a wonderful woman named Cook--Sutton and Cook and Bill Roberts from \nDC Court of Appeals.\n\n  By the way, all three are well known. Sutton is one of the top \nappellate lawyers in the country; Roberts, who was considered if not \nthe top, one of the two top appellate lawyers before the Supreme Court \nof the United States; and Cook is a Supreme Court justice in Ohio.\n\n       Republicans on the Judiciary Committee held a single \n     hearing last week for three controversial appeals court \n     nominees. There was no way, given the format, for Senators to \n     consider each nominee with care.\n\n  We held one of the longest hearings ever on record, from 9:30 in the \nmorning until 9:30 that night. I was willing to stay longer. I told the \nCommittee we would finish that hearing that day and I would stay as \nlong as it took.\n\n       There was no way, given the format, for senators to \n     consider each nominee with care.\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\n     A fourth nominee had a hearing yesterday, and a fifth is \n     likely to have one next week.\n\n  What is wrong with that? They have been sitting there for months and \nmonths and they are high-quality people. They have gone through this \nhorrendous process to get to where they have a hearing.\n\n       During the Clinton years, the committee took six months or \n     more to consider the number of appeals court nominees this \n     committee is hearing from in two weeks.\n\n  I would add that many nominees have been waiting longer, not 6 months \nor more, 2 years, in the ones we have called up.\n  By the way, Mr. Roberts had been sitting there since 1990 or 1991 or \n1992. I know he has been sitting there for at least 11 years. He has \nbeen nominated three times. This is too much of a rush? Give me a \nbreak. They took a lot longer than 6 months to consider the Bush \nnominees.\n\n       The nominees being whisked through all have records that \n     cry out for greater scrutiny.\n\n  I have covered how scrutinizing we are in the committee. We do not \nmiss anything. My friends on the other side do not miss anything. We \ndon't either.\n\n       One, Jeffrey Sutton, is a leading states' rights advocate \n     who in 2001 persuaded the Supreme Court to rule against a \n     nurse with breast cancer on the ground that the Americans \n     With Disabilities Act does not apply to state employers.\n\n  I was one of the authors of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I \nwas not enthused about that case. But the fact is, it was a legitimate \nlegal matter and he had every right to represent the States in that \nmatter. The attitude around here is, if he represented the States, it \nmust have been wrong. Or, if he represents big corporations, he must be \nwrong.\n  Sometimes the States are right. Sometimes the corporations are right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  There is some statement in there that sounds odd to me. They \ncriticize Mr. Sutton for persuading the Supreme Court, like it is \nsomething bad. And I make a note that the Supreme Court ruled with him \nand agreed with his position.\n  I know the Senator is so knowledgeable about these issues. I just \nask, Is there something wrong, is it disqualifying for an attorney to \nprevail on the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. HATCH. Apparently to the New York Times. The fact is, that case \nwas written by the Supreme Court. He advocated, as any advocate, and he \nwas representing, as I recall, one of the States.\n\n       Another, Deborah Cook, regularly sides, as a state judge, \n     with corporations.\n\n  Oh, my goodness. You mean we have somebody who will be on the Federal \nbench who occasionally finds corporations might be right? What a \nterrible thing that must be, that corporations are right? Let's be \nhonest about it. A lot of employment cases, almost every one that is \ngood, is settled before it gets to court. It is only the hard cases \nthat basically have to be tried. And in many instances, those cases are \nnot good cases. Some on the other side seem to think, well, she sides \nwith corporations. My gosh, she sides with who is right. And that is \nwhat we should do.\n  Admittedly, sometimes it was a dissent, and she was known for the \ndissent. That is not bad. Dissenting judges play a noble role. You can \ndisagree with cases but you cannot disagree with her integrity. No one \nwould attack her integrity.\n\n       In one case she maintained that a worker whose employer \n     lied to him about his exposure to dangerous chemicals should \n     not be able to sue for his injuries.\n\n  That is the most oversimplification I have ever seen. It is wrong.\n\n       Jay Bybee, who was heard from yesterday, has argued that \n     United States senators should be elected by state \n     legislators, not the voters.\n\n  That is purely wrong; it is bunk. The fact is, this system we have is \na good system. But we know one time Senators were elected by State \nlegislatures. He has expounded on that.\n\n       Questions have also been raised about whether, as a White \n     House aide, Mr. Bybee attempted to suppress a criminal \n     investigation of financing of Iraqi weapons purchases.\n\n  Come on. That is totally bunk. They have not talked to Mr. Bybee and \ngiven him any consideration. That, first, should never have been \ndisclosed. But it was. And not one person asked a question about it. I \nam sure they will say they were watching Colin Powell's speech. I was \nnot. I was sitting there in committee, making sure they had a chance to \nask any questions they wanted. We delayed the committee until after \nColin Powell finished to enable any Democrat to come, and at least two \nsaid they would come, to come back and question. They did not come \nback.\n\n       The committee's new leadership showed similar recklessness \n     when it waved Miguel Estrada through on a straight party-line \n     vote.\n\n  What are we suppose to do if the other side plays politics with the \njudges? They did not have one good argument through the whole process, \nand we have had a horrendous process to begin with that took 631 days \nbefore he came to the committee. The only reason he came then was \nbecause the Republicans took control of the Senate. Thank goodness for \nthat or he would never have come up. He would never have had a chance. \nWe all know it around here.\n\n  ``Mr. Estrada, a conservative lawyer''--who knows if he is. I don't \nknow his ideology. I know he is a great lawyer. And I presume, as I am \nsure the President does, that he is probably moderate to conservative.\n  ``Mr. Estrada, a conservative lawyer with almost no paper trail,''--I \njust made the case there is a paper trail on him--``refused to answer \nsenators' questions on crucial issues like abortion.'' Give me a break. \nHe did answer. He said that he would apply the law regardless of his \npersonal viewpoints.\n  This is a man who argued the case for NOW. Who knows where he \nstands--I don't know. All I can say is that is a ridiculous statement. \nI guess editorials can be ridiculous, but this one is particularly.\n\n       Meanwhile, the White House refused to hand over memos Mr. \n     Estrada wrote as a government lawyer that could have shed \n     light on his beliefs.\n\n  They wanted memos on that side because they could not find anything \nelse to give him a rough time about. They wanted memos on that side \nfrom the Solicitor General's office and seven former Solicitors \nGeneral, four of whom are Democrats, came in and said that would be a \nvery inadvisable thing to do because it would chill the work of the \nSolicitor General's office. People would not give their honest opinions \nif they knew that later they would be pilloried with those in the \nSenate of the United States.\n\n       Meanwhile, the White House refused to hand over memos Mr. \n     Estrada wrote as a government lawyer that could shed light on \n     his beliefs.\n\n  Mr. Estrada said it would have been all right with him. He is proud \nof his work.\n  I have to say that the greater approach would be to recognize that \nthere are some things that have to be privileged. As I say, all seven \nliving former Solicitors General have said that.\n  ``The Bush administration is naturally going to nominate candidates \nfor the bench who are more conservative than some Democrats would \nlike,''--that is fair--``and the Republican majority in the Senate is \ngoing to approve them.'' That is fair. ``That does not mean, however, \nthat the administration should be allowed to act without scrutiny,''--\nthat is not fair, because it is tremendously scrutinized--``and pack \nthe courts with new judges who hold views that are out of whack with \nthose of the vast majority of Americans.''\n  Now, come on.\n\n       We fear that that is what the hasty hearing process is \n     trying to--\n\n  Come on. Hasty--631 days before he even gets a hearing with all of \nthat scrutinization that has gone on? It is not fair. This editorial is \nnot fair.\n  I call on my friends at the New York Times: be fair about the judges. \nI know the paper is more liberal than I, and I expect you to be more \nliberal. But I expect you to be fair. This business about three judges \nbeing called at one time--they have been sitting there for 631 days or \nmore; actually more. They have been sitting there since May 9, 2001. \nThey have been scrutinized to death. We gave every opportunity to \nquestion and every opportunity to file additional questions.\n\n  By the way, I remember during the Carter years, when Senator Kennedy \nwas chairman of the committee, if I recall correctly we had seven \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\nnominees on one hearing. Is it wrong for Republicans to try to move \nthese judges after all of these delays when they have the opportunity \nto do so, but not wrong for the Democrats to move the judges they want \nmoved when they have control of the White House and the Judiciary \nCommittee? I don't think there should be a double standard. I wanted to \nmove as many of those May 9 judges as we could. If you will take note, \nthe next week we had only one and that was Jay Bybee. That was this \nweek. And next week we will probably only have one more.\n  We are doing the best we can to try help solve judicial problems in \nthis country. Just for the information of the New York Times, there are \naround 25 judicial emergencies in this country--emergencies. The \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is one. The Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals in Ohio is another. We need to do something \nabout that if we want justice in this country, if we want to have cases \nheard and tried and resolved--and that is what we want. That is what \ngood lawyers want, fair judges who will fairly listen to their case and \ngive them a fair trial. And these judges will. That is why they are so \nhighly rated by the American Bar Association and that is why Miguel \nEstrada has the highest rating possible.\n  I think it is time for the New York Times to be more fair in its \nreporting on these judges. I noticed the day before they were reporting \nas though Paul Bender's opinion really amounted to something. It may in \nsome areas, but certainly I think the opinions he gave at the \nSolicitor's office are more important than politically motivated \nopinions that he gives later as a liberal Democrat--and, I might add, a \nvery liberal Democrat.\n  I have taken enough time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nassume the Senator will be speaking on a subject other than the Estrada \nnomination?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will say, I was down here to speak on the Estrada \nnomination. I think the individuals who oppose him say they want to \ntalk about it. I would like to hear what they have to say. This morning \nthere is nobody down from the other side, the opposition, to speak \nagainst him. I don't know what they could say if they came. So it is \nfrustrating to me.\n  I know the Senator has some issues she cares about deeply and wants \nto talk. I suppose that is appropriate at this time, although in \nreality I think we ought to be engaged in a debate about this \nnomination and why it should be held up, why he does not qualify for \nthe bench, and why there is something wrong with an individual who was \ngiven the highest possible rating, unanimously, by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Having said that, I withdraw my objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I assume we are on the business of the \nEstrada nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that is the pending business before the \nSenate today. It is a matter of importance. The Court of Appeals of the \nUnited States are important judicial offices. We need good people for \nthose offices.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Miguel Estrada is one of the finest \nnominees we have seen in years. He has an impeccable record, with \nextreme capability, and wonderful integrity. He had a great demeanor in \nthe committee when he testified. So I am very impressed with him.\n  It is very disturbing to me that we would have a blockage, an \nobstruction being carried on here by the members of the Democratic \nParty. They stalled him in committee. They failed to give him and \nseveral other superb President Bush nominees to the court of appeals a \nhearing at all--over 600 days. It would have been 2 years in May since \nthey were nominated, and there was not a hearing even held.\n  So when the majority switched, Senator Hatch had hearings on Mr. \nEstrada. I thought he testified just superbly, with such a winning \nmanner. He is a low-key person, but he has a brilliant mind. He \nanalyzed the questions carefully, and gave responsible answers time and \nagain in a way that few could disagree with, in my view.\n  If we are going to slow down the work of the Senate, if we are going \nto stop what we are doing to talk about a nominee for the court of \nappeals, I would like to hear people step up to the plate and talk \nabout that nominee. Let's see what the problems are. I haven't seen \nthem. We have had two speakers today from the other side who talked \nabout asbestos and hydrogen automobiles, not the subject at hand. We \nhave agreed to that. I don't know how long we ought to agree to that. \nMaybe we should just say, if you want to slow down the Senate, then so \nbe it. We will just talk about that day after day. I am concerned about \nthat.\n  I did misspeak in saying that Estrada didn't have a nomination \nhearing under the Democratic majority. He did get a hearing late in the \nprocess. Three of the nominees we had last week who were nominated with \nhim in May 2 years ago got their first hearing just last week. He was \nnot part of that group.\n  Mr. Estrada came to this country at 17. He went to Columbia College \nwhere he graduated with honors magna cum laude. Then he went on to \nHarvard Law School. He grew up in Honduras. His mother came here. She \ncould not speak English. He has done exceedingly well. He is a \ntremendous American success story. He is a great American, the kind of \nperson we all respect because of his merit, his humility, his strength \nof character, his hard work, and his intellect.\n  After going to the Harvard Law School, which many consider the most \nprestigious law school in the world, he not only finished at the top of \nhis class, he was chosen to be editor of the Harvard Law Review. The \neditor of the Harvard Law Review or any law review at a good law school \nis considered to be one of the most outstanding honors a graduate can \nhave. It is probably more significant in the minds of many people than \nwho had the highest grade point average, who finished No. 1 in the \nclass. Being editor of the law review is something you are chosen for \nby your classmates and the faculty. It is a great honor. It requires \nexceptional academic excellence. He finished magna cum laude at \nHarvard. It also requires leadership skills and analysis, the kind of \nskills that most people think make a good lawyer. He was successful in \nthat.\n  After doing that, he was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern \nDistrict of New York. I was an assistant U.S. attorney in my prior \nlife, and a U.S. attorney. But those in the Southern District of New \nYork, rightly or wrongly, considers themselves to be the premier U.S. \nattorney's office in the country. They hire only the highest achieving \nassistant U.S. attorneys. They are very proud of that. Just being \nchosen at that office is a great honor. I would suspect there are more \nthan 100 applicants for every vacancy they have. It is an office that \nhandles complex matters. Some of the biggest financial and \ninternational matters often get handled in the Southern District of New \nYork.\n  While he was there, he became active in and chairman of the appellate \nlitigation section. That means he wrote briefs that would be presented \nto the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. The Second Circuit \nis considered one of the great circuits in America. So he was chosen to \nrepresent the United States in the attorney's office, to write their \nappellate briefs before one of the great circuit courts.\n  One reason he was chosen for that is that Miguel Estrada, after \ngraduating from Harvard, clerked for a U.S. Court of Appeals judge for \nthe Second Circuit there in New York and had a good record. After \nhaving clerked for the Second Circuit, he was chosen to be a\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\nclerk for the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\n  For lawyers graduating from Harvard, or from any law school in \nAmerica, being chosen to be a law clerk for a Justice on the Supreme \nCourt is an exceedingly great honor. It is sought by thousands and \nthousands, and very few are selected. He was selected because of his \nexcellent record, his background, and expertise. It is a great \ncompliment to him that he was chosen to clerk for Justice Anthony \nKennedy, who is considered to be a swing Justice on the Court.\n  After that, he went to the U.S. attorney's office, where they \nprosecute criminal cases and work on the appeals that arise from those \nkind of cases and other matters relating to U.S. litigation in court. \nThat is what they do there. He did a good job there.\n  Then he was chosen to come to the Solicitor General's Office of the \nU.S. Department of Justice. Inside the Department of Justice, one of \nthe oldest Cabinet positions in our Government, one of the founding \nCabinet positions, there is the Litigation Division. Inside the \nappellate litigation section is the Solicitor General's Office. The \nSolicitor General has often been referred to as the Government's \nlawyer. The position of Solicitor General has been called one of the \nfinest lawyer jobs in the world, because the Solicitor General and his \nteam get to appear before the Supreme Court and represent the United \nStates.\n  I used to be thrilled when I could stand in a courtroom in the \nSouthern District of Alabama and say: I represent the United States of \nAmerica. The United States is ready, Your Honor.\n  That was a great honor for me. To be able to do that in the highest \ncourt in the land and represent the United States before the Supreme \nCourt is a premier honor for any lawyer.\n  Miguel Estrada was chosen for that. He served over 5 years in that \ncapacity. During that time, overwhelmingly, he served in the Clinton \nDepartment of Justice. During that time, every single year while he \nserved in the Department of Justice, he got the highest possible \nevaluation that the Department of Justice evaluators give--year after \nyear. They said he was cooperative, a leader; he inspired other lawyers \nto do their best. They said he followed the policies of the Department \nof Justice, not someone running off doing independent things and nutty \nthings.\n  He was a solid, committed attorney to the Solicitor General's Office, \nto the ideals of the Solicitor General's Office. He was commended in \nhis evaluations for following the policies of that office.\n  That is quite an achievement. He left there and joined the \nprestigious law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, one of the great law \nfirms in the world, no doubt. He has been highly successful there, and \nthe President has now nominated him for the court of appeals.\n  He has, in the course of his career, argued 15 cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. You could count on both hands probably the number of \npracticing lawyers today who have ever argued 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court.\n  That is a reflection of the confidence that clients and his law firm \nhad in him. This isn't politics. When you have a big case before the \nSupreme Court of the United States and you have to have somebody there \narguing that case, you don't want second rate, you want the best person \nyou can get. The Supreme Court hears less than 100 cases per year. They \nselect only a very few. Whenever your case is chosen for the Supreme \nCourt, there is no doubt about it, the clients start looking around for \nsuperior appellate lawyers to represent their interests in a case that \nmay set national policy for generations to come. We still cite many of \nthose Supreme Court cases time and again to indicate the importance of \nthem and how much they impact our daily lives. So he was chosen 15 \ntimes to appear before the Supreme Court. I think that is a tremendous \ntestament to his merit, his capability.\n  I will tell you something else. You don't hotdog before the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. You have to know what you are talking \nabout. You have to be disciplined and you must understand the rulings \nof the Supreme Court, how they impact the case at hand, and you have to \nargue to the Justices within the realm of their existing philosophy and \nthe existing status of the case law as to why you think your client \nshould prevail or why the opponent should not prevail. That is a great \ncompliment to him.\n  Now, for some time, our Democratic colleagues have complained we did \nnot give enough prominence to the opinions of the American Bar \nAssociation. They evaluate judges. They are not any official body. The \nAmerican Bar Association is just an institution out there that does \nlegal matters and represents lawyers as a group. They evaluate these \njudges. So they want to do it and they do it. They have every right to \ndo it. I, frankly, value their opinions. I have always thought they \nwere good. Some have felt they were biased a bit to the left. The \npositions the ABA takes at conferences consistently are liberal \npositions, which irritates a lot of lawyers and conservatives in the \ncountry. They have felt the ABA could not be trusted to evaluate judges \nobjectively. In fact, I have noted some tendency to be less favorable \nto conservative judges than to liberal judges, but I feel their \ncontributions are valuable--I always have--and I continue to believe \nthey are valuable. So that was a complaint from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, that we ought to listen to them more.\n  The ABA has reviewed Miguel Estrada's nomination. They have conducted \na thorough review of it. They give several different kinds of ratings. \nThey give ratings of nonqualified, unqualified, qualified, and a well-\nqualified rating. Very few people get the well-qualified rating. This \nis what it requires to get it, according to the ABA manual:\n\n       To merit a rating of well qualified, the nominee must be at \n     the top of the legal profession in his or her legal community \n     . . .\n\n  The ``top'' of the profession . . .\n\n       . . . have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity, and either \n     have demonstrated or exhibited the capacity for judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  That is what is required for a person to get the well-qualified \nrating. They have 15 of so lawyers study and talk to judges and to the \nlawyers in the firm with the person, and they talk to lawyers on the \nother side of cases from the nominee; they make the nominee list the \ntop 10 or so cases they have handled, and they talk to the lawyers and \njudges to see how well they performed in handling those cases, and so \nforth. When all of that was done, Miguel Estrada was unanimously voted \nwell qualified, which is the highest possible rating for the court of \nappeals. In fact, he is one of the finest young lawyers in America \ntoday, a man of extraordinary capabilities, and I think a man who would \nbe perfect for the court of appeals. He will be handling cases in a \nnumber of different aspects. These will be the kinds of matters he has \nspent his life handling, because the kinds of cases they have here in \nDC are cases he has worked with both as an Assistant U.S. Attorney when \nhe represented the United States of America, and at the Solicitor \nGeneral's office, and also the kind of appellate cases he has had in \nprivate practice before the Supreme Court. I am proud of him. I have \nobserved no complaint that in any way damages his qualities and \ncapabilities.\n\n  Miguel Estrada has support across the aisle from Democrats and \nRepublicans. He is the kind of person who ought to move forward. I \nremain utterly baffled about why such a fine nominee would be given the \nkind of grief he has gotten so far, and to be held up the way he has \nbeen held up, and how people say they are going to fight it for weeks, \nperhaps. I hope that is not so. I hope we don't have a filibuster. At \nthe time the Republicans had the majority in the Senate, and when \nPresident Clinton was nominating judges, we never had a filibuster. \nDuring that time, we confirmed 377 of President Clinton's nominees and \nvoted only one down. Not one nominee was ever blocked in committee, and \nin less than 2 years we have had two nominees blocked in the committee \nalready, when the Democrats had the majority.\n  Regardless of that, this nominee ought to move forward. He is the \nkind of person we need on the bench. We should celebrate the fact that \nan individual of his quality, with his potential to create high income \nin one of the finest law firms in the country, right here in one of the \nmost prestigious practices in the country, is willing to give that\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nup for public service because he loves his country and the principles \nof our country.\n  I think he is the kind of person we need on the bench, and I think it \nis time for us to give him a vote. I am sure we will and, when we do, I \nbelieve he will be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been an observer of all of these \ndebates about judges because I am not a lawyer and I don't sit on the \nJudiciary Committee, but I have been interested to note that when \nPresident Bush became the President, he announced he would not allow \nthe American Bar Association to, in effect, veto Presidential nominees. \nHe said the Constitution doesn't give the American Bar Association any \nright to determine who should be on the Federal bench and who should \nnot, and that he would not bow to the American Bar Association for \ntheir recommendations.\n  Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, in the popular \nphrase of the teenagers, went ballistic. They said the American Bar \nAssociation was the gold standard by which everybody should be judged. \nAnd Senator Leahy, when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nmade it very clear that even though a recommendation from the American \nBar Association is extraconstitutional, he would apply that \nextraconstitutional test to everyone who came up; and if they did not \npass that test--extraconstitutional though it is--they could not be \nconfirmed. He made that very clear. I am grateful to him for his \ncandor. I appreciate the fact he was open with this body and the \nAmerican public that that particular test was being added to the \nconstitutional test that a nominee should pass.\n  Now we have someone before us who passes not only the constitutional \ntest but the extraconstitutional test laid down by the Democrats. He is \nnot only qualified--according to the American Bar Association, ``well \nqualified''--he was found unanimously well qualified by the American \nBar Association. Yet Senator Leahy is leading a form of filibuster \nagainst this nominee that gives rise to this question, which I have \nasked on the floor before and, undoubtedly, in this extended debate I \nwill ask again. I would ask Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, and the \nothers: What additional, extraconstitutional test have you devised that \nyou are applying to nominees for the judiciary? You have told us the \nfirst one. You have been very up front about it and tell us what \nadditional, extraconstitutional test you have determined must be passed \nby a nominee because there is no obvious reason this nominee should be \nobjected to; there is no obvious reason every single Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee should have voted against him and we should see the \ncoming of a filibuster against his nomination.\n\n  The Senators are exercising their rights. I do not object to them \nexercising their rights, but I do ask them very respectfully to tell us \nthe nature of the test they are applying to these nominees so that we \ncan know in advance in future circumstances which nominees will not \npass their test, which nominees will fail that test. In order to do \nthat, we need to know what that test is.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nmaterials be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today I rise in support of the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to sit on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. As has been said \nmany times in this Chamber, Mr. Estrada is highly qualified to sit on \nthis court and deserves a fair hearing and a vote in the Senate.\n  There are four vacancies on the DC Circuit's 12 seats. Most lawyers \nconsider the DC Circuit to be the second most important court in the \nUnited States. That means the court is missing one-third of its judges.\n  That is alarming. The seat for which Mr. Estrada has been nominated \nhas been designated as a judicial emergency by the Judicial Conference \nof the United States. To leave the seat empty for any longer is \nunacceptable and dangerous.\n  In Kentucky, we know a little bit about vacancies. We are part of the \nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and that panel has 6 vacancies right \nnow out of 16 total seats. That is a little better from not too long \nago when we had 8 openings, but it is not much better. In all, the U.S. \nCourts of Appeals have 25 vacancies, totaling 15 percent of the entire \nsystem.\n  The situation is so bad the American Bar Association has described it \nas an emergency. Fortunately, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on \nfour appellate court nominees recently, and one of those nominees is \nnow before the Senate. At least we are starting to see some progress.\n  Recently, Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered his annual report on the \nstate of the Federal judiciary. One of the key points he emphasized was \npromptly filling vacancies. With this nomination, we have the \nopportunity to begin filling empty seats on the bench.\n  Case filings in the Federal court system hit a new record high last \nyear, and I believe that trend will continue this year also. The record \nnumber of cases in the court system, combined with judicial vacancies, \nled the Chief Justice to warn Congress that proper functioning of the \ncourt system is in jeopardy. The Senate cannot and must not allow that \nto happen.\n  In concluding his remarks on judicial vacancies, the Chief Justice \nsaid:\n\n       We simply ask that the President nominate qualified \n     candidates with reasonable promptness and that the Senate act \n     within a reasonable time to confirm or reject them.\n\n  I cannot imagine a clearer signal to the Senate to fulfill its \nresponsibility to confirm judges.\n  President Bush has done his part in nominating candidates of the \nhighest moral integrity and legal expertise. Each of his nominees has \nbeen carefully selected, and each deserves a hearing and a vote, which \nleads us to the nomination before us today.\n  Mr. Estrada was nominated by President Bush in early 2001. Although \nhe did get a hearing in the Judiciary Committee after well over a year, \nhe was not granted a vote. It took almost 2 years for him just to get \nhis day in court. In fact, when the 107th Congress ended last year, 31 \nnominees were still waiting in committee for a vote. We had not even \nhad hearings in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Twelve of the 14 pending nominees for the court of appeals were \nnominated in 2001, and six of them, including Miguel Estrada, were \namong the first group of nominees submitted to the Senate nearly 2 \nyears ago.\n  The judicial nomination situation in the Senate is totally \nunacceptable. Fifteen of President Bush's appellate nominees have had \nto wait more than a year for a hearing--not even a vote, just a \nhearing. According to the Justice Department, 15 of President Bush's \nappellate court nominees have had to wait over a year for a hearing. \nThis is a higher total than the combined total that had to wait over a \nyear for the past 50 years.\n  Almost 90 percent of the appellate court nominees made in the first 2 \nyears of the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton administrations \nwere confirmed by the Senate. But in the first 2 years of this \nadministration, only 54 percent were confirmed.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist is not exaggerating when he says the status \nof judicial nominations threatens the very function of our court system \nand justice itself.\n  As for Mr. Estrada, he is a fitting nominee to break this logjam. Mr. \nEstrada is an inspiration. He has lived the American dream. He will \nbecome the first Hispanic to serve on that prestigious court. He is a \nfine example of the quality nominees President Bush has sent to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. Estrada came to the United States when he was 17 years old, \ngrowing up in Honduras. He spoke little English when he arrived in \nAmerica, but that did not keep him from graduating magna cum laude from \nColumbia College and Harvard Law School. He is no stranger to the \nappellate court system.\n  After law school, he clerked for a judge at the Second Circuit Court \nof Appeals. After that, he was a clerk for Justice Kennedy at the \nSupreme Court. Mr. Estrada then served as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nNew York and a deputy chief of the appellate section of the\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office. Those jobs required him to try cases in the \ndistrict courts and argue before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Next, he served in the Office of the Solicitor General during William \nJefferson Clinton's administration. Now he is a partner in the \nWashington, DC, law firm of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher.\n  It has been said many times, but I think it is worth repeating, Mr. \nEstrada earned the American Bar Association's highest rating for a \nnominee, a ``unanimously well-qualified'' rating.\n  He has been endorsed by a long list of political, business, and civil \nrights organizations. I have yet to hear any detractors make credible \narguments that he is not qualified. I can see no obstacle to his being \nconfirmed. He is supported by Seth Waxman, a Solicitor General under \nformer President Clinton, as well as the former chief legal counsel to \nVice President Gore. There is no question in my mind that Mr. Estrada \nwill make a fine judge once confirmed. His life story is an inspiration \nfor minorities, and all of us, throughout America. His hard work and \ndedication is obvious. His academic and legal achievements cannot be \ndenied.\n  I urge the Senate to quickly hold a vote on this nomination, and I \nurge my colleagues to support Miguel Estrada.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2003.\n       Dear Colleague: I write to urge you to support the \n     confirmation of Miguel A. Estrada, who has been nominated for \n     a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit. If he is confirmed, he will be the first \n     Hispanic to sit on this court, which is widely considered to \n     be the second most important court in the country.\n       Mr. Estrada represents an immigrant success story. Born in \n     Tegucigalpa, Honduras, his parents divorced when he was only \n     four years old. Mr. Estrada remained in Honduras with his \n     father while his sister immigrated to the United States with \n     his mother. Years later, as a teenager, Mr. Estrada joined \n     his mother in the United States. Although he had taken \n     English classes during school in Honduras, he actually spoke \n     very little English when he immigrated. He nevertheless \n     taught himself the language well enough to earn a B- in his \n     first college English course. In a matter of years, he not \n     only perfected his English skills, but he exceeded the \n     achievements of many persons for whom English is their native \n     tongue. He graduated with a bachelor's degree magna cum laude \n     and Phi Beta Kappa in 1983 from Columbia College, then \n     received a J.D. degree magna cum laude in 1986 from Harvard \n     Law School, where he was editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n       Mr. Estrada's professional career has been marked by one \n     success after another. He clerked for Second Circuit Judge \n     Amalya Kearse--a Carter appointee--then Supreme Court Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy. He worked as an associate at Wachtell Lipton \n     in New York--as high powered a law firm as they come. He then \n     worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, rising to become \n     deputy chief of the appellate division. In recognition of his \n     appellate skills, he was hired by the Department of Justice \n     Solicitor General's Office in 1992. He stayed with that \n     office for most of the Clinton Administration. When he left \n     that office in 1997, he joined the Washington, D.C., office \n     of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he has continued to excel \n     as a partner. He has argued an impressive 15 cases before the \n     United States Supreme Court, and the non-partisan American \n     Bar Association has bestowed upon him its highest rating of \n     Unanimously Well Qualified.\n       I take the time to offer up this brief recitation of Mr. \n     Estrada's personal and professional history because I think \n     it illustrates that he is, in fact, far from the right-wing \n     ideologue that some have portrayed him to be. He clerked for \n     Judge Kearse, a Carter appointee, then Justice Kennedy, a \n     moderate by any standard. He joined the Solicitor General's \n     Office during the first Bush Administration, but stayed on \n     through much of the Clinton Administration. His \n     supporters include a host of well-respected Clinton \n     Administration lawyers, including Ron Klain, former Vice \n     President Gore's Chief of Staff; Robert Litt, head of the \n     Criminal Division in the Reno Justice Department; Randolph \n     Moss, former Assistant Attorney General; and Seth Waxman, \n     former Solicitor General for President Clinton. He has \n     defended pro bono convicted criminals, including a death \n     row inmate whom he represented before the Supreme Court in \n     an effort to overturn his death sentence. He has broad \n     support from the Hispanic community, including the \n     endorsement of the League of United Latin American \n     Citizens (which is the country's oldest Hispanic civil \n     rights organization), the Hispanic National Bar \n     Association, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the \n     Hispanic Business Roundtable, the Latino Coalition, and \n     many others.\n       Mr. Estrada has been unfairly criticized by some for \n     declining to answer questions at his hearing about whether \n     particular Supreme Court cases were correctly decided. Lloyd \n     Cutler, who was White House counsel to both President Carter \n     and President Clinton, put it best when he testified before a \n     Judiciary Committee subcommittee in 2001. He said, \n     ``Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.'' He \n     further explained, ``What is most important is the \n     appointment of judges who are learned in the law, who are \n     conscientious in their work ethic, and who possess what \n     lawyers describe as `judicial temperament.'' ' Mr. Estrada's \n     academic achievement, his professional accomplishments, and \n     the letters of bipartisan support we have received from his \n     colleagues all indicate that Mr. Estrada fits this \n     description.\n       Several opponents of Mr. Estrada have attempted to block \n     his confirmation by boldly demanding that the Department of \n     Justice release internal memoranda he authored while he was \n     an Assistant to the Solicitor General. All seven living \n     former Solicitors General--four Democrats and three \n     Republicans--oppose this request. Their letter to the \n     Committee explains that the open exchange of ideas upon which \n     they relied as Solicitors General ``simply cannot take place \n     if attorneys have reasons to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure.'' They concluded that ``any attempt to \n     intrude into the Office's highly privileged deliberations \n     would come at a cost of the Solicitor General's ability to \n     defend vigorously the United states' litigation interests \n     cost that also would be borne by Congress itself.'' The Wall \n     Street Journal and the Washington Post have also criticized \n     the attempts to obtain these memoranda.\n       These misguided efforts should not prevent our confirmation \n     of a well-qualified nominee who has pledged to be fair and \n     impartial, and to uphold the law regardless of his personal \n     convictions. I have no doubt that Mr. Estrada will be one of \n     the most brilliant federal appellate judges of our time, and \n     I urge you to join me in voting to confirm him.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Latino Coalition\n\n\n                                           for Miguel Estrada,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Jim Bunning,\n     Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bunning: At a time of a serious judicial \n     vacancy crisis in our country, it is simply disingenuous that \n     the Senate Democratic leadership is threatening to filibuster \n     a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, with impeccable \n     credentials and a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from \n     the American Bar Association.\n       On May 9, 2001, President Bush nominated Miguel A. Estrada \n     to fill a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. Mr. Estrada would be the \n     first Hispanic in history to sit on that court, which is \n     widely viewed as the most important and prestigious Court of \n     Appeals in the nation. No wonder George Herrera, President \n     and Chief Executive Officer of the United States Hispanic \n     Chamber of Commerce, concludes that ``Estrada's nomination \n     can be a historic event for the Hispanic community. Latinos \n     in this country have worked hard to break the barriers and \n     obstacles that have stood in our way for too long and we now \n     have the opportunity to do so. Estrada's appointment will \n     also be a role model for Latino youth by demonstrating that a \n     Latino can be appointed to one of the highest courts in the \n     nation.'' He is just one of the overwhelming majority of \n     national Hispanic grassroots organizations that are \n     enthusiastically supporting his nomination, not just because \n     he is Hispanic, but because he is superbly qualified.\n       Mr. Estrada is unique in another respect, too. As his \n     colleagues can attest, both conservatives and liberals alike, \n     Mr. Estrada is one of the most brilliant and effective \n     appellate lawyers in the country. Having worked at the \n     Justice Department under Republican and Democratic \n     Administrations, he has demonstrated a commitment to \n     upholding the integrity of the law and a dedication to public \n     service. During his career, he has argued fifteen cases \n     before the Supreme Court--all before reaching the age of 40. \n     He richly deserves the unanimous ``well qualified'' rating \n     the American Bar Association bestowed on him--the \n     organization's highest possible evaluation.\n       Miguel Estrada is more than just a talented lawyer. He \n     represents the potential of a growing population and what is \n     possible in the United States. A native of Honduras, Mr. \n     Estrada arrived in the United States at age 17, unable to \n     speak much English. Yet he graduated magna cum laude from \n     Columbia University and magna cum laude from Harvard Law \n     School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He \n     clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy--one of the \n     more moderate Republican appointees who continues to be \n     Estrada's mentor. Mr. Estrada's own journey from immigrant to \n     successful attorney has inspired him to devote much of his \n     career to serving his fellow Americans. Both in government \n     service and in private practice, he has sought to ensure that \n     all citizens receive the law's fullest protections and \n     benefits, whether they are death-row inmates or abortion \n     clinics targeted by violent protestors.\n       Never has a judicial nominee that has been voted out of the \n     Judiciary Committee been\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\n     successfully filibustered in the Senate. Estrada's opponents \n     argue that he is a Hispanic in name only and is an ideologue. \n     This is absolute non-sense.\n       Miguel Estrada is considered by all who have worked with \n     him to be a brilliant attorney who has demonstrated the \n     ability to set aside any personal beliefs he may have and \n     effectively argue cases based on the US constitution and the \n     law. Perhaps the most compelling praise in support of Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination has come from Democratic political \n     appointees who worked with him in the Clinton Administration.\n       Prominent Democrats including Ron Klain, the former Chief \n     of Staff of Vice President Gore; Seth Waxman, Clinton's \n     Solicitor General; Robert Litt, Associate Deputy Attorney \n     General in the Criminal Division; Drew Days III, Solicitor \n     General; and Randolph Moss, Assistant Attorney General in the \n     Office of Legal Counsel have all praised Miguel Estrada for \n     his brilliance, compassion, fairness and respect for \n     precedent (quotes attached).\n       It would be an ironic travesty of justice for any member of \n     the US Senate--a body without a single Hispanic member--to \n     vote against Mr. Estrada with the excuse that he is a \n     Hispanic in name only or that he does not understand or \n     represent the values of our community? Under normal \n     circumstances, this argument would be so absurd that we would \n     have ignored it. But under the current partisan environment, \n     we cannot stand by and allow Mr. Estrada's ethnic background \n     to be used against him.\n       Miguel Estrada was nominated on May 9, 2001. He did not \n     receive his first hearing until September 26, 2002, 16 months \n     after his nomination. Now his opponents complain that they \n     have not enough time to evaluate his record and that his \n     nomination should not be rushed to a vote. We believe that a \n     nominee should not have to wait for 21 months for a vote and \n     that the Senate has had plenty of opportunity to consider \n     Miguel Estrada's qualifications. This same tactic was used to \n     delay Richard Paez's nomination for more than 4 years. It was \n     unfair then and it is unfair now.\n       Any attorney who has argued 15 cases before the US Supreme \n     Court has an extensive legal track record that can be \n     analyzed for accuracy, quality, effectiveness and bias. Yet, \n     incredibly, Mr. Estrada's detractors claim that his legal \n     record is too skimpy for them to make an informed decision on \n     his nomination. This ridiculous claim underscores the \n     opposition's real problem . . . that there is nothing in \n     Miguel Estrada's record that would lead a reasonable person \n     to conclude anything other than this nominee is an \n     exceptionally well qualified, highly principled attorney, who \n     will make a fine judge on the DC Circuit.\n       The Hispanic National Bar Association, the League of United \n     Latin American Citizens (LULAC), The Latino Coalition, the \n     United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the American \n     Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, MANA--a \n     national Latina organization, and the Mexican American \n     Grocers Association are among the many Hispanic organizations \n     supporting the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n       Miguel Estrada is a perfect example of an American success \n     story, who deserves an up or down vote on the Senate floor. \n     He brings to the court a distinguished and extensive legal \n     record based on his many years of work in the public and \n     private sector. Mr. Estrada also brings unique perspective \n     and human experience understood only by those who have \n     migrated to a foreign land.\n       It is for this cultural depth and his unique legal \n     qualifications that on behalf of an overwhelming majority of \n     Hispanics in this country, we urge the leadership of both \n     parties in the U.S. Senate to put partisan politics aside so \n     that Hispanics are no longer denied representation in one of \n     the most prestigious courts in the land.\n           Sincerely,\n       League of United Latin Americans Citizens, the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \n     Commerce, the Association for the Advancement of Mexican \n     Americans, The Latino Coalition, Mexican American Grocers \n     Association, the Hispanic Contractors Association, the \n     Interamerican College of Physicians & Surgeons, the American \n     G.I.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Kentucky \nfor his excellent remarks. He said much of what I wanted to say, \noutlining the extraordinary qualifications of Miguel Estrada. He very \nclearly laid out the case that there is no legitimate reason to \nfilibuster his nomination, but that appears to be the tactic that is \nbeing contemplated and maybe even being engaged in by many on the other \nside of the aisle, certainly not all on the other side of the aisle. We \nare certainly grateful for Members who are discerning enough to \nunderstand, as has been quoted many times--the Washington Post has \nsuggested that filibustering this nomination would be unjustifiable, I \nthink is their term, and certainly beneath the standards in the Senate. \nThe standard is that we do not filibuster judges for the circuit \ncourts, that it would be an unprecedented move to filibuster a judge.\n  In the 220-odd-year history of the Senate, what makes this judge so \nunique? And that is what it would be, it would be unique because it is \nthe first time in the history of this country a filibuster would be \nconducted on a circuit court nominee.\n  What makes this nominee so unique to warrant--and I am not using this \nterm in a pejorative sense but in a factual context--an extreme \nreaction, extreme by the definition that it is the first time in almost \n230 years of American history that this would occur, that this would be \nan extreme reaction because it has never been done before.\n  What has this nominee done, or what about this nominee causes such an \noverreaction, or extreme reaction, that raises the bar to this high \nlevel?\n  Let's look at this nominee. The Senator from Kentucky noted he is \nintellectually clearly qualified. He got into colleges I was not able \nto get into, I can say that. As the Senator from Kentucky said, he is a \nman who was raised in Honduras. English was not his first language. He \nwas able to perform at the highest levels at some of the most rigorous \nuniversities in the country, Columbia and then Harvard Law School. He \nwas on Law Review, it is my understanding, at Harvard Law School. These \nare truly lofty attainments and a demonstration of not only a powerful \nintellect but a rigorous attitude toward his studies and a commitment \nto excellence.\n  He clerked for the appellate court, which is a high honor very rarely \nbestowed upon graduates of law school, and even a more rare honor is to \nclerk for a Supreme Court Justice. He obviously has the intellectual \ncapability, even at a young age; that was established. He has gone on \nwith a distinguished career in law, public service, and in the private \nsector. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court, which, \nfrankly, standing up before a panel of Supreme Court Justices is hard \nenough but, in all candor, standing up when you have a speech \nimpediment has to be a thoroughly paralyzing experience. To have the \ncourage to persuasively make arguments, nonetheless, and deal with the \nbench under this context is a testament not only to his intellectual \ncapability and to the hard work he puts into his job but to the \npersonal courage and determination this man has.\n  So we have in this nominee someone who has overcome adversity in \nlanguage, adversity in disability, and performed at the highest levels \nof the legal profession in this country.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky mentioned, he has a unanimous well-\nqualified rating. I am sure this has been repeated many times, but the \nother side has said this is the gold standard, this is the stamp of \napproval, getting a qualified rating from the American Bar Association.\n\n  This was not a qualified rating. This was not a well-qualified \nrating. This was a unanimously well-qualified rating.\n  So what is it? What could it possibly be that this nominee has done \nin his life to potentially warrant the first ever filibuster of a \ncircuit court judge in the history of the Senate? What has he done? \nWhat are the arguments on the other side?\n  One of the arguments on the other side is he does not have sufficient \nexperience. Well, I am a lawyer, and I can say I do not have near the \nexperience Miguel Estrada has. I have not performed nearly in the arena \nof the law he has. His experience is abundant.\n  He has never been a judge. He is being nominated for a position on a \ncourt where there are eight judges right now. Five of the eight \nconfirmed by this Senate had no prior judicial experience. So if \njudicial experience was so important for this court, then why do over \nhalf the members on this court have no prior judicial experience? One \ncould make that argument, but the cup the water is being held in is as \nempty as the top. It flows straight through. It does not hold any \nwater.\n  He has refused to disclose his judicial philosophy. Since when do we \nexpect\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\npeople who are applying for judicial nominations to tell us how they \nwould rule on future cases? That would truly be an extreme view, an \nunprecedented view, for the consideration of judges in the Senate. We \ndo not require people to prejudge cases. In fact, part of the canons is \none does not prejudge cases. So to ask a judge-nominee how he would \nrule or what his feeling is on these matters is inappropriate and that \nis why most judges, if not--well, maybe some give opinions, but most \nnominees who come before the Senate for confirmation do not answer that \nquestion. They can talk general judicial philosophy, but to go through \nand talk about how they would rule on certain cases is something that \nis an inappropriate question, in my mind, and should not be answered.\n  The other side is saying he did not turn over his work papers. Now, I \ndid practice a little bit of law, and there is a privileged work \nproduct of lawyers that is not available to the other side in a case. \nGenerally speaking, it is not available for discovery. Why? Because \nwhen you are working on a case--having worked in my capacity for a \nsenior partner in most cases, as is the case here, because Miguel \nEstrada was an Assistant Solicitor; he was not the Solicitor General; \nhe was working for someone in the capacity of the Solicitor's office--\nyou are preparing the case and trying to share his opinions, his candid \nopinions about what his boss should do.\n\n  His boss may make a different decision, but his boss needs, as my \nsenior partner needed, my candid opinion about what I thought of the \nmerits of our argument or the facts in the case or whatever the case \nmay be. He needed my candid assessment. Why? Because I understood the \nissue better than he or she did. That work product was essential for \ncoming to the decisionmaking with all the best information that \ndecisionmaker needed to make the property assessment of the case and to \nmove forward.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that Mr. Estrada was employed \nduring the Reno Justice Department; is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it not then the case that some of these papers the \ncommittee is demanding are papers that were submitted to a Clinton \nPresidential appointee who acted as Solicitor General; is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So is it not true that it is a Clinton appointee, former \nSolicitor General, who is now saying it would be inappropriate for Mr. \nEstrada's material to be made public?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct, including, I believe, six other \nSolicitor Generals who have said it would threaten the viability of the \nSolicitor General's office if this information were discoverable \nthrough this nomination process.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I could comment on the question, I find it \ninteresting for those who supported Janet Reno for Attorney General and \nsupported President Clinton's Presidential nominees in that office, \nwhich nominees, after confirmed, are saying Estrada's notes should not \nbe made public, are saying those nominees are wrong.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I find that incongruous. I find, frankly, all of the \narguments to be specious, at best.\n  What is confounding is that such an extreme measure appears to be in \nthe offing, which is a filibuster, on such a pathetically weak case \nagainst this nominee.\n  So one has to step back and ask, Why? What is going on here? Why is \nthis nominee being singled out? What is it about this nominee that is \nunusual, that has raised the fear or the ire of so many in this \nChamber?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I recall in the last Congress where the Democratic \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, and particularly the Democratic \nleader, then majority leader, along with the then-chairman of that \ncommittee, Senator Leahy, attacked Republicans for being insufficiently \nsupportive of nominees who were women or members of minorities. We were \ngiven quotas, if you will, at least the language of quotas, that we \nshould have so many women and so many minorities, and we were attacked \nin the strongest possible language. Indeed, it came close to violating \nSenate rules, of implying that everyone on this side of the aisle was \neither sexist or racist because we did not support a sufficient number \nof minority nominees or female nominees.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest it went further. We were accused, if we voted \nagainst any minority--they would single out any negative vote against \nany minority member--it was the equivalent of having some sort of \nantiracial agenda; that somehow we harbored ill feelings toward \nwhatever particular race or gender happened to be the subject of that \nnominee.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator's memory is correct. We were told if we \nvoted against any nominee who happens to be either a woman or a \nminority, we were, indeed, guilty.\n  Now we have one who happens to be a minority. I do not believe \nnominations should be made on the basis of gender or minority status. \nBut when we have a nominee based on quality, who happens to be in a \nminority status, I find it disingenuous of those who made the point of \nthe minority status. We didn't; they did. Those who made the point of \nthe minority status now are insisting that the minority status should \nnot be considered. I wish they would be consistent. Either minority \nstatus does not matter or it does, and if it does, as they insist, it \nshould be a reason for them to vote for this nominee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I stand here, as the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Utah, and ask the question, Why this nominee? The Senator \nmay have--I hope he has not--may have uncovered what may be the \nunderlying cause of this obstruction. We have passed and considered \njudges who, through their nominating process, have disclosed their \nconservative ideology equal to Miguel Estrada. It is accepted that \nMiguel Estrada is conservative in answering his questions and how he \ninterprets the law. It seems to be consistent with, frankly, most if \nnot all of President Bush's nominees. President Bush believes in \ncommonsense judges who take the Constitution for what it says and who \nfollow the law.\n  As Miguel Estrada has said in his testimony, he would follow the law. \nThe Supreme Court says this is the law; he will follow the law. That is \nall this President wants. That is all most Members, certainly on our \nside, would like to see--which is, judges who are not Supreme Court \nJudges now, because they are making more law than following law--judges \non the district court and appellate courts and their responsibility to \nfollow the higher court. Miguel Estrada said, without question, he will \ndo so.\n  It is not that he will not follow precedent. The objection must be \nphilosophy. If it is philosophy, look at all the nominees of this \nPresident. They are overwhelmingly almost universally more conservative \nthan they are liberal. I don't know how you measure conservatism, but \ncertainly they are almost all generally right around where Miguel \nEstrada is as far as his philosophy is concerned of government and of \njurisprudence. Yet none of them have been filibustered on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  So, again, you come back: What is different about Miguel Estrada than \nall the other conservative district court judges, appellate court \njudges, who have been confirmed by the Senate? They have been given a \nvote. I won't even go to confirmed. They have just been given the \nopportunity for a vote.\n\n  I can speak from personal experience, one I know very well. We had \nprobably the most contentious nominee to hit the floor the last session \nof Congress, a judge from Pennsylvania, Judge Brooks Smith. He was from \nthe western district of Pennsylvania. Judge Brooks Smith is a \nconservative judge, very much in the mainstream of ideology on the \ncourt and America. But he tracks more conservatively in his opinions \nthan those more activist in nature, or more liberal.\n  Did they oppose him on that? No, they found a few issues having to do \nwith him being involved with a club, years ago, that excluded women. So \nthey began to make this case that he\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nwas antiwoman. So that was the reason for this whole thing, even though \nwe had the local chapter of NOW in his own county come out and suggest \nthis is a good guy. It didn't matter. They had a hook. So they stuck \nthe hook in. But they gave him a vote. They reported him out of \ncommittee and we gave him a vote on the Senate floor and he passed with \n60-plus votes here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I know Judge Smith well and have tremendous respect for him. But I \nsuggest Judge Smith and Miguel Estrada, when it comes to judicial \nphilosophy, are pretty much two peas in a pod. It's pretty hard to tell \nthe difference between how they would approach the issues. Judge Smith \ngot a vote, even though, arguably--even though I think it was a red \nherring--he had some other issue out there that could have been used to \ndiscolor or discredit him.\n  What issue does Miguel Estrada have that could potentially disqualify \nhim? What has he done in his legal career that could be used against \nhim? I have not heard anything that, through his experience or \neducation or actions, has disqualified him from this position. I \nhaven't heard of any clubs he belonged to. He is a minority, so it's \nhard to belong to a club that excluded minorities, if he was one, so we \ncan't run into that problem.\n  Maybe that is the problem. Maybe that is the problem, that we have \nsomeone who is a conservative and a minority. Is that the combination \nthat is lethal?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. As the Senator from Pennsylvania seeks to find a reason \nfor opposing Mr. Miguel Estrada, I suggest to him one that comes out of \nyesterday's editorial in the Washington Post, as the Washington Post \npoints out that Mr. Estrada did not cooperate with the Democrats in \nproducing a case against him. Then it says,\n\n       Because it stems from his own and the administration's \n     discourteous refusal to arm Democrats with examples of the \n     extremism that would justify their opposition, they are \n     opposed to him.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       Such circular logic should not stall Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation any longer.\n\n  I agree with the Washington Post in this circumstance. It may be they \nwere hoping he would be cooperative enough to give them something to \nuse against him and when he refused to do that, and indeed his \nbackground says there is nothing in there he could have given them, in \nanger they decided to turn against him.\n  As the Senator looks for some reason why they are opposed to him, \nmaybe they are just disappointed over the fact he passed?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I know when you try to bully someone into doing \nsomething and they don't do it, it can be pretty frustrating. But that \nis no reason to go to such an extreme unprecedented measure of \nfilibustering an obviously competent, well-qualified--unanimously \nsupported by the American Bar Association--nominee for the circuit \ncourt.\n  I would just say this in closing. It is my intention as a Senator to \nsee this nominee through to a vote. I think this nominee deserves a \nvote. There has been no reason, no legitimate judicial reason why this \nnominee should not be given an opportunity to be voted on. So I will \nmake this statement. It is this Senator's intention to do everything I \ncan do to keep the Senate on this issue for as long as it takes for a \nvote to occur.\n  When I say ``as long as it takes,'' let me underscore what I mean: As \nlong as it takes.\n  If the other side likes to stand up and criticize Miguel Estrada and \nwants to filibuster his nomination, let me assure you, we will provide \nyou plenty of opportunity and time to do that if that is what you want \nto do. If you want to make the next days, weeks, months, years an \nopportunity to talk about Judge Estrada's qualifications for this job, \nit is this Senator's intention to give you the opportunity to do that. \nHe deserves, through his outstanding record of accomplishment, \novercoming language, disability, and prejudice heretofore and \npotentially now, to get this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, because of the statements made by my friends \non the other side of the aisle relative to Mr. Estrada, I would like to \ntake a few minutes and rebut some of what they have stated during \ntoday's session of the Senate.\n  It is true there is a conflict in our country as to whether or not he \nshould be approved by the Senate. We have newspapers saying yes, \nnewspapers saying no. My friend from Pennsylvania, the junior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, who stated he could not understand why there was a \nfilibuster, first has to understand there has never been a statement on \nthe floor to the effect there is a filibuster. A decision has not been \nmade by the leadership on this side as to whether or not there will be \na filibuster. But let me just say I think something as controversial as \nthis nomination should have some consideration.\n  We just started this process at 2:45 p.m. yesterday. There was good \ndebate on Wednesday. We had a memorial service for the Columbia this \nweek in Houston. We had another one this morning. Many Senators \nattended the two services. There is no session this afternoon or Friday \nbecause of the majority being engaged in a retreat. There is nothing \nwrong with having a retreat. We are going to have one in May. We will \nhave to take some time off.\n  But we should not rush to judgment. There will be a decision made as \nto whether or not there will be a filibuster, but that decision has not \nbeen made, to my knowledge.\n  Let me say there are people who care a great deal about our country \nwho oppose this nomination. There are people who care a great deal \nabout our country who favor this nomination. That is the reason our \nFounding Fathers established the Senate of the United States.\n\n  We do not live in a dictatorship. President Bush is President Bush, \nnot King George. He knows that, I hope, and I am confident he does.\n  Take, for example, the New York Times which said, among other things:\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote \n     tomorrow on Miguel Estrada, a nominee to the D.C. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada comes with a scant paper trail \n     but a reputation for taking extreme positions on important \n     legal questions. He stonewalled when he was asked at his \n     confirmation hearings last fall to address concerns about his \n     views. Given these concerns, and given the thinness of the \n     record he and his sponsors in the administration have chosen \n     to make available, the Senate should vote to reject his \n     nomination.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the New York Times. It is a newspaper that has \ncirculation not in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands but \nin the millions.\n  Among other things, this editorial states:\n\n       Mr. Estrada has put few of his views in the public record. \n     One way to begin to fill this gap, and give the Senate \n     something to work with, would be to make available the \n     numerous memorandums of law that Mr. Estrada wrote when he \n     worked for the solicitor general's office, as other nominees \n     have done. But the White House has refused senators' \n     reasonable requests to review these documents.\n       Mr. Estrada, now a lawyer in Washington, also had an \n     opportunity to elaborate on his views, and assuage senators' \n     concerns, at his confirmation hearing, but he failed to do \n     so. When asked his opinion about important legal questions, \n     he dodged. Asked his views of Roe v. Wade, the landmark \n     abortion case, Mr. Estrada responded implausibly that he had \n     not given enough thought to the question. Mr. Estrada's case \n     is particularly troubling because the administration has more \n     information about his views, in the form of his solicitor \n     general memos, but is refusing to share it with the Senate.\n\n  Finally, the article says:\n\n       The very absence of a paper trail on matters like abortion \n     and civil liberties may be one reason the administration \n     chose him. It is also a compelling--indeed necessary--reason \n     to reject him.\n  It is not as if the objection to this man is out of nowhere. We have \neditorials and newspapers that are transmitted to millions of people \nevery day that take the position this man shouldn't be confirmed as a \ncircuit court judge. We can't discount those opinions, or think there \nare some left-wing kooks who have decided for reasons which are not \nsubstantive not to go with this man.\n  I would also say that there have been a number of Senators talking \nabout how unusual it is--how unusual it is--that we are talking about a \njudge's qualifications. I think if there is anything in the extreme, \nall we need to do\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\nis look at the newspaper of today--the Roll Call: ``GOP Calls on K \nStreet to Boost Estrada.''\n  What this is all about is getting the lobbyists involved--to put \npressure on Senators to move forward on this nomination and approve \nhim. This Roll Call story documents special interests being told by \nmembers of the Republican leadership that they have a stake in this \nnomination process.\n  I think if there is anything untoward, it is the pressure being put \non these people.\n  I also note that one of the Senators in the majority complained today \nabout vacancies in the Federal court system. We are talking about the \nD.C. Court of Appeals. We Democrats tried to fill those. We were not \nallowed to do so. Why? Among other reasons, we were told by the \nmajority that the D.C. Court of Appeals was too big and the people we \nwanted to put on would be just unnecessary baggage; that it wasn't \nnecessary to fill those vacancies.\n  What our friend on the other side of the aisle complained about was \nOK, but he failed to explain that the vacancies on the two courts he \nmentioned--the D.C. Court of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit--were caused \nby the Republicans' failure to act, or their success in blocking \nnominees to the DC court.\n  Allen Snyder, who was a nominee voted qualified by the ABA, was never \ngiven a hearing, and never had a committee vote for a seat on the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Elena Kagan, a well-respected law professor, was never given a \nhearing and was never given a committee vote for her nomination to the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court.\n  On the Sixth Circuit, Kathleen McCree Lewis--I am only giving you \nexamples--waited for more than a year, was never given a hearing, and \nwas never given a committee vote on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Kent Markus--no hearing and no vote; Helene White waited 4 years--no \nhearing and no vote.\n  We have said here--Senator Daschle when he was majority leader and I \nhave said--that this isn't get even time for when we were in the \nmajority. We tried to treat the minority then as we wanted to be \ntreated when we were in the minority. We expect to be treated as we \ntreated the minority when we were in the majority for approximately 18 \nmonths. That is what we are asking.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader is on the floor. I would be happy \nto yield to the majority leader and then would retain the floor when \nthe majority leader completes his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday \nthere be an additional 6 hours for debate on the Estrada nomination; \nprovided further that the time be equally divided between the chairman \nand ranking member or their designees, and that following the \nconclusion of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Given the objection, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle if they need additional time, which I \nassume they do? And if so, would they be willing for me to modify the \nrequest to 8 hours or 10 hours or 12 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond to the \ndistinguished Republican leader, the majority leader. As he knows, we \nbegan this debate yesterday afternoon. We had a good debate yesterday, \nI think, for 3 or 4 hours. I thought it was a constructive debate.\n  There are strong feelings on both sides of the aisle with regard to \nthis nomination. I think our colleagues, of course, would have been \nprepared to continue the debate this week, and, for good reason, we are \nunable to do that because of the Republican conference. Our conference \nis later on this spring. Theirs is now. That precludes our opportunity \nto continue the debate. But clearly, very few Senators have had a \nchance to be heard. Few Senators have had the occasion to look more \ncarefully at these facts.\n  We cannot prescribe a particular time, at least at this point. We \nwill continue to discuss this matter with our colleagues, and I will be \nin touch with the distinguished Republican leader at a later date. But \nclearly this nomination deserves careful consideration, with ample time \nfor debate.\n  I would hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle could be afforded \ntheir chance to speak to this nomination. It is a controversial \nnomination and, therefore, requires perhaps more time than others. So \nfor that reason, I object.\n  I, of course, would not be able to say how much additional time we \nwould require, but certainly some time next week will be required.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield so I can ask a question of \nthe Democratic leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, there \nhas been talk here by the majority that there is a filibuster taking \nplace. I said, just a few minutes ago, unless I missed something you \nsaid, there has been no decision made from you as to whether or not \nthere is going to be a filibuster. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is correct. As I \nsaid, I think I recall there were only three or four Senators who were \nable to speak yesterday. There are many others who wish to have the \nopportunity to speak. And certainly to cut off debate prior to the time \nthey have had that occasion, especially with a nomination of this \nimport, would be unwise. But there is no filibuster as we speak.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments made by \nthe assistant Democratic leader and the Democratic leader on the \nimportance of this nomination and the importance of having adequate \ntime for debate and discussion, in part because this is the first judge \nto come through in this Congress, and it is important that it be \nhandled well and it be handled fairly and it be handled in a \ncooperative spirit, which has been demonstrated over the last 2 days.\n  The reason for extending the unanimous consent request for Monday, \nwhich was objected to--I do want to state very clearly we need to have \npeople on the floor talking and debating and discussing as much as \npossible for the times that are made available. I will shortly announce \nwe will come back Monday. I would hope we could go through Monday and \nMonday evening, if necessary, and use that time effectively so we do \nhave adequate discussion and debate.\n  This is an important nomination. There has been good debate to date. \nI encourage all of our colleagues to take advantage of the opportunity \nwe are making available. We will extend the hours, starting earlier and \ngoing later, in order to make sure people do have that ample \nopportunity.\n  In terms of the allegations of a filibuster--and certainly even the \nuse of the term yet--individual Senators can express themselves, but I \nthink it does show the desire to have good debate, useful debate, to \nhave the points made on both sides of the aisle, and then to allow an \nup-or-down vote on this nominee. I think we are on course for that. I \nwould appreciate, in the early part of next week--after checking with \nyour side of the aisle; and I will do likewise--for us to try to get \nsome sort of time certain so we can further plan the business of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, can I ask the distinguished majority leader \na couple questions?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. First question. I believe you will announce it later. Do \nyou expect any votes on Monday?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes. We will have votes on Monday.\n  Mr. REID. Second question: Let's say there is something worked out \nand we have a vote on this on Tuesday. What are we going to take up \nafter that?\n  Mr. FRIST. We will have other judges we will go to, and there are a \nnumber of bills that are being considered. There is a children's bill \nthat is related to pornography we will be taking up at some point. \nThere are other bills that have come through. There is an antitheft \nbill that is being considered right now we might be able to take up on \nMonday.\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Those bills have been reported out of committee?\n  Mr. FRIST. The military tax bill has been reported out. We have the \nMoscow treaty, which is very important, that we passed through the \nForeign Relations Committee. We would like to address that as soon as \npossible. There are other pieces of legislation that are being looked \nat now. So we do have a number of items we can go to.\n  Mr. REID. One final question, Mr. President: What time do you expect \nthe vote to be on Monday? We have people on our side, and I am sure on \nyour side, who are interested in that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Approximately 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I would just say, if we could make that 5:15, it helps one \nof our Senators.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader. I know that our Republican colleagues are hoping to \nadjourn shortly so they can accommodate their schedule. I want to \nrespect that, but I know Senator Biden also wanted to come to the floor \nfor some brief remarks with regard to North Korea, which is why I \noriginally came to the floor.\n  I wish to comment for a moment and thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada for his comments on the Estrada nomination. I think it may \narguably be the most serious of all nominations which has been \npresented to the Senate by this administration--the seriousness of \nknowing so little with so little information having been provided, and \nwith so significant a level of intransigency with regard to a \nwillingness to provide the information we seek. We have a \nconstitutional obligation to advise and consent.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand how anybody could be called \nupon to vote on the qualifications of this or any other individual with \nso little information provided, and with the arrogance demonstrated by \nthis nominee and in this case by the administration with regard to our \nright to that information.\n  I am very troubled. I know when you look at the array of Hispanic \norganizations that have now publicly declared their opposition to a \nHispanic nominee, you get some appreciation of the depth of feeling \nabout this issue, about this candidate, about his qualifications, and \nabout the stakes as we consider filling a position in the second \nhighest court in the land.\n  I will have a lot more to say about this next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2034-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I commend the Secretary of State for the \nstrong presentation to the United Nations Security Council that he made \nyesterday. He confirmed what many of us already knew--that Saddam \nHussein is a threat who has, once again, failed to live up to his \ncommitments to the international community.\n  And he did it at a place many of us had been pressing him and the \nadministration to do it--at the United Nations.\n  I hope that President Bush will use Secretary Powell's presentation \nto build a broad international coalition to confront Iraq. Our national \nsecurity is better served if he does.\n  But, as the world's attention was focused on Secretary Powell and his \npresentation, an even more ominous development regarding weapons of \nmass destruction was taking place in North Korea.\n  Yesterday, North Korea announced that it had flipped the switch and \nrestarted a power plant that can be used to produce plutonium for \nnuclear weapons.\n  This is but the latest in a series of aggressive steps North Korea \nhas taken to kick into gear its programs to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them--steps that our intelligence \ncommunity believes indicate that Iraq is months, if not years, away \nfrom being able to take.\n  At the U.N., Colin Powell talked about the potential that Iraq may \nbuild a missile that could travel 1,200 kilometers. In 1998, North \nKorea fired a multi-stage rocket over Japan, proving they are capable \nof hitting one of America's closest allies--and soon, America itself.\n  In November 2001, intelligence analysts presented a report to senior \nadministration officials that concluded North Korea had begun \nconstruction of a plant to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons.\n  In October 2002, North Korea informed visiting U.S. officials that it \nhad a covert nuclear weapons program.\n  In December 2002, North Korea turned off cameras that were being used \nto ensure that 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods were not being converted \ninto weapons-grade material.\n  Days later, North Korea kicked out an international team of weapons \ninspectors.\n  And, within the past week, the administration confirmed that North \nKorea has begun moving these fuel rods to an undisclosed location.\n  On Tuesday, former Assistant Secretary of Defense and Korea expert \nAshton Carter called these events ``a huge foreign policy defeat for \nthe United States and a setback for decades of U.S. non-proliferation \npolicy.''\n  He is right. But it is potentially even worse. North Korea could have \nsix to eight additional nuclear weapons before autumn.\n  And we know, when it comes to nuclear weapons--it only takes one. \nRemember, everything North Korea makes, North Korea sells.\n  Those scuds we intercepted on a ship to Yemen--and then inexplicably \nreturned--weren't a gift. They were an example of business as usual \nfrom what even this administration has acknowledged is the world's \nworst proliferator.\n  As alarming as this information is, the administration's reaction is \neven more troubling. The President said in the State of the Union:\n\n     the gravest danger in the war on terror . . . is outlaw \n     regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons.\n\n  As the chronology of events I detailed above indicates, the \nadministration knew about North Korea's plans on enriching uranium as \nearly as November 2001, and yet it has said little, and done less, to \nstop these plans.\n  We have heard the administration--through leaks in the press from \nunnamed sources--suggest that we cannot focus on North Korea because it \nwill distract attention from Iraq.\n  And we have even heard--and this is on the record--that some in the \nadministration believe that North Korea's expansion of its nuclear \narsenal is not even necessarily a problem.\n  Proliferators with nuclear weapons are a problem--a serious one. And \nour attention should be focused on all the threats we face. It is well \npast time that the administration develop a clear policy on North \nKorea.\n  Earlier this week, an administration official testified before the \nSenate that we will have to talk directly to the North Koreans. But he \nwent on to say that the administration had not reached out to the North \nKoreans to schedule talks and did not know when that might happen.\n  In the State of the Union, the President stated that the United \nStates is ``working with the countries of the region . . . to find a \npeaceful solution.'' All indications, however, suggest that the \ncountries in the region appear to be taking a course directly at odds \nwith the administration's latest pronouncements.\n  North Korea is a grave threat that seems to grow with each day that \npasses without high-level U.S. engagement. It is one the President must \nredouble his efforts to confront.\n  The President should stop downplaying this threat, start paying more \nattention to it, and immediately engage the North Koreans in direct \ntalks.\n  Secretary Powell was very effective in outlining the threats Iraq \nposes. But\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nwe need a comprehensive strategy to effectively deal with ``all'' the \nthreats we face.\n  Given the stakes of this situation and the ongoing confusion about \nthe President's and the administration's policy, we should expect no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2035-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2035-S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, midday today President Bush is going to \ngive a speech here in Washington, DC, on the subject of the development \nof fuel cell vehicles and moving to a hydrogen economy.\n  I was glad to hear the President express support for the concept of \nhydrogen and fuel cells in his State of the Union Address. After his \nspeech, I gave him credit for discussing that with the American people.\n  Since last year, I have made a number of presentations on the Senate \nfloor about fuel cells. Today, I would like to share with my colleagues \nmy thoughts about the development of a hydrogen economy and the use of \nfuel cells in our future.\n  I have told all my colleagues previously that my first vehicle when I \nwas a kid was an antique car I purchased for $25. It was a 1924 Model T \nFord. I am sure people are tired of hearing me talk about it. I was 16 \nyears old, and I was the owner of an antique 1924 Model T Ford. I \nrestored it. It took me a year and a half to 2 years to do that. I \nlovingly restored this old Model T. Then I sold it. I discovered, later \nin high school, that I wanted to date, and a Model T was not exactly a \nmodern way to date.\n  The point of the story is, when I was a kid I put gasoline in a Model \nT Ford--a 1924 Model T Ford--the same way you put gasoline in a 2003 \nFord. Nothing has changed in three-quarters of a century. You pull up \nto a pump. You pull the hose and put the nozzle in the tank and pump \ngas. The core technology has not changed.\n  Over the years, however, our dependence on a foreign source of that \npetroleum has worsened, and become very dangerous for our economy.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of State made a presentation at the United \nNations about the country of Iraq. Frankly, Iraq produces a lot of oil. \nSo do other countries in that region.\n  It is a very troubled region. Yet our economy is dependent on foreign \nsources of energy, much of it from that region. Is that something that \nmakes sense for us, for the American economy, for the American people? \nThe answer is no.\n  By talking about a technological change to a hydrogen economy and to \nthe use of fuel cells, I am not suggesting we should not and will not \nmine for coal, drill for oil and natural gas. I believe we will \ncontinue to use fossil fuel in our economy for a long while. And I \nbelieve we need to do that.\n  But we also need to understand that it is time to change. After a \ncentury of running gasoline through the carburetors of our vehicles, it \nis time for our country to think in different ways, about how can \ntechnology change our energy future. I would like to talk a bit about \nthat.\n  Again, let me say that I credit the President for talking about it in \nhis State of the Union Address. I think this is a step forward on the \npart of the administration--a baby step to be sure--but an important \nstep.\n  Mr. President, $1.2 billion is what the President announced last week \nand is talking about today. That is not all new money. In fact, the \nmajority of it is not new money. So it is a timid, small step forward, \nbut, nonetheless, a step in the right direction, for which I give this \nPresident credit.\n  Let me talk a bit about why we need to take strong action. I have in \nthe Chamber a chart that shows oil consumption--in millions of barrels \nper day. This shows total demand, and you see the line going up, up, \nup, and up. It also shows transportation demand, and that growth in \ntransportation demand is the bulk of the growth in energy needs and \nenergy usage in our country.\n  As you can see from the chart, shown here is domestic production. \nDomestic production does not come close to meeting the demand that \nexists in our country. So what do we do to meet the difference? What we \ndo is we import oil from other parts of the world.\n  The issue of energy security is a significant issue for all of us. \nThe White House issued a press release on that subject in connection \nwith its hydrogen proposal, noting the gap between our projected demand \nfor oil and our domestic supply. And that gap is going to increase, not \ndecrease--even if we would drill in ANWR, which I do not think this \nCongress will decide to do.\n  This is what the White House had to say in proposing development of \nfuel cells:\n\n       America's energy security is threatened by our dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n\n  Absolutely. There is no question about that.\n\n       America imports 55 percent of the oil it consumes; that is \n     expected to grow to 68 percent by the year 2025. Nearly all \n     of our cars and trucks run on gasoline. They are the main \n     reason America imports so much oil. Two-thirds of the 20 \n     million barrels of oil Americans use each day is used for \n     transportation.\n\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       Fuel cell vehicles offer the best hope of dramatically \n     reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  If tonight, God forbid, a network of terrorists interrupted the \nsupply of imported oil to this country, tomorrow morning this economy \nwould be in desperate, desperate trouble. That is the jeopardy we have \nin this country with our dependence--overdependence--on foreign sources \nof energy.\n  Let me describe where this dependence resides. And one can make one's \nown judgment about the stability of it all.\n  Our top supplier of oil is Saudi Arabia. That is not exactly \ndescribing a region of stability. Saudi Arabia is our top supplier. And \nthen you have Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq, Angola, Norway, \nColombia. Mr. President, 3.4 million barrels are imported into this \ncountry from these countries. And you understand--everyone \nunderstands--that Venezuela is in trouble. There is enormous turmoil in \nthe country of Venezuela. Saudi Arabia, Iraq--these are areas of the \nworld where there is not great stability.\n  It makes no sense to continue along, merrily whistling our way into \nthe future, believing that our country will be just fine even as our \neconomy is so dependent on sources of oil from outside our borders.\n  One-third of our oil comes from the Middle East. Iraq is the sixth \nlargest supplier of oil; Venezuela is the fourth; Angola and Colombia, \nthe seventh and ninth--both countries are also plagued with \ndifficulties.\n  Hydrogen fuels offer a way out. The supply of hydrogen is \ninexhaustible. It is everywhere. It is in water. The issue of hydrogen \nfuels is an interesting one. The notion of using hydrogen and the \ndevelopment of fuel cells is not new. In fact, a man named William \nRobert Grove was one of those larger-than-life characters who in the \n19th century could do almost anything. He studied law at Oxford, became \na barrister and a judge. In his spare time, he was also a professor of \nphysics. He ran into a patch of ill health and had his legal career \ninterrupted, so he turned to science to occupy his time, and he \ndeveloped what he called a gas voltaic battery, the forerunner of \nmodern fuel cells.\n  He based his experiment on the notion that sending an electric \ncurrent through water splits water into oxygen and hydrogen. He figured \nif you could reverse the reaction, combining hydrogen and oxygen, you \ncan produce electricity and water. In effect, he burned the hydrogen to \nproduce electricity.\n  Hydrogen can be derived from all sorts of energy sources. You take \nthe hydrogen from water and use it to move through a fuel cell and use \nit to power an automobile and out the back tailpipe, you get water \nvapor. What a wonderful thing.\n  This is a picture of a Daimler-Chrysler fuel cell vehicle that in \nJune of last year went from San Francisco to Washington, DC. This \ntechnology exists. It is being perfected.\n  The next chart shows a Ford fuel cell vehicle ready for production, a \nprototype, in autumn 2002. This is not a futuristic technology; there \nare fuel cell cars on the road today. I have driven a fuel cell car out \nin front of the Capitol Building, a car that is run by batteries \npowered by a fuel cell, that is using hydrogen as a fuel source.\n  The challenge is to make this technology cost effective. I have been \nmeeting with the CEOs and representatives of companies, Shell Hydrogen,\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nMethenex, UTC Fuel Cells, Union of Concerned Scientists, Siemens \nWestinghouse, just to name a few, to get their ideas. A broad coalition \nof interests is coming together because they recognize the promise of a \nhydrogen technology, going to a hydrogen economy using fuel cells in \nour future.\n  I mentioned a Ford Focus fuel cell car. Here is a picture of Ford \nFocus fuel cell car that is being filled at a hydrogen fuel station. If \nwe were to convert the automobile fleet to fuel cells, what would we \nhave to do? We would have to build vehicles with fuel cells. We would \nhave to find a reliable supply of hydrogen, determine how we will get \nthe hydrogen, and then we have to have the infrastructure, fueling \ninfrastructure and stations and technology to make this a commercial \nreality. That is one of the issues we have to deal with.\n  Fuel cell cars don't have to be limited in size to a Ford Focus. For \nexample, Nissan has another fuel cell prototype car--we are seeing more \nand more companies involved in this--the Nissan Xterra, fueled by \ncompressed hydrogen, tested on California roads in the year 2000.\n  General Motors now has an innovative prototype called the Hy-wire. \nThis particular car has a detachable exterior so you can buy multiple \nexteriors with one chassis so you can switch between an SUV or sedan. \nIt has no steering wheel or pedal. It is operated with a joystick. This \nis a fuel-cell-powered vehicle.\n  To make this vision a reality, the private sector is going to need \npublic investment. You might ask, why is that the case? Virtually all \nof the new technologies, the pole vaulting to new technologies, \nrequires Federal involvement, requires governmental involvement. People \nthese days forget, when they go on their computers and on to the \nInternet, they don't remember that the Internet exists because the \nGovernment developed a project to create the Internet. Otherwise, the \nInternet would not exist. That was a government creation that then \nbecame privatized, democratized, and is now a ubiquitous presence all \naround the world.\n\n  If we are going to change the basic construct of our vehicle fleet--\nand yes, stationary engines and other approaches to the use of power as \nwell--but especially with respect to vehicles, because of what I \ndescribed with the increased use of oil in our transportation fleet, \nthe only way that will happen is if we do what we have done in other \nmajor technological challenges: We need to think big. We need to be \nbold.\n  When we decided we were going to explore space, President John F. \nKennedy said, we will put a man on the Moon, and he set a time \ndeadline. America is going to put a man on the Moon.\n  We need an Apollo-type project with respect to the development of a \nhydrogen-based economy and the use of fuel cells, especially in our \ntransportation fleet.\n  We need an Apollo-type project--not timid, not baby steps, bold, big \nsteps--that says: Here is our goal. Here is what our country intends to \ndo, and here is how.\n  The President has proposed $1.2 billion over 5 years for this fuel \ncell initiative. About $700 million at most is new spending. And his \nproposal has substantial redirection of funds from a range of other \ntechnologies we also need to be developing: solar energy, wind energy, \nbiomass, and the other renewable and limitless sources of energy that \nexist. We need to continue to fund the research that is so important on \nthose limitless sources.\n  This initiative--one the President supports, one I credit him for \nsupporting--in my judgment deserves a strong financial commitment and \naggressive and strong goals to be set. It should not come at the \nexpense of research into other renewable sources of energy.\n  The Europeans are investing big in hydrogen. As discussed in a New \nYork Times article in October, the European Commission has committed $2 \nbillion over 5 years. They want to have a hydrogen economy. The \nJapanese are betting big on hydrogen, as discussed in a Business Week \narticle. The Business Week article says that:\n\n       Tokyo's fuel cell initiative has all the hallmarks of a \n     farsighted strategy and calls to mind Tokyo's blossoming \n     success in hybrids. Americans are snapping up these fuel-\n     efficient, environmentally friendly cars. Fuel cells could \n     turn out to be a bigger, more important chapter in the same \n     book.\n\n  I propose legislation that is bold. It is an Apollo-type project that \nsays: Let's set bold goals, $6.5 billion in a 10-year program for \nhydrogen fuel cell research, development, and infrastructure. I have \nbeen working with a number of industry leaders in natural gas, oil, \nenergy, methanol renewables, and fuel cell industries. Interestingly \nenough, the very companies that are now involved in the development of \noil and natural gas and electricity are the companies that are going to \nbe involved in this technology. They are the ones on the leading edge, \ninvolved in cutting-edge technology with respect to a hydrogen economy.\n  This initiative will not displace current energy firms. They will be \nvery actively involved in the creation and development of this new \nfuture.\n  What I propose is a substantial boost over what the President is \nproposing to date, saying it is the right direction, but it is many \nsteps short. Let's do this and do it boldly. We need to fund \ninfrastructure, fund research, and set goals. R funding, pilot \nprojects, yes, tax incentives for consumers who buy fuel cell vehicles, \nall of that is necessary. But it needs to be broad, bold, new money, \nnot reprogrammed money, something that catches the imagination of the \nAmerican people that we can make a change and decide our country will \nnot be held hostage by oil coming from unstable regions of the world.\n  Is $6.5 billion a significant investment? Absolutely. But over 10 \nyears, my plan would cost an amount equal to less than 1 percent of the \nPresident's proposed $675 billion tax cut.\n  Now, in our debate over energy, there will be discussion about where \nwe should drill for oil. As I said before, my State produces oil, coal, \nand natural gas. I believe we are going to continue to do that, and we \nshould. But if our strategy in energy is only to dig and drill, then \nour strategy should be called ``yesterday forever.'' And that is not \ngoing to solve the problem of dependence on foreign oil.\n  In 2000, the president of Shell Oil attended the World Petroleum \nCongress, and this is what he said:\n\n       If the world thinks that carbon dioxide emissions should be \n     reduced, I see this as an opportunity. The stone age didn't \n     end because they ran out of stones, but as a result of \n     competition from the bronze tools which better meet people's \n     needs. I feel there is something in the air. People are ready \n     to say this is something we should do.\n\n  You know, that is what our charge is at this point--to think ahead. \nWe should not develop a policy and debate a policy that is simply \n``yesterday forever,'' and not to ignore the needs of those that \nproduce coal, natural gas, and oil. We need to work with industry \nleaders to make them part of the solution, part of the answer, part of \nthe cutting-edge change that will lead us to a hydrogen-based economy, \nwith fuel cells powering not only stationary engines, but especially \nthat part of our energy usage that is growing so rapidly, \ntransportation.\n  I started by talking about my old Model T that I bought as a young \nboy. I am hoping that in years to come, someone walking into a showroom \nto buy a new car will be able to buy a really ``new'' vehicle, powered \nby fuel cells, a vehicle that is part of a new hydrogen-based economy, \none that can move this country into the future, strengthen its economy, \nand rescue us from dependence on a supply of oil from such enormously \ntroubled parts of our world.\n  Will Rogers used to say:\n\n       When there is no place left to spit, you either have to \n     swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times.\n\n  On energy, there is ``no place left to spit,'' in the vernacular. We \nhave to change. We need to move beyond the same tired debate of where \nare we going to dig and drill. Let's work with those that produce \nfossil fuels and say you are valuable to this country and to our \neconomy and will always be. Let's work with them to say you will also \nbe the pioneers in the development of a hydrogen economy, developing \nfuel cells for our future. We can do that. This President says, let's \nmove in that direction. I say, absolutely, good for you. But I say \nlet's do more than just move. Let's be bold, establish a national goal, \nand make this happen.\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2035-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2035-S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

We need to be \nbold.\n  When we decided we were going to explore space, President John F. \nKennedy said, we will put a man on the Moon, and he set a time \ndeadline. America is going to put a man on the Moon.\n  We need an Apollo-type project with respect to the development of a \nhydrogen-based economy and the use of fuel cells, especially in our \ntransportation fleet.\n  We need an Apollo-type project--not timid, not baby steps, bold, big \nsteps--that says: Here is our goal. Here is what our country intends to \ndo, and here is how.\n  The President has proposed $1.2 billion over 5 years for this fuel \ncell initiative. About $700 million at most is new spending. And his \nproposal has substantial redirection of funds from a range of other \ntechnologies we also need to be developing: solar energy, wind energy, \nbiomass, and the other renewable and limitless sources of energy that \nexist. We need to continue to fund the research that is so important on \nthose limitless sources.\n  This initiative--one the President supports, one I credit him for \nsupporting--in my judgment deserves a strong financial commitment and \naggressive and strong goals to be set. It should not come at the \nexpense of research into other renewable sources of energy.\n  The Europeans are investing big in hydrogen. As discussed in a New \nYork Times article in October, the European Commission has committed $2 \nbillion over 5 years. They want to have a hydrogen economy. The \nJapanese are betting big on hydrogen, as discussed in a Business Week \narticle. The Business Week article says that:\n\n       Tokyo's fuel cell initiative has all the hallmarks of a \n     farsighted strategy and calls to mind Tokyo's blossoming \n     success in hybrids. Americans are snapping up these fuel-\n     efficient, environmentally friendly cars. Fuel cells could \n     turn out to be a bigger, more important chapter in the same \n     book.\n\n  I propose legislation that is bold. It is an Apollo-type project that \nsays: Let's set bold goals, $6.5 billion in a 10-year program for \nhydrogen fuel cell research, development, and infrastructure. I have \nbeen working with a number of industry leaders in natural gas, oil, \nenergy, methanol renewables, and fuel cell industries. Interestingly \nenough, the very companies that are now involved in the development of \noil and natural gas and electricity are the companies that are going to \nbe involved in this technology. They are the ones on the leading edge, \ninvolved in cutting-edge technology with respect to a hydrogen economy.\n  This initiative will not displace current energy firms. They will be \nvery actively involved in the creation and development of this new \nfuture.\n  What I propose is a substantial boost over what the President is \nproposing to date, saying it is the right direction, but it is many \nsteps short. Let's do this and do it boldly. We need to fund \ninfrastructure, fund research, and set goals. R funding, pilot \nprojects, yes, tax incentives for consumers who buy fuel cell vehicles, \nall of that is necessary. But it needs to be broad, bold, new money, \nnot reprogrammed money, something that catches the imagination of the \nAmerican people that we can make a change and decide our country will \nnot be held hostage by oil coming from unstable regions of the world.\n  Is $6.5 billion a significant investment? Absolutely. But over 10 \nyears, my plan would cost an amount equal to less than 1 percent of the \nPresident's proposed $675 billion tax cut.\n  Now, in our debate over energy, there will be discussion about where \nwe should drill for oil. As I said before, my State produces oil, coal, \nand natural gas. I believe we are going to continue to do that, and we \nshould. But if our strategy in energy is only to dig and drill, then \nour strategy should be called ``yesterday forever.'' And that is not \ngoing to solve the problem of dependence on foreign oil.\n  In 2000, the president of Shell Oil attended the World Petroleum \nCongress, and this is what he said:\n\n       If the world thinks that carbon dioxide emissions should be \n     reduced, I see this as an opportunity. The stone age didn't \n     end because they ran out of stones, but as a result of \n     competition from the bronze tools which better meet people's \n     needs. I feel there is something in the air. People are ready \n     to say this is something we should do.\n\n  You know, that is what our charge is at this point--to think ahead. \nWe should not develop a policy and debate a policy that is simply \n``yesterday forever,'' and not to ignore the needs of those that \nproduce coal, natural gas, and oil. We need to work with industry \nleaders to make them part of the solution, part of the answer, part of \nthe cutting-edge change that will lead us to a hydrogen-based economy, \nwith fuel cells powering not only stationary engines, but especially \nthat part of our energy usage that is growing so rapidly, \ntransportation.\n  I started by talking about my old Model T that I bought as a young \nboy. I am hoping that in years to come, someone walking into a showroom \nto buy a new car will be able to buy a really ``new'' vehicle, powered \nby fuel cells, a vehicle that is part of a new hydrogen-based economy, \none that can move this country into the future, strengthen its economy, \nand rescue us from dependence on a supply of oil from such enormously \ntroubled parts of our world.\n  Will Rogers used to say:\n\n       When there is no place left to spit, you either have to \n     swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times.\n\n  On energy, there is ``no place left to spit,'' in the vernacular. We \nhave to change. We need to move beyond the same tired debate of where \nare we going to dig and drill. Let's work with those that produce \nfossil fuels and say you are valuable to this country and to our \neconomy and will always be. Let's work with them to say you will also \nbe the pioneers in the development of a hydrogen economy, developing \nfuel cells for our future. We can do that. This President says, let's \nmove in that direction. I say, absolutely, good for you. But I say \nlet's do more than just move. Let's be bold, establish a national goal, \nand make this happen.\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2037-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2037-S2044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      ASBESTOS IN ATTIC INSULATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to share a story with my \ncolleagues. It's a true story about a family who happened to live in a \nneighborhood in Spokane, WA. They could have easily been in Memphis or \nMinneapolis or Midland as well. But they lived in my State, in Spokane, \na typical American city in Eastern Washington.\n  Mr. President, as part of realizing their American dream, Ralph Busch \nand his wife Donna bought a house. They were newlyweds, and this was \nthe home they bought after getting married. They soon discovered that \nit needed roof repairs, and so Ralph spent quite a bit of time in the \nattic, working on his roof.\n  The following year they found they had to renovate an addition that \nwas put on the house in the 1950s.\n  They both had full-time jobs, so they spent many nights and weekends \nworking on their home. They knocked down walls and tore through the old \ninsulation, drywall and wood. They sanded and hammered and spent two \nentire years fixing up the place.\n  One morning, Ralph was reading the newspaper. Just by chance, he came \nacross a story about a company that manufactured a household insulation \ncalled Zonolite. This insulation, he read, was tainted with deadly \nasbestos.\n  Ralph suddenly realized that Zonolite was in his home.\n  Ralph Busch was stunned as it dawned on him. He had just spent two \nyears in his own home handling Zonolite insulation and he and his wife \nmay have unknowingly been exposed to deadly asbestos.\n  What would happen from his and his wife's exposure?\n  How come no one had told him he had asbestos in his attic?\n  The Zonolite insulation was a product from the little town of Libby, \nMT. It was produced by the W.R. Grace Company.\n  W.R. Grace mined vermiculite from the hillside near Libby. The \ncompany turned the ore into insulation known as Zonolite by heating \nvermiculite to expand it into light granules.\n  The process was similar to popping popcorn. After sorting the popped \nvermiculite, W.R. Grace poured it into bags and sold it to use as \ninsulation.\n  The company marketed Zonolite as ``perfectly safe''.  .  .\n  But laced throughout the vermiculite in the ground near Libby, \nanother mineral was present: asbestos. W.R. Grace's process to make \nZonolite and other products could not, and did not, remove all the \nasbestos from the end product. Zonolite insulation contains between .5 \npercent and 8 percent asbestos.\n  The community of Libby has suffered immensely from decades of mining \nthe deadly vermiculite ore used to make Zonolite insulation and other \nconsumer products.\n  At least 200 men and women from Libby have died from diseases caused \nby exposure to asbestos-tainted vermiculite, and hundreds more people \nfrom the town are sick.\n  When inhaled, asbestos can cause deadly diseases, from asbestosis to \nmesothelioma, a deadly cancer of the lining of the lung that is almost \nalways fatal. In fact, mesothelioma kills at least 2,000 people each \nyear and is caused only by asbestos.\n  The diseases induced by exposure to asbestos result in horrible \ndeaths and they are nearly always fatal. Treatment is harsh and \ndebilitating.\n  These diseases can take years to strike. The late Congressman Bruce \nVento and the father of the modern Navy, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt both died \nfrom asbestos they had been exposed to years earlier.\n  The asbestos-tainted insulation manufactured by the W.R. Grace \nCompany was used in homes throughout the country for decades.\n  Vermiculite from Libby first started being sold commercially in 1921, \nand W.R. Grace bought the mine in 1963. Reviews of invoices indicate \nthat more than 6 million tons of Libby ore was shipped to hundreds of \nsites nationwide for processing over the decades.\n  This chart behind me shows more than 300 sites across the Nation, \nwhere ore was processed, in many cases to make Zonolite insulation.\n  In internal memos and e-mails, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas estimated that as many as 35 million homes, schools and businesses \nmay still contain this insulation. Moreover, W.R. Grace knew the Libby \nmine contained asbestos when the company purchased it in 1963. But \nGrace made millions of tons of Zonolite anyway and unabashedly marketed \nit as ``safe.''\n  If the manufacturer of this insulation knew it was contaminated with \nasbestos, why didn't it or the Federal Government make sure that Ralph \nBusch and millions of others across the country knew to leave it alone?\n  The answer to the first question is that W.R. Grace still claims its \nproduct isn't harmful. The answer to the second question is more \ncomplicated.\n  According to published reports and internal EPA documents, the EPA \nwas preparing to tell the American people about the dangers of Zonolite \ninsulation. But it didn't happen.\n  An investigation by Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Andrew Schneider \nfound that last spring while it was addressing the public health crisis \nin Libby, MT, the EPA was preparing to tell the American people about \nthe dangers of Zonolite insulation in millions of homes across this \ncountry. But first, EPA had to deal with Libby. EPA decided it needed \nto minimize the exposure of Libby residents to asbestos-contaminated \nvermiculite, and the agency drafted a press release announcing its \ndecision.\n  This document said that EPA:\n\n       . . . will spend $34 million to remove dangerous asbestos-\n     contaminated vermiculite insulation from 70 percent of \n     residential and commercial buildings in Libby.\n  I am glad that EPA has taken aggressive steps to protect people in \nthat small Montana town.\n  Senator Baucus deserves tremendous credit for the work he has done to \nbring Federal resources to Montana to help people in Libby.\n  And EPA deserves credit for doing the right thing, and going in to \nremove the insulation from Libby.\n  But what about the rest of the country? What about the millions of \nother homes with Zonolite insulation?\n  Since EPA decided to help Libby, the agency anticipated the logical \nfollow-up question of what about the millions of homes nationwide that \ncontain the same Zonolite insulation as homes in Libby.\n  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the EPA had drafted news \nreleases, and drawn up lists of public officials to notify. The agency \nwas preparing to embark on an outreach and education campaign to let \npeople know about this hazard in their homes.\n  But what stopped EPA from following through with its warning?\n  It may have been the same person or people who blocked another \ngovernment health agency from warning workers about asbestos exposure.\n  Last April, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth--NIOSH--was preparing to release new guidance for workers who \ncome into contact with insulation in the course of their daily work.\n  NIOSH was preparing to alert workers, such as electricians, plumbers \nand maintenance workers, about how they can better protect themselves \nfrom exposure to asbestos in Zonolite insulation.\n  These materials were prepared last April, but they still have not \nbeen released.\n  Let me read from a ``Pre-Decisional Draft'' of a NIOSH Fact Sheet \ndated April 11, 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record in its \nentirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    NIOSH Recommendations for Reducing Risk of Worker Exposures to \n           Vermiculite That May Be Contaminated With Asbestos\n\n       A vermiculite deposit formerly mined in Libby, Montana was \n     contaminated with asbestos, raising concerns about \n     occupational and public health risks to former miners, \n     residents of Libby, and to workers and consumers who come in \n     contact with vermiculite end-products, such as insulation and \n     potting soil. This fact sheet summarizes existing \n     recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's \n     (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \n     (NIOSH) for reducing risk of worker exposures to asbestos or \n     to materials that may be contaminated with asbestos. These \n     recommendations serve as interim guidance from NIOSH for \n     employers and workers involved at sites where vermiculite \n     used as attic insulation or for other purposes may be \n     contaminated with asbestos. NIOSH is conducting further \n     research on vermiculite to provide more information on \n     exposures that may pose the highest risks to workers.\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n       How can a worker or an employer know if vermiculite they \n     have is contaminated with asbestos?\n       The only way to determine conclusively whether vermiculite \n     is contaminated is to have it analyzed by a trained \n     microscopist. (Any suggestions by NIOSH beyond OSHA 1910 \n     regarding methods for bulk analysis would be extremely \n     helpful and reduce much of the confusion we are seeing as \n     polarized light microscopy (PLM) has not been useful in \n     evaluating and predicting airborne levels generated from \n     VAI).\n       As a rule, we believe that any vermiculite that originated \n     in Libby, Montana, before 1990 should be regarded as \n     potentially contaminated. It is known that vermiculite from \n     Libby was sold as attic insulation under the product name \n     Zonolite Attic Insulation, and that this product is still in \n     homes throughout the United States.\n       (Comment: WR Grace estimates several million homes contain \n     VAI, which is most likely very conservative. If we don't wish \n     to provide any indication of the magnitude of the potential \n     VAI exposure in number of homes, we should be clear about the \n     potential situation to provide a more accurate picture and \n     warning. Also, it is uncertain whether other vermiculite \n     products not originating in Libby contain potentially \n     hazardous concentrations of asbestos, until we have \n     definitive information to the contrary these materials should \n     also be treated with caution)\n       How can workers be protected from asbestos-contaminated \n     vermiculite?\n       They should isolate the work area from other areas in order \n     to avoid spreading fibers, use local exhaust ventilation to \n     reduce dust exposures, and use appropriate respiratory \n     protection. If the employer or worker is concerned about \n     potential exposure, and if at all possible, the vermiculite \n     should not be disturbed.\n       Which respirators are appropriate to protect workers from \n     asbestos exposure?\n       If asbestos cannot be contained to below 0.1 fibers per \n     cubic centimeter of air (fiber/cm \\3\\) by engineering \n     controls and good work practices, or when engineering \n     controls are being installed or maintained, appropriate \n     respirators should be provided to workers. When respirators \n     are worn, it is advisable to wear a fit-tested, tight fitting \n     half-mask air-purifying particulate respirator (not a \n     disposable dust mask) equipped with an N-100 filter or \n     better, because of the potential for episodic exposure to 1 \n     fiber/cm \\3\\. A tight-fitting powered air-purifying \n     respirator should be provided instead of a negative-pressure \n     respirator whenever an employee chooses to use this type of \n     respirator. Tight fitting respirators should be used in \n     conjunction with a comprehensive respiratory protection \n     program under the direction of a health and safety \n     professional. Further information concerning respirator \n     selection can be found on the NIOSH web site at: http://\nwww.cdc.gov/niosh; or the OSHA web site at: http://\nwww.osha.gov.\n       What can workers do to protect themselves from exposure to \n     asbestos-contaminated vermiculite?\n       If at all possible, avoid handling or disturbing loose \n     vermiculite that is not contained in a manner that will \n     prevent the release of airborne dust.\n       Workers should guard against bringing dust home to the \n     family on clothes by using disposable protective clothing or \n     clothing that is left in the workplace. Do not launder work \n     clothing with family clothing.\n       Some measures can be used to avoid spreading potentially \n     contaminated dusts:\n       Use vacuum cleaners equipped with High-Efficiency \n     Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to collect asbestos-containing \n     debris and dust;\n       Employ wet methods or wetting agents, unless wetting is not \n     feasible or creates a greater hazard (wetting absorbent \n     vermiculite materials in an attic may not be feasible or \n     advisable);\n       Use negative pressure air units, which are large mobile \n     units that combine a fan and a HEPA filter critical for \n     preventing other exposures to non-workers, to keep \n     airborne asbestos levels to a minimum. Combined with \n     temporary barriers or enclosures, they can be set up to \n     make sure fibers do not contaminate other areas.\n       Dispose of wastes and debris contaminated with asbestos in \n     leak-tight containers;\n       Never use compressed air to remove asbestos-containing \n     materials;\n       Avoid dry sweeping, shoveling, or other dry clean-up \n     methods for dust and debris containing vermiculite that is \n     potentially contaminated with asbestos without environmental \n     controls to avoid spreading contamination;\n       Use proper respiratory protection.\n       Are there regulations that pertain to asbestos-contaminated \n     vermiculite?\n       Yes, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (OSHA) asbestos regulations (29 CFR 1910.1001 and 1926.1101) \n     for general industry and construction should be consulted to \n     determine if there are specific requirements that need to be \n     followed when handling asbestos-contaminated materials or \n     potential asbestos-containing materials. Relevant information \n     is posted on the OSHA Internet page at: http://www.osha.gov/\nSLTC/asbestos/index.html.\n       What should you do if you believe you have been exposed to \n     asbestos-containing vermiculite?\n       Workers who believe they have had significant past exposure \n     to asbestos-containing vermiculite, should consider getting \n     an appropriate medical check up. The appendices to the OSHA \n     asbestos standard describe the types of tests a physician \n     will need to provide.\n       What did NIOSH find from past studies at Libby, Montana?\n       NIOSH has responded to past and current concerns about \n     worker health by conducting needed research and disseminating \n     its findings. In the 1980s, NIOSH conducted research and \n     communicated findings about job-related exposures and health \n     effects among workers employed in mining and milling \n     vermiculite in Libby, Montana.\n       Our past studies identified asbestos contamination in the \n     vermiculite mined and milled in Libby.\n       We determined, from examination of x-rays of Libby miners, \n     that the miners showed evidence of adverse health effects \n     associated with asbestos exposure.\n       In a review of death certificates of former Libby \n     vermiculite miners, we identified an excess of deaths from \n     lung cancer, and other lung diseases that are known to be \n     related to asbestos exposure.\n       We made our findings available in 1985 through meetings in \n     Libby with workers and their representatives, employer \n     representatives, and members of the community. We also \n     published the results in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n       Is NIOSH planning further occupational health research on \n     vermiculite?\n       NIOSH is currently conducting research to help determine \n     whether the processing of vermiculite produced by mines other \n     than the Libby mine results in workplace exposure to \n     asbestos. Vermiculite is used in a variety of occupational \n     settings including construction, agriculture, horticulture, \n     and for miscellaneous industrial applications. Through \n     carefully designed sampling, NIOSH will be better able to \n     define the extent to which workers may be occupationally \n     exposed to vermiculite that may be contaminated with \n     asbestos. Current plans are to: (1) conclude field exposure \n     sampling, (2) send company-specific reports to each of the \n     surveyed sites, and (3) prepare a summary of the overall \n     result of exposure assessments.\n       (Question will NIOSH be performing any field investigations \n     to evaluate the occupational exposures to airborne asbestos \n     associated with Vermiculite Attic Insulation among commonly \n     exposed workers (i.e. home reconstruction workers, \n     electricians, cable TV workers) ?)\n       Has NIOSH been involved in the public health response for \n     Libby community?\n       NIOSH has been providing technical assistance to the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency for \n     Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) which are the \n     lead agencies for the Federal government in assessing current \n     concerns about potential community health risks from asbestos \n     exposures in Libby.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, NIOSH recommended that workers:\n\n       . . . should isolate the work area from other areas in \n     order to avoid spreading fibers, use local exhaust \n     ventilation to reduce dust exposures, and use appropriate \n     respiratory protection.\n       If the employer or worker is concerned about potential \n     exposure, and if at all possible, the vermiculite should not \n     be disturbed.\n\n  But, astonishingly, this guidance was never released. How many of the \nconstruction workers, maintenance people, electricians, plumbers and \nhomeowners across the country know they should ``avoid spreading \nfibers, use local exhaust ventilation or appropriate respiratory \nprotection?''\n  I suspect that like Mr. Ralph Busch, thousands of people across the \nU.S. are not taking these important precautions because they are simply \nunaware of the danger.\n  I would like to read to my colleagues another section from the never-\nreleased NIOSH Fact Sheet. This was in response to the question about \nhow workers can know if the vermiculite they have is contaminated with \nasbestos. It says:\n\n       As a rule, we believe that any vermiculite that originated \n     in Libby, Montana, before 1990 should be regarded as \n     potentially contaminated . . .\n       It is known that vermiculite from Libby was sold as attic \n     insulation under the product name Zonolite Attic Insulation \n     and that this product is still in homes throughout the United \n     States.\n\n  But especially interesting is the next section, which is in \nparentheses as a comment by the author:\n\n       W.R. Grace estimates several million homes contain \n     ``vermiculite attic insulation,'' which is most likely very \n     conservative.\n       If we don't wish to provide any indication of the magnitude \n     of the potential VAI (or vermiculite attic insulation) \n     exposure in number of homes, we should be clear about the \n     potential situation to provide a more accurate picture and \n     warning.\n\n  I must ask my colleagues, why wouldn't NIOSH or others in the \nAdministration--when they are taking great pains to do the job right in \nLibby--want to share with workers and the public an indication of the \nmagnitude of the number of homes with asbestos-tainted vermiculite?\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\n  Isn't it our government's job to protect people from risks associated \nwith hazardous substances such as asbestos?\n  Don't we need to know the scope of the problem in order to help gauge \nthe extent of the potential risks?\n  Why aren't we warning workers and giving them the new guidance that \nhas already been drafted by NIOSH?\n  Interestingly enough, on April 10, 2002, the day before the date on \nthis NIOSH Fact Sheet, EPA received a letter from W.R. Grace defending \ntheir harmful product.\n  The letter read:\n\n       Zonolite Attic Insulation (ZAI) has been insulating homes \n     for over 60 years and there is no credible reason to believe \n     that ZAI has ever caused an asbestos-related disease in \n     anyone who has used it in his/her home.\n\n  How then does Grace explain the fact that the company has settled at \nleast 25 bodily injury claims caused by exposure to Zonolite?\n  Make no mistake. W.R. Grace is a company with one of the worst public \nhealth and environmental records in America. I draw my colleague's \nattention to a 1998 article by Dr. David Egilman, Wes Wallace and \nCandace Hom published in the journal Accountability in Research \nentitled ``Corporate Corruption of Medical Literature: Asbestos Studies \nConcealed by W.R. Grace & Co.''\n  I will read briefly from the abstract of this article:\n\n       In 1963, W.R. Grace acquired the mine (in Libby) and \n     employee health problems at the mine became known to W.R. \n     Grace executives and to Grace's insurance company, Maryland \n     Casualty.\n       In 1976, in response to tighter federal regulation of \n     asbestos and asbestos-containing products, W.R. Grace funded \n     an animal study of tremolite toxicity.\n       They hoped to prove that tremolite did not cause \n     mesothelioma, the cancer uniquely associated with asbestos \n     exposure. However, the study showed that tremolite did cause \n     mesothelioma.\n       W.R. Grace never disclosed the results of this animal \n     study, nor did they disclose their knowledge of lung disease \n     in the Libby workers, either to the workers themselves or to \n     regulatory agencies.\n       These actions were intentional, and were motivated by \n     Grace's conscious decision to prioritize corporate profit \n     over human health.\n\n  Given the facts that W.R. Grace has knowingly manufactured and sold \nan asbestos-tainted product, has suppressed research findings showing \nthat tremolite asbestos causes cancer, and has denied that their \nproduct is potentially dangerous, the company is woefully lacking for \ncredibility.\n  Which brings us to our question: If EPA was planning to warn the \nAmerican public about the dangers of Zonolite insulation, what stopped \nEPA from following through with its plan?\n  Why aren't we warning homeowners nationwide about Zonolite \ninsulation?\n  Why aren't we warning workers and giving them new safety guidelines?\n  The answers might lie, not with the EPA, but with the White House \nOffice of Management and Budget, OMB.\n  An internal e-mail from John F. Wood, the Deputy General Counsel at \nOMB, to staff at EPA contained details about finalizing the Action Memo \nfor Libby.\n  Also copied on the e-mail were OMB Deputy Director Nancy Dorn and \nAssociate Director of Natural Resources Programs Marcus Peacock.\n  Here's what OMB's lawyer wrote to EPA. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis e-mail be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       John--thank you for your efforts to alleviate my concerns. \n     Here are just a few edits, which are necessary to avoid the \n     problems we discussed earlier.

Here \n     are just a few edits, which are necessary to avoid the \n     problems we discussed earlier. Please be sure to observe the \n     deletion of the citation of Sect. 104 (a) (4).\n\n  What is Section 104 (a) (4)?\n  It is a clause in the Superfund law, which enables the EPA to declare \na public health emergency.\n  And why did OMB tell the EPA to ``delete the citation'' to Section \n104 (a) (4)?\n  We don't know for sure, but if EPA had issued the public health \nemergency for Libby under Superfund, then the agency would have had to \nanswer questions about asbestos-tainted insulation from every other \nhomeowner in the country.\n  Here is what the St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigation concluded:\n\n       The Environmental Protection Agency was on the verge of \n     warning millions of Americans that their attics and walls \n     might contain asbestos-contaminated insulation. But, at the \n     last minute, the White House intervened, and the warning has \n     never been issued.\n\n  The Post-Dispatch got reaction from an EPA staffer about OMB's \nintervention:\n\n       It was like a gut shot,'' said one of those senior staffers \n     involved in the decision. ``It wasn't like they ordered us \n     not to make the declaration, they just really, really \n     strongly suggested against it. Really strongly. There was no \n     choice left.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the St. Louis Post-\nDispatch article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Dec. 29, 2002]\n\n         White House Office Blocked EPA's Asbestos Cleanup Plan\n\n                         (By Andrew Schneider)\n\n       Washington.--The Environmental Protection Agency was on the \n     verge of warning millions of Americans that their attics and \n     walls might contain asbestos-contaminated insulation. But, at \n     the last minute, the White House intervened, and the warning \n     has never been issued.\n       The agency's refusal to share its knowledge of what is \n     believed to be a widespread health risk has been criticized \n     by a former EPA administrator under two Republican \n     presidents, a Democratic U.S. senator and physicians and \n     scientists who have treated victims of the contamination.\n       The announcement to warn the public was expected in April. \n     It was to accompany a declaration by the EPA of a public \n     health emergency in Libby, Mont. In that town near the \n     Canadian border, ore from a vermiculite mine was contaminated \n     with an extremely lethal asbestos fiber called tremolite that \n     has killed or sickened thousands of miners and their \n     families.\n       Ore from the Libby mine was shipped across the nation and \n     around the world, ending up in insulation called Zonolite \n     that was used in millions of homes, businesses and schools \n     across America.\n       A public health emergency declaration had never been issued \n     by any agency. It would have authorized the removal of the \n     disease-causing insulation from homes in Libby and also \n     provided long-term medical care for those made sick. \n     Additionally, it would have triggered notification of \n     property owners elsewhere who might be exposed to the \n     contaminated insulation.\n       Zonolite insulation was sold throughout North America from \n     the 1940s through the 1990s. Almost all of the vermiculite \n     used in the insulation came from the Libby mine, last owned \n     by W.R. Grace & Co.\n       In a meeting in mid-March, EPA Administrator Christie Todd \n     Whitman and Marianne Horinko, head of the Superfund program, \n     met with Paul Peronard, the EPA coordinator of the Libby \n     cleanup and his team of health specialists. Whitman and \n     Horinko asked tough questions, and apparently got the answers \n     they needed. They agreed they had to move ahead on a \n     declaration, said a participant in the meeting.\n       By early April, the declaration was ready to go. News \n     releases had been written and rewritten. Lists of governors \n     to call and politicians to notify had been compiled. Internal \n     e-mail shows that discussions had even been held on whether \n     Whitman would go to Libby for the announcement.\n       But the declaration was never made.\n\n\n                        Derailed by White House\n\n       Interviews and documents show that just days before the EPA \n     was set to make the declaration, the plan was thwarted by the \n     White House Office of Management and Budget, which had been \n     told of the proposal months earlier.\n       Both the budget office and the EPA acknowledge that the \n     White House agency was actively involved, but neither agency \n     would discuss how or why.\n       The EPA's chief spokesman Joe Martyak said, ``Contact OMB \n     for the details.''\n       Budget office spokesperson Amy Call said, ``Those questions \n     will have to be addressed to the EPA.''\n       Call said the budget office provided wording for the EPA to \n     use, but she declined to say why the White House opposed the \n     declaration and the public notification.\n       ``These are part of our internal discussions with EPA, and \n     we don't discuss predecisional deliberations,'' Call said.\n       Both agencies refused Freedom of Information Act requests \n     for documents to and from the White House Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       The budget office was created in 1970 to evaluate all \n     budget, policy, legislative, regulatory, procurement and \n     management issues on behalf of the president.\n\n\n                        office interfered before\n\n       Former EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus, who worked \n     for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, called the \n     decision not to notify homeowners of the\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n     dangers posed by Zonolite insulation ``the wrong thing to \n     do.''\n       ``When the government comes across this kind of information \n     and doesn't tell people about it, I just think it's wrong, \n     unconscionable, not to do that,'' he said. ``Your first \n     obligation is to tell the people living in these homes of the \n     possible danger. They need the information so they can decide \n     what actions are best for their family. What right does the \n     government have to conceal these dangers? It just doesn't \n     make sense.''\n       But, he added, pressure on the EPA from the budget office \n     or the White House is not unprecedented.\n       Ruckelshaus, who became the EPA's first administrator when \n     the agency was created by Nixon in 1970, said he never was \n     called by the president directly to discuss agency decisions. \n     He said the same held true when he was called back to lead \n     the EPA by Reagan after Anne Gorsuch Burford's scandal-\n     plagued tenure.\n       Calls from a White House staff member or the Office of \n     Management and Budget were another matter.\n       ``The pressure could come from industry pressuring OMB or \n     if someone could find a friendly ear in the White House to \n     get them to intervene,'' Ruckelshaus said. ``These issues \n     like asbestos are so technical, often so convoluted, that \n     industry's best chance to stop us or modify what we wanted \n     to do would come from OMB.''\n       The question about what to do about Zonolite insulation was \n     not the only asbestos-related issue in which the White House \n     intervened.\n       In January, in an internal EPA report on problems with the \n     agency's much-criticized response to the terrorist attacks in \n     New York City, a section on ``lessons learned'' said there \n     was a need to release public health and emergency information \n     without having it reviewed and delayed by the White House.\n       ``We cannot delay releasing important public health \n     information,'' said the report. ``The political consequences \n     of delaying information are greater than the benefit of \n     centralized information management.''\n       It was the White House budget office's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs that derailed the Libby \n     declaration. The regulatory affairs office is headed by John \n     Graham, who formerly ran the Harvard Center for Risk \n     Analysis.\n       His appointment last year was denounced by environmental, \n     health and public advocacy groups, who claimed his ties to \n     industry were too strong. Graham passes judgment over all \n     major national health, safety and environmental standards.\n       Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., urged colleagues to vote against \n     Graham's appointment, saying Graham would have to recuse \n     himself from reviewing many rules because affected industries \n     donated to the Harvard University Center.\n       Thirty physicians, 10 of them from Harvard, according to \n     The Washington Post, wrote the committee asking that Graham \n     not be confirmed because of ``a persistent pattern of \n     conflict of interest, of obscuring and minimizing dangers to \n     human health with questionable cost-benefit analyses, and of \n     hostility to governmental regulation in general.''\n       Repeated requests for interviews with Graham or anyone else \n     involved in the White House budget office decision were \n     denied.\n\n\n                       ``It was like a gut shot''\n\n       Whitman, Horinko and some members of their top staff were \n     said to have been outraged at the White House intervention.\n       ``It was like a gut shot.'' said one of those senior \n     staffers involved in the decision. ``It wasn't that they \n     ordered us not to make the declaration, they just really, \n     really strongly suggested against it. Really strongly. \n     There was no choice left.''\n       She and other staff members said Whitman was personally \n     interested in Libby and the national problems spawned by its \n     asbestos-tainted ore. The EPA's inspector general had \n     reported that the agency hadn't taken action more than two \n     decades earlier when it had proof that the people of Libby \n     and those using asbestos-tainted Zonolite products were in \n     danger.\n       Whitman went to Libby in early September 2001 and promised \n     the people it would never happen again.\n       ``We want everyone who comes in contact with vermiculite--\n     from homeowners to handymen--to have the information to \n     protect themselves and their families,'' Whitman promised.\n\n\n                        suits, bankruptcies grow\n\n       Political pragmatists in the agency knew the administration \n     was angered that a flood of lawsuits had caused more than a \n     dozen major corporations--including W.R. Grace--to file for \n     bankruptcy protection. The suits sought billions of dollars \n     on behalf of people injured or killed from exposure to \n     asbestos in their products or workplaces.\n       Republicans on Capitol Hill crafted legislation--expected \n     to be introduced next month--to stem the flow of these suits.\n       Nevertheless, Whitman told her people to move forward with \n     the emergency declaration. Those in the EPA who respect their \n     boss fear that Whitman may quit.\n       She has taken heat for other White House decisions such as \n     a controversial decision on levels of arsenic in drinking \n     water, easing regulations to allow 50-year-old power plants \n     to operate without implementing modern pollution controls and \n     a dozen other actions which environmentalists say favor \n     industry over health.\n       Newspapers in her home state of New Jersey ran front page \n     stories this month saying Whitman had told Bush she wanted to \n     leave the agency.\n       Spokesman Martyak said his boss is staying on the job.\n\n\n                         EPA WAS POISED TO ACT\n\n       In October, the EPA complied with a freedom of Information \n     Act request and gave the Post-Dispatch access to thousands of \n     documents--in nine large file boxes. There were hundreds of \n     e-mails, scores of ``action memos'' describing the \n     declaration and piles of ``communication strategies'' for how \n     the announcement would be made.\n       The documents illustrated the internal and external battle \n     over getting the declaration and announcement released.\n       One of the most contentious concerns was the anticipated \n     national backlash from the Libby declaration. EPA officials \n     knew that if the agency announced that the insulation in \n     Montana was so dangerous that an emergency had to be \n     declared, people elsewhere whose homes contained the same \n     contaminated Zonolite would want answers or perhaps demand to \n     have their homes cleaned.\n       The language of the declaration was molded to stress how \n     unique Libby was and to play down the national problem.\n       But many in the agency's headquarters and regional offices \n     didn't buy it.\n       In a Feb. 22 memo, the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention \n     and Toxics said ``the national ramifications are enormous'' \n     and estimated that if only 1 million homes have Zonolite \n     ``(are) we not put in a position to remove their (insulation) \n     at a national cost of over $10 billion?''\n       The memo also questioned the agency's claim that the age of \n     Libby's homes and severe winter conditions in Montana \n     required a higher level of maintenance, which in turn meant \n     increased disturbance of the insulation in the homes there.\n       It's ``a shallow argument,'' the memo said. ``There are \n     older homes which exist in harsh or harsher conditions across \n     the country. Residents in Maine and Michigan might find this \n     argument flawed.''\n       No one knows precisely how many dwellings are insulated \n     with Zonolite. Memos from the EPA and the Agency for Toxic \n     Substances and Disease Registry repeatedly cite an estimate \n     of between 15 million and 35 million homes.\n       A government analysis of shipping records from W.R. Grace \n     show that at least 15.6 billion pounds of vermiculite ore was \n     shipped from Libby to 750 plants and factories throughout \n     North America.\n       Between a third and half of that ore was popped into \n     insulation and usually sold in 3-foot-high kraft paper bags.\n       Government extrapolations and interviews with former W.R. \n     Grace Zonolite salesmen indicate that Illinois may have as \n     many as 800,000 homes with Zonolite, Michigan as many as \n     700,000. Missouri is likely to have Zonolite in 380,000 \n     homes.\n       With four processing plants in St. Louis, it is estimated \n     that more than 60,000 homes, offices and schools were \n     insulated with Zonolite in the St. Louis area alone.\n       Eventually, the internal documents show, acceptance grew \n     that the agency should declare a public health emergency.\n       In a confidential memo dated March 28, an EPA official said \n     the declaration was tentatively set for April 5.\n       But the declaration never came. Instead, Superfund boss \n     Horinko on May 9 quietly ordered that asbestos be removed \n     from contaminated homes in Libby. There was no national \n     warning of potential dangers from Zonolite. And there was no \n     promise of long-term medical care for Libby's ill and dying. \n     The presence of the White House budget office is noted \n     throughout the documents. The press announcement of the \n     watered-down decision was rewritten five times the day before \n     it was released to accommodate budget office wording \n     changes that played down the changes that played down the \n     dangers.\n\n\n                          dangers of zonolite\n\n       The asbestos in Zonolite, like all asbestos products, is \n     believed to be either a minimal risk or no risk if it is not \n     disturbed. The asbestos fibers must be airborne to be \n     inhaled. The fibers then become trapped in the lungs, where \n     they may cause asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a \n     fast-moving cancer of the lung's lining.\n       The EPA's files are filled with studies documenting the \n     toxicity of tremolite, how even minor disruptions of the \n     material by moving boxes, sweeping the floor or doing repairs \n     in attics can generate asbestos fibers.\n       This also has been confirmed by simulations W.R. Grace ran \n     in Weed-sport, N.Y. in July 1977; by 1997 studies by the \n     Canadian Department of National Defense; and by the U.S. \n     Public Health Service, which reported in 2000, that ``even \n     minimal handling by workers or residents poses a substantial \n     health risk.''\n       Last December, a study by Christopher Weis, the EPA's \n     senior toxicologist supporting the Libby project, reported \n     that ``the concentrations of asbestos fibers that occur in \n     air following disturbance of (insulation) may reach levels of \n     potential human health concerns.''\n       Most of those who have studied the needle-sharp tremolite \n     fibers in the Libby ore consider them far more dangerous than \n     other asbestos fibers.\n       In October, the EPA team leading the cleanup of lower \n     Manhattan after the attacks of Sept. 11 went to Libby to meet \n     with\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\n     Peronard and his crew. The EPA had reversed an early decision \n     and announced that it would be cleaning asbestos from city \n     apartments.\n       Libby has been a laboratory for doing just that.\n       Peronard told the visitors from New York just how dangerous \n     tremolite is. He talked about the hands-on research in Libby \n     of Dr. Alan Whitehouse, a pulmonologist who had worked for \n     NASA and the Air Force on earlier projects before moving \n     to Spokane, Wash.\n       ``Whitehouse's research on the people here gave us our \n     first solid lead of how bad this tremolite is,'' Peronard \n     said.\n       Whitehouse has not only treated 500 people from Libby who \n     are sick and dying from exposure to tremolite. The chest \n     specialist also has almost 300 patients from Washington \n     shipyards and the Hanford, Wash., nuclear facility who are \n     suffering health effects from exposure to the more prevalent \n     chrysotile asbestos.\n       Comparing the two groups, Whitehouse has demonstrated that \n     the tremolite from Libby is 10 times as carcinogenic as \n     chrysotile and probably 100 times more likely to produce \n     mesothelioma than chrysotile.\n       W.R. Grace has maintained that its insulation is safe. On \n     April 3 of this year, the company wrote a letter to Whitman \n     again insisting its product was safe and that no public \n     health declaration or nationwide warning was warranted.\n       Dr. Brad Black, who runs the asbestos clinic in Libby and \n     acts as health officer for Montana's Lincoln County, says \n     ``people have a right to be warned of the potential danger \n     they may face if they disturb that stuff.''\n       Marytak, chief EPA spokesman, argues that the agency has \n     informed the public of the potential dangers. ``It's on our \n     Web site,'' he said.\n       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is sponsoring legislation to \n     ban asbestos in the United States. She said the Web site \n     warning is a joke.\n       ``EPA's answer that people have been warned because it's on \n     their Web site is ridiculous,'' she said. ``If you have a \n     computer, and you just happened to think about what's in your \n     attic, and you happen to be on EPA's Web page, then you get \n     to know. This is not the way the safety of the public is \n     handled.\n       ``We, the government, the EPA, the administration have a \n     responsibility to at least let people know the information so \n     they can protect themselves if they go into those attics,'' \n     she said.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, because of OMB's involvement, EPA never \nconducted the planned outreach to warn people about Zonolite. NIOSH's \nguidance to workers about how to protect themselves was never \nfinalized.\n  In response to these shocking reports, on January 3, 2003, I wrote to \nEPA Administrator Whitman and OMB Director Daniels to get some answers.\n  Mr. Daniels has not yet responded to the allegations that his office \nblocked the announcement.\n  Ms. Whitman wrote that she is responding on behalf of OMB. I can only \nascribe this to OMB's desire to remain unaccountable and to hide the \nrole it played in these decisions.\n  Ms. Whitman's response was woefully inadequate. She failed to explain \nthe nature or the substance of OMB's involvement. She also wrote that \nit is not possible to know how many homes contain vermiculite \ninsulation even though HER OWN AGENCY has estimated it may be between \n15 and 35 million homes, schools, and businesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Administrator Whitman's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: Thank, you for your letters dated \n     January 3, 2003, to me and Mitch Daniels, Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget (OMB), regarding EPA's \n     efforts to address asbestos contamination in the town of \n     Libby, Montana. I am responding for both OMB and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n       I assure you that since my tenure at the Agency, every \n     action regarding Libby, Montana has been taken with the goal \n     of protecting the health of Libby residents from further \n     harm. After visiting with the residents of Libby Montana in \n     September 2001, I committed to have EPA do everything as \n     quickly and comprehensively as possible to remove the \n     multiple sources of asbestos exposure of Libby residents. The \n     Action Memo signed on May 9, 2002, authorized significant \n     additional measures in Libby, including the removal of attic \n     insulation. Cleanup work has proceeded at an aggressive pace \n     and substantial sources of exposure have already been \n     removed.\n       While enclosed are EPA's Office of Solid Waste and \n     Emergency Response detailed responses to your questions, I \n     want to make it clear that neither OMB nor any other Federal \n     agencies directed EPA to take a specific course of action \n     regarding whether to employ the public health emergency \n     provision of the Comprehensive Environmental Response and \n     Liability Act (``CERCLA'', or the Superfund Law). The Agency \n     made its decision regarding the removal of asbestos \n     contaminated vermiculite attic insulation from Libby homes in \n     order to reduce the cumulative exposure to residents as \n     quickly as possible. EPA based this decision on many factors, \n     including legal, scientific, and practical considerations. \n     The Agency concluded that asbestos contaminated vermiculite \n     insulation found in homes in Libby could be removed without a \n     public health emergency. Ultimately, EPA chose not to rely \n     upon CERCLA's health emergency provision, in part, to \n     minimize the possibility of removal work being delayed by \n     possible legal challenges to this untested approach, and \n     instead relied upon more traditional removal authorities.\n       Additional, I want to clarify that the decision to proceed \n     with the cleanup in Libby is unrelated to the larger issue of \n     whether asbestos contaminated vermiculite insulation poses a \n     risk outside of Libby, Montana. Several questions in your \n     letter imply that invoking the public health provision in \n     CERCLA for the situation in Libby would give the Agency \n     additional authority or impose additional requirements to \n     inform the public nationwide about the health risks \n     associated with asbestos contaminated vermiculite attic \n     insulation. This is not the case. While the experience and \n     data collected in Libby are important to a larger national \n     evaluation, the Libby cleanup and the Agency's national \n     evaluation of the potential risks of asbestos contaminated \n     attic insulation are on parallel but different tracks.\n       Again, thank you for your support of EPA's cleanup efforts \n     in Libby, Montana and your commitment to making sure that \n     people nationwide are not at risk from asbestos. The Agency \n     looks forward to working with you and your staff to continue \n     our mutual goal to protect the health and welfare of the \n     residents of Libby, Montana, and of the United States. If you \n     have further questions or concerns, please contact me, or \n     your staff may contact Betsy Henry in the Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564-\n     7222.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Christine Todd Whitman.\n                                  ____\n\n\nEnclosure: EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response and Office \n             of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances\n\n\n Detailed Responses to Senator Patty Murray's Questions on Vermiculite \n            Attic Insulation and the Libby, Montana Clean-Up\n\n     What were EPA's recommendations on formation of a policy to \n         inform consumers of potential dangers from exposure to \n         Zonolite insulation?\n       The Agency's activity in Libby reflects a unique situation \n     where citizens have been exposed for many years to \n     widespread, high levels of asbestos contamination, and suffer \n     unprecedented rates of asbestos related illness. After \n     extensive consideration of scientific and health-related \n     information, the Agency concluded that residents in Libby \n     were a sensitive population, and asbestos exposure which \n     would otherwise present an acceptable risk to a healthy \n     population may cause an increase in disease for a highly \n     impacted community like Libby. EPA decided to remove all \n     potential sources of exposure to asbestos in Libby, including \n     asbestos contamination in yards, playgrounds, parks, \n     industrial sites, the interiors of homes and businesses, and \n     vermiculite attic insulation.\n       The Agency's guidance to consumers outside of Libby has \n     consistently been to manage in place asbestos or asbestos \n     containing products found in the home. Based on currently \n     available information and studies the Agency continues to \n     believe that, absent the unique conditions present at Libby, \n     vermiculite insulation poses minimal risk if left \n     undisturbed. If removal of the insulation is desired, the \n     Agency recommends that this work be done professionally.\n       To better understand the potential risks of asbestos \n     contaminated vermiculite attic insulation, EPA's Office of \n     Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) initiated \n     the first phase of a limited study to evaluate the level of \n     asbestos in vermiculite attic insulation in homes in the \n     Spring of 2001. The study included six homes in Vermont and \n     simulations in an enclosure. This preliminary study will be \n     used to help the Agency design the next phase of a more \n     comprehensive study and to help determine whether the \n     Agency's guidance in place for many years--to manage asbestos \n     contaminated material in place or hire professionals to \n     conduct removals--is still appropriate or should be revised. \n     Formal external peer review is finished for the first phase \n     of the study. The Agency's Office of Research and Development \n     (ORD), as well as others, are currently reviewing the \n     preliminary study.\n       Based on the findings from this study, EPA will revise or \n     supplement the existing guidance and outreach materials as \n     necessary, and further inform the public about how best to \n     manage vermiculite attic insulation.\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\n     2. Top what extent were OMB and other federal agencies and \n         departments involved in the decision whether to declare a \n         public health emergency in Libby or to notify people \n         nationwide of the dangers potentially posed by exposure \n         to Zonolite?\n       EPA consulted extensively with other federal and state \n     partners in determining the best course of action to address \n     all sources of asbestos contamination in Libby. This included \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the Center for Disease Control, \n     the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, U.S. \n     Geological Survey, Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration, the State of Montana, and many others. \n     These consultations focused on scientific issues \n     associated with asbestos contaminated vermiculite \n     exposure, not to discuss public health emergency \n     declarations. The Agency was also contacted by several \n     members of Congress who wished to express the depth of \n     their concern and share their views regarding this matter. \n     In general, EPA tries to share information and discuss \n     potential response decisions with interested parties, \n     especially those with expertise in the area, so it can \n     make the most informed decision.\n       After consulting broadly with experts in the field, the \n     Agency determined a course of action regarding both the \n     removal of asbestos contaminated vermiculite attic insulation \n     and the public outreach to be conducted beyond Libby, \n     Montana. These decisions were made by the Administrator, in \n     close consultation with the Office of Solid Waste and \n     Emergency Response, the Office of Enforcement and Compliance \n     Assurance, the Office of General Counsel, the Office of \n     Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, and EPA Region \n     8.\n     3. What process did the Administration use in making these \n         decisions? Specifically what roles did individual \n         agencies play and who in these agencies was involved in \n         the process?\n       EPA's primary focus was on protecting the residents of \n     Libby by removing the multiple sources of asbestos exposure \n     as quickly as possible. EPA considered many factors, \n     including the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution \n     Contingency Plan. Ultimately, the Agency chose not to rely \n     upon CERCLA's health emergency provision, in part, to \n     minimize the possibility of removal work being delayed by \n     possible legal challenges to this novel approach, and instead \n     relied upon more traditional removal authorities. EPA \n     concluded that homes in Libby contained vermiculite attic \n     insulation that did not constitute a ``product.'' The Agency \n     therefore could clean up the insulation without addressing \n     the question of whether it constituted a public health \n     emergency.\n       In making its response decisions in Libby, EPA engaged in a \n     major effort to discuss and consider the issues associated \n     with its approach to cleaning up asbestos contamination, both \n     in Libby and at more than 20 contaminated sites out of the \n     241 domestic vermiculite processing facilities. Although 175 \n     of these sites had processed Libby vermiculite, EPA's \n     sampling confirmed that contamination only remained at 22 \n     sites. To date, EPA or the responsible parties have cleaned \n     up or have cleanup underway at 10 of these sites and the \n     remaining 12 sites are either being addressed or are under \n     further investigation and response planning. This effort has \n     been one of the most significant actions ever taken under the \n     Superfund program, and has involved the participation and \n     collaboration of a great many people and organizations at the \n     local, state and federal level.\n     4. Which outside parties, such as corporations, non-\n         governmental organizations or associations, did EPA \n         consult with on these decisions?\n       During the more than two years in which EPA has been \n     working on Libby, Agency officials have met with the Libby \n     community and its Technical Assistance Group, other agencies, \n     businesses in Libby and international corporations, various \n     associations, the State and subcommittees of both houses of \n     the U.S. Congress. Community members, the Vermiculite \n     Association, and W.R. Grace Corporation have all corresponded \n     with the Agency to state their opinions or to ask for \n     information about our work at the site.\n     5. What was OMB's final recommendation to EPA? What \n         recommendations, if any, did EPA receive from other \n         federal agencies and departments?\n       Neither OMB, nor any other federal agency directed EPA to \n     use a specific course of action regarding whether to employ \n     the health emergency provision of CERCLA. As stated \n     previously, EPA consulted extensively with other federal \n     partners, including OMB, in determining the best course of \n     action to address all sources of asbestos contamination.\n     6. Who ultimately directed EPA not to issue a public health \n         emergency in Libby last spring nor to proactively notify \n         the public in a proper manner?\n       No one directed the Agency. The decision was made by EPA. \n     After searching broadly for input from the many agencies \n     within the Executive Branch with expertise to inform our \n     thinking, the Agency decided to perform the cleanup under \n     traditional Superfund program removal authorities. \n     Furthermore, regarding outreach on the Libby decision, the \n     Agency has conducted many public meetings concerning the \n     Libby cleanup, and testified before Congress in July, 2001. \n     Since the Agency's first removal actions, the On-Scene \n     Coordinator in Libby has been in regular contact with the \n     citizens of Libby discussing the progress of the cleanup and \n     communicating about the issues of the vermiculite attic \n     insulation. The Administrator also spoke extensively on \n     issues concerning vermiculite contamination during her visit \n     to Libby, Montana in September of 2001.\n     7. What are EPA's most current estimates of how many homes, \n         businesses and schools still contain Zonolite? How did \n         EPA derive these numbers?\n       Over the years several attempts have been made to estimate \n     the number of homes that may contain vermiculite attic \n     insulation. While numbers have been included in at least one \n     study conducted for the Agency in 1985, the Agency does not \n     believe that these estimates are reliable. EPA recently again \n     tried to estimate the number of homes, businesses and schools \n     that may still contain vermiculite attic insulation but again \n     determined that this task was virtually impossible to \n     complete because there is little information about how many \n     homes contain vermiculite insulation (outside of Libby) as \n     well as little data about what happens to homes after they \n     are built. Any numbers derived from such an effort would be \n     inaccurate and misleading.\n       In the Libby valley, the Agency is identifying which homes \n     contain asbestos contaminated vermiculite insulation in the \n     attic and wall space by visually inspecting homes. The good \n     news is that EPA is finding vermiculite insulation in fewer \n     homes than the Agency anticipated in this region.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleagues may be curious about why I \nam so interested in EPA's decisions regarding vermiculite from Libby.\n  This issue is important to me because residents in my State are being \nexposed to asbestos from Zonolite.\n  And, Mr. President, constituents in your state and every other State \nin America may also have this insulation.\n  I am deeply concerned that most people with Zonolite in their homes \nare completely unaware of this problem. I am afraid most will not learn \nof it until they have already been exposed to dangerous levels of \nasbestos. And I am most concerned that this administration may be \nstifling EPA's efforts to warn homeowners, consumers, and workers \nbecause of pressure from W.R. Grace.\n  And I must remind my colleagues: there is no safe known level of \nexposure to asbestos. Deadly diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer \nand mesothelioma can develop decades after just brief exposures to high \nconcentrations of asbestos.\n  Ultimately, I believe Administrator Whitman wanted to do the right \nthing by warning homeowners nationwide to be careful if they have \nZonolite in their homes when the agency began removing Zonolite from \nhomes in Libby, MT. But she was stopped. The reasons may never be \nknown--the excuse may be buried in ``executive privilege.''\n  So where do we go from here?\n  First, I hope my colleagues will support efforts to get to the bottom \nof what stopped the EPA from warning the public. We have to increase \npressure on EPA, NIOSH, and other public health agencies to raise \npublic awareness about Zonolite.\n  Second, I hope my colleagues will support legislation to ban asbestos \nin America and to warn people about the potential dangers posed by \nZonolite insulation.\n  I appreciate the support for this legislation I have received from \nSenators Baucus, Cantwell, Dayton, and our late colleague, Senator \nWellstone, who were original cosponsors.\n  I have been working to raise awareness about the current dangers of \nasbestos for over 2 years.\n  In July of 2001, I chaired a Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee hearing on asbestos and workplace safety.\n  In June of 2002, 2 days after introducing the Ban Asbestos in America \nAct, I testified at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nhearing on Libby held by Senator Baucus.\n  My colleagues may wonder whatever happened to Ralph Busch and his \nwife Donna.\n  After reading about Zonolite in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Mr. \nBusch went to get the asbestos removed from his home. He learned it \nwould cost $32,000 to do so.\n  When he tried to secure compensation from his homeowners insurance to \npay to clean up the contamination, his insurance company rejected the \nclaim.\n  He got nowhere with the company that had inspected the home before he\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\npurchased it. They hadn't known about Zonolite, either.\n  When he talked to his realtor about trying to sell his house, Mr. \nBusch's realtor emphasized that Mr. Busch and his wife would be \nresponsible under the law for disclosing the presence of Zonolite to \nany potential buyer.\n  According to Mr. Busch, even his realtor--and I quote--``. . . \nexpressed apprehension over entering the house saying he has young \nchildren and was fearful of asbestos exposure without a proper \nrespirator . . . this about a house we were living in every day.''\n  In the end, having exhausted all of his options, Ralph Busch and his \nwife Donna sacrificed their home to foreclosure, having lost thousands \nof dollars and their good credit rating. They didn't feel that it was \nsafe to live there anymore, or to bring other people into their home. \nFinally, they decided to move out of their ``dream house'' in Spokane. \nTo this day, that home remains vacant.\n  Apart from the tremendous economic loss, Mr. Busch and his wife are \nconcerned for their health. They are left wondering what long-term \nnegative health effects they may suffer as a result of their exposure \nto asbestos fibers from the insulation.\n  Mr. Busch has told me, ``I feel like the poster-child for the \nunsuspecting homeowner who unknowingly set off a time bomb in the \nprocess of remodeling his home.''\n  To this day, Mr. Busch is haunted by words he read in the Spokesman-\nReview almost three years ago. The March 12, 2000, article, entitled, \n``Zonolite's Effects Outlive Plant,'' said this about mesothelioma.\n\n       [The disease] inflicts one of the most torturous deaths \n     known to humankind. Some people require intravenous morphine \n     to numb mesothelioma's pain. Some need part of their spinal \n     cord severed. Some are driven to suicide.\n\n  If there is a role for Government in people's lives, then it should \ninclude protecting the public health. We have an opportunity to protect \nthe public's health so that Ralph Busch and thousands--perhaps \nmillions--of other Americans won't have to be needlessly exposed to the \ntime bomb sitting in their homes, schools, and businesses.\n  And meanwhile, if you are planning to do work in your attic, look at \nyour insulation carefully first to see if it is vermiculite. You can \nsee pictures of what this insulation looks like by going to EPA's web \nsite, which is www.epa.gov/asbestos/insulation.html.\n  If you think you have Zonolite, immediately contact EPA to get \nadditional advice about how to handle it. According to EPA's web site, \nif you think you have Zonolite insulation, leave it alone and not \ndisturb it. And then contact your Representative in Congress and ask \nhim or her to pass legislation to ban asbestos, something we all should \nhave done decades ago. We can make a difference, but we must act today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would just like to follow up on the \nstatements regarding asbestos-contaminated insulation made by my good \nfriend from Washington, Senator Murray. The issues she raises are \nextremely important, and I applaud her for her determined efforts on \nbehalf of her constituents, and her dedication to raising the profile \nof the continued hazards associated with asbestos.\n  I was very moved by Senator Murray's description of what happened to \nher constituent in Spokane, WA. I agree with her 100 percent that the \nGovernment should not be in the business of keeping important health-\nrelated information from the public, including information about the \nhealth risks posed by Zonolite insulation. Again, I commend the Senator \nfrom Washington for her leadership in championing this important public \nhealth and safety issue.\n  I just believe it is important for me to speak directly to the \nexperience of my constituents in Libby, MT, to put some of this into \nperspective.\n  The experience of the residents of Libby is truly, tragically, \nunique. This little town in northwestern Montana, surrounded by \nmillions of acres of Federal forest lands, has lost over 200 people to \nasbestos-related diseases and cancers. Hundreds more are sick, and \nthousands more may become sick. Libby doesn't have that many people. \nThe magnitude of this tragedy is staggering.\n  The vermiculite mining and milling operations of W.R. Grace belched \nthousands and thousands of pounds of asbestos-contaminated dust into \nthe air in and around Libby, coating the town and its inhabitants with \nthe deadly substance. Folks used raw vermiculite ore or expanded \nvermiculite to fill their gardens, their driveways, the high school \ntrack, the little league field, in their homes and attics. W.R. Grace \nmineworkers brought the dust home with them on their clothing and \ncontaminated their own families, without knowing the dust was poison. \nAsbestos was absolutely everywhere in Libby, for decades.\n  It is also becoming more and more clear that the fibers unique to \nLibby, including tremolite asbestos fibers, are particularly deadly--\nmore so than other forms of asbestos, such as chrysotile asbestos. \nSenator Murray is absolutely right to be concerned about insulation \nmanufactured from vermiculite ore mined and milled in Libby.\n  But let me also be clear, that the situation in Libby demanded a \nunique, determined, and coordinated response from the Environmental \nProtection Agency, other Federal agencies, the State, and the community \nitself just to address the enormous task of cleaning up the town \nbecause, as I just mentioned, the contaminated vermiculite was \neverywhere.\n  Because of the extraordinary levels of asbestos contamination in \nLibby, an important part of this clean-up effort included removing \nasbestos-contaminated materials from Libby homes. People in Libby used \nvermiculite insulation, raw vermiculite tailings, or other vermiculite \nmaterial that they brought home from W.R. Grace to fill their walls and \nattics.\n  Last year, I personally urged the EPA to leave no stone unturned as \nit sought to determine how to best begin an expeditious removal of \ncontaminated materials from homes in Libby, in an effort to continue to \nreduce the exposure of Libby residents to deadly tremolite asbestos. \nThe EPA responded admirably to my requests, and as Senator Murray \nmentioned, the agency is currently removing asbestos-contaminated \nvermiculite material from homes in Libby.\n  I only highlight these issues because I believe the timing and scope \nof the EPA's decision to go into Libby homes and remove the vermiculite \nin their walls and ceilings was absolutely appropriate and necessary \ngiven the sheer volume of asbestos to which the people in Libby have \nbeen exposed.\n  Should the EPA have issued a public health emergency declaration in \nLibby prior to taking that action? I don't know. What I do know is that \nthe decision was made and the correct on-the-ground result is happening \nin Libby. I have recently written to Administrator Whitman asking her \nto explain to me any health care benefits that may or may not be \navailable to the people of Libby in the event that a public health \nemergency is declared in Libby. At this point, that is the most \nimportant issue to the people in Libby.\n  In fact, the Montana delegation, the State of Montana, the community \nof Libby, and many concerned private citizens have been working hard to \nbring new economic development and much-needed health care resources to \nLibby. It is amazing to see how everyone has come together to create \nsomething positive from a terrible situation.\n  The people in Libby are proud folks. They have had more than their \nshare of hard knocks, and they just keep on going--getting up and \ntrying. They are survivors, and I am privileged to know them so well. \nIn January of 2000, I traveled to Libby to meet with 25 extremely ill \npeople for the first time.\n  I had been briefed a number of times on what I might expect to hear \nthat night. These kind men and women--some whom are no longer with us--\ngathered to share huckleberry pie and coffee in the home of Gayla \nBenefield. They opened their hearts and poured out unimaginable stories \nof suffering and tragedy on a scale I was absolutely stunned and \nunprepared to hear: entire families--fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, \nsons, and daughters all dead and all bound by their exposure to \ntremolite asbestos, mined by W.R. Grace in this isolated, community of \nseveral thousand--located as far away from Washington, DC, as one can \nbe, with a foot still in Montana.\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n  I will never forget meeting another gentleman who has become my dear \nfriend, Les Skramstad. Les watched me closely all evening. He was wary \nand approached me after his friends and neighbors had finished \nspeaking. He said to me, Senator, a lot of people have come to Libby \nand told us they would help, then they leave and we never hear from \nthem again.\n  ``Max,'' he said, ``please, as a man like me--as someone's father \ntoo, as someone's husband, as someone's son, help me. Help us. Help us \nmake this town safe for Libby's sons and daughters not even born yet. \nThey should not suffer my fate too. I was a miner and breathed that \ndust in. And what happened to me and all the other men who mined wasn't \nright--but what has happened to the others is a sin.\n  ``Every day, I carried that deadly dust home on my clothes. I took it \ninto our house, and I contaminated my own wife and each of my babies \nwith it, too. Just like me, they are sick, and we will each die the \nsame way. I just don't know how to live with the pain of what I have \ndone to them. If we can make something good come of this, maybe I'll \nstick around to see that, maybe that could make this worthwhile.\n  ``Find someone to use me, to study me, to learn something about this \ndust that is still in my lungs right now.'' I told him I would do all \nthat I could and that I wouldn't back down and that I wouldn't give up. \nLes accepted my offer and then pointed his finger and said to me, \n``I'll be watching Senator.''\n  Les is my inspiration. He is the face of hundreds and thousands of \nsick and exposed folks in this tiny Montana community. When I get \ntired, I think of Les, and I can't shake what he asked me to do. In all \nof my years as an elected official, this issue of doing what is right \nfor Libby is among the most personally compelling things I have ever \nbeen called on to do.\n  Doing what is right for the community and making something good come \nof it, is my mission in Libby, and I thank Les Skramstad every day for \nhanding me out my marching orders. My staff and I have worked \ntirelessly in Libby--not for thanks or recognition but because the \ntragedy is just that gripping.\n  The ``something good,'' Les challenged me to deliver keeps our eye on \nthe ball. I secured the first dollars from HHS 3 years ago to establish \nthe Clinic for Asbestos Related to Disease, to allow the Agency for \nToxic Substances and Disease Registry to begin the necessary screening \nof folks who had been exposed to Libby's asbestos. Federal dollars have \nflowed to Libby for cleanup, healthcare, and revitalizing the economy.\n  Last Congress, I was pleased to introduce the Libby Health Care Act, \nto secure longterm health funding for sick people in Libby, and I will \nintroduce similar legislation this year. We seek ongoing funding for \nasbestos patient care and continue to closely monitor and support \nasbestos cleanup efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  At the first field hearing I held in Libby of the Committee for \nEnvironment and Public Works, Dr. Blad Black, now the director of the \nLibby Clinic for Asbestos Related Disease, called for developing a \nresearch facility so that Libby's tragedy could be used to protect the \nhealth of men, women, and children.\n  The wheels are on the cleanup and health screening, and the time for \nmaking Brad's vision a reality is here. Working together with Montana \nCongressional delegation and our State's Governor to develop a leading \nedge, world class research facility with the mission of one day \ndeveloping cures for asbestos-related disease is exactly what Les \ncalled for that evening more than 3 years ago as well. He and the \nhundreds and thousands who suffer like Les and his family have my \ncommitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2044-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to extend my deepest \ncondolences to the families of the seven astronauts whose lives were \nlost on February 1. To Nevadans Audrey and Barry McCool, whose son \nWilliam piloted the final Columbia mission, I offer my sympathy and the \nsincere gratitude of an entire nation.\n  You raised an incredible human being. William McCool represented the \nbest and the brightest of this country. Though his life was taken \nprematurely, his legacy will be felt indefinitely.\n  William was incredibly smart, a talented athlete, and a true patriot. \nThe combination of these traits, along with devoted parents and \nreligious conviction, produced an American hero. We mourn that hero \ntoday, as Audrey and Barry McCool mourn their son. And while we stand \nwith them in grief, we should also express our admiration for the type \nof son they raised.\n  Many children dream of one day becoming an astronaut. A very elite \nfew ever make that dream a reality. For William McCool, his dream was \nhis destiny. As a child, he looked up to his Marine and Navy pilot \nfather, built model airplanes, and became an Eagle Scout. As a young \nman, he excelled by graduating second in his class at the Naval \nAcademy, maintaining a 4.0 grade point average, and earning advanced \ndegrees in computer science and aeronautical engineering.

On \nJanuary 16, he left his wife, sons, parents, and siblings grounded on \nEarth while he soared toward his lifetime dream among the stars. \nWilliam was kept from completing his journey home, but our gratitude \nfor his service must not be short lived.\n  We must ensure that these 7 astronauts, and the 10 other NASA \nastronauts who died in pursuit of knowledge, did not do so in vain.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nand dismay that the Secretary of Agriculture has failed to meet the \ndeadline mandated by Congress to establish a program of Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Farmers.\n  In the Trade Act of 2002, Congress directed the Secretary to get this \nprogram running by no later than this week, February 3, 2003.\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\n  It is running? No. Is it even close to running? No.\n  In fact, the Department of Agriculture tells me that their \nanticipated startup date is still another six months away. Meanwhile, \nthe $90 million that Congress set aside for this program in fiscal year \n2003 has no way of reaching its intended beneficiaries. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Senators Grassley and Conrad recently joined me in a letter making \nthis very point to secretary Veneman. We told her then--and I repeat it \nnow--that we hold her personally accountable for dropping the ball on \nTAA for Farmers. Frankly, I expected better.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 renewed the President's trade promotion \nauthority after a lapse of 8 years. In exchange for Congress', and the \nNation's, renewed commitment to trade liberalization, the President \nagreed to expand the trade adjustment assistance program to better meet \nthe needs of those who might be negatively impacted by trade.\n  A critical part of the President's commitment was the creation of a \ntrade adjustment assistance program for farmers, ranchers, and other \nagricultural producers.\n  We all know that opening foreign markets to American agricultural \nproducts can provide great advantages to U.S. farmers and ranchers. \nAlready, nearly one-fifth of Montana's agricultural production is \nexported. For Montana wheat, a full two-thirds is exported. And opening \nforeign markets is the best way to create new opportunities for our \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  This is one reason I have always been a strong supporter of trade \nliberalization and an equally strong advocate for a level playing field \nfor our farmers in world markets.\n  But trade liberalization can have a downside as well. It can leave \nour farmers and ranchers more vulnerable to sudden import surges, \ndevastating commodity price swings, and other countries' unfair trading \npractices. That is why they need this TAA program.\n  The Department of Labor's TAA program for workers has nominally \ncovered family farmers, ranchers, and fishermen all along. But hardly \nany have participated. They usually can't qualify because they don't \nbecome unemployed in the traditional sense.\n\n  After decades of trying without success to squeeze farmers into \neligibility rules designed for manufacturing workers, it was time to \ntry something new, something that would help farmers adjust to import \ncompetition before they lost their farms.\n  What the Trade Act does is create a TAA program tailored to the needs \nof farmers, ranchers, and fishermen. Basically, the program creates a \nnew trigger for eligibility. Instead of having to show a layoff, the \nfarmer, rancher, or fisherman has to show commodity price declines \nrelated to imports.\n  The trigger is different, but the program serves the same purpose as \nall our trade adjustment programs. It assists the farmer, rancher, or \nfisherman to adjust to import competition, to retrain, to obtain \ntechnical assistance, and to have access to income support to tide them \nover during the process. And the income support is capped to make sure \nthat the program is not being abused.\n  So last summer the President made a commitment--to the Congress and \nto the American agricultural community--to make this program a reality. \nI think it is fair to say that this was one of just a few key elements \nthat got the President those critical few votes he needed to pass TPA \nin the House and the pass it with a strong bipartisan vote in the \nSenate.\n  And now I say to the President, and to Secretary Veneman: the farmers \nand ranchers of Montana--and indeed throughout America--continue to \nwait for your administration to fulfill this commitment.\n  I hope this will happen sooner, rather than later.\n  Indeed, there is absolutely no excuse for a 6-month delay in getting \nthis program off the ground. There certainly wasn't a 6-month delay in \nlaunching negotiations for four new free-trade agreements under TPA. \nThere shouldn't be a delay here either.\n  My staff and I stand ready to assist in any way we can to kick start \nthis process. But Secretary Veneman needs to do the heavy lifting here. \nAnd that is my challenge to her today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2045-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2045-S2046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, each year I come to the floor during the \nmonth of February to celebrate Black History Month and to discuss many \nof the contributions made by Black Americans to my home State of \nOregon. Today, at the beginning of this year's celebration of Black \nHistory Month, I would like to begin another series of floor statements \nwith a short discussion of a significant event in Oregon's history, the \nVanport flood.\n  In 1929, Dr. DeNorval Unthank moved to Portland, OR from \nPennsylvania, becoming one of the city's first black physicians. When \nhe moved into a segregated, nearly all-White neighborhood, he and his \nfamily were greeted by rocks thrown through the windows of his home. \nWhen he replaced those windows, more rocks were thrown. Phone calls \nthreatening his family were also common. Ultimately, Dr. Unthank was \nforced to move to another part of town.\n  The city of Portland was highly segregated in its early history, and, \nalthough experiences like Dr. Unthank's were not uncommon, there were \nvery few Black Portlanders. World War II changed all that. Between 1941 \nand 1943, the African-American population in Portland increased \ntenfold, from roughly 2,000 to over 20,000. People came from all over \nthe country to work in Portland's shipyards, and to accommodate this \ninflux of labor, the city of Vanport--a combination of the names \nVancouver and Portland--was built. At the time, it was the largest \npublic housing project in the Nation, and it became home to thousands \nof Black Oregonians.\n  Due to the housing shortage in Portland after the war, the temporary \nhousing at Vanport was allowed to linger on long past its original \nintended purpose. Restrictive policies of the local real estate \nindustry, as well the hostility to be found in Portland's White \nneighborhoods, kept Black residents largely confined to Vanport. On \nMemorial Day 1948, the Columbia River overflowed its banks and washed \naway Vanport City, leaving behind a large lake and thousands of \nhomeless people. White residents of Vanport could be fairly easily \nabsorbed into the larger fabric of the White community with minimal \ndisruption; however, the response to the plight of Vanport's Black \nresidents presented a dramatic challenge to the previous patterns of \nracial thought and action in the city.\n  According to Dr. Darrell Millner, professor at Portland State \nUniversity, Portland generally rose to meet the challenge of the flood \nin a display of admirable humanitarianism. While some distinctions \nrelated to color were made in the aftermath of the disaster, other new \ninterracial dynamics emerged from the event that, in the long term, \nhelped change the course of Portland race relations.\n  H.J. Belton Hamilton, a former chair of the Urban League of \nPortland's board, recalls, ``A lot of people got to know each other \nthen.'' Many White families took displaced Vanport Blacks into their \nhomes after the flood, and the old artificial boundaries of the \nAfrican-American community were stretched to accommodate the relocation \nof residents. ``The Vanport flood had a major impact on Portland,'' \nsaid Bobbie Nunn, and early activist in the NAACP and Urban League. The \ncity of Portland had to accommodate its Black citizens, and the \nmovement for positive racial change was on the rise.\n  We can see the changes in Portland by looking back again on the life \nof Dr. Unthank. Not only did Dr. Unthank cofound the Urban League of \nPortland, but by 1958, the Oregon State Medical Society named him \nDoctor of the Year. Four years later, he was named Citizen of the Year \nby the Portland Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and \nJews. In 1969, DeNorval Unthank Park was dedicated in Portland. Forty \nyears before, rocks had been thrown through the windows of his Portland \nhome.\n  Portland and the entire State of Oregon went through as many changes \nin the middle part of the 20th century as did most other parts of our \ncountry. In the case of Portland, it was a major catastrophe, the \nVanport flood, that served as one of the major catalysts for positive \nchange. During Black History Month, I think it is important that we \nremember the people and events, like\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nDr. Unthank and the Vanport flood, that helped shape the history of \nOregon. I will come back to the floor each week this month to talk more \nabout why Black History Month is important to Oregonians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2046-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 26, \n2001, in Los Angeles, CA. A college student assaulted a police officer \noutside a fraternity. The student, Adam Guerrero, 23, threw objects and \nshouted racial slurs at a Black traffic officer who was standing \noutside the fraternity house. The student was charged with counts of \ncommitting a hate crime, battery on a peace officer, and assault on a \npeace officer.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2046-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2046-S2047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

No witness shall be reimbursed \n     for his or her appearance at a public or executive hearing \n     before the Committee or Subcommittee unless such \n     reimbursement is agreed to by the Chairman and Ranking Member \n     of the Committee.\n       [g] Limits of questions. Questioning of a witness by \n     members shall be limited to 5 minutes duration when 5 or more \n     members are present and 10 minutes duration when less than 5 \n     members are present, except that if a member is unable to \n     finish his or her questioning in this period, he or she may \n     be permitted further questions of the witness after all \n     members have been given an opportunity to question the \n     witness.\n       Additional opportunity to question a witness shall be \n     limited to a duration of 5 minutes until all members have \n     been given the opportunity of questioning the witness for a \n     second time. This 5-minute period per member will be \n     continued until all members have exhausted their questions of \n     the witness.\n\n\n                             Rule 5. Voting\n\n       [a] Vote to report a measure or matter. No measure or \n     matter shall be reported from the Committee unless a majority \n     of the Committee is actually present. The vote of the \n     Committee to report a measure or matter shall require the \n     concurrence of a majority of the members of the Committee who \n     are present.\n       Any absent member may affirmatively request that his or her \n     vote to report a matter be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be \n     sufficiently clear to identify the subject matter, and to \n     inform the Committee as to how the member wishes his vote to \n     be recorded thereon. By written notice to the Chairman any \n     time before the record vote on the measure or matter \n     concerned is taken, any member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies shall be kept in the files of \n     the Committee, along with the record of the rollcall vote of \n     the members present and voting, as an official record of the \n     vote on the measure or matter.\n       [b] Vote on matters other than to report a measure or \n     matter.--On Committee matters other than a vote to report a \n     measure or matter, no record vote shall be taken unless a \n     majority of the Committee are actually present. On any such \n     other matter, a member of the Committee may request that his \n     or her vote may be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be in \n     writing and shall be sufficiently clear to identify the \n     subject matter, and to inform the Committee as to how the \n     member wishes his or her vote to be recorded thereon. By \n     written notice to the Chairman any time before the vote on \n     such other matter is taken, the member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies relating to such other matters \n     shall be kept in the files of the Committee.\n\n\n                             Rule 6.

Mr. President, this Congress will address a number of very \nserious issues this year, but there is perhaps no issue we will discuss \nwith greater long-term implications than health care.\n  Last year, my colleagues and I came to the Senate floor to talk about \nand debate the pressing need for an affordable, universal, and \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit for America's seniors. \nUnfortunately, our efforts were not successful, and our Nation's \nseniors continue to live in fear that the loss of their health could \nlead to the loss of their homes.\n  For the past several years, I have also tried to address the growing \nproblem of the uninsured: Every day, 41 million Americans live, work, \nand go to school without health coverage. While the economic downturn \nthis past year has caused many families to tighten their belts, it has \nhad more serious results for almost 2 million men, women, and children \nwho have lost their health insurance along with their jobs.\n  Last year, the Senate Budget Committee chairman's mark included a \n$500 billion health fund, to be used to modernize Medicare with the \naddition of a\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nprescription drug benefit, and to reduce the number of uninsured in \nthis country. With annual prescription drug cost inflation, any \nlegislation to address the long-neglected need of Medicare seniors for \nan affordable prescription drug benefit this year will consume at least \nas much. Additionally, growing State fiscal woes coupled with the \nincrease in the number of uninsured Americans will require a \nsubstantial Federal response.\n  With the threat of war and ongoing economic downturn, it may be \ndifficult to consider new initiatives this year. But we must. The \ncurrent economic climate is all the more reason to focus attention and \nresources on covering the uninsured now, when the need is great. In \naddition, every year that passes without adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare, seniors continue to suffer, and the cost of adding \nsuch a benefit increases substantially. We must make every effort to \nprovide a very real benefit for our Nation's seniors and uninsured, and \nI urge my colleagues to support a sufficient sum to make these goals a \nreality this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2048-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX CUTS AND JOBS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to make a suggestion about how \nwe can work more effectively to get the engine of our economy running \non all of its cylinders again.\n  We have heard a great deal this week about the current state of our \neconomy and whether the President's growth plan, which he released this \npast Monday, will be effective in putting Americans who have lost their \njobs back to work. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare questioning whether there is a link between high taxes and jobs.\n  The current debate has featured quotations and commentary from some \nof the most prominent economists and tax experts in America. Both sides \nrely on knowledgeable and learned authorities to make their case that \nthe Bush growth plan will or will not be effective in creating jobs. \nAnd, as the old saying goes, you can find an expert to prove any point \nyou wish.\n  But too often, I think we tend to overlook the wisdom of people on \nthe front lines of the U.S. economy. Sometimes these people can provide \nanswers with clarity and common sense.\n  A few months ago, a small business owner in Moab, UT, Jeffrey Davis, \nsent me a very heartfelt letter, and his sentiment has stuck in my \nmind. I want to share it with my colleagues here today.\n  Moab is a relatively small town in southeastern Utah whose economy is \ngreatly dependent on tourism. Within just a few miles of this town lies \nsome of the most spectacular scenery on Earth. However, the people who \nmake Moab their home face the same economic realities with which \neveryone else in America deals.\n  Mr. Davis owns and operates a restaurant in Moab, and over the years \nhe has tried his hand at a few other retail businesses as well. From \nhis letter, it is obvious he has faced both good times and bad times \nwith his businesses. Unfortunately, the recent trends have not been \npositive. He currently employs between 13 and 20 people, depending upon \nthe season, and he worries that these people, who depend on him, might \nfind themselves out of a job if conditions do not soon improve. Mr. \nDavis understands all too well the pressures that face all small \nbusiness owners.\n  In his letter to me, Mr. Davis makes a point that is extremely \nimportant to the current debate on taxes and jobs--that if high taxes \nforce the small business person to go out of business, the U.S. \nGovernment will not get any tax money.\n  As simple and obvious as that concept sounds, I fear it might be one \nwho is sometimes lost on those of us in Congress. Taxes and other \ngovernment requirements have a real cost on small businesses in this \ncountry, many of which are right at the edge of viability. In the case \nof businesses in many towns in Utah and around the country, things have \nbeen really tough for the past couple of years. The one-two punch of a \nslowing economy and the greatly reduced travel resulting from the \nevents of September 11 have moved many thousands of small businesses in \nUtah and around the Nation right to the edge of going out of business. \nThis is especially true of businesses in towns that depend heavily on \ntourism, such as Moab.\n  Tax cuts, such as the President is proposing, can make the difference \nbetween a small business surviving and it closing its doors. We must \nkeep in mind that a high percentage of small businesses pay taxes at \nthe individual rates.\n  As we debate the best way to deal with our slow recovery over the \nnext weeks, we will surely hear a great deal more from economists and \nexperts on the macro effect of various plans and how gross domestic \nproduct will be affected by enacting one idea or another.\n  These opinions and analyses are a very much needed and welcome part \nof the political process. But I urge my colleagues to not forget to \nalso consider the wisdom of those back home in their States, who, like \nJeffrey Davis of Moab, UT, face the real world effects of our \ndecisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2048-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       30th ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURTLE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nTurtle Mountain Community College located on the Turtle Mountain Indian \nReservation in my State of North Dakota on its 30th anniversary.\n  Turtle Mountain Community College was one of the six original tribal \ncolleges formed to meet the higher education needs of American Indians. \nWithout the college, the dream of a college education would have been \nout of reach for so many on the reservation.\n  It is quite exciting to see how this college has evolved over the \npast 30 years. The college started from very humble beginnings. On the \nthird floor of an abandoned Catholic convent, with fewer than 60 \nstudents and only 3 full-time faculty members, the college offered its \nfirst course to those on the reservation. Today, the college has grown \nto serve over 650 students, with more than 150 courses and 65 full- and \npart-time faculty members. Additionally, the college serves more than \n250 adults who are working to earn their general equivalency degree.\n  Turtle Mountain Community College was the first tribal college to be \ngranted 10-year accreditation by the North Central Association of \nColleges and Schools and was the one of the first to fully integrate \ntraditional culture throughout the curriculum.\n  By far one of the largest accomplishments for the college was the \nopening of its new campus building in 1999. The college worked for \nyears to raise the needed funds to construct this facility. Located on \na 234-acre site, the 105,000-square-foot facility includes state-of-the \nart technology, general classroom space, science and engineering labs, \na library, learning resource center, and a gymnasium.\n  Over 2,000 tribal members have graduated from the college since its \ncreation, a truly commendable accomplishment. Nearly half of the \ngraduates have gone on to other institutions to earn a 4-year degree. \nLast spring, the college graduated the first group of students to earn \na bachelor of science degree in elementary education.\n  For the past 30 years, the college has also played a critical role in \nreservation life, supporting tribal business development, worker \ntraining to meet the needs of local industries, and year-round \nactivities for elementary, middle, and high school students.\n  I congratulate the college, its faculty, and students on this \nmomentous occasion and wish them much success in the next 30 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2048-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2048-S2049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ARTHUR ASHE\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, Arthur Ashe said: ``True heroism \nis remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all \nothers at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever \ncost.'' This is more than an eloquent definition of heroism; it was how \nArthur Ashe lived his life.\n  Ashe emerged from segregated Richmond, VA, to become one of the \nfinest individuals to play the game of tennis. He shattered barrier \nafter barrier and showed the world that anyone who worked hard enough \nand trained could rise to the top. Ashe's triumphs began in Maryland in \n1957 when he was the\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nfirst African American to ever participate in the Maryland boy's tennis \nchampionships. After graduating first in his high school class, he \nattended UCLA. At UCLA, he helped his team win the NCAA Championship in \n1965 by winning the individual championship. Ashe became the first \nAfrican American ever to be appointed to the Davis Cup Team and played \nfor the team from 1963 to 1970, and also in 1975, 1976, and 1978, and \nserved as captain in 1980.\n  The world also admired Ashe for his great individual victories. He \nwon the U.S. Open in 1968, the Australian Open in 1970, the French Open \nin 1971, and no one can forget his victory over Jimmy Connors in the \nWimbledon Championship of 1975. Each victory, from the Maryland boy's \nchampionship to the triumph at Wimbledon, earned Arthur Ashe a spot in \nthe International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985.\n  But tennis is just one part of Ashe's legacy. He was in the military. \nHe was an author, a husband, and a father. He understood that with \ngreat success came even greater responsibility. And in the early 1970s \nhe denounced apartheid and worked tirelessly for South Africa's \nexpulsion from the International Lawn Tennis Association. Ashe was the \nfirst African-American professional to play in South Africa's national \ntennis championships. He seized that moment in the spotlight to \nhighlight the struggle of the South African people against the terrible \noppression of apartheid. And when the South African Government refused \nreforms, Ashe refused to play and was even arrested in 1985 outside the \nSouth African Embassy while protesting apartheid.\n  Ashe never wavered in his commitment to use his position to help \nfurther important causes. Whether it was the plight of Haitian refugees \nor creating the USTA National Junior Tennis League to help young inner-\ncity athletes, each effort was a measure of a man determined to make \nthis world a better place.\n  Then the news came in 1992 that Ashe was HIV positive. As the news \ntraveled to all who were inspired by Ashe, sadness spanned the globe. \nBut once again, Ashe used his position in the world to further one last \ncause. He went before the General Assembly of the United Nations and \ncalled for an increase in AIDS funding and research, and he started the \nArthur Ashe foundation to promote these and other causes. Arthur Ashe \npassed away on February 6, 1993, but his legacy continues thanks to his \ndedicated wife Jeanne who serves as the chairperson of the Arthur Ashe \nEndowment for the Defeat of AIDS, his daughter Camera, and all of those \nwho admired this truly heroic individual.\n  A decade ago, the world lost one of its great heroes. And on this \nday, in recognition of all of his accomplishment for athletes, and the \nexemplary role he fulfilled as activist, author, husband, father, and \nindividual, we salute Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2049-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF MR. DAVID B. HARRITY\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself \nand my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg, to extend our congratulations to Mr. David B. \nHarrity on the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  Dave has had an exemplary career in Federal service, devoting more \nthan 34 years to our Nation. Because of his dedication to duty, Dave \nrose through the ranks at HUD and retires today as director of the New \nHampshire field office. Dave's accomplishments are not limited to his \ndecades of Federal service, but extend to the difference he has made in \nthe lives of countless citizens. His years of leadership and generosity \nhave helped make Manchester, NH, the strong and vibrant community it is \ntoday.\n  Dave began his service with HUD at its inception in 1965, starting in \nthe Philadelphia field office where he provided assistance to the \npeople of Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. From there, Dave moved \nto HUD's Boston regional office where, in 1971, he became the first \nlow-rent housing specialist in New England and worked in close concert \nwith all of the local housing authorities in each of the six New \nEngland States.\n  When HUD created the Executive Identification and Development Program \nin 1974, Dave was one of only 21 individuals selected from a national \ncompetition of more than 700 to participate in the leadership training. \nAfter completing and receiving a certificate from the Urban Executive \nProgram of the Sloan Management School at the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology, Dave was appointed special assistant to the Regional \nAdministrator in 1975.\n  In 1978, Dave was tapped to serve as the director of the Housing \nDevelopment and Management Divisions of the Hartford, CT, HUD Field \nOffice. Dave's team of staff professionals worked closely with HUD \ncustomers, providing mortgage insurance, housing subsidies, and \nmanagement oversight of federally assisted housing. In 1988, Dave moved \non to an opportunity with the State of Connecticut's Department of \nHousing. In this position, he administered HUD's Section 8 Existing \nCertificate and the Small Cities Community Development Block Grant \nPrograms.\n  In October of 1992, Dave was appointed Manager of HUD's Manchester \noffice by then-Secretary Jack Kemp. Dave's managerial style has been \nand continues to be, one of working with, and in support of, local \nofficials to ensure that each city and town in New Hampshire receives \nthe maximum benefit from HUD's programs. While protecting the Federal \nGovernment's interests, Dave has instilled in his staff a willingness \nto find ways to allow local officials to administer HUD's programs in a \nmanner which best meets the specific needs of New Hampshire's \nresidents. Because of Dave's leadership skills, a recent Quality \nManagement Review of the Manchester office resulted in one of the \nhighest overall ratings of any HUD office in the Nation.\n  Besides the help he provides the men and women of New Hampshire \nthrough his service at HUD, Dave's philosophy of giving is reflected in \na number of other community activities. He is president of the board of \ndirectors of ``The CareGivers, Inc.'' a nonprofit organization serving \nthe Manchester and Nashua areas of the Granite State and whose mission \nis ``helping the frail, elderly and disabled to maintain their \nindependence and dignity.'' He is also the past president of the New \nHampshire Federal Executive Association and is a leader within the \nGreater Manchester Chamber of Commerce. As another part of his \ncommunity participation, Dave serves as a ``Granite State Ambassador,'' \ngreeting visitors to New Hampshire at information kiosks in both the \nairport and downtown Manchester. He is also a member of the board of \ndirectors of the Manchester Rotary Club.\n  Dave's career has truly been an inspiration to those who look to form \na better future through active participation in the community. While \nSenator Gregg and I trust Dave will enjoy his retirement with his wife \nPatricia, and being able to spend more time with his daughters Suzanne \nand Tracey and his grandsons Ryan and Thomas, we also know he will not \ncease giving of himself in service to his fellow man.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Manchester and of the Granite State, \nSenator Gregg and I congratulate David Harrity and thank him for all he \nhas done for his community, the State of New Hampshire, and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2049-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2049-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2049-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2049-S2050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ENROLLED JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nSpeaker has signed the following enrolled joint resolution:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nincrease competition and transparency among packers that purchase \nlivestock from producers; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the last Congress Senator \nFeingold and I sponsored the Transparency for Independent Livestock \nProducers Act, or what we have generally referred to as the \n``Transparency Act''. Today we are once again working together in a \nbipartisan fashion to re-introduce this important legislation.\n  As everyone knows, I introduced the packer ban this Congress because \nI want more competition in the marketplace. While I don't think packers \nshould be in the same business as independent livestock producers, it's \nnot the fact that the packers own the livestock that bothers me as much \nas the fact that the packers' livestock competes for shackle space and \nadversely impacts the price independent producers receive.\n  My sponsorship of the packer ban is based on the belief that \nindependent producers should have the opportunity to receive a fair \nprice for their livestock. The last few years have led to widespread \nconsolidation and concentration in the packing industry. Add on the \ntrend toward vertical integration among packers and there is no \nquestion why independent producers are losing the opportunity to market \ntheir own livestock during profitable cycles in the live meat markets.\n  The past CEO of IBP in 1994 explained that the reason packers own \nlivestock is that when the price is high the packers use their own \nlivestock for the lines and when the price is low the packers buy \nlivestock. This means that independent producers are most likely being \nlimited from participating in the most profitable ranges of the live \nmarket. This is not good for the survival of the independent producer.\n  This bipartisan legislation would guarantee that independent \nproducers have a share in the market place while assisting the \nMandatory Price Reporting system. The proposal would require that 25 \npercent of a packer's daily kill comes from the spot market. By \nrequiring a 25 percent spot market purchase daily, the mandatory price \nreporting system, which has been criticized due to reporting and \naccuracy problems, would have consistent, reliable numbers being \npurchased from the spot market, improving the accuracy and transparency \nof daily prices. In addition, independent livestock producers would be \nguaranteed a competitive position due to the packers need to fill the \ndaily 25 percent spot/cash market requirement.\n  The packs required to comply would be the same packs required to \nreport under the Mandatory Price Reporting system. Those are packs that \nkill either 125,000 head of cattle, 100,000 head of hogs, or 75,000 \nlambs annually, over a 5 year average.\n  Packers are arguing that this will hurt their ability to offer \ncontracts to producers, but the fact of the matter is that the majority \nof livestock contracts pay out on a calculation incorporating Mandatory \nPrice Reporting data. If the Mandatory Price Reporting data is not \naccurate, or open to possible manipulation because of low numbers on \nthe spot market, contracts are not beneficial tools for producers to \nmanage their risk. This legislative proposal will hopefully give \nconfidence to independent livestock producers by improving the accuracy \nand viability of the Mandatory Price reporting system and secure fair \nprices for contracts based on that data.\n  It's just common sense, when there aren't a lot of cattle and pigs \nbeing purchased on the cash market, it's easier for the Mandatory Price \nreporting data to be inaccurate or manipulated. The majority of \nlivestock production contracts are based on that data, so if that \ninformation is wrong the contract producers suffer.\n  This legislation will guarantee independent livestock producers \nmarket access and a fair price. It will accomplish these goals by \nmaking it more difficult for the Mandatory Price Reporting System to be \nmanipulated because of low numbers being reported by the packs. The \nTransparency Act is crucial legislation to guarantee livestock \nproducers receive a fair shake at the farm gate and I am looking \nforward to working on this legislation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to apply \nto prosecutions of child abuse cases in courts-martial an extended \nstatute of limitations applicable to prosecutions of child abuse cases \nin United States District Courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Forces.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to close a gaping loophole in the Victims of Child Abuse \nAct that currently ties the hands of military prosecutors.\n  Congress passed the Victims of Child Abuse Act to extend the statute \nof limitations for prosecuting offenses involving the sexual or \nphysical abuse of minor children. But the military's highest court \nrecently said the VCCA's extended statute of limitations doesn't apply \nto courts martial.\n  Because Congress did not expressly address the relationship of this \nprovision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice serious crimes \nagainst children are now out of military prosecutors' reach.\n  This loophole became tragically apparent to me after I was contacted \nby the father of a young girl who was sexually abused by a member of \nthe military. The victim's father called my office to express his \nfrustration that the Air Force couldn't properly prosecute the man for \nmolesting his daughter over a 7-year period. The military couldn't \nconvict the offender on the worst counts levied against him because of \nthe insufficient 5-year statute of limitations provided by the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice.\n  Air Force prosecutors originally used the extended statute of \nlimitations provided by the Victims of Child Abuse Act to convict the \ndefendant of several crimes, but the most serious convictions were \noverturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces which \ndetermined that the shorter statute of limitations provided by the UCMJ \napplied to the case instead of the extended prosecution period provided \nby the VCAA.\n  The Court's narrow interpretation of the VCAA means this sex offender \nwill do a very short sentence at best, even though he abused this young \ngirl for years.\n  The bill I introduce today is designed to ensure that kids aren't \ndenied justice just because the defendant happens to be a member of the \nmilitary. Military prosecutors need the power to put these criminals \naway for a long time.\n  The statute of limitations provided by the VCAA allows prosecutions \nuntil the victim's 25th birthday. My bill clarifies that the VCAA's \nstatute of limitations applies to courts martial whenever a case arises \ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child.\n  Child victims of sexual crimes sometimes struggle to come to terms \nwith the crimes committed against them and often are not willing, or \nable, to bring the crime to the attention of authorities until they are \nmuch older. Applying the longer statute of limitations provided by the \nVCAA to courts martial will allow military prosecutors to throw the \nbook at sexual predators.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this simple, but very \nimportant, change to the law. Our kids deserve this protection and we \nshould give it to them without delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENDED LIMITATION PERIOD FOR PROSECUTION OF \n                   CHILD ABUSE CASES IN COURTS-MARTIAL.\n\n       Section 843(b) of title 10, United States Code (article 43 \n     of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Section 3283 of title 18, relating to an extension of \n     a period of limitation for prosecution of an offense \n     involving sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age \n     of 18 years, shall apply to liability of a person for trial \n     for such an offense by a court-martial and liability of a \n     person for punishment for such an offense under section 815 \n     of this title (article 15).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 327. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto allow up to 2 months of vocational educational training to be \ncounted as a work activity under the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the Senator \nJeffords in reintroducing legislation that seeks to add an important \nmeasure of flexibility to a provision of the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families program, TANF, under the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The legislation we are \nintroducing increases from 12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of \nvocational education training that a State can count towards meeting \nits work participation rate.\n  Under the pre-1996 Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, \nwelfare recipients could participate in post-secondary vocational \ntraining or community college programs for up to 24 months while \nreceiving assistance. While I support TANF's emphasis on moving welfare \nrecipients into jobs, I am troubled by the restriction on post-\nsecondary education training, limiting it to 12 months. Only one year \nof vocational education counts as an approved work activity. The second \nyear of post-secondary education study does not.\n  The limitation on post-secondary education and training raises a \nnumber of concerns, not the least of which is whether individuals may \nbe forced into low-paying, short-term employment that will lead them \nback onto public assistance because they are unable to support \nthemselves or their families. According to recent studies, this is \nexactly what has happened in far too many cases.\n  A March 13, 2001, report of the Congressional Research Service, \nindicates that the average hourly wage for these former welfare \nrecipients ranged from $5.50 to $8.80 per hour. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, the mean earnings of adults with an associate degree are \n20 percent higher than adults who have not achieved such a degree.\n  A majority of the Senate has previously voted to make 24 months of \npost-secondary education a permissible work activity under TANF. The \nLevin-Jeffords amendment to the 1997 Reconciliation bill, permitting up \nto 24 months of post-secondary education, received 55 votes--falling \nfive votes short of the required procedural vote of 60. I must note the \nefforts of our dear friend and colleague Senator Paul\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nWellstone who was committed to this issue and who subsequently, in \n1998, offered similar legislation as an amendment to the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization, which I cosponsored. The Senate adopted \nhis amendment, however, the amendment was dropped during conference \nnegotiations.\n  In June of last year, Senator Jeffords and I were very pleased that \nour proposal was included in the Senate Finance Committee reported bill \nreauthorizing TANF. It is our hope that the Senate will again act \nfavorably and expeditiously on this legislation and that the House will \nsupport this much-needed state flexibility. We must do what is \nnecessary to achieve TANF's intended goal of getting families \npermanently off of welfare and onto self-sufficiency.\n  Finally, I would like to share with my colleagues some examples of \nthe difference that completion of two years of vocational or community \ncollege can make. The following are jobs that an individual could \nprepare for in a structured two-year training or community college \nprogram, including the average starting salary, as provided by the \nBureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n                   AVERAGE STARTING SALARY NATIONWIDE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRespiratory Therapist.........................................   $29,700\nOccupational Therapy Assistant................................    25,220\nElectrician...................................................    24,230\nPhysical Therapy Assistant....................................    23,590\nComputer Support Specialist...................................    22,710\nInterior Designer.............................................    21,490\nLegal Secretary...............................................    22,360\nFood Service Manager..........................................    20,370\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  We must ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to become \nproductive and successful members of the workforce. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues to act with haste on this legislation. This modification \nwill give the states the flexibility they need to improve the economic \nstatus of families across America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation Senator \nJeffords and I are introducing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF MONTHS OF VOCATIONAL \n                   EDUCATIONAL TRAINING COUNTED AS A WORK ACTIVITY \n                   UNDER THE TANF PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 407(d)(8) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     607(d)(8)) is amended by striking ``12'' and inserting \n     ``24''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 328. A bill to designate Catoctin Mountain Park in the State of \nMaryland as the Catoctin Mountain National Recreation Area,'' and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleague Senator Mikulski, to re-designate Catoctin \nMountain Park as the Catoctin Mountain National Recreation Area. I \nfirst introduced this measure in October 2002, but unfortunately it was \nnot acted upon during the closing days of the 107th Congress. It is my \nhope that the legislation will receive full and prompt consideration \nthis year.\n  I spoke last year about the need for this legislation and would like \nto underscore the principal arguments today. Catoctin Mountain Park is \na hidden gem in our National Park System. Home to Camp David, the \nPresidential retreat, it has been aptly described as ``America's most \nfamous unknown park.'' Comprising nearly 6000 acres of the eastern \nreach of the Appalachian Mountains in Maryland, the park is rich in \nhistory as well as outdoor recreation opportunities. Visitors can enjoy \ncamping, picnicking, cross-country skiing, fishing, as well as the \nsolitude and beauty of the woodland mountain and streams in the park.\n  Catoctin Mountain Park had its origins during the Great Depression as \none of 46 Recreational Demonstration Areas, RDA, established under the \nauthority of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Federal \nGovernment purchased more than 10,000 acres of mountain land that had \nbeen heavily logged and was no longer productive to demonstrate how \nsub-marginal land could be turned into a productive recreational area \nand help put people back to work. From 1936 through 1941, hundreds of \nworkers under the Works Progress Administration and later the Civilian \nConservation Corps were employed in reforestation activities and in the \nconstruction of a number of camps, roads and other facilities, \nincluding the camp now known as Camp David, and one of the earliest--if \nnot the oldest--camp for disabled individuals. In November 1936, \nadministrative authority for the Catoctin RDA was transferred to the \nNational Park Service by Executive Order.\n  In 1942, concern about President Roosevelt's health and safety led to \nthe selection of Catoctin Mountain, and specifically Camp Hi-Catoctin \nas the location for the President's new retreat. Subsequently \napproximately 5,000 acres of the area was transferred to the State of \nMaryland, becoming Cunningham Falls State Park in 1954. The remaining \n5,770 acres of the Catoctin Recreation Demonstration Area was renamed \nCatoctin Mountain Park by the Director of the National Park Service in \n1954. Unfortunately, the Director failed to include the term \n``National'' in the title and the park today remains one of 17 units in \nthe entire National Park System and one of 9 units in the National \nCapital Region that does not have this designation. Those units include \nfour parkways, four wild and scenic rivers, the White House and Wolf \nTrap Farm Park for the Performing Arts.\n  The proximity of Catoctin Mountain Park, Camp David, and Cunningham \nFalls State Park, and the differences between national and state park \nmanagement, has caused longstanding confusion for visitors to the area. \nCatoctin Mountain Park is continually misidentified by the public as \ncontaining lake and beach areas associated with Cunningham Falls State \nPark, being operated by the State of Maryland, or being closed to the \npublic because of the presence of Camp David. National Park employees \nspend countless hours explaining, assisting and redirecting visitors to \ntheir desired destinations.\n  My legislation would help to address this situation and clearly \nidentify this park as a unit of the National Park System by renaming it \nthe Catoctin Mountain National Recreation Area. The mission and \ncharacteristics of this park--which include the preservation of \nsignificant historic resources and important natural areas in locations \nthat provide outdoor recreation for large numbers of people--make this \ndesignation appropriate. This measure would not change access \nrequirements or current recreational uses occurring within the park. \nBut it would assist the visiting public in distinguishing between the \nmany units of the State and Federal systems. It will also, in my \njudgment, help promote tourism by enhancing public awareness of the \nNational Park unit.\n  The legislation is supported by the Board of County Commissioners and \nTourism Council of Frederick County. I urge approval of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Bunning, Mr. Domenici, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 330. A bill to further the protection and recognition of veterans' \nmemorials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would \nrecognize and protect the sanctity of veterans' memorials standing \ntributes to the brave American men and women who have fought for our \nenduring freedom. I am pleased to be joined by eleven of my colleagues, \nwho are original cosponsors of this bill, the ``Veterans' Memorial \nPreservation and Recognition Act of 2003.''\n  This bill is based on legislation which passed the Senate in the \n107th Congress, S.1644. When I introduced S.1644, it was four days \nbefore Veterans' Day--an appropriate marker to honor those who so \nadmirably served our country. Under my bill, someone who willfully \ndestroys any type of monument commemorating those in the Armed Services \non Federal property would be fined or put in jail. The violator would \nbe subject to a civil penalty in addition to a fine, equal to the cost \nof repairing the damage.\n  The second part of this bill would permit states to place \nsupplemental\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nguide signs for veterans' cemeteries on Federal-aid highways. By \nallowing signs to be posted on well-traveled roads, these sites will \ngain the recognition they deserve. It is my goal to make cemeteries \neasily accessible to those who want to pay their respect there. Many \nAmericans do stop and recognize the sacrifice so many have made for our \nfreedom, and I am convinced many more would if they were aware of where \nour memorials are located.\n  Our veterans, living and lost, are reminders of our national unity. \nThose who have served in our Armed Services remind us of freedom and \njustice in the midst of conflict and during times of peace. We are \nlosing thousands of them forever, each year, as the veteran population \nages. We have to honor their sacrifices by protecting those sites that \nrecognize them. There are hundreds of veterans' memorials, on Federal \nproperty, where we go to heal and to remember. As a veteran myself, I \nam committed to seeing that not a single one is stripped of its \ndignity.\n  I learned that approximately one month before introducing my bill, \nvandals in Mead, CO, had stolen four headstones and shattered another \nat a local cemetery. One of those headstones belonged to a Civil War \nveteran. I commend the Weld County Sheriff's office for their work on \nthe ongoing investigation into the crime, as well as local residents \nwho have volunteered their time to rebuild the site.\n  This was a local cemetery, which received overwhelming local support. \nUnfortunately, when heartbreaking incidents like this happen on Federal \nland, there currently is no comprehensive law to protect the site nor \nto punish the perpetrators.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work together for swift consideration of \nthis important legislation. It doesn't cost the taxpayers a thing, but \nit could save the American people from the injustices of thoughtless \nvandalism. I have the support of several veterans' organizations who \nhave offered words of encouragement for this bill. These Americans \nknow, first hand, the concept of service. Let's honor what they and \nthousands of others have done so bravely to preserve our freedom.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to \n     commend your introduction of legislation to ban desecration \n     of veterans' memorials, provide for timely repair of \n     memorials, and ensure appropriate placement of guide signs to \n     veterans' cemeteries along federal highways.\n       Our nation's veterans' memorials are national shrines to \n     the bravery and dedication of the men and women who have \n     served in our Armed Forces. It is hard to believe that \n     certain individuals within our communities would even \n     consider the desecration of a memorial to those who defended \n     freedom. Yet, it unfortunately occurs.\n       AMVETS strongly supports the goals of your legislative \n     proposal and endorses your effort to do more to protect our \n     veterans' memorials and honor the memory of their military \n     service. We also give strong backing to the provision in your \n     proposal that identifies the need and importance of providing \n     information to travelers on our Nation's highways about the \n     location of these beautiful memorials.\n       We appreciate your steadfast support on issues important to \n     the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. And, \n     again, thank you for the leadership on veterans' issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Richard ``Rick'' Jones,\n     National Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans \n     of America (PVA) I am writing to offer our support of the \n     ``Veterans' Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of \n     2003.''\n       Memorials to the men and women who have served this Nation, \n     in times of war and in times of peace, are tokens of our \n     gratitude for this service, and their sacrifice. They are \n     tangible reminders of our past, and an inspiration for our \n     future. For this reason they are well worth protecting and \n     preserving. This legislation addresses both of these goals.\n       Again, thank you for introducing the ``Veterans' Memorial \n     Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003.''\n       Sincerely,\n                                                Richard B.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto provide equitable access for foster care and adoption services for \nIndian children in tribal areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \ncorrect an inequity in the laws affecting many Native American \nchildren. I am joined by Senators McCain, Inouye, Baucus, Johnson, \nDomenici, Bingaman, Cochran and Stabenow, in sponsoring this important \npiece of legislation. This effort is also supported by the National \nIndian Child Welfare Association, the American Public Human Services \nAssociation, and the National Congress of American Indians.\n  Every year, for a variety of often tragic reasons, thousands of \nchildren across the country are placed in foster care. To assist with \nthe cost of food, shelter, clothing, daily supervision and school \nsupplies, foster parents of children who have come to their homes \nthrough state court placement receive financial assistance through \nTitle IV-E of the Social Security Act. Additionally, States receive \nfunding for administrative training and data collection to support this \nprogram. Unfortunately, because of a legislative oversight, many Native \nAmerican children who are placed in foster care by tribal courts do not \nreceive foster care and adoptive services and assistance to which all \nother income-eligible children are entitled.\n  Not only are otherwise eligible Native children denied foster care \nmaintenance payments, but this inequity also extends to children who \nare adopted through tribal placements. Currently, the IV-E program \noffers limited assistance for expenses associated with adoption and the \ntraining of professional staff and parents involved in the adoption. \nThese circumstances, sadly, have made it even harder for Indian \nchildren to attain the permanency they need and deserve.\n  In many instances, these children face insurmountable odds. Many come \nfrom abusive homes. Foster parents who open their doors to care for \nthese special children deserve our help. These generous people should \nnot have to worry about whether they have the resources to provide \nnourishing food or a warm coat, or even adequate shelter for these \nchildren. This legislation will go a long way to ease their concerns.\n  Currntly, some tribes and states have entered into IV-E agreements, \nbut these arrangements are the exception. They also, by and large, do \nnot include funds to train tribal social workers and foster and \nadoptive parents. This bill would make it clear that tribes would be \ntreated like a state when they choose to run their own programs under \nthe IV-E program.\n  The bill we are introducing today would: extend the Title IV-E \nentitlement programs to children placed by tribal agencies in foster \nand adoptive homes; authorize tribal governments to receive direct \nfunding from the Department of Health and Human Services for \nadministration of IV-E programs (tribes must have HHS-approved \nprograms); allow the Secretary flexibility to modify the requirements \nof the IV-E law for tribes if those requirements are not in the best \ninterest of Native children; and allow continuation of tribal-State IV-\nE agreements.\n  In a 1994 report, HHS found that the best way to serve this \nunderfunded group is to provide direct assistance to tribal governments \nqualified tribal families. This bill would not result in reduced \nfunding for the States, as they would continue to be reimbursed for \ntheir expenses under the law.\n  I strongly believe Congress should address this oversight and provide \nequitable benefits to native American children who are under the \njurisdiction of their tribal governments, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself,  Mr. Daschle, Mr. Levin, Mr. Baucus, \n        and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 332. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a Canadian pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Today I am introducing legislation to correct a long-\nstanding inequity that has caused hardship for American farmers. That \ninequity is the pricing of agricultural pesticides for American \nproducers in relationship to Canadian pesticide pricing. My bill would \nsolve this inequity by allowing individual States to label Canadian \npesticides that have the same formula as those used in the U.S. for use \nby American farmers.\n  Farmers combine land, water, commercial inputs, labor, and their \nmanagement skills into practices and systems to produce food and fiber. \nTo sustain production over time, farmers must make a profit and \npreserve their resource and financial assets. Society wants food and \nfiber products that are low-cost, safe to consume, and aesthetically \npleasing, and wants production systems that preserve or enhance the \nenvironment. These often competing goals and pressures are reflected \nnot only in the inputs made available for production, but also in how \nthe inputs are selected, combined, and managed at the farm level.\n  Time and time again I have come to Senate floor to point out the \nstark realities of free trade. I have talked at length about the flood \nof imported grain that streams across our border. Come to my State of \nNorth Dakota. Every day truckload after truckload of Canadian \ncommodities, wheat, barley, durum, come across our border to compete \nwith commodities grown here at home. These Canadian imports are grown \nwith the aid of pesticides, pesticides of the same makeup and \ncomposition as those purchased in the United States. Yet Canadian \nproducers have the luxury of buying those same chemicals at prices \nsubstantially lower than those American farmers have to pay.\n  Why? The answer is simple; pesticide manufacturers charge American \nfarmers more because they can. In agricultural policy, benefits from \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement flow the same direction as the \nRed River of my State, north. This is especially true of pesticide \npricing.\n  A recent survey completed by North Dakota State University surveyed \n15 different pesticides commonly used in both Canada and North Dakota. \nAll would qualify for registration in North Dakota under this bill. Of \nthe 15, not one, not one, had a price differential in favor of the \nAmerican farmer. When you totaled it all out, those 15 chemicals cost, \nin North Dakota alone, $23.7 million more, in 1 year, for the American \nproducer. That's just not right.\n  If we're going to have free trade, let's make it fair trade. If we \nare going to open our borders to Canadian grain grown with Canadian \npesticides, we ought to open our borders to similar pesticides for U.S. \nproducers at the same cost. It's time to level the playing field for \nAmerican farmers, we must give them the same advantages that Canadian \nproducers have enjoyed for years. If we're going to have a free trade \nagreement with Canada, let's all sing from the same page, using the \nsame music. Because putting American farmers at a disadvantage in the \nworld marketplace over pesticide prices that are not in harmony with \nour competitors is a practice that must be stopped. It must be stopped \nnow.\n  Nothing in this legislation harms the environment, unless you're in \nthe environment of profits. This legislation would create a procedure \nwhereby individual states could apply and receive an Environmental \nProtection Agency label for agricultural chemicals sold in Canada that \nare identical or substantially similar to agricultural chemicals used \nin the United States. Thus, U.S. producers and suppliers could purchase \nsuch chemicals in Canada for use in the United States.\n  The new labels for the chemicals would still be under the strict \nscrutiny of the Environmental Protection Agency as would their use. \nThis would continue to insure safety in the food supply. Food safety is \na number one priority for all of us. Chemical safety is a number one \npriority for all of us. This bill keeps those priorities intact.\n  It is impossible to defend chemical price imbalance. You can't defend \nit to the growers, you can't defend it to the chemical distributor, and \nyou can't defend it to the chemical retailer. Most importantly, you \ncan't defend it to the American consumer, who ultimately pays the tab.\n  Let's be clear, this is not the end of the journey but the beginning. \nWe have a long way to go to cure the imbalances of trade between our \nnations. If we don't begin the journey, we can't end it. This bill is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Therefore, Members should be on notice that the next rollcall \nvote can be expected approximately at 5:15 on Monday. We will alert \nMembers to the precise timing, but it won't be any earlier than 5:15 on \nMonday.\n  Mr. REID.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n     CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the Chair. I know the Chair has things to \ndo. We have been in the same position. We know that it is not \nconvenient sometimes to preside, but we were kind of dared to come out \nhere today, even though there are a lot of things going on. We had a \nnumber of people who went to the memorial. Senators from the other side \nsaid: I am amazed there are no Democrats here to debate Estrada. We \nrecognize there is going to be other time to debate, but we do not want \nthe record to appear that we are not interested. That is the reason I \ncame down here, to offer my opinion.\n  Migrada Estrada has literally had no paper trail. Despite what some \nof my colleagues have said on the other side of the aisle, it is \nindisputable that Solicitor General memoranda have been turned over in \nthe past. For example, the Department of Justice turned over Solicitor \nGeneral memoranda for Bork, Rehnquist, and Easterbrook. On executive \nbranch appointments, the Department of Justice turned over memoranda \nfor Benjamin Civiletti.\n  While my colleagues may note that former Solicitors General have \nwritten a letter opposing the release of these memos, they cite no \nlegal authority for keeping these memos secret. Basically what they say \nis it would impede these people from writing their opinions. It doesn't \nhappen very often that these people are asked to serve on the second \nhighest court of the land. It is not often they are asked to serve on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. But in cases in the past when that has \noccurred, with Rehnquist, Bork and, of course, another important \nappointment, Easterbrook, they were made available. And they should be \nmade available here.\n  There is no attorney-client privilege at work here. The courts have \ndetermined that applying that privilege to Congress would impede our \nwork. Both the House and the Senate have refused to recognize the \nprivilege in their rules. Former Solicitors argue that the policy \nconsiderations of ensuring candid advice outweighs the Senate's \ninterest in examining this nominee. I don't think that is valid.\n  As I mentioned, the precedent supports release of these memos to the \nSenate. Further, the United States' own Department of Justice \nguidelines from 2000 state:\n\n       Our experience indicates that the Justice Department can \n     develop accommodations with congressional committees that \n     satisfy their needs for the information that may be obtained \n     in deliberative material while at the same time protecting \n     the Department's interest in avoiding a chill in the candor \n     of future deliberations.\n\n  It is my understanding the Department of Justice has made no attempt \nto reach such an accommodation with the Judiciary Committee. The \nstonewalling on the Estrada nomination is part of a larger systematic \neffort by this administration to disable the Senate, to govern in \nsecret, to advance the interests of big business over the public \ninterests.\n  I joined an amicus curiae brief in a matter where Vice President \nCheney had all these meetings with big oil companies. It was determined \nthat there should be some divulging of whom he met with, when he met \nwith them, and what they talked about. Litigation had to be filed on \nthat, and I joined in that litigation, filing a friend of the court \nbrief. It is not right that there be stonewalling. Here is another \nexample of what has happened in this administration.\n\n  My colleague and a dear friend, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, has called the Democratic calls for more \ninformation about Estrada ``silly.'' Well, we have a role as Members of \nthe Senate to advise and give consent to nominations forwarded to us by \nthe White House. I don't think what we are asking is silly.\n  My friend may not agree with our position, but it is not a silly \nposition. Here is a person about whom the Hispanic caucus of the \nCongress unanimously said: We don't want him.\n  Here is a person about whom I put in the Record over 50 organizations \nyesterday saying: We don't want him.\n  There are lots of different reasons organizations give based on his \nqualifications, his temperament. We have one of his former employers \nwho said his temperament, demeanor is not appropriate to serve on a \ncircuit court. In fact, he said he was an ideologue.\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n  That is not silly. People may disagree with our position, but it is \nnot a silly position. The Constitution's consent requirement is not \njust a rubberstamp requirement, as my colleague himself once observed. \nWhen a Democratic President sat in the White House, my Republican \ncolleagues called for voluminous document presentations from his \njudicial nominees, and they got them.\n  Judge Paez, I talked to his mother, trying to get him confirmed, and \nwe finally did. Senator Hatch knows this. I had his mother talk to \nSenator Hatch. He was held up for 4 years. He was asked to provide \ndocumentation of every instance during his tenure as a lower court \njudge where he reduced a sentence downward from Federal sentencing \nguidelines. I had no problem with their asking for them. Why did he do \nit? Was his judicial temperament, his activism, as it is called by my \nfriend from Utah, so much that he couldn't vote to confirm? That is a \nright that he has.\n\n  Judge Marcia Berzon was required to provide the minutes from every \nsingle California ACLU meeting that occurred while she was a member, \nregardless of whether she had even attended the meeting.\n  At that time, Chairman Hatch stated:\n\n       [T]he Senate can and should do what it can to ascertain the \n     jurisprudential views a nominee will bring to the bench in \n     order to prevent the confirmation of those who are likely to \n     be judicial activists.\n\n  That is not a ``silly'' thing he is doing. He has a right to do that. \nSenator Hatch continued:\n\n       Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will \n     become activists is complicated and it will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questioning \n     of nominees' jurisprudential views.\n\n  He had a right to do that. I think the Senate should be similarly \ndiligent and probing in its review of Mr. Estrada's record. Basically, \nthe Judiciary Committee asked him roughly 80 questions and he didn't \ngive any answers. He gave answers such as ``I have not read the \nbriefs;'' ``I wasn't present during arguments;'' ``I have to \nindependently research the issue.'' He was asked to name three cases \nfrom the last 40 years--Supreme Court cases--of which he was critical. \nHe didn't have any.\n  Even Chief Justice Rehnquist, who presided in the Senate during the \nimpeachment trial--and the Presiding Officer was one of the \nprosecutors--and, I thought, handled that impeachment proceeding with \ngreat solemnity--he was diligent and fair. I may not agree with all of \nhis legal opinions, but what a nice man. I was chairman of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee, and I called the Chief Justice and said: \nCome visit with us at election time; would you do that? He did that. He \nanswered questions, was real funny, and he had a great sense of humor. \nSo Chief Justice Rehnquist, a person I have great respect for, said:\n\n       Since most justices come to this bench no earlier than \n     their middle years, it would be unusual if they had not by \n     that time formulated at least some tentative notions that \n     would influence them in their interpretation of the sweeping \n     clauses of the Constitution and their interaction with one \n     another.\n\n  This nominee doesn't fall under that. He also commented:\n\n       It would not merely be unusual, but extraordinary if they \n     had not at least given opinions as to Constitutional issues \n     in their previous legal careers.\n\n  They are asking that the man be on the second highest court in this \nland and he doesn't have any opinion about other opinions written by \njudges. I think that really says it all--why there are questions being \nraised.\n  I am going to bring in here--I was hoping to do it today. Everybody \nbrings in visual aids to the Senate, and there have been efforts to cut \nthe size of them, or to cut them out. Anyway, that has not been done. \nLet's assume we had a chart back here, a big white piece of cardboard, \nor posterboard, and we had here the judicial experience of Mr. Estrada. \nIt would be blank. There would not be anything on it. We would bring \nout another chart and on that it would have Miguel Estrada and it would \nhave there the questions he answered for the Judiciary Committee. It \nwould be blank. There would be nothing on it.\n  Does it seem ``silly'' that we are asking questions about this man? I \ndon't think so. So I would say that we have a right and an obligation \nto move forward the way we are.\n  The administration's secrecy is deeply disturbing in all these areas. \nIt is more so in the case of Miguel Estrada. I have talked about Vice \nPresident Cheney not giving us information about the oil companies, and \nthis nomination is also very troubling to me. If I could file another \ncourt brief in this instance, I would. It is not available. This is a \ndifferent type of proceeding.\n\n  Senators have a constitutional duty to evaluate this nominee. This \nnominee has stayed silent, refusing the American people a window into \nhis views, judicial philosophy, and his manner of thinking. The \nadministration has similarly refused to turn over documents that would \nillustrate those things to the Senate.\n  Should we approve this nomination, the Senate would be setting a \ndangerous precedent that would greatly narrow the scope of the \nimportant power vested in us by our Founding Fathers.\n  It would serve neither the Senate, the people of Nevada, nor the rest \nof the American people to confer such a rubber stamp on this or any \nadministration, Republican or Democrat.\n  The Founders carefully balanced the powers of each branch of \ngovernment, and the Senate's role in approving a President's nominee is \na critical part of that balance, this separation of powers.\n  I submit that the examples I have provided show that this \nadministration has forgotten, or ignored, the importance of that \nbalance.\n  There is no more important a time to remind this administration of \nthe importance of that balance than in the case of a person who is \nnominated for a lifetime judicial appointment to the second highest \ncourt in our land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, \nfor accommodating my being able to speak at this moment.\n  I rise today, after coming from a hearing of my Foreign Relations \nCommittee, where Secretary Powell has just testified. I note at the \noutset that I, for one--and I think my view is shared by many--think \nSecretary Powell made a compelling and irrefutable case yesterday about \nSaddam Hussein's possession of and continued effort to hide his weapons \nof mass destruction and his desire to gain more. But I am fearful--that \nis the wrong word--I am concerned that our understandable focus on Iraq \nat this moment is taking focus off of what I believe to be an equal, if \nnot more immediate, threat to U.S. interests and those of our allies. I \nspeak of Korea.\n  Last week we learned that North Korea has moved plutonium fuel rods \nout of storage and possibly towards a production--for everybody \nlistening, this is complicated stuff and I will explain what I mean. \nThey announced today they are beginning their 5 megawatt nuclear \npowerplant. What happens with that type of nuclear powerplant--which \nwe, until now, had them shut down with the IAEA, when there were \ncameras and inspectors making sure it was shut down. What happens is \nthey have fuel rods--as my friend knows well, fuel is a nuclear power, \nproduces nuclear power. That spent rod--in other words, the byproduct \nof that process of generating electricity through nuclear power--that \nso-called spent rod is then taken out of that reactor and, because of \nthe type of reactor this is, it is the byproduct of that reactor. It is \na spent rod that has plutonium in it. Plutonium--and I am giving an \nunscientific analysis. Not that the American public could not \nunderstand it, but this is an unscientific analysis of how it works.\n  That spent rod is then stored somewhere because it has a radioactive \nhalf life that is longer than any of us, or our grandchildren, or \ngreat-grandchildren are going to have. What we have always worried \nabout is they would take that spent rod and move it to a plant not far \nfrom the reactor that generates electricity, such as the lights that \nare on in this Chamber, and they are put in a reprocessing plant.\n  The reprocessing plant is another process by which that spent rod \nthat no longer generates electricity, that has the fissile material in \nit, essentially\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\ntakes that rod--it is a long rod and it looks like a big pole, sort of. \nWhen it is put in that reprocessing plant, within 1 month there would \nbe enough plutonium--figuratively--that comes out of that rod that is \nin a different form--enough plutonium to construct one additional \nnuclear bomb. That material does not lend itself to easy detection. \nGeiger counters don't click when it passes through a detection area. It \nis very hard to pick up, like we pick up knives in suitcases going \nthrough at the airport. That plutonium is exportable and hardly \ndetectable. It is the stuff of which a nuclear bomb is made.\n  Correct, and prophetic! How then, do we explain the administration's \nmuted response to the world's worst proliferator taking concrete steps \nthat could permit it to build a nuclear arsenal?\n  We can't afford to put this problem on the back burner just because \nwe are preoccupied with Iraq and the war on terrorism. The \nadministration needs to demonstrate the ability to walk, chew tobacco, \nand spit at the same time.\n  If we follow the hard-headed engagement prescription, will it work? \nWill the North change course?\n  I don't know. It's impossible to know for sure unless we try. I say \nthe odds, frankly, are stacked against us, and would have been stacked \nagainst us even if we hadn't wasted the last 2 years.\n  Pyongyang says it wants to resolve all of the United States' security \nconcerns, including the ``nuclear issue,'' and will do so if the United \nStates formally assures the DPRK of nonaggression. Is this price too \nhigh? Can the North be counted on to fulfill its side of the bargain?\n  Prior to his departure for Pyongyang in 1994, President Carter was \nbriefed by the State Department on the current situation in North \nKorea--its economy, military capabilities, diplomatic initiatives. He \nkept coming back to one question, ``What does North Korea want?''\n  He answered the question himself with one word: RESPECT. The \nunderlying cause of the 1994 crisis and the current one are the same.\n  North Korea is weak, isolated, and incapable of rescuing itself. \nLargely cut off from Chinese and Russian support, the DPRK is \nprofoundly insecure. South Korea's economy has made possible a \nrevolution in military affairs, and U.S. military prowess has been \nproved repeatedly in the Gulf, the Balkans, and most recently in \nAfghanistan. By contrast the North's conventional military forces are \nobsolete, its training budget minuscule.\n  The North is one of the obvious targets of a new so-called \n``preemptive'' military doctrine, and it is witnessing a military \nbuildup in the Persian Gulf designed to oust Saddam Hussein from power \nin the very near future.\n  The message to Pyongyang could not be more clear: ``Be afraid. Be \nvery afraid.''\n  Fine, Deterrence works, up to a point, and I am not against reminding \nNorth Korea of our military prowess.\n  But only comprehensive negotiations have a change to move Pyongyang \nback from the precipice it is approaching.\n  The administration should overcome its distaste for dealing with Kim \nChong-il and engage the North in serious, high level, bilateral \ndiscussions to end the North's nuclear program once and for all.\n  Demanding that Pyongyang unconditionally surrender before the United \nStates will engage in talks is a nice fantasy policy, but it has \nabsolutely no hope in the real world.\n  We should instead adopt a posture of ``more for more.'' The President \nis right when he resists ``paying'' North Korea to abide by the \nagreements it has already signed. But that is not what I'm talking \nabout. The agreed framework left too much undone. Our objective should \nnot be to restore the status quo ante.\n  Rather, we need to seek the removal of all of the spent fuel rods \nfrom the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. We need verifiably to dismantle the \nNorth's highly enriched uranium program. We need to account for the 8-9 \nkilograms of plutonium ``missing'' since 1994, and do so sooner. rather \nthan later. We need to get North Korea back inside the Nuclear Non-\nproliferation Treaty and return the inspectors to monitor the North's \nconduct.\n  Long term, we need to address the North's development and export of \nballistic missiles and its abominable human rights records.\n  To get there, we must bring something to the table other than threats \nand insults.\n  The North isn't looking for money from us. That can come from South \nKorea, Japan, our allies, in the form of trade, aid, investment, and \nwar reparations.\n  The North is looking for respect and security. These are precious \ncommodities. The North must earn them. But in the end, it seems a small \nprice to pay if the outcome is a denuclearized Peninsula with North and \nSouth living in peace.\n  If you have a piece of plutonium that has a base bigger in \ncircumference than the bottom of the jar I am holding up and about as \nhalf as thick and you have the right instrument, the right rifling \neffect--you know how a bullet that has gunpowder in it and a piece of \nmetal at the end of it, the stuff that goes through your body, the \nbullet has to be directed some way; it has to be, in effect, ignited \nsome way.\n  What happens is you have a rifle with a firing pin. It has a long \ntube. You hit the back of it, and it explodes the gunpowder, fires this \nprojectile through the rifle, through the long muzzle, and it goes \ncertain distances based on its configuration.\n  That is what happens when you have these two pieces of plutonium, if \nyou can get your hands on them, and you put it in a nuclear device they \ncall a rifle device. If you can smash those two pieces of plutonium \ntogether at the appropriate speed in the appropriate sphere, you can \nhave, with just those two small pieces, a 1-kiloton bomb. A nuclear \nchain reaction starts when those pieces collide in the right \ncircumstances.\n  If one of those weapons is homemade--it does not have to be put in a \nmissile. Because it is classified, I am not able to tell you, but I \nknow my friend knows because he has full access, as I do. If we put \nthat so-called rifle device which is, like that old saying, bigger than \na bread box but smaller than a Mack truck--it is somewhere in between--\nif you put that in place in a stationary position and detonate it, you \nwould have been able to take down the World Trade Towers in, I believe \nit was 3 seconds--do not hold me to that, but very few seconds--and \nkill about 100,000 people according to our experts. Because this \nmaterial is highly undetectable and moveable, it is of considerable \nconcern.\n  What does this have to do with anything? Why am I standing here when \nwe may be able to go to war in Iraq if Saddam does not make the right \nchoice? Why am I talking about this?\n  What happened is, the North Koreans, who are trying to blackmail us \nand the world, who are the bad guys, who are doing the wrong thing and \nare doing it on their own--I am not suggesting anything we did produced \nthat or made them do that--they are saying: We are going forward, and \nwe just turned the light switch on in our 5-megawatt nuclear reactor \nthat will only produce more spent rods--follow me?--the stuff from \nwhich you get plutonium, but we have 8,000 of these spent rods sitting \nin another location. But all we have to do is take these spent rods or \nthe new ones we get and take them over to that reprocessing plant. We \nhave not clicked the light switch on in that plant yet, but we promised \nyou we would not switch the light on in our nuclear powerplant, and we \nare saying: No, we are out; we are out of the arms control regime; we \nare going ahead and switching the light on, and if you do not talk to \nus--basically, blackmail--we are going ahead and switching the light on \nin the reprocessing facility.\n  That puts the President in a very difficult position, and I am not \nsuggesting this is an easy call. At the end of December, the \nadministration indicated that it intended to take a careful and \ndeliberative approach to the emerging crisis on the peninsula.\n  The emerging crisis occurred when they blocked the cameras of the \nIAEA, kicked the inspectors out, and they went dark; we did not know \nwhat they were doing. Fortunately, we have COMINT and HUMINT, my friend \nknows, a fancy way of saying human intelligence on the ground and \nsatellites above, that give us a pretty\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\ngood idea what they are doing because we know where the reprocessing \nplant and nuclear plant are.\n\n  I think the administration took a fairly reasoned approach. They \ndeclared:\n\n       We have months to watch this unfold and see what happens.\n\n  Other administration officials, including the President, conveyed the \nimportance of patience in assessing and responding to North Korean \nthreats. Were North Korea 3 to 5 years away from acquiring additional \nnuclear weapons, this patience in diplomacy would be very appropriate. \nHowever, there are 8,000 spent-fuel rods in North Korea, which may now \nbe moving out of storage, that can yield enough fissile material for \nfive or six additional nuclear weapons.\n  The time line for reprocessing this spent fuel is a mere 5 to 6 \nmonths, but it gets worse. The North Koreans are likely to reprocess \nplutonium from spent-fuel rods in small batches. They do not have to \ntake the 8,000 spent-fuel rods and start to reprocess them, meaning \nthat the plutonium emerges a few grams at a time. Enough plutonium to \nproduce one nuclear weapon can be ready in less than 5 weeks, according \nto our intelligence people and our scientists at the laboratories, \nafter the initial spent fuel--those 8,000 rods--enter the reprocessing \nplant, not 8,000 of them but some of them.\n  The clock is already ticking, and I think it is important that the \nadministration's assessment of the recent reports that North Korea has \nbegun removing some or all of those 8,000 spent-fuel rods from those \nstorage facilities--tell us how this development will impact on the \noverall policy of the administration in terms of patience.\n  Just restarting this reactor could produce another 6 kilograms of \nplutonium, in addition to those that are sitting in these rods right \nnow. If Pyongyang completes construction of two unfinished, but much \nlarger nuclear reactors, it could produce as much as 275 kilograms of \nweapons-grade plutonium each year.\n  When the administration says North Korea's reprocessing, if they \nstarted, is not a crisis, it seems to me it makes a very unhealthy \nsuggestion, and that is that the only use of this reprocessed \nplutonium, the stuff that can go right into a bomb, a nuclear weapon, \nthat the only use they will use it for is to make another six or eight \nnuclear weapons.\n  They have, we think, one or two nuclear bombs now, from the time we \nshut down the process. We worked out an agreement that they shut down \nthe process, and everybody agrees it was shut down in 1994.\n  I would have to agree with the administration because I think \ndeterrence works. They seem to have a dual standard here. They say the \nreason we have to build a national missile defense is if deterrence \ndoes not work, and now they tell us basically: Do not worry, it does \nnot materially change the situation on the peninsula if they get \nanother three, four, five, or eight nuclear weapons. I think it does. \nApparently they agree deterrence does work somehow or they would be \nmuch more worried about it.\n  I then ask the question, What happens if they do not take this spent \nfuel? What happens if they do not take it and put it in a weapon? What \nhappens if they take this plutonium from the spent fuel and put it in a \nlittle canister? I am told by my staff who is expert on Korea that \ntheir total trade surplus is about $400 million a year.\n  If they have this spent fuel, I cannot imagine they would not be able \nto find buyers where they could pick up maybe $200 million for this. \nWhat would Iran pay for this spent fuel? They are trying to now \ngenerate the ability to reprocess their own fissile material.\n  What about al-Qaida, who I might note is alive and well, \nunfortunately? Damaged but well, damaged but in business. Remember when \nwe saw those pictures as we took Kandahar, when we invaded Afghanistan \nwith the multilateral force? Remember a reporter--I forget which news \norganization it was, but I think it was one of the weekly magazines. I \nwill not say which one. I remember clearly, and everyone else will \nremember when I say it, they went into a safe house, I believe it was \nin Kandahar, and came out with a diagram--a safe house meaning a house \noccupied by al-Qaida--of an attempt at what looked like how to produce \na nuclear weapon. Then we got further information saying there was \nclear evidence that al-Qaida had been talking to two Pakistani nuclear \nscientists who know how to and have made nuclear weapons. So obviously \nthese boys are trying to figure out how to make a homemade nuclear \ndevice.\n  So I would like to think, and I agree the probability is North Korea \nis not likely to sell this--I should not say not likely--may not sell \nthis plutonium. They may use it all for their own purposes.\n  What if we are wrong and the ability to account for this material is \nvirtually nonexistent, because it is so difficult to discern and \ndetermine where it is? The reason why our intelligence service, even \nafter the agreed framework, is saying we think they have enough fuel, \nenough fissile material, plutonium from the past to have made one or \ntwo nuclear bombs by 1994, we do not know that. So what happens if we \ndo not resolve this crisis, draw some red lines, make it clear what our \nintention is and talk with these guys? What happens if 6 months down \nthe road they have started up the reprocessing plant and we know they \nhave enough plutonium for 6 new nuclear weapons, and then we get an \nagreement? They are going to say we did not really produce X amount, we \nproduced Y amount, or X minus whatever. Are we ever going to know where \nthis material is? This is dangerous stuff.\n  As I understand it, the Bush administration says--which is the \npreferred course--we do not want to be blackmailed. We have to put this \ninto a multilateral context. Again, I find it interesting they never \nwanted to do anything multilateral but now with regard to Korea they \nwant to be multilateral, which is a good idea. They say China, Russia, \nSouth Korea, and Japan have as much at stake as we do, even more.\n  So what we are going to do--and it is correct if we can get it done--\nwe are going to say we will negotiate or talk with North Korea only \nunder the umbrella of a multilateral meeting called by the community I \njust named, where we are one of the parties.\n  What are the North Koreans saying? They are saying it does not matter \nwhat the rest of these guys think. We want to know what you think. We \nknow if we do not get a nonaggression agreement in some form from you, \nour legitimacy continues to be at stake.\n  Do we want to legitimize this illegitimate regime? No. But here is \nthe horns of the dilemma. If we do not talk to them about what it is we \ninsist on in order to suggest we get a nonaggression pact or some \nversion of it, if we do not let it be known, we will never know whether \nthere could have been an agreement, and we almost certainly know that \nin the near term there will be plutonium that is unaccounted for coming \nout of that country.\n\n  My colleagues might say, oh, that is not true, Joe. All we have to do \nis we can take out those reprocessing plants--and we can, by the way. \nWe can take them out in a heartbeat. We have the capacity. We know \nwhere they are. We can blow them up with our missiles, our jets, our \nstandoff bombers.\n  Guess what. There are roughly 8,000 pieces of artillery they have \nsitting within range of Seoul. One of our South Korean friends told us, \nwe do not support you using force against the North.\n  How can we go to war with the North when the South will not support \nus? Kind of fascinating, isn't it?\n  China says they are prepared to talk with North Korea but you should \nnot waste any more time. Talk to them. South Korea is saying you should \ntalk to them. In a sense, the President is put on the horns of another \ndilemma. One says we should talk multilateral because that is the best \nway to deal with this, and all our multilateral partners whom we say \nshould be part of the discussion say, no, you talk, which is unfair \nbecause China will not step up to its obligations and its own interest, \nin my humble opinion. So much is at stake for South Korea in terms of \nthe potential carnage that would occur to South Koreans, in addition to \nthe 37,000 American forces on the peninsula. They are saying, whoa, we \nare not for you taking out those reactors. We are not ready to have you \ncall the bluff of the North.\n  So what does the President do? Imagine being President of the United\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nStates and having to make the decision between shutting down a reactor \nyou believe to be inimicable to your security interests, and knowing if \nyou do, you may very well be in a position of starting a war--justified \nin literal terms, in my view--that would cause such overwhelming damage \nto the--and we would win the war, by the way, but it would cause such \noverwhelming damage to the very people we went to Korea in the first \nplace to protect, the South Koreans.\n  What do we do? I suggest the members of this administration have the \nanswer if they listen to the people who are now in their \nadministration. The Bush administration claims the ball is in North \nKorea's court. North Korea says the ball is in our court. From where I \nsit, the ball is stuck somewhere in the net, or not even in the net. \nYou know how once in awhile when you were a kid you would fake a \njumpshot from the corner and it would get wedged between the back \ncorner and the rim? That is where the ball is right now. Somebody has \nto jump up and put the ball back in play.\n  How does the ball get put back in play? There was a report written \nnot long ago called The Armitage Report. He happens to be the No. 2 guy \nat the State Department now. In that report, Mr. Armitage and others--\nincluding the following people: Paul Wolfowitz, the No. 2 guy at \nDefense; the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Peter \nBrookes; current Assistant Secretary of Intelligence and Research, Carl \nFord, among others. They are all part of this Armitage Report filed \nbefore President Bush became President--called for a policy of \nhardheaded engagement, developing close coordination with our allies \nand backed by a credible threat of military force. Their prescription \nwas remarkably close to that offered by former Secretary of Defense \nPerry, but has the tremendous political advantage of having been \nembraced by so many leading figures on the Bush foreign policy team, \nthe people running the show now.\n  What did Armitage advocate? Here are the key recommendations.\n  First, regain the diplomatic initiative. U.S. policy toward North \nKorea has ``become largely reactive and predictable with U.S. diplomacy \ncharacterized by a cycle of North Korea provocation or demand and an \nAmerican response.''\n  Good idea. Now the Bush administration claims the ball is in their \ncourt, as I said.\n  The second recommendation was ``a new approach must treat the agreed \nframework as the beginning of a policy toward North Korea, not as an \nend to the problem. It should clearly formulate answers to two key \nquestions. First, what precisely do we want from North Korea and what \nprice are we prepared to pay for it.''\n  I am quoting from the Armitage report that Wolfowitz signed off on \nand Carl Ford signed off on, major players in this administration.\n  They said, ``Are we prepared to take a different course if, after \nexhausting all reasonable diplomatic efforts, we conclude that no \nworthwhile court is possible?''\n  What diplomatic efforts have we exhausted? These are great questions, \nbut the administration has yet to answer them. Indeed, the \nadministration cannot seem to decide what it is about the north that \nbothers it the most. Is it human rights abuses or past support of \nterrorism, export of missiles, its military threat, or its nuclear \nprogram?\n  To me, the priority must be a verifiable ending of North Korea's \nweapons program, particularly nuclear weapons. Everything else must be \nput off for another day.\n  The third recommendation of the Armitage report: A U.S. point person \nshould be designated by the President in consultation with \ncongressional leaders and should report directly to the President.\n  We have a fine man named Kelly out of the State Department, but he \nhas no direct access to the President. This has not been raised up to \nthat level because we are being told--I don't know why--that this is \nnot a crisis.\n  I think the American people and this Congress are fully capable of \nhandling more than one crisis at a time. Iraq is a crisis. So we are \ntold. Well, it is. But not in my view in terms of the immediate threat \nto the United States. Or the crisis could be in North Korea. Why can't \nwe do both?\n  President Bush has downgraded the special envoy position, thereby \nassuring that we cannot gain access to Kim Chong-il, the only man in \nNorth Korea with whom we can get a deal, or at least figure out what he \nis about.\n  Fourth recommendation: Offer Pyongyang clear choices in regard to the \nfuture. On the one hand, economic benefits, security assurances, \npolitical legitimization. On the other hand, the certainty of enhanced \nmilitary deterrence.\n  For the United States and its allies, the package, as a whole, means \nwe are prepared, if Pyongyang meets our concerns, to accept North Korea \nas a legitimate actor up to and including full normalization of \nrelations.\n  This is not Joe Biden writing this recommendation; it is Paul \nWolfowitz. It is the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Armitage. What \nhappened in a year and a half? What happened to change their mind?\n  The good idea of the administration almost seems ready to be \nembraced. The President has spoken about bold initiatives toward the \nnorth but talk of carrots still has been undermined by the Bush \nadministration's insistence that incentives are the equivalent to \nappeasement.\n  Before my committee today, the Secretary of State says we have no \nintention to go to war with the north, et cetera, et cetera. The right \nwords, right phraseology. The Secretary of Defense walked out of a \nhearing yesterday with the House Armed Services Committee and said this \nis an evil empire, something much more provocative. Accurate but \nprovocative.\n  The fifth recommendation by this committee that the notion of buying \ntime works in our favor is increasingly dubious. Let me reiterate the \nfifth point of the report signed by Carl Ford, No. 2, over at CIA, \nWolfowitz, No. 2 at Defense, Armitage, No. 2 at State: The notion that \nbuying time works in our favor is increasingly dubious.\n  President Bush, please, even if you don't want to enunciate it, in \nyour mind, treat this as a crisis because, if it is not contained now, \nour options are only diminished as time goes by, not increased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/06/senate-section/article/S2063-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
