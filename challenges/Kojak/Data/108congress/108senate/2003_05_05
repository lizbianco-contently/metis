Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 12:45 p.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate will begin consideration of the nomination of Deborah Cook to be \na Federal judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  Under the agreement entered into last week, there will be up to 4 \nhours of debate on the nomination prior to a vote. Therefore, the first \nvote will occur at 4:45 p.m. today, and it will be on the confirmation \nof Deborah Cook.\n  Upon the disposition of the Cook nomination, the Senate will debate \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada until 6 p.m., and at 6 p.m. the Senate \nwill conduct its fifth cloture vote on the Estrada nomination.\n  The majority leader stated on a number of occasions that we are not \ngoing to give up on attempting to get Miguel Estrada an up-or-down \nvote.\n  In addition to these additional nominations, there are a number of \nother important issues to be considered during this coming week. On \nTuesday, we will begin debate on the energy bill, although amendments \nwill not be in order until Thursday. We are expecting Members to come \nto the floor to begin the debate on this much needed legislation.\n  Also, we have been working on agreements that would allow the Senate \nto consider the State Department reauthorization bill, the NATO \nexpansion treaty, the bioshield bill, and the FISA legislation. \nTherefore, I will advise our colleagues to prepare for a very busy week \nwith rollcalls each and every day.\n  Let me also say the majority leader hopes and expects that we will be \ndoing the vote on the Roberts nomination Friday morning, which is \npursuant to the agreement the assistant Democratic leader and myself \nand the two leaders were working on last week. So we hope to be able to \nwrap that nomination up on Friday as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was listening closely. But the Senator \nsaid we would take up the energy bill on Tuesday with no amendments in \norder. Then he said Thursday. Maybe I misunderstood.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding that there will not be any vote \non the energy bill until Thursday, but we will take it up tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5695-5", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been mentioned this morning, of \ncourse, that we are going to move forward this week to deal with energy \npolicy. I must tell you I am very pleased that that is the case. We \nhave worked very long and hard to develop an energy policy to bring it \nagain this year before the Senate. As you recall, we had one last year. \nIt went into conference and we were unable to bring it up.\n  I think it is certainly important that we do that. Of all the issues \nthat are before us, I expect it may be one of the most compelling--\ncompelling because it is something that is of vital importance to this \nNation. Probably more people are affected by energy than most any other \nservice.\n  We have the Middle East situation, of course. Over time we have \ngotten ourselves in the position where 60 percent of our oil imports \nare a matter of importance because we have become very dependent.\n  It was almost 2 years ago that the President of the United States and \nthe Vice President, Dick Cheney, and their task force, came up with \nenergy recommendations. This is one of the first issues talked about. \nSince that time, it has become even more compelling partly because of \nthe unrest in the Middle East. Also, partly because of the result in \nIraq, I think people now are more aware of how important it is for us \nto have an energy policy.\n  The President said we need to have an energy policy for the future, \nbut, of course, one that also meets the needs of today. I think we can \ndo that. I think we can develop a policy which deals with the problems \nwe now have, but, more importantly, we should try to get a vision for \nthe future--15 or 20 years in the future--and see what we have to do, \nand where we would expect to be at that time and then measure what we \ndo in the interim with respect to accomplishing those goals.\n  We do have to make changes. We have to make changes in most \neverything. But I have to tell you that in the case of energy, perhaps \nchange is more apparent and more obvious and more compelling than most \nof the other issues with which we have to deal. We must modernize \nconservation. Obviously, what we need is a balanced policy but one that \ndeals with conservation, one that deals with alternative fuels, one \nthat deals with research, one that deals, of course, with enhancing \ndomestic production, and other issues. But those certainly have to be \nthe basic elements of our energy policy as we look forward.\n  There is much that we can do. I can recall a number of years ago in \nCasper, WY, meeting with an energy group. I don't remember who it was. \nBut I remember they said that we have never run out of an energy \nsource. We have continued to change. We used to have wood. We used to \nhave coal. We had oil, we had gas and nuclear, and we continue to \nchange. But it takes some forward thinking to do that. It takes some \nresearch to do that. It takes an effort made to bring about the changes \nthat are necessary to provide Americans with a very important element \nof their support. We need to modernize our infrastructure.\n  Obviously, situations change. We are going to have production, for \ninstance, in gas. In my State, we have a great deal of supply and a \nsource. In order to get it to a marketplace, you have to have \npipelines. You have to have transportation.\n  The same is very much true with electricity. The largest source of \nfuel for the future and for which we have a resource is currently \ncoal. You have to move that resource to the consumer. You can either \nmove it as coal in a railroad car, which is very inefficient, or you \ncan produce energy at the mine site and then move it to the consumer in \ntransmission lines. We have not kept up with that. We are beginning to \nfeel the consequences of that very much.\n\n  We have to increase our supplies of energy. We are doing that, of \ncourse, by having new places to drill, new places to extract, new \nplaces to find different alternative fuels that are available, frankly, \nvery little of which has become really commercial in nature.\n  If you exclude hydro from renewables, then only about 3 percent of \nour energy comes from renewable sources. That is not very much, so it \nis going to take a while. It is going to take research. It is going to \ntake much action to make sure we get those actually in the homes in \nAmerica. Renewables are very important. We have to accelerate our plans \nand our efforts to protect the environment as we do this.\n  I think everybody wants a balanced energy policy, a balanced policy \nwhich says, yes, we need to produce more of our own energy in whatever \nway. As we do it, we have to protect the environment.\n  Again, in my home State of Wyoming, that is very important to us. \nFifty percent of Wyoming belongs to the Federal Government, so most of \nthe resources there, such as oil and gas and often coal, are on Federal \nlands. We need to be able to produce this energy in such a way that you \ncan also have wildlife, you can also enjoy the environment, as well as \nproduction. Frankly, we have shown you can do that. We need to make \nthat activity become even more workable by doing more research.\n  The bottom line, which I have already mentioned, is, in our national \nsecurity, to be less dependent on having to look somewhere else for the \nenergy that is necessary for us to remain secure and prosperous. It is \nnot only part of security; it is also part of economic stability and \neconomic growth.\n  We have been trying. I mentioned we tried last year, but our attempts \nfailed. We worked very hard at it, as a matter of fact. We had bills \nout of both the House and the Senate. After some controversy on both \nsides, we went to committee to put them together and were never able to \ncome up with a solution. Now we are back again.\n  That process was flawed. Basically, the committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Energy Committee in this case, did not work through the bill before \nit came to the floor. Quite frankly, it is very difficult to be \nsuccessful on the floor unless you can come to some agreement in the \ncommittee prior to that. We had no hearings, really. We had no markups.\n  But it has been different this year. We have a chairman who has \nworked very hard--the Senator from New Mexico. We have a bill that is \nready to come before us, and one we really need to work on.\n  Again, certainly it is essential to completing this war activity we \nhave been in, to really having stability in our own country so that we \nhave somewhat of an energy independence. We may not be totally \nindependent, of course. There is nothing wrong with bringing in fuels \nfrom other places, but we should not allow ourselves to be 60 percent \ndependent on that.\n  The development of resources is essential to economic growth and that \nis what we are looking for now, at the same time we are looking at ways \nto stimulate the economy to create more jobs. I can tell you, the \nmovement in the energy field is one that allows us to do the same \nthing. We need a balanced approach. I have mentioned that.\n\n  Some people think, oh, my gosh, all you are going to do is take oil \nwells out there and start drilling everywhere. That is not the case. We \nare looking at conservation. As we look at our own lives, there are \nmany ways, if we make some changes in what we do, we can reduce our \ndemands on energy. We can shift our demands on energy to those things \nthat are more available.\n  Think about it at home. Are there any ways in which we could have \nappliances where we could do things a little differently and have them \nuse less energy? I think that is true. We are all looking for ways to \nincrease mileage in our automobiles, and there are ways to do that.\n  I have to tell you, I think it is a mistake to mandate certain action \nover a period of time because that becomes very expensive and also puts \na real halt on us moving forward. But what we ought to do is have \nincentives so that we do work toward having more conservation.\n  Fossil fuels, of course, are our biggest supplier now of energy and \nwill be for some time. Again, for instance, in the case of coal, we \nhave a great abundance of coal, and we have done a great deal to make \nit more clean to help with climate change. But we can do even more.\n  In the coalfields in Wyoming there is an effort to begin to put some \nemphasis on hydrogen. Hydrogen can be made with coal and water, and \nhydrogen can\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\nthen be used much more efficiently in terms of the movement of the fuel \nas well as using it for automobiles. We can do that.\n  Natural gas, of course, is one of our very important resources. \nAgain, we need to be able to move that. We need to be able to use it at \nthe highest priority and use these fuels where we get the best bang for \nthe dollar. That is what we are seeking to do: to give some diversity, \nto utilize the domestic resources, to have an overall energy strategy.\n  I think too often--and we are a little guilty of that right here in \nthe Senate--we get into one of these issues and we start talking almost \nentirely about today's problems and solving the problems we have or our \nconstituents have out there right now. That is fine, and we need to do \nthat. But this is a policy. This is designed to give us a roadmap to \nmake changes over time.\n  Again, electricity is a good example. Years ago, when you had a \ndistribution area, you had a city or a county, and you had an electric \nsupplier that provided for that group. They had a generating plant and \na distribution system, and it was all contained right there in the city \nor right there in the county.\n  Now 40 percent of energy is generated by what you call merchant \ngenerators that do not do distribution, but they sell it to \ndistributors. Of course, to do that, you have to have transmission \nlines that move the energy around. So things are changing, and we need \nto keep ahead of change the best we can.\n  There are also great opportunities for doing something with nuclear \npower, which is one of the cleanest sources of power we have. We will \nbe talking about doing some things with Alaska, for example, whether it \nis pipelines or ANWR.\n  So I just want to say, Mr. President, we are going to be spending a \nconsiderable amount of time on energy in the next several weeks. Our \ngoal, hopefully, in the Senate is to get through with the program by \nMemorial Day. The House will be moving forward as well and has a \nprogram that is ready to go, pretty much.\n  Part of this, of course, will be in the area of tax incentives. As I \nsaid, what we need to do is provide incentives for people to do better, \nto have better ways of drilling, to do better in geological surveys, \nand so on. Part of that will be a tax title that has been passed out of \nthe Finance Committee. And now the energy bill has been passed out of \nthe Energy Committee. So we are ready to go.\n  I am hopeful we can come together. I know there are going to be \ndifferent views about what we do on conservation, what we do about \nethanol, what we do about alternatives, but all of those must be \nresolved if we are to come forward with something that will be good for \nour country in terms of an energy policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5697-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5697-S5698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INCREASING THE FEDERAL DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, later this week, I am told, we will be \ngetting in the Senate a proposal to increase the Federal debt limit. My \nassumption is that the increase in the Federal debt limit we will be \nasked to consider will be nearly $1 trillion--$900-some billion. I am \ntold it is shaved just enough to be under $1 trillion.\n  That increase in the debt limit will equal, incidentally, all of the \ndebt accumulated from George Washington until 1980, until Ronald Reagan \ntook office. For all of those years, we accumulated less than $1 \ntrillion in debt. The debt limit increase we will be asked to vote on \nwill be just slightly under $1 trillion.\n  What does that say about the country's fiscal policy? It says we are \nrunning very large Federal budget deficits. Two years ago, it was \nexpected that we would run large budget surpluses as far as the eye \ncould see. President Bush said: Let's have the American people keep \ntheir own money. Let's move the surpluses back. Let's have a $1.7 \ntrillion tax cut.\n  Some of us said: Maybe we should be more conservative. What if these \nFederal budget surpluses don't materialize? What if we are wrong about \nthat?\n  They said: Never mind. And they pushed it through the House and the \nSenate, and with great fanfare they signed the bill.\n  Two years later, we have budget deficits as far as the eye can see; \nthis year, the biggest budget deficit in history and this week, \napparently, a proposal to increase the Federal debt limit by nearly $1 \ntrillion. I don't understand that.\n  In addition to that, there is a major debate on how much additional \ntax cuts there should be: Should the President get his program of \nadditional tax cuts? There are not only tax cuts in what is called \nreconciliation, but tax cut proposals outside of reconciliation, which \naltogether total $1.3 trillion in additional tax cuts.\n\n  The easiest lifting in American politics for any politician anywhere \nin America is to say: I support tax cuts. If in fact tax cuts produce \nnew jobs, then sign me up. I propose we have a trillion dollars in tax \ncuts or, better yet, $2 trillion in tax cuts. But, of course, we know \nwhat we have ahead of us are very large Federal budget deficits.\n  For Congress and the President, the question is, What is it that we \ndon't want to do in our Government? Do we not want to have regulatory \nagencies that provide protection for American citizens and consumers? \nDo we not want to build roads? Do we not want to fund schools? Do we \nnot want to fund the Customs Service, the Immigration Service, the \nBorder Patrol, the Food and Drug Administration? What exactly is it \nthat we should not be doing? Those are the important questions.\n  Of course, there is waste in government. And we ought to cut spending \nwhere it is wasted. Let me give an example. Senator Wyden and I some \nwhile ago asked the Federal Bureau of Prisons, why are you advertising \nfor a dance instructor? In fact, it was advertising for a dance \ninstructor in the State of Texas. Why are you advertising for that for \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons? What do we need that for? What is the \npurpose of that? We have since discovered that the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons has had dance instructors at eight federal prisons. I don't \nunderstand that. Learning how to dance the salsa when you are in \nprison, is that necessary? In areas where there is waste, let's attack \nwaste.\n  Let me cite one other example. Senator Wyden and I mentioned this \npast week--and this is not direct spending on our budget--that the U.S. \nPostal System inspector general's office is wasting massive amounts of \nmoney. The inspector general's office has 700-some people in the Office \nof the Postal Department doing events supposed to promote teamwork, \nwhere employees wrap themselves in toilet paper. They wear animal \ncostumes. They dress up and do role playing. It is the most Byzantine \nthing I have ever heard of. They spend millions of dollars on these \nevents. That inspector general ought to lose their job. It is a waste \nof money.\n  But there are government functions that are essential for our \ncountry. Like those nettlesome regulatory agencies that are supposed to \nprotect us from the kind of grand theft that occurred on the west coast \nwith Enron Corporation and others, where what they did was ratchet up \nthe price of electricity. They were turning it, double, triple, 10 \ntimes, charging the consumers on the west coast a massive amount of \nmoney for electricity as they were manipulating the price. They were \ntaking plants offline and manipulating the quantity of energy, and they \nwere engaged in efforts that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nand the Justice Department now apparently say are criminal.\n  I believe they were criminal. I said so last year when I chaired \nhearings on Enron Corporation. What we have seen on the west coast, \nwith respect to what was going on with the pricing of electricity, is \ngrand theft. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is now beginning \nto take action, after the fact,\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nafter the west coast consumers were cheated, bilked to the tune of \nbillions of dollars.\n  So is that a part of government that we don't want to have around? We \ndon't want the regulatory agencies looking over the shoulder of \ncompanies such as Enron that were manipulating price and supply in \norder to cheat consumers in an approach that now appears criminal? That \nis what FERC says. Do we want to reduce the number of regulators who \nprotect consumers?\n\n  What about Wall Street? We saw last week there was a $1.9 billion \nsettlement because Wall Street firms were saying: Let's push this stock \nto the customers, despite the fact that internally these firms were \nsaying: The stock is a dog; this stock is terrible. Yet what their \nsalesmen in the field were being told by research analysts at these \ncompanies was: Push this stock along to an unsuspecting public.\n  Do we want to cut the money for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and others that are supposed to be regulators protecting \nconsumers, and say let the buyer beware? I don't think so.\n  Fiscal policy has to be sensible and thoughtful. Tax cuts are fine. \nIf you can afford tax cuts, that is fine. But when you face deficits as \nfar as the eye can see, should this Government say: Let's send our sons \nand daughters to war and, by the way, we won't pay for it? And when you \ncome back, what we will do is increase the Federal debt by $1 trillion \nand say, as soon as you take your uniform off, you have to help pay the \ndebt, because we wouldn't pay it, or your children and grandchildren \nwill have to pay it because we wouldn't?\n  We are talking about implementing tax cuts that predominantly benefit \nthe upper income people, to such an extent that if you were lucky \nenough to earn $1 million a year, you would get an $80,000 a year tax \ncut. Is that a priority?\n  Warren Buffett, the second richest man in the world, said he didn't \nsupport it because he said it favors the rich. That is what the second \nrichest man in the world said about the President's tax plan. Is that \nwhat we ought to embrace when we are deep in debt, and headed deeper in \ndebt, and about to vote on a $1 trillion increase in the Federal \ndebt? I do not think so. There are some activities in Government that \nare important. I mentioned schools and roads. There are activities we \nperform of which we are proud and of which we should be proud.\n\n  I once visited a Communist country. It was a country with which we \nwere doing business. I met with the American Chamber of Commerce in \nthat Communist country. Do you know what their message was? Their \nmessage was this is a great market for us to tap, but the problem is we \nneed more government in this country to do business.\n  I said: What do you mean by that? They said: You cannot do business \nunless you have a judicial system that can sort out the disputes, \nunless you have a system of administrative practices in which you have \nreferees and regulators. If you do not have that government, the \nmechanism that establishes the rules and makes sure the rules are \nfollowed, you cannot do business. You just cannot.\n  I said this is really interesting because normally the Chamber of \nCommerce would not be calling for more government, but they are saying \nthat in this Communist country, government is essential for us to do \nbusiness.\n  We ought to remember that in this country as well--whether it is the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, you name it--there are structures and processes that are \nimportant for the governance of this country, and to decide they do not \nmatter is to suggest our system does not matter. It is to say, let the \nbuyer beware. Let the Enrons run wild and overcharge consumers by \nbillions, and it does not matter.\n  That is not the kind of government I want. I want a government that \nallows the system to work, that helps establish fair rules and enforces \nthem.\n  I mentioned we have these proposals for tax cuts that are very large \nat a time when we have very large Federal budget deficits. There are \nthings we can do. A, we can cut wasteful Federal spending, and B, we \ncan go after the tens and tens of billions of dollars that are not paid \nto this country in taxes because the companies that make a lot of money \nselling products to the American consumers have decided they are going \nto locate in tax-haven countries but take advantage of the American \nmarketplace to generate their profits.\n  If it is the case that $50 billion or $70 billion would otherwise be \nowed to this country in taxes but are not paid because those companies \nhave located in tax-haven countries, then this country should take a \nlook at doing something about it and say to them: If you want to be an \nAmerican citizen, part of the responsibility of citizenship is to help \npay the bills in this country, to help pay for that which makes this \ncountry great--our schools, our roads, our infrastructure, everything \nthat makes this a great place in which to live.\n  I think that is an area we ought to be tackling and trying to solve \nsome problems. I would hope perhaps rather than just talk about tax \ncuts for the upper-income people, we might talk about tax \nresponsibility for some corporations that have decided they do not want \nto be a part of American citizenship anymore.\n  My solution to all these companies that have decided they do not want \nto be an American citizen is, if you want to go to Bermuda, that is \nfine. If you get in trouble somewhere around the world and some \ngovernment is about to expropriate your assets, who are you going to \ncall? Call the Bermudan navy. I think they have 36 people in the \nBermudan navy. Call them out. If you do not want to be an American \ncitizen, then do not ask the American military forces to protect your \ninvestment around the world.\n  That sort of behavior is not, in my judgment, something that is very \npatriotic, and it is something that requires, in my judgment, this \nCongress to do something about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5698-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5698-S5699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to ask another question. Why do we \nhave a ceiling on Federal indebtedness? The answer is because we want \nto try to control it. But there is another form of indebtedness for \nwhich there is no ceiling, and that is the trade debt. There is \ndefinitely no ceiling on that.\n  We have a foreign trade debt of about $2.8 trillion at the moment. \nEvery single year, there is more and more red ink. There was a $470 \nbillion trade debt, merchandise trade deficit in 2002. Overall, $2.8 \ntrillion deficit is now about 27 percent of our GDP? How does that \nhappen?\n  The foreign debt comes from record foreign trade deficits. We are the \nbiggest debtor in the world. As one can see by this chart, we run a \ndeficit every year, and every year it grows. One-fourth of the trade \ndeficit is with China; $103 billion last year alone. China is not the \nonly country. We have deficits with Canada, $50 billion a year; Mexico, \n$37 billion a year. We have deficits with every major European country \nexcept Belgium and The Netherlands. We have deficits with every major \nAsian country except Singapore, and we are about to fix that because we \nare doing a free trade agreement with Singapore, and I am sure we will \nturn that into a trade deficit quickly. We have deficits with all the \nmajor countries in Latin America.\n  In addition to having deficits with the countries, let me talk about \nhow our deficits are constituted: A $110 billion deficit in motor \nvehicles; a $47 billion deficit in consumer electronics; a $58 billion \ndeficit in clothing. I have been on the floor many times to talk about \nvehicles, so I will not do that today except to say, to use Korea as an \nexample, Korea sends over 600,000 Korean automobiles every year; some \n600,000 Korean cars come in to this country.\n  We sell 2,800 cars into the country of Korea. Why? Because our market \nis wide open, and the Korean market is largely closed, and nobody has \nthe spine, the backbone, the nerve, or the will to do much about it. \nThat is always the problem.\n  If you want to use potato flakes from the United States to make fast \nfood in Korea, the potato flakes will find a 300-percent tariff going \nin to Korea.\n  The fact is, we have big problems in a range of areas and nobody does \nmuch about it. We used to have a big surplus in meat. That surplus \ndeclined by $1 million last year. Our deficit in livestock trade \nreached $1.5 billion last\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nyear. Our deficit in vegetables and fruits reached $2.5 billion last \nyear.\n  These deficits come from a very simple fact: Our markets are open to \nforeign products; foreign markets are closed to ours. Too often the \nproducts that flood into this marketplace are products made by 12-year-\nolds working 12 hours a day being paid 12 cents an hour, and it is not \nfair trade.\n  Let me use Bangladesh as an example. The fourth largest producer of \ngarments for the U.S. market is Bangladesh. Workers in Bangladesh get \npaid on average 1.6 cents for every baseball cap they sew, under \ncontract to an Ivy League school. That same baseball cap for which a \nworker gets 1.6 cents to sew is sold on the campus of this particular \nIvy League college for $17.\n  Each year Americans buy over 900 million garments made in Bangladesh, \nand yet workers in Bangladesh still cannot make the 34 cents an hour \nthey need as basic subsistence.\n  If workers in one of the poorest countries of the world cannot even \nget paid 34 cents an hour, how do U.S. workers and U.S. businesses \ncompete against that kind of trade?\n  Some say these trade deals are a way of getting other nations to \nimprove their labor and environmental standards, but the fact is, our \ntrade negotiators do not think about that and do not do anything about \nthat. If one needs evidence of that, take a look at the trade agreement \nthat was just negotiated with Singapore, which is going to come to the \nSenate floor at some point soon for a vote.\n  This agreement has a provision that would allow massive transshipment \nof products through Singapore into this country from countries with \nabysmal labor and environmental records.\n  How would that work? Article 3.2 of the agreement says the products \nmade in third countries will be treated as Singapore products as long \nas the products are on a list approved by U.S. trade officials, which \nincludes electronics, semiconductors, computers, cell phones, \nphotocopiers, medical instruments. This chart shows what it says in \nthat Singapore free trade agreement.\n  The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a paper saying \nin that Singapore agreement this provision could very well torpedo the \nentire agreement. This is what a former senior official at the \nDepartment of State on labor matters wrote about what has happened in \nIndonesia:\n\n       Government enforcement of child labor laws is weak or \n     nonexistent.\n       There is a long-standing pattern of collusion between \n     police and military personnel and employers, which usually \n     takes the form of intimidation of workers by security \n     personnel in civilian dress, or by youth gangs.\n\n  She quotes a State Department study which says:\n\n       Institutions required for a democratic system do not exist, \n     or are at an early stage of development.\n\n  So we have a free trade agreement with Singapore. And what happens \nwith that free trade agreement? What is going to happen is we will get \nproducts from Burma or Indonesia which go to Singapore and are \ntransshipped into this country. As long as they are going on the \nproduct list, what we are going to see is transshipment into this \ncountry of products coming from areas with abysmal records with respect \nto child labor and workers' rights.\n  This Senate has decided it would like to fit itself out with a \nstraightjacket by unwisely passing something called the fast track \nagreement. The President called it TPA, which was a euphemism for a \nfast-track agreement, I should say. Under fast track rules, trade deals \ncome to the Congress for an up-or-down vote, and there will be no \namendments offered under any circumstance. And this very flawed \nSingapore free trade agreement will come to the Senate under fast track \nrules.\n  The fact is, our trade negotiators don't care what happens after they \nnegotiate a trade deal.\n  We did a bilateral trade agreement with China a couple of years ago, \nand we did it so that China could then get into the WTO. Then China got \ninto the WTO. When they joined the WTO in November 2001, the Chinese \nagreed to significantly expand the amount of imported wheat that could \ncome into China at relatively low tariffs. China agreed that it would \nset a tariff rate quota of imported wheat at 8\\1/2\\ million metric \ntons. That meant 8\\1/2\\ million metric tons could enter the market at \nlow tariffs.\n  According to the CRS, the Congressional Research Service, the Chinese \nimports were less than 8 percent of that amount. In fact, the Chinese \nAgriculture Minister was reported in the South Asia Post saying: 8\\1/2\\ \nmillion metric tons does not really mean that is what we are going to \nbring into our country.\n\n  This is a country that has a $103 billion trade surplus with us, that \nreaches a trade agreement with us saying they are going to buy some of \nyour wheat but never really intends to. What do we do about it? Well, \nwe say it does not matter so much. Nobody is going to do too much about \nit.\n  It is unforgivable that this goes on. In fact, a U.S. trade official \nin charge of agricultural trade with China recently said China has not \nlived up to its promise. That official said the United States would be \njustified in filing a World Trade Organization case against China. The \nsame official said the evidence of unfair trade by the Chinese was \n``undeniable,'' and the Chinese themselves privately acknowledged they \nare cheating on agricultural trade.\n  This official said the administration is reluctant to take action \nagainst China because the Chinese might be offended. The official said \nthe administration is worried that a WTO case would be seen as ``in \nyour face'' so soon after China joined the WTO.\n  Well, what is in your face is what these trade officials are doing to \nfarmers, to workers, and to businesses all around the country. It is \nnot fair. In my judgment, we expect and demand that there be action to \nenforce trade agreements.\n  I believe my time is about up. I am going to speak at greater length \nabout China trade in the coming days, but I did want to say today that \nthis is an area that is desperately in need of attention by Congress \nand the administration.\n  And the Singapore trade agreement is a terrible agreement. We ought \nto pay some attention to that.\n  Finally, going back to where I started, this fiscal policy does not \nadd up. Everyone in the country understands it, and I hope when we talk \nabout the need to increase the Federal indebtedness by $1 trillion this \nSenate will ask itself: Does this make any sense at all?\n  The major subject before us is more tax cuts when we have the largest \ndeficits in history for the next 10 years and a requirement to increase \nthe Federal debt limit by $1 trillion.\n  I come from a really small town. We had a guy living there named \nGrampy. He knew everything about everybody and everything about \neverything. I always wondered what would Grampy think if you explained \nto Grampy where we are--deep in debt as far as you can see; a \nrequirement to increase the debt limit by $1 trillion; and the next big \nthing on the agenda is to cut your revenue, the benefit of which will \ngo largely to the upper income people.\n  I think Grampy from my hometown would say: Are you nuts? Can't you \nadd? This is not higher math. This does not add up for the country and \nwill not produce one new job. It will produce more despair, more \nconcern, and less economic growth.\n  Get your fundamentals right. Make things add up and put things back \non the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5699-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The hour of 12:45 having arrived, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. \n34, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Deborah L. \nCook, of Ohio, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is my great honor to come to the Senate \nfloor this afternoon to speak in favor of the nomination of Deborah \nCook to sit on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Deborah Cook is from Akron, OH. She is currently serving her second \nterm as an Ohio Supreme Court Justice, a post to which she was first \nelected in 1994.\n  I will take a few minutes to tell my colleagues in the Senate about \nJustice Cook and why I am so pleased this afternoon to support her \nnomination.\n  Justice Cook received her law degree in 1978 and an honorary doctor \nof law degree in 1996, both from the University of Akron. Prior to \nserving on the Ohio Supreme Court, she served on the Ohio Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth District from 1991 to 1994. And, from 1976 until \n1991, she worked for the Akron law firm of Roderick, Myers & Linton. \nShe was the first female associate hired by the firm, later becoming \nthe firm's first female partner.\n  Justice Cook is an excellent judge and a gracious and giving \nindividual who has dedicated a great deal of her personal time and \nenergy to helping the underprivileged in her community and in the State \nof Ohio. First, let me tell my colleagues a little bit about her work \nas a judge.\n  Justice Cook has been an appellate judge for over 12 years--4 years \non the Ohio Court of Appeals and over 8 years on the Ohio Supreme \nCourt. While Justice Cook was on the Ohio Court of Appeals, she \nparticipated in deciding over 1,000 cases. Overall, she had a very low \nreversal rate.\n  She has worked on hundreds of additional cases in the Ohio Supreme \nCourt. But rather than focus on these hundreds of cases, I would like \nto draw my colleagues' attention to just a small handful of Ohio \nSupreme Court opinions that have been considered by the United States \nSupreme Court, during Justice Cook's tenure. As my colleagues are \naware, the U.S. Court reviews few State supreme court cases.\n  But this statistic is still worth considering for Justice Cook. \nDuring her time on the Ohio Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court has \nreviewed five Ohio Supreme Court decisions and has agreed with Justice \nCook in all five of those cases.\n  One of those cases was simply a unanimous Ohio Supreme Court decision \naffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court 8 to 1. In the other four cases, \nJustice Cook has dissented in the underlying Ohio case. And, in each of \nthese four cases, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ohio Supreme \nCourts' majority opinion and reached the same conclusion as Justice \nCook.\n  These were not all just the close 5 to 4 decisions that we sometimes \nsee in the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, in a fifth amendment self-\nincrimination case, the Supreme Court sided with Justice Cook 9 to 0. \nAnother case went 8 to 1, again siding with Justice Cook's dissent. So \nit is clear from this record that Justice Cook's decisions have been \nwell founded.\n  Another useful gauge of a sitting judge's abilities is the \nevaluations she gets from objective observers who watch the court on a \nday-to-day basis.\n  In my home State of Ohio, the major newspapers closely watch our high \nCourt. After observing Justice Cook on the Ohio Supreme Court for a \nfull 6-year term, Justice Cook was endorsed by all the major newspapers \nin Ohio for her 2000 reelection campaign.\n  These newspapers included the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Columbus \nDispatch, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Akron Beacon Journal, the Dayton \nDaily News, and the Toledo Blade.\n  Here's what several Ohio papers have said about her nomination to the \nSixth Circuit. The Cincinnati Post wrote on January 8, 2003:\n\n       Cook is serving her second term on the Ohio Supreme Court, \n     where she has been a pillar of stability and good sense. Her \n     role on that court--one, which in the last few years, has \n     repeatedly marched on 4 to 3 votes into the realm of policy \n     making--has often been writing sensible dissents.\n\n  On December 29, 2002, insisting that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nact on Justice Cook, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote:\n\n       Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist--perhaps the brightest \n     on the state's highest court.\n\n  The Akron Beacon Journal wrote on January 6, 2003:\n\n       Those who watch the Ohio high court know Cook is no \n     ideologue. She has been a voice of restraint in opposition to \n     a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course, \n     acting as problem-solvers . . . more than jurists. In Deborah \n     Cook, they have a judge most deserving of confirmation, one \n     dedicated to judicial restraint.\n\n  And, the Columbus Dispatch wrote on January 6, 2003:\n\n       Cook's record is one of continuing achievement. . . . Since \n     1996, she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court, where she has \n     distinguished herself as a careful jurist with a profound \n     respect for judicial restraint and the separation of powers \n     between the three branches of government.\n\n  Mr. President, these quotes are from papers across the political \nspectrum--all of which endorsed Justice Cook. As these comments make \nclear, Justice Cook is a talented, serious judge who works diligently \nto follow the law. At the same time, she also dedicates a great deal of \nher time to volunteer work and community service.\n  Justice Cook has served on the United Way Board of Trustees, the \nVolunteer Center Board of Trustees, the Akron School of Law Board of \nTrustees, and the Women's Network Board of Directors. She was named \nWoman of the Year in 1991 by the Women's Network. She has volunteered \nfor the Safe Landing Shelter and for Mobile Meals. She has served as a \nboard member and then president of the Akron Volunteer Center.\n  Furthermore, Justice Cook has served as a Commissioner on the Ohio \nCommission for Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management, where she \nfocused on, among other things, truancy mediation for disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  She has chaired Ohio's Commission on Public Legal Education and has \ntaught continuing legal education seminars on oral argument and brief \nwriting. I find it remarkable that Justice Cook has found the time for \nthis level of commitment to her community--and I have yet to describe \nthe most amazing commitment Justice Cook has made to helping the \nunderprivileged in Ohio. Justice Cook believes that the ticket out of \npoverty is a quality education. And, over the years, in their everyday \nlives Justice Cook and her husband, Bob Linton, has come across hard \nworking young people who are making an effort to improve their lives \nthrough education.\n  Tashia Smith is one of those people. Justice Cook met her when Tashia \nwas struggling to put herself through college at Kent State by working \nas a waitress. Justice Cook assisted her with tuition for several \nyears. Today, Tashia is in her final year of nursing school, carrying a \n3.8 grade point average.\n  Tara King is another of these students. With Justice Cook's help, \nTara recently graduated from the University of Akron. She just enrolled \nin graduate school at Cleveland State University.\n  After helping several students in this manner, Justice Cook and her \nhusband decided they should structure their assistance so they could \nhelp more young people early on in their education.\n  A little over 4 years ago, they started the ``College Scholars'' \nprogram with a group of 20 disadvantaged third graders from an inner \ncity school. The students were selected to participate based on teacher \nrecommendations, financial need, and level of family support. Justice \nCook matched each of the students with a mentor in the community. The \nstudents meet with their mentors weekly and participate in other \nprogram activities.\n  If the students maintain good grades and conduct through secondary \nschool, Justice Cook and her husband will pay for 4 years of their \ntuition at any public university in Ohio. Let me repeat that--Justice \nCook is going to pay for 4 years of college tuition for 20 \ndisadvantaged children.\n  These activities demonstrate a commitment to the community and \ndedication to helping the disadvantaged that we would like to see in \neveryone. These are qualities that help make Justice Deborah Cook \na great judge on the Federal bench. It tells us what kind of a person, \nwhat kind of human being she is. For these reasons and the other \nreasons I have outlined, I urge my colleagues to support her \nnomination.\n\n  I add, on a personal note, I have known Justice Deborah Cook for many \nyears. She is a fine individual. She is the type of person that should \nbe on the Federal bench. She has a proven track record of fairness, of \ncompassion, of competence. I would not be on the\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nSenate floor today if I did not trust her. I would not have recommended \nher name to the President of the United States if I did not have the \nutmost confidence in her ability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any time on \nthe quorum call be taken off both sides at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I rise to address the nomination of \nDeborah Cook to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Senate, to express \nmy very deep concerns about the commitment of this nominee to the \ninterests of working families and to the underlying cause of fairness \nand justice.\n  I want to say at the outset that I have the highest regard for my \nfriend from Ohio, Senator DeWine. With his recommendations of a \nnominee, one has to give not only a first look but a second and a third \nbecause the good Senator is so highly regarded and respected here in \nthe institution. Certainly anyone he supports has a very heavy \npresumption in their favor because of the high regard we have for \nSenator DeWine. So I acknowledge that at the outset.\n  But I must say in reviewing the history of this nominee, there is a \npattern of decisionmaking that is of very deep concern for the Senate \nand for all of us who want to make sure those sitting on the courts of \nappeal are going to be fair to workers and workers' rights in that \ndistrict, that district which obviously has so many working families \nwhose rights need to be reaffirmed at different times.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the nomination of Deborah Cook \nto a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. \nHer record demonstrates the extreme length to which she will go to \nprotect corporations and deny the rights of injured workers, victims of \ndiscrimination, religious minorities, schoolchildren, and others. She \nis the leading dissenter on the predominantly Republican Ohio Supreme \nCourt, objecting repeatedly to decisions by that court that favor the \nrights of individuals. Often she stands alone as the only dissenter, \nand again and again her colleagues have criticized her for ignoring \nprecedents, for manipulating the law to reach the results she wants. \nHer record is extreme, even in comparison with her Republican \ncolleagues on the Ohio Supreme Court, and she consistently seems bent \non narrowing laws intended to remedy violation of the rights of \nindividuals.\n\n  In cases involving workers' rights, her record is among the worst we \nhave ever seen. Her defenders try to maintain a straight face when they \nsay she is only impartially enforcing the law, but more than any other \njudge on her court, she seems to think that the law should almost \nalways protect corporations and not injured workers. She consistently \ndissents from the majority and votes to protect corporations from \nliability when they harm their employees, and she has even tried to \nshield these corporations from liability when they attempt to cover up \ntheir malfeasance. The pattern is overwhelming.\n  In 37 cases she has supported the rights of employees only 6 times, \nand in all but 1 of those 6 cases she was joining a unanimous court. \nEven where a Republican majority on the court rules in favor of the \nemployee, she dissents almost 80 percent of the time. She has never, in \nany case we know of, dissented from a decision of the court in favor of \nan employee. In the majority of the cases where she dissents, she is \nthe only dissenter or is joined by only one other member of the seven-\nmember supreme court.\n  Her dissents take an extremely narrow view of workers' access to the \ncourts. On more than one occasion she would have protected employers \nwho were accused of lying to their employees. In one extreme case, in \nDavis v. Wal-Mart Stores, she would have penalized the employee when \nthe store had covered up evidence that the workplace was unsafe. In \nthat case, a Wal-Mart worker was killed operating a forklift at work. \nHe was unloading a truck with the forklift when the truck suddenly \npulled away from the loading dock. The forklift fell on him and crushed \nhim to death.\n  His wife brought a tort action to recover damages from Wal-Mart for \nher husband's death, and during the course of the proceedings on her \ncase, Mrs. Davis discovered that Wal-Mart might have withheld evidence \nand provided false and misleading testimony. Wal-Mart representatives \nhad denied under oath that they were aware of hazardous conditions at \nthe loading docks, and had denied knowledge of incidents similar to \nthose that caused her husband's death. As it turned out, Wal-Mart had \nimproperly concealed documents on similar accidents and had instructed \nits representatives to lie about them.\n\n  If Mrs. Davis had obtained this information sooner, she would have \nprevailed on some of her claims at the initial trial. With this new \nevidence, she filed a new claim, in which she alleged that the \ncompany's concealment, destruction of evidence and perjury had been \nused to limit her recovery on her prior claims. All except one of the \nmembers of the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Mrs. Davis's claim that \nWal-Mart had concealed and distorted evidence could proceed. One \nJustice said that concealing evidence as Wal-Mart did ``harms the \nsanctity of the judicial system and makes a mockery of its search for \nthe truth.''\n  Deborah Cook was the only member of the court to dissent from the \nholding that the case should proceed. She was the only member of the \ncourt to conclude that the company was not accountable for its \nmisrepresentations of the evidence. Incredibly, her dissent would have \nhad the effect of rewarding an employer who lied to cover up its wrong \ndoing.\n  Similarly, in Norgard v. Wellman, Cook wrote a dissent that would \nshield from liability an employer who lied to its employees about their \nexposure to beryllium on the job. Beryllium is a toxic chemical that \ncauses a serious chronic illness, and exposure to it can be deadly.\n  The worker in the case developed the disease. The company assured him \nthat he was fine even though it had found through its examinations that \nhe had a heightened sensitivity to beryllium. The company knew that its \nworkers were being exposed to beryllium at the particular job site, and \nthat they were becoming ill from the exposure, but the company \nconcealed these facts from its workers. When the worker learned that \nthe company had withheld information about exposure levels, air-\nsampling and ventilation problems in the workplace, he filed a lawsuit.\n  When the case came before the Ohio Supreme Court, the issue was \nwhether the suit had been timely filed. The supreme court held that the \nsuit was still timely, because his employer had concealed the beryllium \nexposure. It ruled that the time to bring suit begins to run not at the \ntime when the worker becomes ill, but when he learned of his employer's \ndeceit.\n  Cook, however, rejected this sensible approach. She said that the \nperiod to file the suit began to run when the employee had first become \nill--even though at that time the employee could not have known that \nhis illness was caused by his unsafe workplace. Under Cook's approach, \nworkers would be responsible for knowing whether or not their employers \nare lying to them. In her view, if an employer deliberately conceals \ninformation about safety violations, the worker has no effective \nremedy.\n  Another shameful example of Cook's willingness to strip workers of \ntheir legal protections is the case Petrie v. Atlas Iron Processors \nInc. Petrie\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nworked in a scrap-yard, and some of the yard's conveyor belts were in a \nfenced-in enclosure. Petrie was removing ice and debris from one of the \nmachines when his glove was caught in the moving conveyor belt, and his \nfinger was cut off.\n  Petrie sought additional workers' compensation on the ground that his \nemployer had violated specific safety requirements. Under Ohio law, he \nhad a claim only if the yard's fenced-in enclosure could be considered \na ``workshop.'' The Ohio Supreme Court found the answer so obvious that \nit wrote only a brief three-paragraph opinion holding that the area was \na workshop and Petrie could proceed with his claim.\n  Cook, however, wrote a two-page dissent--joined only by one other \njustice--insisting that because the machine was not ``within a \nbuilding,'' it was not a workshop and the employee was not entitled to \nthe protection of state safety rules. The cases Cook cited, however, \ndid not hold that outdoor factory work was exempt from workshop safety \nrules. Nevertheless, Cook would have held that a scrapmetal conveyor \nbelt in a fenced-in area, is not subject to workplace safety \nprotections, just because there is no roof over this employee's head.\n  There are many other examples of Cook's attempts to limit workplace \nprotections. She has opposed allowing employees fired for reporting \nviolations of federal occupational safety and health laws to sue under \ncommon law and statutory whistleblower protections. She wrote a lone \ndissent in the case of a railroad worker who had been repeatedly \nharassed and threatened on the job and required to work under unsafe \nconditions. The issue was whether the worker could bring suit under the \nFederal Employers' Liability Act. Cook alone would have barred the \nsuit, despite the clear language of the statute.\n  No Senate should confirm a judge so consistently hostile to \nprotections for workers injured or killed on the job. In 2001, there \nwere 5.2 million occupational injuries and illnesses in the private \nsector, and 6,000 deaths. Many workers in the four states covered by \nthe Sixth Circuit--Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee--are \nemployed in manufacturing jobs. Often, the workers in such jobs are \nexposed to a high risk of injury or death in the workplace.\n  The nation has made genuine progress in reducing injuries and \nfatalities, but only through careful enforcement of Federal and State \nsafety standards. We rely on the courts to uphold these safety laws and \ngive injured workers the chance to obtain compensation for their \ninjuries. Yet Cook seems bent on denying workers their day in court \nwhenever she can.\n  Cook has also tried to limit the ability of students in public \nschools to vindicate their right to an adequately funded public \neducation. The Ohio Constitution, like many State constitutions, \nguarantees all students what is called a thorough and efficient public \neducation. In many states, public schools are severely underfunded, \npartly because of heavy reliance on local property taxes to fund \neducation often leads to gross disparities in funding between school \ndistricts.\n  In litigation challenging the constitutionality of Ohio's educational \nfunding system, the Ohio Supreme Court found that many students were \nattending schools in dangerous disrepair and failed to meet minimum \nsafety requirements. Half of Ohio's schools had unsatisfactory \nelectrical systems, 70 percent lacked adequate fire alarm systems, and \nmore than 80 percent lacked proper heating systems. In one school \ndistrict, 300 students were hospitalized when carbon monoxide leaked \nout of heaters and furnaces. In another district, elementary schools, \nmore than 100 years old, had floors so thin that a teacher's foot went \nthrough the floor.\n  In another school, students were breathing coal dust from the coal \nheating system. The system was in such disrepair that the coal dust \noften covered students' desks after accumulating overnight. In another \ndistrict, buildings were crumbling and chunks of plaster were falling \nfrom the walls and ceilings. In some districts, classes were held under \nleaking roofs and in former coalbins. Funding of teachers and supplies \nwas also inadequate. Some districts had to ration basic supplies such \nas paper and chalk and even toilet paper.\n  The majority of the Ohio Supreme Court found that ``school districts \nwere starved for funds, lacked teachers, buildings and equipment, had \ninferior educational programs, and their pupils were being deprived of \neducational opportunity.'' The majority of the supreme court found \nthat.\n  The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the education funding system was \nunconstitutional and had to be changed, but not Ms. Cook. She \ndissented. Despite the shameful conditions in some schools, and the \nlarge disparities that existed between school districts, she insisted \nthat Ohio citizens did not have a right to go to court to enforce the \nState constitution's guarantees. On at least four separate occasions, \nshe dissented from the majority of the court which has repeatedly ruled \nthat the legislature must fill the Ohio Constitution's commitment.\n  In her view, the courts had no authority to define the scope of the \nOhio Constitution's provisions on funding education. She says that as \nlong as the legislature provides at least some funding, the \nconstitution is satisfied. As the court's majority has said:\n\n       [D]eference to the corresponding branches of government \n     does not mean abdication.\n\n  The court's majority specifically criticized the dissent failing to \nface up to the evidence of the school problems. As the court majority \nwrote:\n\n       The dissent recognizes that it could not in good conscience \n     address these facts and then conclude that Ohio is providing \n     the opportunity for a basic education. Therefore, it does the \n     only thing that it could do: it ignores them.\n\n  Few issues are more important to the future of our country than \nensuring a good education for our children. Courts, of course, do not \nhave the principal responsibility to remedy all these problems. But a \nmajority of the Ohio Supreme Court clearly ruled that the State \nconstitution gave the Ohio courts a role in assuring that a State \nprovides a basic education to its children. But Cook said no, as she \nalways tries to do in such cases.\n  In another basic area discrimination case, Cook again seeks to narrow \nremedies and reverse jury awards. The Nation has made great progress in \ncombating discrimination against minorities and women, but \ndiscrimination and harassment continue to exist. Victims of \ndiscrimination rely on courts to remedy such discrimination when other \navenues have failed.\n  Cook has joined dissents to protect employers from liability in \nharassment cases, no matter how flagrant the violation. She has voted \nto reverse jury verdicts for employees in age discrimination cases and \ngender discrimination cases, despite the high presumption of the \nvalidity of those verdicts on appeal and the clear and abundant \nevidence of discrimination.\n  In a case on religious freedom, she adopted a position opposed by all \nof her colleagues on the court. A Native American employee of a State \nagency was asked to cut his hair by his employer. His religious beliefs \nprevented him from doing so, and he tried to be accommodating by \npinning his hair under his cap. The Ohio Supreme Court accepted that \naccommodation, but Cook alone dissented. Despite previous Ohio Supreme \nCourt decisions, Cook wanted a higher standard before plaintiffs could \nprevail in cases involving violations of religious freedom.\n  For reasons such as these, Cook's nomination has generated intense \nopposition from groups that know her record and that represent women, \nracial minorities, labor, and consumers. I have more than 100 letters \nin opposition. I ask unanimous consent to have relevant material \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Employment Lawyers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                 January 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: I am writing as President of \n     the National Employment Lawyers Association to urge the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Justice Deborah Cook's \n     nomination for appointment to the Sixth Circuit Court \n     Appeals. NELA is\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\n     the country's only professional organization that is \n     exclusively comprised of lawyers who represent individual \n     employees in cases involving employment discrimination and \n     other employment-related matters. NELA and its 67 State and \n     local affiliates have more than 3000 members. The Ohio \n     Employment Lawyers Association is among NELA's largest \n     affiliates.\n       Justice Cook's record and temperament display all the \n     characteristics of a bad judge. She is dogmatic, often in an \n     unprincipled manner, insensitive and biased in her decision-\n     making. Our Ohio affiliate joined several other statewide \n     organizations in opposing Justice Cook's nomination. I have \n     attached a copy of the letter these Ohio organizations have \n     sent to the Committee. Their description of Justice Cook is \n     apt:\n       ``What is most striking about Justice Cook's career on the \n     bench, particularly her tenure on our state Supreme Court, is \n     her heartlessness. She repeatedly displays a cold \n     indifference to the most tragic situations confronted by the \n     individuals who appear before her. Worse, she routinely \n     adopts strained or extreme legal propositions to deny \n     meaningful relief to those most in need of justice from our \n     courts. Her body of opinions demonstrates that she lacks the \n     compassion, sensitivity and legal integrity which are the \n     hallmark of a jurist who enforces both the letter and spirit \n     of the law. Any objective reading of her decisions, makes it \n     clear she is not a fair-minded judge.''\n       Although this letter is sent in my capacity as president of \n     NELA, I also write as an Ohio lawyer who has appeared before \n     the Ohio Supreme Court many times during my 27 years of \n     practice. I have represented a wide array of individuals and \n     organizations in the Court both before and during Justice \n     Cook's tenure as a Justice. Justice Cook's anti-civil rights, \n     anti-worker and anti-consumer record on the Court is \n     unparalleled.\n       Justice Cook is the most frequent dissenter (often the lone \n     dissenter) on a Court consisting of five (5) Republicans and \n     only two (2) Democrats. Justice Cook has taken the position: \n     (1) that even overt racist, sexist and ageist statements and \n     epithets are irrelevant in most discrimination cases. See \n     Byrnes v. LCI Communications Holdings Co. (1996), 77 Ohio St. \n     3d 125, 672 N.E. 2d 145; (2) that blind people are not \n     qualified because of their disability to go to medical school \n     notwithstanding the testimony of successful blind \n     practitioners to the contrary. See, Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n. \n     v. Case Western Reserve University (1996) 76 Ohio St.3d 168, \n     666 N.E.2d 1376; (3) that an employer cannot be sued for \n     destroying, concealing or lying about evidence. See her lone \n     dissent in Davis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, dba Sam's Club \n     (2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 488, 756 N.E.2d 657; (4) that railroad \n     workers subjected to severe harassment, including threats of \n     serious physical injuries, cannot pursue a claim under the \n     Federal Employers' Liability Act. See her lone dissent in \n     Vance v. Consol. Rail Corp., (1995) 73 Ohio St.3d 222, 625 NE \n     2d 776; (5) that an employer can avoid liability by lying to \n     its employees about the presence of dangerous chemicals in \n     the workplace so that fatally affected employees will miss \n     applicable time limits for filing an action against the \n     employer. See Norgard v. Brush Wellman, Inc. (2002) 95 Ohio \n     St.3d 165; (6) that employers can disregard their own \n     handbooks and promises to their employees with impunity. See \n     her lone dissent in Wright v. Honda of America Mfg., Inc. \n     (1995) 73 Ohio St.3d 571, 653, N.E.2d 381.\n       In light of the letter signed by Denise Knecht, chairperson \n     of our Ohio affiliate, which reviews more of Justice Cook's \n     opinions in particular cases, I will not detail here the many \n     unfathomable and unjust votes and opinions issued by Justice \n     Cook.\n       At the request of our Ohio affiliate, my firm undertook a \n     study of all of the employment decisions which were decided \n     on the merits by the Ohio Supreme Court during Justice Cook's \n     tenure. The purpose of the study was to do a complete review \n     of Justice Cook's employment law record (including civil \n     rights cases) to measure the full extent of Justice Cook's \n     propensities in these cases. The review covered all \n     employment related cases other than workers' compensation \n     matters. The cases reviewed included discrimination actions, \n     intentional workplace torts, breach of contract suits, \n     promissory estoppel claims, whistle-blower cases, public \n     policy wrongful discharge cases and alleged violations of \n     statutes governing procedures for termination of public \n     employees.\n       During Justice Cook's tenure on the Court there were 37 \n     such employment cases in which the Court issued decisions on \n     the merits. Attached to this letter are the results of the \n     study. The study demonstrated the following about Justice \n     Cook's record: (1) Justice Cook has never dissented from any \n     decision of the Court favorable to an employer; (2) Justice \n     Cook dissented 23 times, in cases in which the Court ruled in \n     favor of an employee (or 79 percent of the time); (3) Justice \n     Cook only voted in favor of an employee on 6 occasions \n     (notably, 5 of those 6 cases were ``no brainers'' in which \n     the Court decision for the employee was unanimous); (4) \n     Justice Cook has voted in favor of an employee in only 1 case \n     in which there was a split vote of the Court in favor of the \n     employee (that case, not surprisingly, was a 6 to 1 decision \n     for the employee); (5) Of Justice Cook's 23 dissents from a \n     ruling in favor of an employee, she was either the lone \n     dissenter or joined by only one other Justice 61 percent to \n     the time; (6) Overall, Justice Cook voted in favor of \n     employers in 83 percent of the cases and, as noted above, her \n     few votes in favor of employees were almost always in cases \n     in which the Court was unanimous.\n       Both Justice Cook's actions and her words demonstrate that \n     she is not fit for a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. \n     As a state court judge she voted to weaken protections for \n     working Americans, undermined equal employment opportunity \n     laws and spurned the pleas of those who have suffered \n     catastrophic injuries caused by intentional misconduct of \n     their employers.\n       Judges must be fair-minded and impartial. Justice Cook \n     lacks both of these traits. Her hostile an extreme views \n     concerning laws governing the workplace have no place on the \n     Federal bench. Her nomination is a disservice to working men \n     and women. Her appointment will only serve to encourage \n     unscrupulous and prejudiced employers.\n       I will be happy to provide any further information that the \n     Committee may desire concerning Justice Cook's record.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Frederick M. Gittes,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The groups opposed to her nomination include the Ohio \nOrganization for Women, the National Employment Lawyers Association, \nand the AFL-CIO. Many of those who have written to oppose her are \nlawyers who have participated before her and are familiar with her \nrecord and approach. Their message is clear: Justice Cook displays a \nhostility to workers' rights, consumer rights, and civil rights, and \nshe lacks the fairness and balance we expect of our Federal judges.\n  Many of our Republican colleagues say that when we oppose nominees \nsuch as Cook, we are somehow obstructing the President's right to put \nhis nominees on the Federal courts. If fact, the Senate has confirmed \n120 of President Bush's judicial nominees--100 of them when Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. Today, our Federal courts have the lowest \nvacancy rate in more than a decade.\n  When nominees' records raise concern about whether they will be fair, \nwhether they will enforce Federal rights and protections, the Senate \ndoes have the constitutional right to withhold our consent. The \nConstitution is clear that the Senate's role is not simply to \nrubberstamp nominees. The Framers clearly intended to avoid vesting too \nmuch power in the President. The role of the Senate on Presidential \nnominations is one of the fundamental checks and balances in the \nConstitution. From the earliest days of the Nation, the Senate has \nexercised its duty of advice and consent, rejecting Presidential \nnominees it has found unsuitable.\n  Far too many of President Bush's nominees are controversial and \ndivisive. They are clearly part of a plan to pack the Federal courts, \nparticularly the courts of appeals, with judges who will advance an \nideological agenda that is hostile to civil rights, hostile to workers' \nrights, hostile to environmental protections, and hostile to the right \nto privacy and a woman's right to choose.\n  We in the Senate do not have to go along for the ride. We should have \nour constitutional responsibility to safeguard the independence of the \njudiciary, and to ensure that the courts are not stacked with judges as \na part of a White House master plan to tilt the Federal courts as far \nright as possible.\n  Deborah Cook's record demonstrates she lacks the fairness the Nation \nexpects from the judiciary, and I urge the Senate to reject her \nnomination.\n  I have a number of items. I will not take a great deal of time, but I \nwill read excerpts from a few of these letters. This one is from the \nNational Employment Lawyers Association.\n\n       I am writing as President of the National Employment \n     Lawyers Association to urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to \n     reject Justice Deborah Cook's nomination for appointment to \n     the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. NELA is the country's \n     only professional organization that is exclusively comprised \n     of lawyers who represent individual employees in cases \n     involving employment discrimination and other employment-\n     related matters. NELA and its 67 state and local affiliates \n     have more than 3000 members. The Ohio Employment Lawyers \n     Association is among NELA's largest affiliates.\n       Justice Cook's record and temperament display all the \n     characteristics of a bad judge. She is dogmatic, often in an \n     unprincipled manner, insensitive and biased in her decision-\n     making.\n\n  And he continues:\n\n       Justice Cook's anti-civil rights, anti-worker and anti-\n     consumer record on the Court is unparalleled. . . .\n       Both Justice Cook's actions and her words demonstrate that \n     she is not fit for a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. \n     As a State\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\n     court judge she voted to weaken protections for working \n     Americans, undermine equal employment opportunity laws and \n     spurned the pleas of those who have suffered catastrophic \n     injuries caused by intentional misconduct of their employers.\n       Judge's must be fair-minded and impartial. Justice Cook \n     lacks both of these traits. Her hostile and extreme views \n     concerning laws governing the workplace have no place on the \n     federal bench. Her nomination is a disservice to working men \n     and women. Her appointment will only serve to encourage \n     unscrupulous and prejudiced employers.\n\n  These are the organizations, the lawyers who represent workers who \nhave been suffered injury and have been discriminated against. This is \nthe national organization. This is as strong a letter as we have \nreceived in opposition to a judge by the lawyers who have represented \nworkers who have been before that court. That is a powerful commentary.\n  We also have a letter from the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers:\n\n       I write to you on behalf of the Academy . . .\n       Throughout Justice Cook's tenure, I and numerous other \n     Academy members have had a first hand opportunity to observe \n     Justice Cook's temperament, demeanor and decision making as a \n     member of the Ohio Supreme Court. Our observations of her \n     record demonstrate to our Association that Justice Cook is \n     willing to disregard precedent, misinterpret legislative \n     intent and ignore constitutional mandates in an effort to \n     achieve a result that favors business over consumers. Justice \n     Cook's personal background is from big business and she has \n     allowed her background to bias her decision making. She has \n     consistently in our view voted to limit citizens' access to \n     the courts and routinely articulated positions which would \n     leave members of the public without remedies.\n       In our view, Justice Cook is among the most conservative \n     activist justices who have served on the Court.\n       Our Court is viewed by most objective observers as moderate \n     and bipartisan. However, the Court does have extremely \n     conservative Republican members. Justice Cook is to the right \n     of all of them. She has authored 313 dissents, more than any \n     other Justice.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       Another reason for the Academy's concern about Justice Cook \n     stems from her decisions in the area of basic constitutional \n     rights. Justice Cook issued a sole dissent in a religious \n     free exercise case that would have seriously undermined key \n     rights provisions of our Ohio Constitution.\n       Another example of Justice Cook's lack of commitment to \n     constitutional principles, including due process, can be \n     found in the Bray v. Russell decision. In Bray, Justice Cook \n     dissented from a 5-2 decision striking a state statute which \n     empowered the patrol board add ``bad time'' to a prisoners' \n     sentencing punishment of misconduct occurring during \n     imprisonment.\n\n  It continues along:\n\n       . . . there is hardly a case in which Justice Cook does not \n     side with the insurance company over its policyholder no \n     matter how outrageous the circumstances.\n       . . . Justice Cook is not only out of touch with many of \n     the core values shared by most Americans but she lacks the \n     proper judicial temperament and a meaningful sense of \n     justice. She does not afford individual Ohioans a fair \n     opportunity to be heard by an impartial adjudicator. She \n     neither deserves nor is she qualified for a lifetime \n     appointment to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Her \n     presence on that Court would be even more harmful to the \n     public as she would turn many balanced panels toward extreme \n     positions which will jeopardize access to the courts, civil \n     rights and equal justice. For these reasons, we ask the \n     Committee to carefully study Justice Cook's decisions in \n     their entirety before any vote . . .\n\n  We have given some examples of cases. I may have the opportunity to \ndo that a little later in the afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during \nconsideration of the nomination, the time during all quorum calls be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I certainly have a great deal of respect \nfor my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. We have discussed this \nnomination in the Judiciary Committee. We are continuing our discussion \non the Senate floor today. I would like to respond to a few of his \ncomments.\n  My colleague has stated Justice Cook has been a dissenter on the Ohio \nSupreme Court. That certainly is true. She has been a dissenter. I am \nnot sure that is a sin. I am not sure that is a reason someone should \nnot be confirmed by this body. If that was the criteria for turning \nsomeone down, some of our greatest justices would not be on the Supreme \nCourt, would not have been confirmed, nor would be on the Federal \nbench.\n  Justice Cook has had five cases where the Ohio Supreme Court has been \nreviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. In all five of those cases, the \nOhio Supreme Court has agreed with Justice Cook. It is interesting that \nin four of those cases, Justice Cook was a dissenter. Yes, she was a \ndissenter in the Ohio Supreme Court. The case went up to the U.S. \nSupreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court said the majority on the Ohio \nSupreme Court was wrong. But Justice Cook, the dissenter, was right. So \nthe dissenter, Justice Cook, at least according to the highest Court in \nthis country, the U.S. Supreme Court, was right.\n  As I have outlined, for some of those decisions by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, it was not even a close call. So much for that horrible label of \nbeing a dissenter.\n  My colleague and friend from Massachusetts has talked about several \ncases. I would like to talk about them as well. As the man on the radio \nsays: ``to tell the rest of the story.''\n  It has been charged that in the case of Davis v. Wal-Mart, Justice \nCook voted to shield corporations from the legal consequences of their \naction. It has been asserted Justice Cook's dissent in that case would \nhave allowed Wal-Mart to get away scot-free. At least that seems to be \nwhat has been asserted. But that is simply not what the facts are. In \nfact, there were two separate legal actions in Davis v. Wal-Mart. We \nreally only hear about one.\n  In the first case, Justice Cook did not intervene, and Mrs. Davis \nreceived almost $3 million. In the second case, when Mrs. Davis \nattempted to get additional payment for the same event, Justice Cook \ndid vote against her position based on a well-known legal principle.\n  Let me tell the story. The facts in this case involved a terrible \nincident in which Mr. Davis, a Wal-Mart employee, was killed on the \nloading docks while at work. Mrs. Davis sued Wal-Mart, and she won. She \nwon a jury verdict of $2 million because there was evidence that Wal-\nMart had failed to provide a safe working environment for Mr. Davis. In \naddition, the trial court found Wal-Mart had attempted to hide evidence \nduring the trial and, as punishment for that, the trial court awarded \ninterest on the $2 million to Mrs. Davis covering the time from when \nthe case was first filed to the time when the jury found for Mrs. \nDavis.\n  Wal-Mart's appeal at the court of appeals failed. The Ohio Supreme \nCourt, including Justice Cook, declined to even consider Wal-Mart's \nappeal of that decision. So Wal-Mart was punished. Mrs. Davis had her \nday in court and won a significant verdict plus interest. That is what \nJustice Cook found.\n  As I noted earlier, the interest award was on the $2 million during \nthe entire time the case was pending. I believe it was about 4 years' \nworth of interest. I haven't done the math, but it must have been about \n$800,000 in interest during that period of time--roughly that. Justice \nCook did not affect that verdict in any way. So that was the first case \nin which Mrs. Davis received approximately $3 million, as she should \nhave.\n  The unfounded complaints about Justice Cook are based on a second \ncase against Wal-Mart that was filed by the plaintiff's lawyer. In the \nsecond case, the plaintiff's lawyer filed a new lawsuit claiming Wal-\nMart had covered up evidence during the first trial. Mrs. Davis lost \nher second case at the trial court because that judge found all the \nsupposedly new evidence was discovered during the original case, and \nWal-Mart had already been punished for covering up the evidence. \nSpecifically Wal-Mart had been punished by the award of that interest \nmoney, approximately $800,000.\n  So just to summarize, we have a case in which Wal-Mart engaged in \nwrongful conduct both at its workplace and in defense of a lawsuit. \nWal-Mart was then punished for wrongful conduct in both instances.\n  Justice Cook in no way interfered with any of that process or \npunishment. After the jury verdict and after the favorable decision on \ninterests were final, the plaintiff's lawyers tried to take a second \nbite of the apple. Not surprisingly, they lost the second case at the \ntrial court. The plaintiff's lawyers appealed the loss, and a majority\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\nof the supreme court overturned the trial court and ruled in favor of \nMrs. Davis.\n  The entire supreme court, including Justice Cook, agreed on the legal \nstandard to be applied that such new claims could be brought only if \nnew evidence of wrongful conduct was discovered. The majority of the \ncourt said, though, there was new evidence, but they never said what \nthey thought was new. In contrast, Justice Cook agreed with the trial \ncourt judge that there was no new evidence. So Justice Cook said there \nwas no new evidence and applied the well-known doctrine of res \njudicata. In other words, because the issue had already been decided, \nthe case could not be retried.\n  Reasonable people, reasonable jurists--a disagreement. Justice Cook \nand the trial court judge agreed; the rest of the supreme court were on \nthe other side. Somehow this agreement about a technical legal issue \nhas been turned into an argument that somehow Justice Cook was \nattempting to shield Wal-Mart and undercut the rights of the plaintiff \nafter Wal-Mart had already been ordered to pay Mrs. Davis $2 million \nplus interest.\n  Those are the facts. That is the rest of the story.\n  Let's turn to another case that was cited by my friend from \nMassachusetts, Norgard v. Brush Wellman. Norgard was another tragedy, a \ntragedy about an individual who contracted chronic beryllium disease \nwhile he worked for Brush Wellman. The facts of the case are egregious, \nespecially facts that Brush Wellman withheld information about the \ncauses of the disease.\n  The legal issue, however, was a simple one. It was a statute of \nlimitations case. A statute of limitations, of course, as we know, is a \ntime within which an individual has to file a claim. In Ohio, the \nstatute of limitations is, as it is in every State, set by the State \nlegislature. The statute of limitations for this type of case in Ohio \nset by the legislature is 2 years.\n  As in most States, there is an exception to the statute of \nlimitations called the discovery rule. That rule provides that the 2 \nyears does not start until an injured party discovers he is injured and \nknows the source of the injury.\n  In this case, the evidence before the court showed Mr. Norgard knew \nhe was injured and that his injury was caused by his exposure to \nberyllium at work. He knew that at the latest by August of 1992 when he \nwas formally diagnosed by a doctor.\n  Even though the company had tried to hide evidence from Mr. Norgard, \nin a legal sense, it really did not make a difference. He still knew \nabout his exposure by August of 1992. The company's conduct, though \nhorribly reprehensible, did not change the legal fact that Mr. Norgard \ndiscovered his illness and the source of his illness. Accordingly, the \n2-year statute of limitations required the lawsuit to be filed by \nAugust 1994. Instead, tragically, Mr. Norgard did not file his claim \nuntil 1997, more than 2 years after his time to do so expired. After \nthe case was filed, the trial court applied the statute of limitations \nand granted summary judgment against Mr. Norgard.\n  We know what summary judgment is. It is a ruling that rejects a \nparty's claim without even going to trial. Because summary judgment \ncircumvents the trial, under the law, a court can only grant summary \njudgment motions if it finds the claimant cannot possibly win even if \nit gives the plaintiff every benefit of the doubt.\n\n  In this instance, the court had to consider all the allegations \nagainst Brush Wellman to be true, including the allegations that Brush \nWellman outright lied to Mr. Norgard about his exposure to beryllium. \nThey had to accept those as true.\n  That is what happened in this case. The trial judge gave Mr. Norgard \nthe complete benefit of the doubt to which he legally was entitled. In \nspite of what we all think about this horrible conduct by Brush \nWellman, the trial judge thought he had no choice but to follow the \nlaws laid down by Ohio's legislature and grant summary judgment.\n  As I noted earlier, legally, unfortunately, it did not make a \ndifference that Brush Wellman had tried to hide the facts. Norgard \nstill knew about his exposure as a fact. So he still had to file his \nclaim by August of 1994.\n  The court of appeals unanimously upheld the trial court's decision. \nJustice Cook and two other Ohio Supreme Court justices simply applied \nthe statute of limitations and upheld the decisions of the trial court \nand the court of appeals.\n  A four-judge majority in the Ohio Supreme Court was troubled by the \nfacts of the case and decided to follow their policy preferences. The \nnew result was one that was favorable to the Norgard family.\n  This is what the Akron Beacon Journal had to say about the case:\n\n       In her dissent, Cook did not carry an ideological banner \n     cold heartedly proclaiming the company above all. She has \n     sided with workers in many cases. In this instance, she \n     followed the law. Justices do not have a task of changing the \n     statute of limitations. That job belongs to the legislature.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nAkron Beacon Journal editorial about this case.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Feb. 27, 2003]\n\n                            Cook and the Law\n\n       The demonization of Deborah Cook has reached full froth. So \n     much for assessing a judicial nominee on her record.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this \n     morning on the nomination of Deborah Cook to sit on the 6th \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Almost two years \n     have passed since she was first tapped by President Bush to \n     join the federal bench. The delay reflects understandable \n     payback from Democrats who watched strong nominees of Bill \n     Clinton linger for longer as Republicans played political \n     games. Unfortunately, part of the game played by both parties \n     and their allies involves the crude caricature (and worse) of \n     judicial nominees.\n       A fresh example of the distortion and even recklessness can \n     be found on today's Commentary page. Adam Cohen, an editorial \n     writer for the New York Times, delivers a slashing critique \n     of the Cook record as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court the \n     past eight years. Too bad his assessment lacks the necessary \n     context, let alone a full grasp of the issues at work in the \n     cases he discusses.\n       Cohen notes ``the predominantly Republican court'' and \n     later adds that Cook ``frequently breaks with her Republican \n     colleagues.'' The objective is to portray the justice, ``the \n     court's most prolific dissenter,'' as extreme, even for a \n     Republican court. Those who pay cursory attention to the Ohio \n     Supreme Court know that party labels do not tell the story of \n     recent years.\n       Two of the Republicans have been among the most liberal \n     members, siding regularly with the two Democrats to form a \n     majority in such areas as employment and tort liability law. \n     To say the court is predominantly Republican may be \n     convenient. It doesn't add to an understanding of Cook.\n       We have noted in the past our sharp disagreements with \n     Cook, especially in the landmark school-funding case. What \n     offends in the current confirmation process is the attempt to \n     demonize the Akron resident, arguing (as Cohen does) that \n     ``often she reaches for a harsh legal technicality to send \n     a hapless victim home empty-handed,'' that she shills for \n     ``big business and insurance companies.''\n       Actually, the description is funny, in view of the mish-\n     mash the ``bipartisan'' majority made of insurance law in the \n     state. Cook has been a frequent dissenter. That doesn't mean \n     she stands alone. Cohen addresses a half-dozen cases. In \n     four, Cook sided with the rulings of both the trial court and \n     the state appeals court. In the remaining two, she would have \n     upheld the trial court or the appeals court.\n       Were these courts reaching for ``a harsh legal \n     technicality''? Is there a vast right-wing conspiracy? Sorry, \n     not in Ohio. If anything, Cook and two Republican colleagues \n     (Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, ideologue?) often objected to \n     the majority departing from precedent, hardly a radical \n     position.\n       Cook critics overlook the majority opinion she wrote \n     rejecting the claims of employers and concluding that \n     punitive damages are available to workers who have suffered \n     discrimination in the workplace. The opinion reveals much \n     about the Cook judicial philosophy. She precisely examined \n     legislative intent in crafting the law.\n       That is the Cook familiar to many Ohioans. She gives great \n     deference to the legislature. She reflects the principle that \n     this is a nation of laws, not of men or women.\n       Who doesn't sympathize with David Norgard, a worker exposed \n     to beryllium on the job who has been ailing for two decades? \n     The issue before the Ohio Supreme Court was whether Norgard \n     filed suit within the statute of limitations. The majority \n     ruled he had. Cook dissented.\n       Cohen suggests Norgard knew little about his illness \n     because the company stonewalled. In truth, Norgard knew for \n     years. He sought advice about hiring an attorney. The trial \n     court dismissed his case on summary judgment. The appeals \n     court unanimously upheld the lower court. Cook objected to \n     the majority casting aside settled law on the statute of \n     limitations. Her interpretation followed the practice of \n     courts across the country.\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\n       The ruling of the Ohio Supreme Court in the case of Phyllis \n     Ruth Mauzy provoked cries of amazement in courthouses. Cook \n     dissented from the majority's far-flung and poorly reasoned \n     departure from the way Ohio and almost every other state \n     applied federal civil-rights law. Again, Cook wasn't by \n     herself. She argued the mainstream interpretation.\n       The impression promoted by Cohen is that Cook is results-\n     oriented, serving corporate masters, denying the little guy \n     his due. Read the cases cited in the Cohen column and many \n     others, and the conclusion is plain: Cook criticizes the \n     majority for bending the law to fit its desired result.\n       We share concerns about Bush nominees who ``will radically \n     reshape the federal judiciary for a generation'' (as Cohen \n     puts it). Jeffrey Sutton, another selected to sit on the \n     federal appeals court in Cincinnati, may give too little \n     deference to legislative intent. Its the argument that Cook \n     gives too much? A silly argument? It is almost as silly as \n     surveying the many Bush nominees and concluding that Cook \n     offers reason for Americans to be ``very worried.''\n       In this crowd, she is reassuring.\n       Other nominees deserve harsh words. Yet, in seeking to \n     demonize Cook, critics risk their credibility. When trouble \n     really enters the committee room, the howls will be dismissed \n     as the usual fare. That ill serves the federal judiciary. The \n     Adam Cohens could learn something from Deborah Cook. They \n     could argue their case more carefully.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. This case was not about Justice Cook standing up for big \nbusiness. This case was about a very specific legal question: The \nstatute of limitations for this type of lawsuit in Ohio. Justice Cook \ninterpreted the law as it was written by the Ohio Legislature. That was \nher job as a supreme court justice, and she did her job.\n  Whether we like the law or not, whether the legislature was right or \nnot, the justice followed the law, and that is a simple fact.\n  My friend from Massachusetts has talked about the school funding \ndecision, a case that in Ohio is referred to as the Rolf decision.\n  It may surprise my friend from Massachusetts and I may surprise some \nof my friends from Ohio when I say that I disagree with Justice Cook on \nthat case. I did not hear all the evidence, but I suspect if I had been \non the court, I probably would have ruled the other way. But I think my \nfriend is confusing what was really in front of the court because it \nwas a tough case.\n  The Ohio Supreme Court is not a superlegislature, and the decision in \nfront of the supreme court was not whether they liked the way Ohio was \nfunding the schools or whether it was the best way or whether it was \nthe fairest way or whether it was constitutional.\n  That, I would submit, was a very tough decision. The Ohio Supreme \nCourt talks about school funding in these terms and the obligation of a \nState. It says the State has the obligation to provide a thorough and \nefficient education for the children of the State. That is the \nconstitutional obligation.\n  In a similar case, I believe in 1979, if I have my date correct, the \nOhio Supreme Court had ruled that Ohio was providing a constitutional \neducation for all of the children. Most observers of the court, most \nobservers of education in Ohio would say that things had not gotten \nmore unconstitutional in that period of time since 1979. In fact, \npeople would argue that, if anything, it had gotten better as far as \nmore equity since 1979.\n  In a sense, Justice Cook's decision when she dissented was consistent \nwith prior decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court. So while she was \ndissenting in this case, while she was not in the majority, it was \ncertainly not an unreasonable decision. It was a decision that was \nconsistent with prior precedent of the court. So it was not a decision \nthat was in any way out of bounds.\n  I will speak later as our debate continues, but I conclude by again \ntalking about my great admiration for Justice Cook. I have known \nJustice Cook for many years. I know her as an individual. I know her as \na public official in the State of Ohio. She is a person of great \npersonal integrity and honesty. In the 2 years she has been nominated \nfor this position, I have had the opportunity to read many of her \ncases. The one thing that is very clear when one reads her decisions is \nthis is someone a person would want deciding their case, someone who \ndoes not have an axe to grind, someone who is very deferential, \nfrankly, to a legislature. I say to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who are concerned about activist judges, she is someone who I \nbelieve will be deferential, as she was to the Ohio Legislature, and \nwho will respect the authority of the legislative body; someone who \nwill be deferential within the proper constitutional framework and \nbounds to the U.S. Congress and who will understand the separation of \npowers between the different branches of Government. This is someone \nwith great integrity, great honesty, and someone who will be a fine \nFederal judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I listened carefully to the comments of \nmy friend, Senator DeWine. No one is suggesting in the cases that I \nmentioned, which were cases where she was a dissent, that they were \noverturned by the Supreme Court of the United States. I listened \ncarefully to his explanation of these cases.\n  To summarize very quickly, in the Wal-Mart case, it is difficult for \nme to understand how Cook's position in the Wal-Mart case is \ndefensible. Here is a widow who was trying to move forward on certain \nclaims but could not because Wal-Mart had hid the evidence, and Cook \nwas the only one who dissented. That is the bottom line. That is the \nbottom line of the case. She is the only one who dissented.\n  In the Norgard case, the employee did not know that he could sue and \nhe did not know he had a claim because the employer had lied. She \ndissented, making it harder for the employees to recover.\n  These are just two examples, but to come back to the earlier point, \nif we look over the history of her dissents, we will find that when the \nOhio Supreme Court dissented--or when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled for \nthe employees, which was not a great number of times, but whenever they \ndid, she dissented from that 80 percent of the time. Even when the \ncourt ruled for the employees, she dissented 80 percent of the time.\n  Justice Cook never dissented from any decision of the court when it \nfavored the employer. These are statistics. The examples I have cited \nare illustrative of a series of instances where the rights of workers \nwere not adequately recognized or respected and where she took a very \nextreme position, in many of these cases in isolation. In some, she was \njoined by other members.\n  I believe there is a consistency and a pattern of insensitivity in \nterms of workers' rights and workers' needs and the fairness to those \nworkers. That is what both the statistics very clearly demonstrate and \nwhat these cases themselves demonstrate.\n  The idea that one could do legal gymnastics to find out that when you \nhave the employer involved in actually lying to an employee, the \nemployee gets sick, the employer knows it is because of beryllium, does \nnot tell the worker that it is because of beryllium, and he finally \nbrings the case and only later on finds out that it is beryllium and \nthat the company has lied to him, for her to say he should have known \nhe was sick a long time ago, and the statute of limitations really went \non during that period of time, it is too bad that the employer lied to \nthat person, endangered that person's health, and disadvantaged that \nperson's health in a dramatic degree, and she finds a technicality and \nsays they might have been sick during the time, but even though the \ncompany knew that they could have been devastatingly sick and die from \nthis kind of toxic chemical, she looked for the very narrow niche in \norder to disadvantage the worker.\n  When one finds in the case at the Wal-Mart a coverup was taking place \nand then discovers in a second case that there was a whole diary where \nthe Wal-Mart had lied and then came back in, how Justice Cook could \neven at that time--and there was such deception and such deceit by the \ncompany--find a way to diminish the rights and the interests and the \nprotections of the workers seems to me to be well out of the \nmainstream.\n  We are talking about people who should be in the mainstream, and the \nstatistics do not indicate, when it comes to workers' rights and \nworkers' rights cases, that she is in the mainstream.\n  In age discrimination, in religious tolerance issues, I gave examples \nwhere she drew the line in a way that I think\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\nis outside of the common understanding or common interpretation of the \nlaw, and we are being asked to give a lifetime appointment to this \nindividual. It seems to me that we can find people to serve on the \nSixth Circuit who are going to be fair and balanced and are going to be \nin the mainstream in terms of their protection of workers' rights and \nthe workers themselves.\n  This nominee is clearly on the fringes in protecting workers' rights. \nThis circuit court has an enormous responsibility of protecting workers \nin a major industrial area of our country, and those rights need to be \nprotected when those plaintiffs are up before the judge; they are going \nto look up at the judge and say: I know from the background, I know \nfrom the Senate hearings I am going to get a fair shake. We have the \nlist of letters and reports, all from the representatives of workers, \nthat say they do not believe they will ever get a fair shake. Are they \nall out of common sense? All these notes and letters representing \nworkers in cases where they have been short shrifted, are they out of \nthe mainstream? I don't believe so.\n\n  Those who come before our committee should be able to meet the \nrequirement of fairness in the range of different constitutional \nissues. They ought to understand what the constitutional issues are, \nand they ought to have a record of fairness and balance in interpreting \nthose. I do not believe this nominee meets that requirement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to speak on \nbehalf of Deborah Cook, an exceptional lawyer and a longtime friend \nfrom the State of Ohio. The President nominated her to serve on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on May 9, 2001, 2 \nyears ago. In fact, I was at the White House when President Bush \nnominated Deb, and I remember how enthusiastic he was about her record, \nnot only as a distinguished judge but as a dedicated volunteer and role \nmodel in her community.\n  Now, 2 years later, we are finally voting on her nomination. I am \nextremely disappointed at the length of time it has taken for this \nhighly qualified nominee to reach the floor but am grateful that this \nday has come.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Deborah Cook for over 25 years. \nShe is not only a brilliant lawyer but a wonderful person. She \ngraduated from the University of Akron School of Law in 1978 and \nimmediately went to work for the law firm of Roderick, Myers & Linton, \nAkron's oldest law firm. She was the first female lawyer to be hired by \nthis firm, and 5 years later, in 1983, she became its first female \npartner.\n  Deborah remained at Roderick Myers until 1991 when she was elected to \nOhio's Ninth District Court of Appeals. She remained on this bench \nuntil 1995 when she successfully won election to the Ohio Supreme \nCourt, an office she continues to hold.\n  Deb has always devoted her life to her family, community and \nprofession. Married to Robert Linton, Deborah has always acted on her \nbelief that a member of the bar and judiciary has responsibilities to \nthe community. In this regard, she has given generously of her time to \nthe Akron Women's Network, Akron Volunteer Center, the University of \nAkron School of Law Intellectual Property Advisory Council, Summit \nCounty United Way, and the Akron Art Museum, to name just a few.\n  In 1999, Deb and her husband established a foundation, \nCollegescholars, Inc., with their own private funds to foster the \neducation of underserved public school students and encourage them to \nseek higher education. Students were selected upon finishing third \ngrade based on teacher recommendations, financial need and family \nsupport of the program. This group of students is promised a 4-year \ntuition scholarship to any public university in Ohio. The students, \ncalled ``scholars,'' remain eligible for the scholarship by maintaining \ngood grades and conduct and participating with the other college \nscholars in activities organized for their benefit, including a one-\nhour, instructed mentor meeting weekly during the school year.\n  Deb has always recognized that she has a responsibility to help \nstrengthen the legal profession and honors this responsibility through \nher work with the Ohio and American Bar Associations. She chaired \nthe Commission on Public Legal Education, was a member of the Ohio \nCourts Futures Commission, and the Ohio Commission on Dispute \nResolution and Conflict Management. She is a past president of the \nAkron Bar Association Foundation, a fellow of the American Bar \nFoundation, and was a member of the Akron Bar Association disciplinary \ncommittee from 1981 to 1993.\n\n  Throughout these past 25 years, I have found Deborah Cook to be a \nwoman of exceptional character and integrity. Her professional demeanor \nand thorough knowledge of the law make her truly an excellent candidate \nfor an appointment to the Sixth Circuit. Deb has served with \ndistinction on Ohio's Supreme Court since her election in 1994 and \nreelection in 2000.\n  My only regret is that with her confirmation to the Sixth Circuit, we \nwill lose an outstanding justice on the Supreme Court of Ohio. However, \nshe will be a tremendous asset to the Federal bench.\n  With 10 years of combined appellate judicial experience on the Ohio \nCourt of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court, Deborah Cook also \npossesses a keen intellect, a record of legal scholarship and \nconsistency in her opinions. She is a strong advocate of applying the \nlaw without fear or favor and of not making policy towards a particular \nconstituency. Deborah Cook is committed to upholding the highest \nstandards of her profession and she is a trusted leader. It is my \npleasure to give her my highest recommendation for this nomination.\n  When it was announced that Deb was nominated by the President, the \nresponse from the major newspapers in our State was wonderful and \namazing. Newspapers from all over Ohio have echoed my sentiments.\n  In January 6, 2003, the Columbus Dispatch stated that:\n\n       Since 1996, she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court, where \n     she has distinguished herself as a careful jurist with a \n     profound respect for judicial restraint and the separation of \n     powers between the three branches of government.\n\n  On December 29, 2002, the Cleveland Plain Dealer stated that:\n\n       Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist--perahaps the brightest \n     on the state's highest court.\n\n  In a May 11, 2000 editorial the Beacon Journal newspaper stated that \nwhat distinguishes Deborah Cook's work:\n\n     has been a careful reading of the law, buttressed by closely \n     argued opinions and sharp legal reasoning.\n\n  In addition to newspapers, Deb Cook has a bevy of other supporters.\n  John W. Reece, retired Ohio jurist, stated:\n\n       Judge Cook and I served on the Ninth Judicial District \n     Court of Appeals in Ohio from 1991 to 1995. I believe we \n     became friends as well as colleagues, working closely \n     together although she was a Republican and I a Democrat. I \n     became impressed with Judge Cook's work ethic and legal mind. \n     She quickly became a talented Appellate Judge. In fact, in a \n     rather brief period of time she became a leader on the Court. \n     Later, when she was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court, I was \n     privileged to sit by assignment with her on the Court a few \n     times. She has exhibited an ability and willingness to be \n     an independent thinker and member of that Court.\n\n  William Harsha, Judge on the Ohio Court of Appeals, Fourth District, \nstated:\n\n       Always courteous and seldom impatient, she is the \n     antithesis of the ill-tempered despot that comes to mind when \n     one thinks of `black robe fever.' ''\n\n  Many of us have seen people change once they get on the Federal \nbench. J. Dean Carro, Director of the Legal Clinic at the University of \nAkron remarked:\n\n       I feel comfortable with expressing an opinion on the \n     qualities I like to see in judges. These qualities are \n     independence, intelligence, and integrity. Justice Cook \n     scores high in all three categories.\n\n  This Senator would like to add the characteristic of humility.\n  With the confirmation of Jeff Sutton last week and Deb Cook today, \nthe Sixth Circuit can begin to breathe a little easier. From 1998 up \nuntil September, 2002, the number of vacant\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\njudgeship months in the Sixth Circuit has increased from 13.7 to 91, \nthe highest in the Nation. In addition, during this same time period, \nthe median time from the filing of a notice of appeal to disposition of \nthe case in the Sixth Circuit was 16 months, well above the 10.7 months \nnational average, and the longest in the Nation.\n  Clearly, the Sixth Circuit is in crisis, and today's confirmation of \nDeborah Cook will go a long way toward restoring the court's efficiency \nand ability to deal with cases.\n  I am sure you will agree that Deborah Cook is exactly what we need on \nthe Federal bench.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in just a few minutes we will be voting on \nthe nomination of Justice Cook. I would like to take this opportunity \nto again talk to my colleagues about Justice Cook and to urge her \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  I have known Justice Cook for many years. She is a person of great \nintegrity. Senator Voinovich and I recommended her to the President. He \nnominated her. She is someone we both have known for many years. She is \nsomeone for whom we both have a great deal of respect.\n  I wish to take a minute to respond to the comments my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, made a few minutes ago. Let me say what a great \npleasure it is to work with Senator Kennedy. He and I have worked \ntogether on many pieces of legislation. Many times we have been on the \nsame side of the legislation. Unfortunately, we are opposed on this \nparticular nomination. It always is a pleasure to work with him. He is \nalways a great debater, always someone who is fun to be with. It is a \nreal pleasure to debate him on this issue.\n  My colleague came to the floor and talked about the Norgard case. I \nwish to remind my colleagues about the facts in the Norgard case.\n  Justice Cook was a dissenter in the Norgard case. The facts in the \nNorgard case, as I pointed out earlier in this debate, are very simple. \nIt was simply a statute of limitations case. So if any of my colleagues \nhave a problem with the outcome of this case, they should have a \nproblem with the Ohio Legislature.\n  The Ohio Legislature passed a 2-year statute of limitations. Norgard \nwas diagnosed with his disease in August of 1992. That is when he found \nout about it. Under the Ohio law, the statute started to run, the time \nlimits started to run in 1992. Tragically, he did not file his lawsuit \nuntil 1997. Obviously, more than 5 years had passed, much more than the \n2-year statute.\n  Another point my colleague from Massachusetts made was that Justice \nCook had not decided just a few cases in favor of employees. We did a \nquick search of the decisions.\n  We found at least 25 cases of employees, a long list. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Cases in Which Cook Ruled in Favor of an Employee\n\n       1.

Wagner v. B.F. Goodrich Co.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I hope my colleagues will have a chance to take a look at \nthat. It is long list of 25 different cases where Justice Cook ruled in \nfavor of the employee.\n  Finally, I ask that my colleagues take a look at an Akron Beacon \nJournal editorial of February 27. The Akron Beacon Journal is certainly \nnot the most conservative paper in the State. It is a very well-\nrespected paper. It is the paper that endorsed Al Gore for President, \nand endorsed Tim Hagan, the Democratic nominee for Governor, in the \nlast campaign. It responded in this editorial to an op-ed piece that \nhad been written on the editorial page by Adam Cohen, an editorial \nwriter for the New York Times.\n  In part, the Akron Beacon Journal stated:\n\n       A fresh example of the distortion and even recklessness can \n     be found on today's commentary page. Adam Cohen, an editorial \n     writer for the New York Times, delivers a slashing critique \n     of the Cook record as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court the \n     past eight years. Too bad his assessment lacks the necessary \n     context, let alone a full grasp of the issues at work in the \n     cases he discusses.\n       Cook critics overlook the majority opinion she wrote \n     rejecting the claims of employers and concluding that \n     punitive damages are available to workers who have suffered \n     discrimination in the workplace--\n\n  Referencing a case that Justice Cook wrote.\n  The Akron Beacon Journal continues:\n\n       The opinion reveals much about the Cook judicial \n     philosophy. She precisely examined legislative intent in \n     crafting the law. That is the Cook familiar to many Ohioans. \n     She gives great deference to the legislature. She reflects \n     the principle that this is a nation of laws, not of men or \n     women.\n       Who doesn't sympathize with David Norgard, a worker exposed \n     to beryllium on the job who has been ailing for 2 decades? \n     The issue before the Ohio Supreme Court was whether Norgard \n     filed suit within the statute of limitations. The majority \n     ruled he had. Cook dissented.\n       Cohen suggests Norgard knew little about his illness \n     because the company stonewalled. In truth, Norgard knew for \n     years. He sought advice about hiring an attorney. The trial \n     court dismissed his case on summary judgment. The appeals \n     court unanimously upheld the lower court. Cook objected to \n     the majority casting aside settled law on the statute of \n     limitations. Her interpretation followed the practice of \n     courts across the country.\n       Other nominees deserve harsh words. Yet, in seeking to \n     demonize Cook, critics risk their credibility.\n\n  I will add one comment of my own and that is we have researched the \nlaw and we would find that in the State of Massachusetts, their courts \nalso follow a fairly strict interpretation of the statute of \nlimitations, and we would expect if this case had been decided by the \ncourt in Massachusetts they would have come down on the same side as \nJustice Cook.\n  Justice Cook is a very fine justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. She \nwill do an excellent job on the Federal bench.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the last 10 \nminutes of this debate be evenly divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to use such time \nas I may consume as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 5 minutes on each side prior to \nthe vote on the nomination at 4:45.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider another controversial and \ndivisive judicial nomination, that of Deborah Cook to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Just last week we debated and voted on the \ncontroversial nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit. The \nvote on his confirmation received the fewest positive votes in almost \n20 years. Only 52 Senators voted in favor of his confirmation and \nappointment to the Sixth Circuit. This number demonstrates the serious \nopposition many conscientious Senators have to some of the extreme \nnominations this administration has been insisting be confirmed in its \ncontinuing effort to take ideological control of the Federal courts.\n  The nomination of Deborah Cook to be Judge Sutton's colleague on the \nSixth Circuit also presents many serious problems. I believe that it is \nimportant to make the record clear that her nomination has a unique \nprocedural posture, especially in light of the recent history of \nRepublican obstruction of President Clinton's nominations to that \nimportant court. These procedural controversies are in addition to \nsignificant substantive concerns raised by Justice Cook's record as an \nactivist State judge. Similar to Justice Priscilla Owen, Deborah Cook's \njudicial record is replete with evidence of results-oriented reasoning.\n  Similar to Priscilla Owen, Justice Cook has demonstrated herself to \nbe an activist judge. Justice Cook sits on a court that is numerically \ndominated by Republicans. Given the partisan politicization of the \njudiciary by Republicans over the last several years, one might expect \nthat Justice Cook would be part of the Ohio Supreme Court's majority in \nall but rare instances and that the two Democratic judges might be the \nmost frequent dissenters. However, Justice Cook is the most active \ndissenter on the Republican-dominated Ohio Supreme Court. She is the \nmost extreme of her colleagues and demonstrates an inability to reach \nconsensus with seemingly like-minded judges. I fear that if confirmed, \nher inability to reach a consensus would further polarize the Sixth \nCircuit, as well.\n  Justice Cook's dissents distort precedent, misinterpret legislative \nintent and demonstrate results-oriented reasoning in an effort to \nsuppress workers' rights. She has repeatedly voted to protect \ncorporations that have harmed or lied to employees. One example is \nBunger v. Lawson, where a convenience store employee who had been \nrobbed at gunpoint was denied psychological trauma remedies, while the \nemployer had failed to install basic safety features such as a working \nphone and door locks. Similar to Justice Priscilla Owen, Justice Cook's \nown Republican colleagues have criticized her extremist opinions. The \ncourt in Bunger called Justice Cook's interpretation of the law \n``nonsensical,'' and said that it, ``leads to an untenable position \nthat is unfair to employees.'' Taking the position adopted by Justice \nCook in her dissent would be, as the majority clearly stated, ``an \nabsurd interpretation that seems borrowed from the pages of Catch-22.''\n  Similarly, Justice Cook sought to deny workers compensation benefits \nto another employee in a case called Russell v. Industrial Commission \nof Ohio. In Russell, Justice Cook's dissent ignored the plain language \nof the statute and the relevant precedent regarding workers \ncompensation benefits. The Court's opinion stated that Justice Cook's \ndissent:\n\n       lacks statutory support for its position [and she] has been \n     unable to cite even the slightest dictum from any case to \n     support its view . . . . [the] dissent's argument, which has \n     not been raised by the commission, the bureau, the claimant's \n     employer, or any of their supporting amici, is entirely \n     without merit. Russell at 1073-74.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, is this the type of judge who should be given a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench?\n  As a former prosecutor, I am also troubled by Justice Cook's opinions \nthat repeatedly seek to disregard jury findings in powerful \ndiscrimination cases. Anyone who has ever tried a case to verdict \nbefore a jury knows how much time and effort goes into the lengthy \nprocess. For this reason, jury verdicts should be given the utmost \nrespect on appeal. In Byrnes v. LCI Communications, Justice Cook voted \nwith a 3-judge plurality to overturn a $7.1 million jury verdict for \nemployees in an age discrimination case despite powerful evidence of \nstatements made by the employer about the relative merits of having a \nyounger staff. Evidence in the plaintiffs' favor in this case included \nblatant statements from the employer that he wanted ``to bring in \nyoung, aggressive staff managers and change out the old folks,'' and \nthat ``some of the older folks there could no longer contribute.'' In \nByrnes, the jury also heard testimony that the employer said a certain \nworker was, ``too old to grasp the concepts that he was looking for,'' \nand that he did not, ``want old marathoners in my sales organization . \n. . I want young sprinters.'' These statements are directly relevant to \na jury's determination whether the employer engaged in age \ndiscrimination. Yet, Justice Cook demonstrated her lack of respect for \nthe jury's role in our system of justice by voting to overturn the \njury's determination. Unfortunately, this case is not an isolated \nincident. Justice Cook also voted to overturn jury verdicts in other \ndiscrimination cases such as Gliner v. St. Gobain Norton Industries and \nPerez v. Falls Financial Incorporated.\n  In addition to her apparent bias against workers' rights, Justice \nCook opposes the rights of consumers and victims even in the most \ncompelling cases. For example, in Sutowski v. Eli Lilly, Justice Cook \nwrote for a divided majority that denied plaintiffs the ability to \nclaim damage to their reproductive systems due to in utero exposure to \nDES, a drug known to cause cancer and reproductive disorders. She \ndenied these victims the ability to rely on the market-share theory in \ntheir complaints against the manufacturers even though the market-share \ntheory was virtually invented for DES cases where hundreds of companies \nmanufactured the drug but the victims could have no idea by whose drug \nthey were affected. Her colleagues in dissent severely criticized \nJustice Cook's opinion stating that she ``selectively quoted,'' from a \nprior Ohio case:\n\n       . . . to create the impression that the General Assembly is \n     the only appropriate body to recognize the market-share \n     liability theory in DES litigation. The majority then uses \n     that misguided impression as a platform for launching into a \n     tortured analysis of Ohio's Products Liability Act. It is \n     here that the majority's shell game becomes most deceptive.\n\n  In another case, Williams v. Aetna Finance, Justice Cook dissented \nfrom the majority's affirmation of the trial courts' holding that an \narbitration clause was unconscionable in a case involving a scheme to \ndefraud elderly African American home owners into home improvement \nloans at exorbitant rates.\n  These are just a few examples of the hundreds of cases that Justice \nCook has decided as a State court judge. They provide a picture of a \njudge with a proclivity for stretching the boundaries of precedent to \nrule against victims and workers in favor of corporations. On the \nsubstance of her record as a judge, I have concluded that Deborah Cook \nis a conservative activist who is hostile to consumers, victims, \nworkers and civil rights. The prospect of elevating this activist judge \nto a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench has generated a \nsignificant amount of controversy. We have received letters of \nopposition from many national organizations that represent labor and \nconsumers, as well as local citizens groups and law professors who \noppose her nomination to the Sixth Circuit.\n\n  Justice Cook's nomination was forced out of the Judiciary Committee \nover the objection of the Democratic Senators and in violation of our \nlongstanding Committee rules. The Democratic members of the Committee \nsought additional time to debate her nomination. Such requests have \nalways before been honored on the Judiciary Committee, which for 24 \nyears had a rule providing protection for minority rights to debate. \nRule IV requires the votes of 10 Senators to bring a matter to a vote \nand one of those votes to end debate must be cast by a member of the \nminority. In their determination to bring this controversial nominee to \nthe floor in February, Republicans unilaterally overruled the Committee \nrules by not allowing a vote to end debate\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nover the objection of Democratic Senators. Along with several other \nSenators, I voted ``present'' in protest of this violation of our rules \nand rights.\n  Over the last several weeks our Republican and Democratic Senate \nleadership has discussed the violation of Senators' rights that \noccurred on February 27. I thank them for their attention to these \nmatters and for working with us to address our concerns.\n  In addition, there is the serious matter of the mistreatment of \nprevious nominations to the Sixth Circuit by the Republican majority. \nDeborah Cook is nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a \ncourt to which President Clinton had an impossible time getting his \nnominees considered. For years, the Sixth Circuit has been one of the \nprime targets of Republicans intent on ideological court packing. \nDuring President Clinton's entire second term, not a single nominee to \nthe Sixth Circuit was allowed a hearing or a vote by the Republican \nmajority. Three highly qualified, moderate nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit, Judge Helene White, Kathleen McCree Lewis and Professor Kent \nMarkus, were all denied hearings and votes in the years 1997 through \n2001. Republicans today fail to acknowledge that the vacancies that \nhave plagued the Sixth Circuit in recent years are the result of their \ntactics to prevent any action on any of President Clinton's nominees.\n  Judge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals was nominated in \nJanuary 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her nomination during the \nmore than 1,500 days before her nomination was withdrawn by President \nBush in March 2001. Judge White's nomination may have set an \nunfortunate but unforgettable record. Her nomination was pending \nwithout a hearing for more than four years. She was one of almost 80 \nClinton judicial nominees who did not get a hearing during the Congress \nin which first nominated. Unfortunately, she was also denied a hearing \nafter being renominated a number of times over the next four years, \nincluding in January 2001.\n  Likewise, Kathleen McCree Lewis, a distinguished African American \nlawyer from a prestigious Michigan law firm was also never accorded a \nhearing on her 1999 nomination to the Sixth Circuit. This daughter of a \nformer Sixth Circuit judge and Solicitor General of the United States \nwas never accorded a hearing or vote by the Republican majority. Her \nnomination was withdrawn by President Bush in March 2001 without ever \nhaving been considered.\n  Professor Kent Markus was another outstanding nominee to a vacancy on \nthe Sixth Circuit. He had served at the Department of Justice and was \nnominated by President Clinton in 1999, but never received a hearing \nbefore his nomination was returned to President Clinton without action \nin December 2000. While Professor Markus' nomination was pending, his \nconfirmation was supported by individuals of every political stripe, \nincluding 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar Association and more \nthan 80 Ohio law school deans and professors.\n  As Professor Markus testified last year, he was told by Republicans \nthat some on the other side of the aisle held these seats open for \nyears for a Republican President to fill, instead of proceeding fairly \non the consensus nominees then pending before the Senate. The \nRepublican majority was unwilling to move forward, knowing that \nretirements and attrition would create four additional seats that would \narise naturally for the next President. That is how the Sixth Circuit \nwas left with eight vacancies, half of its authorized strength, in \n2001.\n  Had Republicans not blocked President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit, if the three Democratic nominees had been confirmed and \nPresident Bush appointed the judges to the other vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit, that court would be almost evenly balanced between judges \nappointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents. That is what \nRepublican obstruction was designed to prevent--balance. The same is \ntrue of a number of other circuits, with Republicans benefiting from \ntheir obstructionist practices of the preceding six and a half years. \nThis, combined with President Bush's refusal to consult with Democratic \nSenators about these matters, is particularly troubling.\n  Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about \nthe vacancies on the Sixth Circuit, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, \n1999 and 2000 implored the Republican majority to give President \nClinton's distinguished and moderate Sixth Circuit nominees hearings. \nThose requests, made not just for the sake of the nominees but for the \nsake of the public's business before the court, were ignored. Numerous \narticles and editorials urged the Republican leadership to act on those \nnominations. The growing vacancies on the Sixth Circuit were ignored by \nthe Republican majority.\n  The former Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee Chairman years ago to ask that the \nnominees get hearings and that the vacancies be filled. The Chief Judge \npredicted that by the time the next President was inaugurated, there \nwould be at least six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. In fact, there \nwere soon eight. Despite all these pleas, no hearing on a single Sixth \nCircuit nominee was held in the last three full years of the Clinton \nAdministration. Not one. The situation was exacerbated further as two \nadditional vacancies arose. And regrettably, despite my best efforts, \nthis White House has rejected all suggestions to redress the legitimate \nconcerns of Senators in that circuit that qualified, moderate nominees \nwere blocked by Republicans Senators during the previous \nadministration. Instead, the White House forwarded several extreme \nnominees to fill the seats that their party held hostage while leading \nthe Senate during the prior administration.\n  When I scheduled the April 2001 hearing on the nomination of Judge \nGibbons to the Sixth Circuit, it was the first hearing on a Sixth \nCircuit nomination in almost 5 years, even though three outstanding, \nfair-minded individuals were nominated to the Sixth Circuit by \nPresident Clinton and pending before the Committee for anywhere from \none year to over 4 years. Despite the partisan treatment of President \nClinton's nominees, I went forward. The conservative Judge Gibbons was \nconfirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2002, by a vote of 95 to 0. We did \nnot stop there, but proceeded to hold a hearing on a second Sixth \nCircuit nominee, Professor John Marshall Rogers, just a few short \nmonths later in June. This conservative was likewise confirmed last \nyear.\n  Thus, the Democratically-led Senate proceeded to hold hearings, give \nCommittee consideration and confirm two of President Bush's \nconservative nominees to the Sixth Circuit last year. With the \nconfirmations of Judge Julia Smith Gibbons of Tennessee and Professor \nJohn Marshall Rogers of Kentucky, Democrats confirmed the only two new \njudges to the Sixth Circuit in the previous 5 years.\n  Under the current Republican leadership, our Committee raced to hold \nJustice Cook's hearing at the same time as two other controversial \ncircuit court nominees, including Jeffrey Sutton. This triple hearing \nresulted in a marathon sitting lasting almost 12 hours. Most of the \nquestioning focused on Jeffrey Sutton and relatively little time was \ndedicated to Justice Cook. Many Democrats serving on the Judiciary \nCommittee requested an additional hearing for Justice Cook and Mr. \nRoberts. That request was denied for Justice Cook. We invited Justice \nCook and Mr. Roberts to meet with us. That request was denied. Then \nRepublicans overrode our longstanding Committee rules in order to \nreport those nominations without proper consideration before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This nomination is one of a long line of divisive and controversial \nnominations on which this Administration and the Republican majority in \nthe Senate insist. They are taking full advantage of their power after \nhaving unfairly refused to consider President Clinton's well qualified, \nmoderate nominees and now insisting that the administration's \nideological court packing scheme be put into effect. The ideological \ntakeover of the Sixth Circuit is all but complete with the confirmation \nof Judge Gibbons, Professor Rogers, Mr. Sutton and now Justice Cook.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Deborah Cook to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\n  Today's vote is important because we have an opportunity to confirm \nan excellent judge who exercises proper judicial restraint on the \nbench. Justice Cook is an honorable jurist. She has a distinguished \nrecord in private practice, she is a legal pioneer, and she is active \nin her community. Let me take a few moments to share how Justice Cook \ncame to this point. The story deserves to be told.\n  A native of Pittsburgh, PA, my hometown as well, I might add--Deborah \nCook had anything but a stable childhood. Not only did her family move \nquite often, but her family suffered economically. Her mother, \nKatherine Rudolph, struggled to support her children after Justice \nCook's father abandoned the family. When Deborah was 16, her mother \npassed away.\n  Although she did not have much time with her, Justice Cook credits \nher mother with instilling in her a sense of justice and a sense of the \nimportance of following the rules. Justice Cook carried these ideals to \nAkron, Ohio, where she and her siblings moved to join their uncle's \nlarge family. All together, the new family numbered 14.\n  In the next few years, Justice Cook received her bachelor of arts and \njuris doctor degrees from the University of Akron. While in law school, \nshe clerked part time at Roderick, Myers & Linton, Akron's oldest law \nfirm, and accepted an offer from the same firm in 1978, becoming the \nfirst woman attorney ever hired there. Five years later, Justice Cook \nagain made history at the firm when she was named its first woman \npartner. Let me tell you, Justice Cook knows first hand the \ndifficulties and challenges that professional women face in breaking \nthe glass ceiling.\n  While in private practice Justice Cook maintained a busy civil \nlitigation caseload, appearing in bankruptcy, state, and federal \nappellate and trial courts to litigate such matters as claims disputes, \nworkers' compensation claims, insurance claims, employment \ndiscrimination cases, torts, and wrongful death lawsuits.\n  Justice Cook has the experience we look for in a Federal judge. In \n1990, she left private practice and ran for a seat on the Ohio Ninth \nDistrict Court of Appeals, which is based in Akron. The Ohio courts of \nappeals have appellate jurisdiction over the Ohio common pleas, \nmunicipal, and county courts, hearing and deciding cases in three-judge \npanels. Four years later, Justice Cook ran for the Ohio Supreme Court, \na seven-member court, where she currently serves.\n  Over the past 7 years, Justice Cook has earned a reputation for being \na stickler for the law, a judge committed to law and order. She defines \nher own judicial role ``as [one] limited by the letter of the law.'' \nShe is a student of history and a committed constitutionalist. These \nare attributes desperately needed in the Federal courts. Simply put, as \nJustice Cook has said of herself, while she ``might hold a personal \nview, or perhaps even hold a bias, that has to be put aside.'' She \n``work[s] within the parameters given a judge by democratically enacted \nstatutes,'' avoiding the temptation to legislate from the bench. \nJustice Cook understands what makes an effective judge and she carries \nout that understanding.\n  The Ohio newspapers have recognized these qualities in Justice Cook. \nThe Columbus Dispatch says Justice Cook ``uniquely combines keen \nintellect, careful legal scholarship and consistency in her opinions. \nShe is committed to rendering decisions validated by the [law], not \npopularity polls and special interests.'' The Cleveland Plain Dealer \nsays Cook is ``extremely well qualified'' and a ``thoughtful, mature \njurist perhaps the brightest on the state's highest court.'' The Akron \nBeacon Journal says Cook ``has been a voice of restraint in opposition \nto a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course, acting as \nproblem-solvers (as ward pols) more than jurists.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of each of these editorials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Columbus Dispatch (Ohio), Oct. 1, 2000]\n\n         Supreme Court--Cook, O'Donnell Can Restore Confidence\n\n       The seven justices who sit on the Ohio Supreme Court are \n     among the most powerful people in the state. Acting in \n     agreement, any four of them can overrule the will of millions \n     of Ohio voters, all 132 members of the General Assembly and \n     the governor.\n       The state constitution grants the court such awesome power \n     so that the justices can strike down unconstitutional acts of \n     the legislature that threaten the rights and liberties of \n     Ohio's residents.\n       But if misused, this power also can threaten the rights and \n     liberties of Ohioans. The rule of law is replaced by \n     prejudice or whim.\n       This is why it is so important that the voters elect \n     justices who regard themselves as servants, not masters, of \n     the constitution. Justices who serve the constitution \n     understand that their role is not to make policy or law, \n     because this is a responsibility given by the constitution to \n     the legislature, not to the courts.\n       Justices may strike down laws that violate the \n     constitution, but they may not replace those laws with ones \n     more to their own liking.\n       It also is vital that voters elect justices who understand \n     that their job is to represent the law, not a political \n     party, not an interest group. Their job is to resolve \n     disputes impartially, in accordance with the constitution and \n     Ohio statutes.\n       In recent years, ideology, not impartial application of the \n     law, frequently appears to have guided court rulings. The \n     familiar 4-3 majority has overturned legislative efforts to \n     limit damage awards in lawsuits, rejected changes in the \n     state workers' compensation system and declared the state's \n     school-funding mechanism unconstitutional, simultaneously \n     dictating the means by which the legislature is to solve the \n     problem.\n       The perception is that this majority--Democratic Justices \n     Alice Robie Resnick and Francis E. Sweeney and Republicans \n     Paul E. Pfeifer and Andrew Douglas--holds itself above the \n     constitution, entitled to make law.\n       While not exactly partisan, this majority's bent is \n     definitely political. These four justices are united in \n     judicial activism with a messianic and populist bent.\n       The perception that the court is controlled by an \n     ideologically driven majority is seriously undermining faith \n     in the integrity and fairness of the high court.\n       Justices should not be turned out of office lightly: \n     certainly not for an occasional unpopular opinion and \n     particularly not for one resulting from a good-faith effort \n     to adhere to the constitution. But when justice becomes \n     politicized and high court rulings twist the law to reach the \n     majority's preferred outcome, a change is needed.\n       *For that reason, The Dispatch urges Ohioans to cast their \n     Supreme Court ballots for incumbent Justice Deborah L. Cook \n     and Judge Terrence O'Donnell of the Cuyahoga County Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Cook, a Republican seeking a second term on the court, \n     believes a judge's job is to apply the law without fear or \n     favor, not to make policy or to favor a constituency. Cook \n     does not believe the court should legislate, a point she has \n     underlined in her dissents to the court's two rulings in the \n     DeRolph school-funding lawsuit.\n       Of the seven justices, Cook uniquely combines keen \n     intellect, careful legal scholarship and consistency in her \n     opinions. She is committed to rendering decisions validated \n     by the constitution, not popularity polls and special \n     interests.\n       Cook's Democratic challenger, Judge Tim Black of the \n     Hamilton County Municipal Court, doesn't hesitate to describe \n     himself as a ``progressive,'' which is another way of saying \n     ``judicial activist.'' Black has made it clear in recent \n     statements that he favors the four-member activist majority.\n       Like Cook, Republican O'Donnell believes in applying the \n     law without fear or favor. He does not make policy from the \n     bench and says judges should be faithful to the law, not to \n     causes. His integrity and well-defined judicial philosophy \n     have made O'Donnell one of the most respected judges in \n     Cuyahoga County.\n       His opponent, incumbent Democratic Justice Alice Robie \n     Resnick claims to follow the same philosophy, but the record \n     suggests otherwise. She is a dependable member of the four-\n     justice activist majority. Her proposal for a legislative-\n     Supreme Court summit to address the school-funding problem \n     shows either that she doesn't understand her role as a judge \n     or that she wants to rewrite the constitution to make the \n     court a seven-member super-legislature. Neither explanation \n     reflects favorably on her.\n       Resnick has shown an unseemly willingness to politicize her \n     office. Her appearance at the opening of a school in Vinton \n     County was a transparent attempt to win votes from those who \n     approve of the Supreme Court's use of the DeRolph lawsuit to \n     dictate school-funding policy to lawmakers.\n       Her appearance at that event along with William L. Phillis, \n     mastermind for the plaintiffs in the continuing DeRolph case, \n     was a glaring conflict of interest and a lapse that cannot be \n     justified or excused.\n       Six years ago, The Dispatch endorsed Resnick for a second \n     term, believing that she had demonstrated diligence and \n     impartiality in her first term. That can no longer be said.\n       O'Donnell has pledged to restore integrity to the court. He \n     deserves that chance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Plain Dealer Publishing Co., (Cleveland, Ohio), Dec. 29, \n                                 2002]\n\n                       Break the Judicial Logjam\n\n       It has been more than 19 months since President George W. \n     Bush nominated Ohio Supreme Court Justice Deborah Cook and\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n     former state Solicitor Jeffrey Sutton to fill vacancies to \n     the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. But inexcusably, the \n     Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate has yet to hold a \n     single hearing on Cook or Sutton.\n       Despite pressure from Bush and other Republicans, Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, has \n     bottled up more than 100 nominations to federal court \n     openings. And amid the political stalling, the workloads of \n     federal District Court and appellate judges continues to \n     mount.\n       That should all change on Jan. 7, when the Senate \n     reconvenes and reorganizes under Republican control. Expected \n     to replace Leahy as Judiciary Committee chairman is Orrin \n     Hatch, a Republican from Utah.\n       Hatch must move quickly to break the judicial logjam. And \n     confirmation hearings for Cook and Sutton should be high on \n     his list.\n       This isn't about doing any special favor for Ohio or the \n     other states the 6th Circuit serves. It's about competence. \n     Both Cook and Sutton are extremely well qualified. Cook is a \n     thoughtful, mature jurist--perhaps the brightest on the \n     state's highest court. Sutton is regarded as a brilliant \n     litigator who has argued numerous cases before the U.S. \n     Supreme Court.\n       It's well past time to hold hearings on these and other \n     judicial appointments and put them before the Senate for a \n     confirmation vote.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Jan. 6, 2003]\n\n                              A Cook Tour\n\n       Tour the Web sites of various liberal interest groups, from \n     the National Organization for Women to the Alliance for \n     Justice, and you will discover how easily nominees for the \n     Federal courts can be caricatured. In recent months, Justice \n     Deborah Cook of the Ohio Supreme Court has been a target.\n       Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee considering her \n     nomination to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should \n     work their way past the political slogans. They will find a \n     judge conservative in the traditional sense. She follows the \n     principle of judicial restraint, ruling as the law is, not as \n     she would like the law to be. Justice Cook has waited 18 \n     months for a hearing on her nomination. The day appears in \n     sight, perhaps as early as Jan. 14. Cook was among the first \n     judicial nominees of President Bush, one of 11 who gathered \n     at the White House on a spring day to demonstrate the new \n     administration's drive to fill vacancies on the Federal \n     bench.\n       Put aside that those vacancies reflect the delaying tactics \n     of Senate Republicans during the Clinton years. Cook and the \n     others have encountered obstacles constructed by Democrats. \n     The November elections altered the political landscape. \n     Republicans rule the Senate and the White House. Nominations \n     are set to move forward.\n       That doesn't mean critics shouldn't howl when the president \n     opts for a nominee with excessive baggage, say, one more \n     comfortable in a debating society than on the Federal bench. \n     Bill Clinton took the cue, avoiding ideologues and sending \n     many impressive nominees to Capitol Hill. President Bush \n     should keep in mind his slight margin of victory and the \n     narrow Republican majority in the Senate.\n       Cook critics point to her membership in the Federalist \n     Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics that \n     includes many who advocate countering liberal activists with \n     their own brand of activism. Critics also note the many times \n     Cook has dissented on the Ohio Supreme Court, contending she \n     is out of the mainstream.\n       Those who watch the Ohio high court know Cook is no \n     ideologue. She has been a voice of restraint in opposition to \n     a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course, \n     acting as problem-solvers (as ward pols) more than jurists. \n     Cook has been accused of advocating the elimination of \n     protections for employee whistleblowers. In truth, she \n     objected to the majority acting as a superlegislature, \n     practicing public policy in the form of judicial rulings.\n       In another instance, Cook disagreed with the majority \n     because she rightly thought it necessary to have expert \n     medical testimony to establish whether a cancer qualified as \n     a disability under the law. When the majority ruled that \n     managers and supervisors could be sued individually for acts \n     of sexual harassment and discrimination, she noted the \n     glaring departure from the defining federal law.\n       Are these ``pro-business'' rulings on her part? That would \n     be the caricature. More accurately, they are precise readings \n     of the law. Indeed, in eight years on the Ohio Supreme Court \n     and four on the state appeals court, Cook has consistently \n     produced reasoned and careful analysis.\n       The argument might be made that we are simply cheering for \n     an Akron resident. We've differed with Justice Cook too many \n     times on school funding and other matters. President Bush won \n     the election. Republicans control the Senate. They have a \n     wide range of candidates for the Federal bench. In Deborah \n     Cook, they have a judge most deserving of confirmation, one \n     dedicated to judicial restraint.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Justice Cook also knows how to serve her community. She is \na founder and trustee of CollegeScholars, a mentored college \nscholarship program in Akron, and she personally mentors students for \nseveral hours each week. She and her husband fund the program's \nactivities in an effort to help inner-city children reach college. \nTheir generosity is really remarkable in that they will personally pay \nthe college tuition of students who complete the program.\n  But service to her community is not limited to the CollegeScholars \nprogram. Justice Cook is a United Way volunteer; she has given her time \nto Safe Landing Shelter, a home for troubled youth; she has served as a \nCommissioner for the Dispute Resolution Commission, helping address \ntruancy problems for disadvantaged children; and she devoted several \nyears to the Akron Area Volunteer Center as a Center trustee and \npresident. Justice Cook has received the Delta Gamma National Shield \nAward for Leadership and Volunteerism, and the Akron Women's Network \nWoman of the Year award.\n  One of the many reasons that this vote on Justice Cook's nomination \nis important is because it represents a step in the right direction in \nterms of addressing the problems in the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth \nCircuit is severely understaffed and needs judges to enable its work to \ngo forward, and the addition of Justice Cook, along with President \nBush's other Sixth Circuit nominee from Ohio, Jeffrey Sutton, will make \nthis happen. At this moment, the 16-seat Sixth Circuit is operating \nwith only 10 judges. All six of the vacancies on the Sixth Circuit are \nconsidered judicial emergencies.\n  The Sixth Circuit has been forced to rely on district court judges to \nkeep pace with its caseload. This practice, in turn, affects the \nefficiency of the district courts. I understand that the Sixth Circuit \ncurrently hears some arguments via telephone to conserve resources. \nEach three-judge panel on the Sixth Circuit not only must hear more \ncases each year, but it also must spend less time on each case in order \nto maintain some control over the docket. Some cases may not be heard \ndespite their merit. In the meantime, the administration of justice \nsuffers.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, \nthe Sixth Circuit ranks last out of the 12 circuit courts in the time \nit takes to complete its cases. On average, the Sixth Circuit in 2002 \ntook 16 months to reach a final disposition on a case. With the \nnational average for appellate courts at only 10.7 months, this means \nthe Sixth Circuit takes about 50 percent longer than the average to \nprocess a case.\n  Since 1996, the Sixth Circuit has seen a 46 percent increase in the \nnumber of decisions per active judge. The national average has \nincreased only 14 percent in that same time frame. Last year each Sixth \nCircuit judge handled more than 600 cases.\n  Mr. President, Justice Cook has demonstrated her capacity to excel on \nthe Federal court bench. She possesses the qualifications, the \ncapacity, and the temperament a judge needs to serve on the Sixth \nCircuit. She deserves confirmation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nOhio State Supreme Court Justice Deborah Cook for the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I intend to vote yes on her nomination because I \nbelieve that she has a proper understanding of the role of the \njudiciary.\n  Unlike some other nominees who have come before the Senate, Justice \nCook's opinions demonstrate a recognition that a judge's proper role is \nto interpret statutes in a way that reflects the legislature's intent. \nShe does not try to legislate from the bench or inject her views into \nher interpretations of a statute.\n  I believe that, based on her past record, she will be an appellate \njudge who will read statutes faithfully and carefully and decide cases \non her best understanding of what the law says as opposed to ruling \nbased on her personal views.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of Justice Cook's views on judicial \nrestraint from her opinions. In a dissent from an Ohio Supreme Court \ndecision overturning the State's system of funding public education, \nCook noted:\n\n       In short, the determination of what constitutes minimum \n     levels of educational opportunity to be provided to Ohio's \n     children is committed by the Ohio Constitution to legitimate \n     policy makers--not the courts, whose proper role is \n     interpretation and application of law.\n\n  Similarly, Cook defended the role of the legislature in a dissent \nfrom an\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nOhio Supreme Court ruling that found a new ``employment intentional \ntort'' statute to be unconstitutional.\n\n       The majority opinion views the issue presented by this case \n     as a question of ``what is right?'', but I believe the true \n     question is ``who decides what is right?'' The General \n     Assembly passed this legislation as part of its policy-making \n     function, a function inherent in the legislative power. With \n     this decision, however the majority usurps the legislative \n     power.\n\n  Senator DeWine, a strong supporter of Justice Cook, has called her an \n``old-fashioned'' conservative, and I think that is a very accurate \ndescription.\n  I certainly don't agree with all of Justice Cook's opinions, and take \nseriously the concerns raised by those who feel she tends to side with \nbig corporations and employers in lawsuits. I also am concerned about \nsome of her opinions arguing for the overturning of jury verdicts.\n  In weighing the totality of these issues, however, I believe that \nJustice Cook will properly exercise the judicial office. Most \nimportantly, I believe she will not be an activist judge who will try \nto legislate from the bench.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Deborah \nCook and urge my colleagues to support her confirmation. The Sixth \nCircuit, which includes my State of Kentucky, is experiencing a true \njudicial emergency. Five of the sixteen seats on that court are vacant, \nleading to justice delayed--and thus justice denied--for the citizens \nof Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan. Fortunately, last week we \nconfirmed Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit, and today we will \nconfirm Deborah Cook.\n  Deborah Cook was among President Bush's original circuit court \nnominees first submitted to the Senate on May 9, 2001. Nearly 2 years \nwill have passed from the time her nomination was first submitted until \nshe will be able to assume her seat on the bench. It has been a long \nwait, but Deborah Cook's confirmation is good news for her and for the \npeople living in the Sixth Circuit.\n  Deborah Cook is an example of the fine judicial nominees President \nBush has submitted to the Senate. She is currently a Justice on the \nOhio Supreme Court, where she has served since she was first elected in \n1994. Prior to that, Justice Cook served as a Court of Appeals judge in \nOhio. She also practiced law for 15 years in Akron, OH, and was her \nfirm's first female associate and partner.\n  I am proud that President Bush nominated Deborah Cook, and I am proud \nto vote for her. She has ample experience as an appellate court judge \nand is well qualified to sit on the Sixth Circuit. Deborah Cook will do \na fine job for all people living in the Sixth Circuit. I am glad she \nwill soon be confirmed, and I urge my colleagues to support her as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in just a few moments the U.S. Senate will \nbe voting on this nomination. What are the essential facts? Here are \nthe essential facts:\n  Justice Deborah Cook authored the Rice case. This case held that \nworkers could get punitive damages from employment discrimination \ncases.\n  Second fact: It has been charged that Justice Cook is a big \ndissenter. It has been charged that she cannot reach consensus. Let us \nlook at the cases from the Ohio Supreme Court which have gone to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. There have been five of those cases. In each case, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court has agreed with Justice Cook. But, more \nimportantly, in four of those cases, Justice Cook was a dissenter from \nthe Ohio Supreme Court. In those four cases, the U.S. Supreme Court \nsaid we disagree with the Ohio Supreme Court, but we agree with the \ndissenter. We agree with Justice Cook. In fact, most of those cases \nweren't even close. By an overwhelming majority, in most of those cases \nthe U.S. Supreme Court said the Ohio Supreme Court was wrong, but \nJustice Cook was right.\n  So much for the argument that there is something wrong with Justice \nCook when she dissents.\n  Justice Cook has been on the Ohio Supreme Court for 8 years. She was \non the court of appeals for 4 years. She has a great deal of \nexperience. She is a person who is a well-rounded individual and who \nhas great compassion.\n  We have heard on this floor from Senator Voinovich and myself about \nhow she has established scholarships for children and how she cares \nabout education. And we have heard from the newspapers in Ohio. That is \nimportant because the newspapers in the State of Ohio pay attention. \nThey pay attention to the Ohio Supreme Court. All of the five, six, or \nseven principal newspapers in Ohio endorsed her for reelection. They \nhave endorsed her for this confirmation. I think what they have said is \nparticularly important.\n  The Cincinnati Post wrote on January 8:\n\n       Cook is serving her second term on the Ohio Supreme Court \n     where she has been a pillar of stability and good sense.\n\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote:\n\n       Cook is a thoughtful, mature jurist--perhaps the brightest \n     on the State's highest court.\n\n  The Akron Beacon wrote:\n\n       Those who watch the Ohio High Court know Cook is no \n     idealogue. She has been a voice of restraint in opposition to \n     a court majority determined to chart an aggressive course \n     acting as problem solvers more than jurists. In Deborah Cook \n     they have a judge most deserving of confirmation, one \n     dedicated to judicial restraint.\n\n  The Columbus Dispatch wrote:\n\n       Cook's record is one of continuing achievement. Since 1996 \n     she has served on the Ohio Supreme Court where she has \n     distinguished herself as a careful jurist with profound \n     respect for judicial restraint and the separation of powers \n     between the three branches of government.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to confirm Justice Cook. Senator Voinovich and I \nasked the President to nominate her. We have known her for many years. \nShe will serve well and ably on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the remaining time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Deborah L. Cook, of Ohio, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nSixth Circuit? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms. Cantwell), \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller), \nand the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember or their designees.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a brief \nstatement, we have had a number of people on this side of the aisle who \nhave indicated we are to object to any extension of time beyond 6. Even \nthough the vote took a little longer than expected, we cannot extend \nthe time past 6.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Priscilla Owen\n\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California on their time. She \nwanted to make a statement and put something in the Record, but it \nshould come on their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, Chairman Hatch. When Chairman Hatch \nand I were debating the Owen nomination, which is not before us, he \nquestioned two statements I made. One was that she did not write a \ndissenting opinion in Doe and the second was that Judge Gonzales never \nreferred to her as a judicial activist. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthese documents printed in the Record, the dissenting opinion, the \nfirst page, which shows that she, in fact, did file a dissenting \nopinion. Secondly, an article that appeared about a week ago in the New \nYork Times which says that Judge Gonzales said he was referring to \nJustice Owen when he said she was an activist. He did say it was merely \nheated language but, in fact, he said he was referring to her.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       . . . Texas interpreting the state's law allowing a \n     teenager to obtain an abortion without notifying her parents \n     if she can show a court that she is mature enough to \n     understand the consequences.\n       In the dissent, Justice Owen said the teenager in the case \n     had not demonstrated that she knew that there were religious \n     objections to abortion and that some women who underwent \n     abortions had experienced severe remorse.\n       One of the other justices on the court at the time was \n     Alberto R. Gonzales, now the White House counsel. He wrote \n     that the reading of the law by the dissenters was ``an \n     unconscionable act of jusdicial activism.''\n       Justice Owen has said that Justice Gonzalez was not \n     referring to her. Mr. Gonzales has, in interviews, \n     acknowledged he was referring to her and said that his \n     description of her as a judicial activist was merely heated \n     language among judges who disagreed.\n       While the first floor fight over the Owen nomination was \n     occurring, another judicial nomination drama was being played \n     out across the street in the Judiciary Committee, which was \n     considering President Bush's nomination of J. Leon Holmes to \n     be a district judge in Arkansas.\n       Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman \n     of the committee, did not ask for a vote on approving the \n     Holmes nomination as is customary. Instead, he took the \n     extraordinary step of asking that the committee vote to send \n     the nomination to the full Senate without a recommendation.\n       Mr. Hatch was apparently concerned that some Republicans on \n     the committee were not completely comfortable with the \n     nomination after disclosures that Mr. Holmes, an ardent \n     opponent of abortion, had made several notable comments about \n     the role of women in society.\n       In 1997 Mr. Holmes wrote that ``the woman is to place \n     herself under the authority of the man.'' He had also written \n     that abortion should not be available to rape victims because \n     conceptions from rape occur with the same frequency as snow \n     in Miami.\n       Most of the combat over judicial confirmations has been \n     over appeals court judges, the level just below the Supreme \n     Court, and the nomination of Mr. Holmes, to the trial court \n     had initially attracted little notice.\n       But at a committee session last week, Senator Dianne \n     Feinstein, Democrat of California, said that she had never \n     voted against a district court nominee but that she found Mr. \n     Holmes's remarks shocking.\n       ``I do not see how anyone can divine from these comments \n     that he has either the temperament or the wisdom to be a \n     judge,'' Senator Feinstein said.\n       Senator Hatch said today that he was concerned about some \n     of those remarks and that Mr. Holmes had expressed regret for \n     some. But the most important factor, the senator said, was \n     that many people in Arkansas, including the state's two \n     Democratic senators, Mark Pryor and Blanche Lincoln, still \n     supported the nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n          IN RE JANE DOE, No. 00-0224, SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n\n         19 S.W.3d 346; 2000 Tex.

JUSTICE ENOCH filed a concurring opinion, \n     joined by JUSTICE BAKER, JUSTICE GONZALES filed a concurring \n     opinion, joined by JUSTICE ENOCH. JUSTICE HECHT filed a \n     dissenting opinion.

After remand from \n     this Court, see In re Jane Doe, 19 S.W.3d 249, 2000 Tex. \n     LEXIS 21 (Tex. 2000) (``Doe 1(I)''), the trial court \n     conducted another hearing and found that Jane Doe failed to \n     prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is \n     sufficiently well informed to have an abortion without \n     parental notification. The court of appeals affirmed. After \n     reviewing the record, we determined that Doe conclusively \n     [**2] established the statutory requirements and that she was \n     entitled to consent to the procedure without notifying a \n     parent. We issued an order on March 10, 2000, reversing the \n     court of appeals' judgment, with opinions to follow on the \n     concern that Doe be able to undergo a less risky abortion \n     procedure, if that option was still available to her and that \n     was her decision. The following is our opinion holding that \n     the evidence Doe presented conclusively established that she \n     was ``mature and sufficiently well informed'' to consent to \n     an abortion without parental notification. See TEX. FAM. CODE \n     Sec. 33.003(i).\n\n                                   I\n\n       Abortion is a highly-charged issue that often engenders \n     heated public debate. Such debate is to be expected and, \n     indeed, embraced in our free and democratic society. It is \n     through this very type of open exchange that our Legislature \n     crafted and enacted the particular statutory scheme before \n     us. Our system of government requires the judicial branch to \n     independently review and dispassionately interpret \n     legislation in accordance with the Legislature's will as \n     expressed in the statute. We begin our analysis with an \n     overview of the Parental [*350] Notification [**3] Act's \n     judicial bypass procedure and our role in interpreting it.\n\n                      A. The Proper Role of Judges\n\n       ``[Courts] are under the constraints imposed by the \n     judicial function in our democratic society. . . . The \n     function in construing a statute is to ascertain the meaning \n     of words used by the legislature. To go beyond it is to usurp \n     a power which our democracy has lodged in its elected \n     legislature. . . . A judge must not rewrite a statute, \n     neither to enlarge nor to contract it.''--Felix Frankfurter \n     (RECORD OF THE ASSOCIATION OF THE BAR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK \n     213 (1947), reprinted in COURTS, JUDGES, AND POLITICS, at 414 \n     (Walter F. Murphy & C. Herman Pritchett, eds., 2d ed. 1974).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. When I come to speak on the Senate floor, I do my \nhomework. I felt very badly about that, and now I have the \ndocumentation. I thank my friend for yielding. I know it does not make \nhim happy, but he was very generous to me to allow this minute to send \nthese documents to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Rather than take time to respond, I will write a letter to \nthe distinguished Senator and point out where she is in error on the \nOwen matter. As a matter of fact, I think it has been outrageous the \nway some of the arguments have been made on the other side against this \nreally excellent justice from the State of Texas, who has a unanimous \nwell qualified, the highest rating, from the American Bar Association. \nI think we have had pure, unadulterated, raw politics involved with \nregard to Justice Owen.\n  This debate we are now having is about the raw politics that are \nbeing used against Miguel Estrada, the first Hispanic ever nominated to \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  Today is Cinco de Mayo, the Fifth of May, commemorating the victory \nof\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\nthe Mexican army over the French army at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. \nThis battle came to represent a symbol of Mexican unity and patriotism. \nThe victory demonstrated to the world that Mexico and all of Latin \nAmerica were willing to defend themselves against any foreign \nintervention. Cinco de Mayo is now viewed as a festive day to celebrate \nfreedom and liberty.\n  The fifth of May, 2003, in the Senate, unfortunately is also the 3-\nmonth anniversary of the beginning of the debate on Miguel Estrada. I \nwould hope that we would be celebrating the liberation of his \nnomination and the freedom to vote on final passage on this Cinco de \nMayo. But instead, the nomination of Miguel Estrada has been captured \nby a minority of Senators who refuse to allow a final vote on his \nnomination. They insist on their unprecedented filibuster, following \ntheir game plan of obstruction. In fact, they have compounded their \nobstructionist tactics by engaging in a second filibuster, this time on \nPriscilla Owen, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. She \nalso has a unanimous well-qualified rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, the badge of honor, the gold standard, that our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, have said that rating is.\n  I must admit, the Democrat game plan of delay and obstructionism is \nnot surprising, but it is getting somewhat contradictory. In the case \nof Mr. Estrada, Democrats say they cannot vote for the nominee because \nthey do not know enough about him. They allege he did not answer their \nquestions and therefore they must have Department of Justice \nconfidential memoranda he wrote while he was a line attorney in the \nSolicitor General's office; memoranda that have never been given in any \nway, shape or form to anybody in the Senate in a confirmation battle \nbefore, or anybody else for that matter. Even the White House has not \nseen these matters because they are so highly privileged, not Judge \nGonzales, not anybody else in the White House.\n  There are no such claims about Justice Owen. Democrat opponents admit \nthey know enough about her, that she did answer the questions, and that \nshe has a record they can review. There are no phony excuses. They \nsimply oppose her on philosophical grounds, namely, her interpretation \nof the Texas parental notification statute that applies to minor girls \nseeking an abortion.\n  This double standard demonstrates that some Senate Democrats are \nwilling to use whatever obstructionist tactics it takes, based on any \nconvenient rationale, to defeat the President's nominees.\n  While the rationales may be different, the motivation in both cases \nis the same. I think that a recent editorial appearing in the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution said it best: ``The fear with Owen and Estrada is \nthat one or both will be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court should a \nvacancy occur. Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the Circuit \nCourt bench any perceived conservative who has the credentials to serve \non the U.S. Supreme Court.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthis editorial be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. As far as Mr. Estrada goes, there is an additional factor \nthat is not based on any substantive objection to his nomination. I \nbelieve that some Senate Democrats do not want the current President, a \nRepublican President, to appoint the first Hispanic as United States \nCircuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  Let me read from an editorial published by the Dallas Morning News \naddressing this point. On February 17, 2003, the News wrote:\n\n       Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. \n     Part of that is due to his ideology--which is decidedly not \n     Democratic. But part of it also has to do with the fellow who \n     nominated him. Democrats don't relish giving President Bush \n     one more thing to brag about when he goes into Hispanic \n     neighborhoods during his re-election campaign next year. They \n     are even less interested putting a conservative Republican in \n     line to become the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't know if Mr. Estrada is a conservative Republican, \nbut I do know he is qualified for the position to which he is \nnominated, and it is well past time to vote on his nomination. This \nFriday will mark the two-years anniversary of his nomination on May 9, \n2001. The Majority leader has made every attempt to obtain time \nagreements or use other procedures to bring this matter to a \nresolution. Each of these attempts has been rebuffed by a minority of \nthis body. Some Senate Democrats have used every delay and \nobstructionist tactic available. Yet they still cannot identify one \nsubstantive issue that would justify or excuse their refusal to permit \na final vote.\n  Mr. President, on this day, 141 years ago, the Mexican Army defeated \nforces which represented tyranny and defended the liberty of their \nnation. I urge my colleagues, on this day of celebration, to defeat the \ntyranny of the minority by voting to bring the debate on the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada to a close.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 4, 2003]\n\n                 Democrats Use Wrong Route to Win South\n\n                            (By Jim Wooten)\n\n       U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) brought his presidential \n     aspirations to the South last week, promising in Alabama that \n     he will make the national party competitive here once again.\n       Make competitive, he neglected to mention, a party that has \n     positioned itself in opposition to the war in Iraq and \n     anything other than token tax cuts, and as Democrats reminded \n     the nation once again about the elevation of conservatives to \n     the federal bench. While the White House may appeal to some \n     as inside work with no heavy lifting, getting there through \n     the South toting this party's agenda will be a task requiring \n     Herculean labor.\n       Just this week, for example, Kerry's Democratic \n     colleagues--Georgia's Zell Miller excepted--began to \n     filibuster the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla Owen to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Kerry and other Democrats are already filibustering the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the District of Columbia \n     Circuit Court of Appeals--the first time simultaneous \n     filibusters against judicial nominees have occurred in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       Both Owen and Estrada are superbly qualified in every \n     respect. Yet on Owen, those who complain that a ``glass \n     ceiling'' exists for women of achievement are busily \n     constructing one to keep her in her place. And those who \n     complain that the federal bench lacks ``diversity'' find \n     Estrada to be too much diversity for their taste. He is \n     considered to be a conservative, and the interest groups that \n     drive the Democratic Party nationally fear Owen is, too, at \n     least on their abortion litmus test.\n       The fear with Owen and Estrada is that one or both will be \n     nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court should a vacancy occur. \n     Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the Circuit Court \n     bench any perceived conservative who has the credential to \n     serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Kerry, then, and the legions of presidential soundalikes \n     who campaign with him, have to come to a region where \n     conservatism is the mainstream to explain how reducing \n     federal taxes is bad and cheating exemplary women and \n     minorities of the fair hearing they have earned before the \n     U.S. Senate because they might be conservative is good.\n       ``I can help you wage a fight down here and rebuild this \n     party for the long run,'' Kerry said in Birmingham. \n     Republicans have carried Alabama in all but three \n     presidential elections in the past 50 years. Jimmy Carter in \n     1976 was the last Democrat to carry the state. George W. Bush \n     carried every Southern state in 2000, including Tennessee, \n     his Democratic opponent's home state. Al Gore Jr. thought so \n     little of his Southern prospects that he actively campaigned \n     in just three states--Tennessee, Florida and West Virginia.\n       Some Democrats, said Kerry, were ``surprised'' that he \n     visited Alabama.\n       No surprise that he visited. The real surprise is the party \n     baggage he hauled.\n       Opposition to tax cuts is comprehensible. Politicians \n     loathe interruption in the flow of spendable revenues. \n     Opposition to the war is, too. Too confrontational. Angers \n     adversaries. Provokes understandable aggression, for which we \n     bear unexpurgated sin.\n       While some positions are understandable, not so their \n     party-line opposition to Owen and Estrada. Owen, the new \n     filibusteree, drew the American Bar Association's highest \n     rating. She is a cum laude graduate of the Baylor University \n     Law School who scored the top grade in Texas on the bar exam. \n     She practiced 17 years before becoming a judge and has been \n     widely praised for her integrity and ability. Liberal groups \n     say, unconvincingly except when they are talking to each \n     other and Senate Democrats, that she is anti-abortion and \n     pro-business.\n       Being a neighborly people, Southerners of course welcome \n     Kerry to visit the region and\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\n     to indulge himself in its hospitality. But the senator should \n     not indulge himself into believing that a party that opposes \n     tax cuts and filibusters nominees such as Owen and Estrada \n     has the slightest chance of carrying this region.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Feb. 21, 2003]\n\n     Rush to Judgment: Estrada Nomination Has Been Blocked Too Long\n\n       There is a time for talking and a time for voting. The time \n     is past for the U.S. Senate to talk about Miguel Estrada's \n     nomination to the federal Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia circuit. It's time to vote.\n       Having emigrated from Honduras as a teenager unable to \n     speak much English, Mr. Estrada went on to graduate magna cum \n     laude from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, to \n     clerk for a Supreme Court justice, to serve two \n     administrations in the U.S. solicitor general's office, to \n     win more than a dozen cases in the Supreme Court. In short, \n     the 42-year-old lawyer is talented. Who knew that talent \n     would extend to tying the Senate in knots for days on end.\n       Democrats by now are in full filibuster. Senate \n     proceedings, as carried on C-Span, resemble the firm Goundhog \n     Day, where the main character has to relive the same day over \n     and over again. Every day, it's the same thing. Democrats get \n     up, march over to the podium, shuffle papers and recite their \n     main complaint with Mr. Estrada--that he's conservative, \n     unconventional and unapologetic. That when he had the chance \n     to hand them the rope with which to hang him during his \n     hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he refused to \n     hold up his end.\n       Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. \n     Part of that is due to his ideology--which is decidedly not \n     Democratic. But part of it also has to do with the fellow who \n     nominated him. Democrats don't relish giving President Bush \n     one more thing to brag about when he goes into Hispanic \n     neighborhoods during his re-election campaign next year. They \n     are even less interested in putting a conservative Republican \n     in line to become the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme \n     Court.\n       And so they have talked and talked, in hopes that \n     Republicans will back down. They won't. Nor should they.\n       Republicans certainly stalled their share of appointments \n     during the Clinton administration. But Democrats are being \n     shortsighted in seeking retaliation. It is precisely these \n     sorts of narrowly motivated temper tantrums--from both sides \n     of the political aisle--that turn off voters and make cynics \n     of the American people. When that happens, it doesn't matter \n     which nominees get confirmed or rejected. Everybody loses.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for some reason the Republican leadership \nis forcing what may be the fifth vote on a cloture motion on this \ndivisive and controversial nomination.\n  I mention that because none of these cloture motions would have been \nneeded if the administration had simply cooperated with the Senate as \ndid prior administrations, Democratic and Republican. I have been here \nwith six different administrations. The previous five always, no matter \nwho was President, no matter who was in the majority in the Senate, \nalways showed cooperation on judicial nominations as, I believe, has \nevery President in the last century. Not this one.\n  I mention that because we are having this vote yet nothing has \nchanged since the last cloture vote. No effort has been forthcoming by \nthe administration to accommodate Senators' requests for access to the \nexecutive branch documents requested last May, almost a year ago. \nEverybody says Mr. Estrada is perfectly willing to come up and answer \nSenators' questions but not to answer the only questions the Senators \nreally want to ask him.\n  Remember, this man was appointed based on what the administration \nknows of his writings while employed in the government. They have \naccess to these writings. They say, in effect: Trust us. I am a strong \nsupporter of Ronald Reagan's position: Trust but verify. I would like \nhim to verify what was in these writings. We have not had access to \nthem. If we did, we wouldn't be needing all these cloture votes.\n  Since the beginning of this year, despite the fixation on the \nPresident's most controversial nominations, we have worked hard to \nreduce judicial vacancies even further. As of today, the number of \njudicial vacancies is 49. That is the lowest it has been in many years. \nThat is lower than at any time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton \nadministration. We have already reduced judicial vacancies from 110, \nwhen I became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to 49. We did \nthis in less than 2 years. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 \npercent to 5.7 percent, the lowest it has been in a decade. If we could \nget even a modicum of cooperation from the administration, think of the \nadditional progress we could be making.\n  The Nation's unemployment rate rose last month to 6 percent, but the \nvacancy rate in the Federal judiciary dipped to 5.7 percent. While the \nnumber of private sector jobs lost since the beginning of this \nadministration is 2.7 million, and while almost 9 million Americans are \nnow out of work, and unemployment has risen by more than 45 percent \nduring this administration, Democrats in the Senate have cooperated, \nmoving forward to confirm 121 of the President's judicial nominees to \nreduce judicial vacancies to the lowest level in more than a decade and \nto reduce Federal judicial vacancies by more than 60 percent.\n  Apparently, the majority in the Senate remains obsessed in seeking to \nforce through the most divisive of this President's controversial, \nideologically chosen nominees. While they have pushed the Nation's \nunemployment rate up to 6 percent, they have focused their energies on \ndropping the vacancy rate of the Federal judiciary to below that.\n  I think it is unfortunate that the White House and some of my friends \non the other side of the aisle have insisted on this confrontation \nrather than working with us to provide the needed information so we \ncould proceed on the Estrada nomination. Some seem to prefer political \ngame playing, seeking to pack the courts with ideologues and leveling \nbaseless charges of bigotry at those who may disagree with them, rather \nthan working with us on this nomination by providing information and \nproceeding to a fair vote.\n\n  We have spent day after day on this nomination that will not go any \nfurther until the nominee is given permission to provide answers to us \nregarding the same questions that were obviously asked by the \nadministration. What was it he wrote that made the administration want \nto appoint him to the second highest court in the land?\n  On one level, I admire their efforts to get this high-paying lifetime \njob for this nominee. Maybe they should talk about the 9 million \nAmericans who do not have any lifetime job, who now don't have any job; \nor the 2.7 million Americans who have lost their jobs since this \nadministration came into office. Maybe we should be debating that. \nMaybe we should be working to put them back to work. Apparently, the \nadministration believes it is more important to have this one job.\n  In that regard, just as any employer would want to know why they \nshould hire a particular person, we in the Senate have a right to ask \nwhat is it in this man's record that made the administration want to \nappoint him to the second highest court in the land. But they don't \nwant us to see what it was on which they based their decision. Maybe \nthey believe the Senate is irrelevant.\n  That is not the way I read the advise and consent clause. Let us see \nwhat brought them to their conclusion, and then let us go forward. \nLet's actually take those steps that would unite us rather than divide \nus, and then maybe the administration will be able to turn to the lives \nof the millions upon millions of Americans who are out of work--the \nhighest unemployment rate in a decade.\n  To reiterate, today the Republican leadership in the Senate is \nforcing what may be the fifth vote on a cloture motion on this divisive \nand controversial nomination. None of these motions would have been \nneeded if the administration had cooperated with the Senate as have \nprior administrations, Democratic and Republican. Nothing has changed \nfrom the last cloture vote. No effort has been forthcoming by the \nadministration to accommodate Senators' requests for access to the \nexecutive branch documents requested last May, almost 1 year ago. The \nWhite House continues to obstruct any progress toward resolving this \nmatter\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nby its unprecedented refusal to turn over documents requested to \ndetermine whether or not Miguel Estrada should sit on the second \nhighest court in the land, for life. Mr. Estrada's nomination is \napparently being sacrificed by the administration for its own partisan, \npolitical purposes.\n  I do want to thank the Democratic leadership in the Senate for \nworking with us and helping press for a vote on the nomination of Judge \nEdward Prado to the Fifth Circuit last week. We had been seeking that \nvote for several weeks, since his nomination was favorably reported \nwith the support of every Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. \nLast Thursday, the Republican leadership at last agreed to schedule \nthat nomination for Senate consideration. Judge Prado's nomination was \nconfirmed 97 to zero. This nomination is another example of how quickly \nthe Senate is able to proceed on consensus, mainstream nominees. Judge \nPrado has 19 years of experience as a U.S. District Court judge. Our \nreview of his actions on the bench showed him to have a solid record of \nfairness and evenhandedness. No supervisor or colleague of Judge Prado \nhas questioned his willingness to interpret the law fairly. Judge Prado \nenjoyed the full support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Not a single person \nor organization submitted a letter of opposition or raised concerns \nabout Judge Prado.\n  Judge Prado is now the second nominee of this President to be \nconfirmed by the Senate to the Fifth Circuit after years during which \nPresident Clinton's nominees were denied hearings and consideration by \na Republican Senate majority. Although Republicans had refused to \nproceed on three of President Clinton's nominees to that court--two \nfrom Texas and one from Louisiana--during his entire second term, \nDemocrats proceeded with hearings and committee votes on all three of \nPresident Bush's nominees. Judge Prado is the fourth nominee of this \nadministration to receive a hearing and consideration.\n  Still stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar is the nomination of \nJudge Cecilia Altonaga to be a Federal judge in Florida. Senator Graham \nrequested that the Judiciary Committee expedite the consideration of \nher nomination, and we did. All Democratic members of the Judiciary \nCommittee supported this nomination. She will be the first Cuban-\nAmerican woman to be confirmed to the Federal bench, whenever the \nRepublican majority is willing to proceed on her nomination. In my \nview, the Senate's time would be better spent this evening voting on \nthis nomination than another unsuccessful cloture vote on the Estrada \nnomination. Unfortunately, that is not how the Republican leadership \nhas chosen to proceed.\n  The administration remains intent on packing the Federal circuit \ncourts and on insisting that the Senate rubberstamp its nominees \nwithout fulfilling this body's constitutional advise and consent role \nin this most important process. The White House could have long ago \nhelped solve the impasse on the Estrada nomination by honoring the \nSenate's role in the appointment process and providing the Senate with \naccess to Mr. Estrada's legal work. Past administrations have provided \nsuch legal memoranda in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork, \nWilliam Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott and Ben Civiletti, and \neven this administration did so with a nominee to the Environmental \nProtection Agency. In my statement in connection with an earlier \ncloture petition, I outlined additional precedent for sharing the \nrequested materials with the Senate, as did Senator Kennedy. I am \ndisappointed that the White House refuses to end this problem and, \ninstead, continues to politicize the process.\n  We understand that the President's nominees will be Republicans. We \nunderstand they will be conservative. We understand that they will have \npositions with which we disagree. I have voted for hundreds of nominees \nwho were conservative Republicans.\n  In just the last 2 years, 121 of the President's judicial nominees \nhave been confirmed. One hundred of those confirmations came during the \n17 months of Democratic leadership of the Senate. No fair-minded \nobserver could term that obstructionism. By contrast, during the 6\\1/2\\ \nyears during which Republicans controlled the Senate and President \nClinton's nominations were being considered, they averaged only 38 \nconfirmations a year. During the last two years of the Clinton \nadministration, the Senate confirmed only 73 Federal judges--the Senate \nconfirmed 72 judges nominated by President Bush last year alone. \nCombining the 1996 and 1997 sessions, Republicans in the Senate allowed \nonly 53 judges to be confirmed in 2 years, including only seven new \njudges to the Circuit Courts.\n  It is a shame that the White House refuses to work together with us \nto do even more to help the Federal judiciary. This week, we have \nalready had a debate and vote on yet another controversial circuit \ncourt nominee, Deborah Cook, for the Sixth Circuit, and now a cloture \nvote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, when we inherited 110 judicial vacancies, there was a \ndire need to fill judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 months, despite \nconstant criticism from the administration, the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including several who were \ndivisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer review ratings \nfrom the ABA, and at least one who had been rated not qualified. \nDespite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced judicial \nvacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' by \nSenator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the \nfixation of the Republican majority on the President's most \ncontroversial nominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial \nvacancies even further. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies \nis at 49. That is the lowest it has been in 7 years. That is lower than \nat any time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton administration. We \nhave already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to 49, in less than 2 \nyears. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.7 \npercent, the lowest it has been in a decade. With some cooperation from \nthis administration, think of the additional progress we could be \nmaking.\n  While the Nation's unemployment rate rose last month to 6 percent, \nthe vacancy rate on the Federal judiciary dipped to 5.7 percent. While \nthe number of private sector jobs lost since the beginning of the Bush \nadministration is 2.7 million, almost 9 million Americans are now out \nof work, and unemployment has risen by more than 45 percent, Democrats \nin the Senate have cooperated in moving forward to confirm 121 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees, to reduce judicial vacancies to the \nlowest level in more than a decade, and to reduce Federal judicial \nvacancies by almost 60 percent. Yet the Republican-led Senate remains \nobsessed with seeking to force through the most divisive of this \nPresident's controversial, ideologically-chosen nominees.\n  It is unfortunate that the White House and some Republicans have \ninsisted on this confrontation rather than working with us to provide \nthe needed information so that we could proceed on the Estrada \nnomination. Some on the Republican side seem to prefer political game \nplaying, seeking to pack our courts with ideologues and leveling \nbaseless charges of bigotry, rather than to work with us to resolve the \nimpasse over this nomination by providing information and proceeding to \na fair vote.\n  I was disappointed that Senator Bennett's straightforward colloquy \nwith Senator Reid and me on February 14, which pointed to a solution, \nwas never allowed by hard-liners on the other side to yield results. I \nam disappointed that all my efforts and those of Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid have been rejected by the White House. The letter that \nSenator Daschle sent to the President on February 11 pointed the way to \nresolving this matter reasonably and fairly. Republicans would \napparently rather engage in partisan politics.\n  Republican talking points will undoubtedly claim that this is \n``unprecedented.'' They will ignore their own recent filibusters \nagainst President Clinton's executive and judicial nominees in so \ndoing. The only thing unprecedented about this matter is that the \nadministration and Republican leadership have shown no willingness to \nbe\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nreasonable and accommodate Democratic Senators' request for information \ntraditionally shared with the Senate by past administrations. That this \nis the fifth cloture vote on this matter is an indictment of Republican \nintransigence on this matter, nothing more. What is unprecedented is \nthat there has been no effort on the Republican side to work this \nmatter out as these matters have always been worked out in the past. \nWhat is unprecedented is the Republican insistence to schedule cloture \nvote after cloture vote without first resolving the underlying problem \ncaused by the administration's inflexibility.\n  I urge the White House and Senate Republicans to end the political \nwarfare and join with us in good faith to make sure the information \nthat is needed to review this nomination is provided so that the Senate \nmay conclude its consideration of this nomination. I urge the White \nHouse, as I have for more than 2 years, to work with us and, quoting \nfrom today's New York Times editorial:\n\n       The answer is not to try to twist the rules or demonize \n     Democrats. It is for the White House to consult with the \n     Senate and agree on nominees that senators from both parties \n     can in good conscience confirm.\n\n  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has \ncontinued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation and, in \nthis case, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country. \nThe nomination and confirmation process begins with the President, and \nI urge him to work with us to find a way forward to unite, instead of \ndivide, the Nation as well as the Senate on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont made a point that \nthe White House has seen these privileged documents in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. If they have any evidence of that, I would like to \nsee it because I know they haven't looked at those records. Those are \nthe most highly privileged records in the Justice Department.

PAUL DIXON\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nOhioan, a leader in higher education, a dear friend, and a good \nneighbor: Dr. Paul Dixon. Dr. Dixon is the current president of \nCedarville University, a Baptist liberal arts university located very \nnear my home, my wife Fran's home in Greene County, OH. Dr. Dixon is \nplanning to retire from that position in June of this year after a \nquarter of a century of great successful leadership. As the longest-\nserving president of any college or university in Ohio, Paul led the \nuniversity through an unprecedented period of growth and has\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nserved as an example and friend to many in our community.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to tell my colleagues in the \nSenate about Paul's great support and dedication to higher education. \nHe is an exemplary educator and a well respected and committed member \nof our local community.\n  Though Paul is retiring from his current position as university \npresident, we are pleased that he will remain at the university as \nchancellor and will continue to be a role model in our community.\n  Paul Dixon was born in Cincinnati, OH, and graduated from Tennessee \nTemple University in 1961, and Temple Baptist Theological Seminary in \n1964. After graduation, Paul spent 14 years as an evangelist where he \ntraveled the country preaching and ministering to communities and \nchurches and spoke for professional sports chapel programs, including \nthe Cincinnati Reds and the Bengals, the former Houston Oilers, and \nmost of the National League of baseball. He moved from Chattanooga, TN, \nto Cedarville, OH, in 1971 with his wife Pat, took a position with the \nfaculty of the Language and Literature Department of then Cedarville \nCollege.\n  In 1978, Cedarville University trustee member Donald Tyler \nrecommended Paul to the board of trustees as a replacement for the \nretiring university president, Dr. James T. Jeremiah. At the time, \nDonald was sure the idea of an evangelist serving as president would \nshock his fellow trustees. But, as Dr. Murray Murdoch's book, \n``Cedarville College: A Century of Commitment,'' tells the story, \nDonald Tyler felt compelled to suggest the successful young evangelist \nto the board as a candidate for the college's next leader.\n  Donald Tyler already knew Paul well as an influential evangelist. But \nhe also observed Paul's interest in and involvement with college \nstudents as a Cedarville resident and husband of a faculty member. Even \nthough he was not a CEO or business leader, Paul demonstrated \nleadership skills and began to establish himself as a visionary within \nthe community. Ultimately, these observations convinced Donald that \nPaul was the right person to serve as the new president, and the entire \nboard of trustees agreed. A glance at the past 25 years of Paul's \ntenure reveals Donald Tyler's instincts served the university well.\n  Paul's success as president of Cedarville University may be due in \npart to his God-given ability to balance stability and change.\n  With a strong vision and foresight, Paul led the university into a \nperiod of tremendous growth. Throughout his 25 years of leadership, \n$100 million in facilities have been built on a campus that has \nexpanded from 180 to 400 acres. The school attained university status \nin the year 2000 and now offers more than 100 programs of study, \nincluding a graduate degree. Enrollment grew from 1,185 students in \n1978 to more than 3,000 students today. Dr. Dixon also championed the \nuniversity's focus on technology, positioning the institution as an \naward-winning leader and pioneer in the digital age.\n  I must say, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, that the \nquality students that Cedarville University produces is really a \ntestament to Dr. Paul Dixon as a role model and to the high standards \nhe sets for the faculty and for the students. Without question, Paul \nDixon sets the bar high. But the young people--the young people--who \ngraduate from Cedarville University not only leave the school with a \ndiploma, but they also leave the school with a strong set of values to \nguide them in their future lives. That is due, in no small part, to Dr. \nPaul Dixon's dedication to each and every student and to his commitment \nto leading by example.\n  Apart from Paul's contributions to the growth and success of \nCedarville University and its students, he is an admired leader \nthroughout the surrounding community. KeyBank President William Hann \nsaid this of Paul:\n\n       Paul is value-driven. He is admired by the entire business \n     community because of his character, compassion, and \n     leadership.\n\n  Also, Mike Stephens, president of Greene Memorial Hospital in nearby \nXenia, OH, and former Cedarville University student, said this:\n\n       I have worked with Dr. Dixon on several community \n     leadership activities. He is a well respected and sought \n     after community leader, both for his ideas and vision.\n\n  Over the years, Paul Dixon has served the area through his leadership \non several local business and community boards.\n  He served on the regional board of directors for KeyBank in Dayton, \nwas a member of the Springfield/Clark County Chamber of Commerce Board \nof Directors, and was a part of the Greene County Development Task \nForce, as well as the Greene County Blue Ribbon Committee.\n  In addition to serving on these boards and committees, Paul Dixon has \nhosted several events at the university aimed at community outreach and \ndevelopment. Every year, Dr. Dixon has hosted Farmer's Night, with \nabout 250 to 300 local farmers attending, and Community Night, with \nabout 400 community leaders in attendance. These events have brought \npeople together to share problems, success stories, and ideas to better \nimprove our community.\n  Jackie Pyles, a resident of Cedarville, had this to say about Dr. \nDixon:\n\n       Through ``Farmer's Night,'' ``Community Night,'' and \n     consulting area businessmen in their areas of expertise, Dr. \n     Dixon has brought the University and community into a \n     relationship where they are more supportive of each other. \n     With Dr. Dixon's genuineness, love for people, and his \n     sincere sensitivity, he has helped people not look at the \n     University as a separate entity, but rather as an intricate \n     part of this community.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Paul Dixon has positively influenced the individual lives of so many, \nbut particularly his students. Students, university staff members, and \npeople in the surrounding community all speak of Paul's love for people \nand his impeccable personal integrity. Reflecting upon this legacy, \ncurrent trustee member Dr. Eugene Apple said this:\n\n       The accomplishments during Dr. Dixon's tenure as president \n     are well known and very impressive: new programs, campus \n     expansion, enrollment growth, and on and on. Having served on \n     the Board of Trustees for more than 20 years, I noted one \n     characteristic that seemed to rise above all else--his \n     integrity, not only with the Cedarville family, but in a very \n     quiet way with others in need of support, advice, \n     consultation, and help.\n\n  The mantle of his presidency has been passed on to Dr. William E. \nBrown, former president of Bryan College of Dayton, TN. And I \ncongratulate Dr. Brown and welcome him to our community. As I said, Dr. \nDixon will not be far away. He will continue to preach, continue to \nrepresent the university among a variety of constituencies, and tell \nthe Cedarville University story wherever he goes. Paul will end his \npresidency the way he began it, and that is by serving people and by \nserving the community.\n  Paul has a famous motto: ``Everything we do ought to have quality \nstamped all over it.'' It is well known by Cedarville University \nstudents, staff, faculty, and the surrounding community. It truly \ncaptures the essence of who Dr. Paul Dixon is as a person and his \nmission in life. As the longest-serving college president in Ohio and \nthe 12th longest-serving president in our Nation, Paul's example of \nstability, commitment, leadership, faithfulness, and quality is \nunparalleled.\n  My wife, Fran, and I extend our deepest appreciation to Dr. Paul \nDixon for his dedication to college students, his leadership in higher \neducation in Ohio, and his service to the village of Cedarville and the \nsurrounding area. We both cherish Paul and his wife Pat's friendship \nand wish them our warmest congratulations and an enjoyable retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5719-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5719-S5720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Members of this \nesteemed body the story of Lance Corporal Donald John Cline. John's \nwife Tina wants to make sure that their young sons know that their dad \nwas ``a proud father, a proud husband, and a proud Marine.'' Dakota, \ntwo and a half, and Dillon, 7 months, won't be able to know him as they \ngrow up because their father gave his life in Iraq to protect this \nnation and defend our freedom. As part of the legacy he left to his \nboys, I honor him today.\n  John and Tina met and became friends in 1997 when their families \nlived in the same apartment complex and both attended Reed High School \nin\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nSparks, NV. According to Tina, John always wanted to be a Marine, and \nhe was already signed up and ready to join during his senior year of \nhigh school.\n  John graduated from Marine boot camp on October 20, 2000. The next \nday, he and Tina were married at the American Legion Hall. John was \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment of the 2nd Marine \nExpeditionary Brigade based at Camp Lejeune, NC. Just after last \nChristmas, John received his orders to ship out to the Middle East.\n  On March 23, John was killed in an amphibious vehicle hit by enemy \nfire during an ambush in the southern Iraq town of An Nasiriyah. Lance \nCorporal Cline was 21 years old when he died. Tina says that she ``saw \na teenager grow up to be a man.''\n  Unfortunately, I did not know John, but I can assure you that the \ndedication of this brave, proud Marine has touched my life. John's \nservice to this Nation, on behalf of all of us, is truly inspiring. I \nwant Tina and her boys to know that we are a grateful Nation for the \nman John became and for his courageous contributions to the United \nStates of America and freedom-loving nations around the world.\n  I know my colleagues join me in praying for strength for John's wife \nand children as they deal with the loss of this American hero. As his \nyoung sons grow, I hope they will realize how grateful this Nation is \nfor their sacrifice and the ultimate sacrifice that their father made.\n  God bless the Cline family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5720-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past few months the International \nCriminal Court, ICC, has taken important steps towards becoming an \neffective forum to hold accountable those accused of war crimes, \ngenocide, and crimes against humanity. By all accounts, the countries \nparticipating in these negotiations did an excellent job of selecting \nqualified jurists and, perhaps most importantly, a responsible and \nexperienced prosecutor.\n  But an important voice is missing from these negotiations. That voice \nis the United States, a country which was founded on the principles of \nthe rule of law, human rights, and democratic freedoms.\n  Perhaps more than at any other time, the past few months have \nhighlighted the folly of the Bush administration's policy towards the \nICC.\n  The whole world wants the United States to be involved with the \ndevelopment of this institution. Yet, instead of seizing this \nopportunity to shape the Court in our interests, we are one of the only \ndemocracies sitting on the sidelines--joined by some of the world's \nworst human rights offenders. It is an embarrassment, and contrary to \nthe arguments of those who oppose the Court, it is self-defeating.\n  Instead of making sure that the ICC will function the way we want it \nto, this Administration withdrew our signature from the Rome Treaty and \nsupported legislation, the American Service Members Protection Act, \nopenly hostile to the ICC.\n  Instead of working to influence the selection of judges, prosecutors, \nand other ICC officials, our negotiators are not even sitting at the \ntable.\n  Has the administration taken this position because they believe \nengagement is not a viable strategy to promote U.S. interests in \ninternational negotiations?\n  Clearly not. One need only look at their position on military \ntraining assistance to the Indonesian Armed Forces. Despite the fact \nthe Indonesian military is a corrupt, brutal institution that has been \nimplicated in the deaths of American citizens, the State Department \nsays that U.S. aid to this institution ``provides a vehicle for the \nUnited States to impart our ideas about civil-military relations to \nforeign military audiences, and to promote military reform.''\n  I don't favor training the Indonesian military unless they show they \nwant to reform. Then we can and should help them.\n  But the ICC is an institution designed to punish the world's worst \ncriminals. The Administration refuses to engage with the ICC, but it \nwill engage with the Indonesian military. If anything, it should be the \nother way around. We should be working to shape the ICC, an imperfect \nbut potentially valuable institution, to promote U.S. interests, while \ndistancing ourselves from institutions that are corrupt, abusive and \nincapable of reform.\n  The administration points to efforts to combat international \nterrorism as the reason that it wants to restore military training for \nIndonesia. The same can be said for the ICC. The Court could become an \nimportant forum to try dictators or others involved in atrocities--\nproviding an important tool to deter acts of international terrorism.\n  Another explanation for the administration's policy might be that the \nUnited States simply got nowhere during previous negotiating sessions \nand further engagement simply will not yield results.\n  In fact, during the negotiations on the Rome Treaty, the U.S. \ndelegation worked to ensure that the Court will serve our national \ninterests by being a strong, effective institution. They succeeded in \ninserting a number of important safeguards, including provisions to \ndeter frivolous prosecutions.\n  Like any international agreement, the U.S. did not get 100 percent of \nwhat we wanted in the negotiations. However, that is why the U.S. \nshould remain involved with the Court. As the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, has said, U.S. policy toward \nthe International Criminal Court should be one of ``aggressive \nengagement.''\n  Instead, the Bush administration has taken its bat and ball and \nwalked off the field. While this might make those opposed to the Court \nfeel better, the fact of the matter is that the ICC is a reality--even \nthe Bush administration acknowledges this. It is rapidly becoming \noperational and will have jurisdiction over offenses committed on the \nterritory of state parties, even if those offenses are committed by the \ncitizens of nonparty states.\n  Bush administration officials have said over and over that the power \nof the prosecutor is one of the main reasons that they oppose the ICC. \nIn March, the New York Times reported that, because of the historic \nrole that the United States has played in international justice, many \nnations sought to appoint an American as Chief Prosecutor to the Court.\n  I can think of few measures that would have been more effective in \naccomplishing the Administration's stated goal of guarding against \npolitical prosecutions of American soldiers than having an American \ncitizen serve as Chief Prosecutor. However, the New York Times article \nwent on to point out that the Administration's policy of being openly \nhostile towards the ICC was precluding an American from being appointed \nto this critical position.\n  Ultimately, an Argentine was selected as the prosecutor. While this \nprosecutor appears to be a very capable, distinguished individual, one \ngets the sense that if U.S. policy towards the ICC had been less \nhostile, an American would now occupy that position.\n  The U.S. need not be estranged from the ICC. Our closest allies, \nalmost all of whom are strong supporters of the Court, have made it \nclear that with or without U.S. ratification of the Rome Treaty they \nwould welcome our involvement in guiding its development.\n  As a signatory to the final document of the Rome Conference we had \nthe right to participate in all of the various preparatory meetings \nleading up to the creation of the Court. Despite its concerns about the \nCourt--or rather, because of them--it is bewildering that the Bush \nadministration chose to not even send U.S. representatives to \nparticipate in the final negotiations.\n  Instead of supporting frivolous legislation that declares war on The \nHague and would cut off military assistance to a number of key friends \nand allies, this administration should reconsider its position on the \nICC.\n  By sitting on the sidelines, the United States is losing out on its \nability to influence the structure and culture of this important new \ninstitution. Each time we refuse to join another treaty or \ninternational organization, which has become a pattern of this \nadministration, we erode our international leadership.\n  I urge the administration to re-engage in a discussion with the \nCongress, and with our allies, of how the United States can once again \nplay a constructive, leadership role in ensuring that the International \nCriminal Court effectively carries out its historic mandate.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5721-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5721-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               88TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 88th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide, in which 1\\1/2\\ million men, \nwomen, and children lost their lives as a result of the brutal \nmassacres and wholesale deportation conducted by the Ottoman Turkish \nrulers against their Armenian citizens. This was the first genocide of \nthe 20th century. Today, as we remember the bravery and sacrifice of \nthe Armenian people in the face of great suffering, we renew our \ncommitment to protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all \nhumanity.\n  As time passes, we must not forget the terrible blows that befell the \nArmenians in 1915. On April 24 of that year, more than 250 Armenian \nintellectuals and civil leaders in Constantinople were rounded up and \nkilled, in what was the first stage of a methodical plan to exterminate \nthe Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire. Next, Armenian soldiers \nserving in the Ottoman army were segregated into labor battalions and \nbrutally murdered. In towns and villages across Anatolia, Armenian \nleaders were arrested and killed. And then the remaining Armenian \npopulation, women, children, and the elderly, were driven from their \nhomes and deported to the Syrian desert.\n  ``Deportation'' was merely a euphemism for what were, in reality, \ndeath marches. Ottoman Turkish soldiers allowed brigands and released \nconvicts to kill and rape the deportees at will; often the soldiers \nthemselves participated in the attacks. Driven into the desert without \nfood and water, weakened by the long march, hundreds of thousands of \ndeportees succumbed to starvation. In areas of Anatolia where \ndeportation was not deemed practicable, other vicious means were used. \nIn the towns along the Black Sea coast, for example, thousands of \nArmenians were packed on boats and drowned.\n  The efforts to destroy the Armenian population did not pass unnoticed \nat the time. Leslie Davis, a U.S. diplomat stationed in eastern \nAnatolia, wrote in a State Department cable of July 24, 1915: ``It has \nbeen no secret that the plan was to destroy the Armenian race as a \nrace, but the methods used have been more cold-blooded and barbarous, \nif not more effective, than I had at first supposed.''\n  Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey at the time and who \npersonally made vigorous appeals to stop the genocide, called it ``the \ngreatest horror in history.'' He later wrote: ``Whatever crimes the \nmost perverted instincts of the human mind can devise, and whatever \nrefinements of persecutions and injustice the most debased imagination \ncan conceive, became the daily misfortunes of this devoted people. I am \nconfident that the whole history of the human race contains no such \nhorrible episode as this.''\n  Despite this testimony from U.S. diplomats who were witness to the \nevents, and the abundance of evidence documenting the Armenian \ngenocide, the argument continues to be made in some quarters that it \nnever occurred. Much of that evidence was collected by our diplomats, \nand along with survivors' accounts, is housed in our National Archives. \nI have no doubt that if he were told that some continue to reject it, \nAmbassador Morgenthau would be astonished and outraged. Coming to terms \nwith history is a difficult and painful process, as the experiences of \nSouth Africa and the countries of the former Soviet Bloc have shown. \nBut we have also learned how pernicious attempts to falsify history \nare. Not only do they insult the memory of those who suffered or \nperished, but they leave us all more vulnerable because they weaken the \nfabric of our common humanity.\n  Many survivors of the genocide settled in this country, built new \nlives for themselves, and raised families here. They have made \nextraordinary contributions to every aspect of our national life, while \npreserving their own rich faith and cultural traditions. That Americans \nof Armenian origin have prospered in so many different ways stands as a \nrebuke to those who would deny the horrors of 1915. Americans of all \nbackgrounds join them in commemorating the tragedy of the Armenian \ngenocide. Together we must commit to building a world in which history \nshall not repeat itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5721-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5721-S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICAL RECORDS PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the issue of one's privacy is something \nthat resonates throughout each and every one of our lives on a daily \nbasis. As Americans we enjoy the luxury of certain forms of privacy, \nwhile at the same time live within the very constraints of a society \nthat is experiencing an erosion of our privacy rights with each passing \nday, consequently affecting the boundaries of individual freedoms. \nJeffrey Rosen, noted author of the book called ``The Unwanted Gaze, The \nDestruction of Privacy in America,'' stated that ``it is surprising how \nrecent changes in law and technology have been permitted to undermine \nsanctuaries of privacy that Americans took for granted throughout most \nof our history.'' Furthermore, he states that ``there is nothing \ninevitable about the erosion of privacy, just as there is nothing \ninevitable about its reconstruction.''\n  On April 14, 2003, America experienced the beginning of comprehensive \nguidelines governing the world of medical privacy. This day marked the \nfinal compliance for health care providers who are implementing the new \nregulations laid out in the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, HIPAA. Originally known as the Kennedy-Kassebaum \nlegislation, passed in 1996, this bill was the result of over a \ndecade's worth of input regarding the privacy of patients' medical \nrecords. As we move forward with these changes, it is important to note \na few of the significant alterations that will impact both health care \nentities and consumers.\n  HIPAA was enacted by the Federal Government to give patients more \ncontrol over their health information as well as provide greater \nboundaries for the use and release of health records. As of April 14, \nhospitals, health care providers, health plans, and clearinghouses will \nbe working under stricter guidelines in regards to patient records. \nHealth care entities will be restricted from releasing information \nregarding inpatient, outpatient, or emergency room patients unless that \npatient agrees to such a release in specific written documentation. \nFederal law, rather than various State regulations, will now protect \nthe confidentiality of medical files. Consumers will be able to find \nout who has tried to have access to their medical records. This new law \nwill also prohibit marketers from obtaining personal medical \ninformation without an individual's consent. These are just a few of \nthe many new regulations set to take place as a result of \nimplementation of HIPAA law.\n  Health care providers have had to rearrange existing procedures, as \nwell as yield additional funding to meet the April 14 compliance \ndeadline. This has proven to be more challenging for some entities than \nothers especially those in rural areas where financial and workforce \nconstraints are often greater than for their urban counterparts.\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n  Hailed by medical consumer groups as a significant advance in \nprotecting the rights of consumers and the privacy of medical records, \nsome have expressed concern that the regulations are cumbersome or \ndon't go far enough. Before HIPAA, however, there were few rules in \nplace to the coherence of patient safety. Consumers now will find great \ncomfort in knowing significant protections are being undertaken to \nprotect their personal medical information.\n  As we move forward with implementation of these new privacy \nregulations, I will continue to monitor these new rules and solicit \nfeedback from consumers and health providers alike about medical and \nother privacy issues so critically important to our everyday lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5722-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN RECOGNITION OF WILLIAM W. FENNIMAN, POLICE CHIEF OF DOVER, NH\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \ncontribution to public safety and community building made by Dover, NH, \nPolice Chief William W. Fenniman.\n  Chief Fenniman was first appointed as a Dover police officer in 1981. \nHe rose through the ranks and in 1991, just 10 years later, was \nappointed the chief of police in Dover. Chief Fenniman has led his \nDepartment to become only the 49th police department in the country to \nbe nationally accredited three times by the Commission on Accreditation \nfor Law Enforcement Agencies. Under Chief Fenniman's leadership, the \nDover police department has also had the distinction of being the first \npolice department in the State of New Hampshire to be accredited \nthrough the State accreditation system. Chief Fenniman's success at the \nhelm of the police department is a testament to his dedication, hard \nwork and determination to strengthen the community through an expansive \nand effective law enforcement agency that truly is an integral part of \nthe community.\n  Chief Fenniman has concentrated on fostering strong ties to and \nwithin the community. Chief Fenniman's focus on creating lasting and \npositive relationships between the community and law enforcement has \nbrought crime levels down and improved community spirit. The creation \nof a youth safe haven and police ministation in partnership with the \ncity housing authority to provide outlets and activities for children \nafter school hours continues to flourish each year.\n  I am honored to participate in the Afterschool Alliance ``Breakfast \nof Champions'' event to present Chief William Fenniman with the 2003 \nAfterschool Community Champion award. Chief Fenniman has made a \nsignificant commitment to helping the children of his community find \npositive activities to do after their school days are over, and his \nwork has helped to increase community ties and reduce crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5722-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CITIZENS BANK DOES THE RIGHT THING\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncommend Citizens Bank for the strong support it is giving to its \nemployees who have been called up for active duty in connection with \nthe Nation's military deployments in Iraq.\n  Many of us in Congress continue to be concerned that many members of \nthe National Guard and Reserves have been activated with too little of \nthis needed support, or even none at all. We have introduced \nlegislation, S. 647, to deal with these urgent problems for all \nactivated Guard and Reserve members and their families.\n  Citizens Bank deserves credit for strengthening its personnel \npolicies to support its brave men and women called to serve. \nUnfortunately, too many Guard and Reserve families are not as \nfortunate, and I hope Congress will act quickly to provide this needed \nrelief.\n  I ask that a statement by Citizens on February 10 announcing its \nimpressive policy may be printed in the Record.\n  The Statement follows.\n\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. Enhances Military Leave Policy, February \n                                10, 2003\n\n       Citizens Financial Group, Inc. announced today is has \n     enhanced the company's existing military leave policy to \n     offer additional support to any employee/reservist activated \n     during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       ``These are difficult and uncertain times in our nation. \n     The current situation in the Persian Gulf has made real the \n     possibility that Citizens' colleagues or family members may \n     be called to serve their country,'' said Lawrence K. Fish, \n     Chairman, President & CEO.\n       ``We are concerned about our employees and providing \n     benefits that match their needs,'' said Fish. ``We hope it \n     won't be necessary for employees to use these benefits, but \n     we are offering the support in the event it is needed.''\n       In its new military leave policy, Citizens Bank will: Pay \n     the difference between employees' Citizens pay and the \n     military pay for the duration of the active duty. This \n     benefit is currently only available for the annual summer \n     camp; offer the continuance of medical, dental, vision and \n     life insurance coverage; and provide a comparable job upon \n     return.\n       Citizens will also offer support to employees whose spouse, \n     domestic partner or child is called to duty. Citizens will \n     grant a paid leave of absence for five consecutive days to \n     coincide with an in-service leave by the family member. If \n     travel is necessary, Citizens will also pay a portion of \n     their travel expenses.\n       Citizens Financial Group, Inc. is a $56.5 billion \n     commercial bank holding company headquartered in Providence, \n     RI.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to the Pulaski County School System for receiving the Public \nEducation Achieves in Kentucky Award from the Kentucky School Boards \nAssociation. The Pulaski County School System has distinguished itself \nthrough its outstanding efforts to promote gifted and talented \nstudents.\n  The Kentucky School Boards Association's Public Education Achieves in \nKentucky Award was first awarded in 1997 to bring statewide attention \nto public school programs that enhance the impact that elementary and \nsecondary schools have on young people. This award was well earned by \nthe members of the Pulaski County School System under the leadership of \nSuperintendent Tim Eaton.\n  The faculty of the Pulaski County School System have demonstrated \nexcellence in the classroom by making a difference in the lives of \ntheir students.

Mr. President, I rise today with great pride \nto pay tribute to our Armed Forces involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nThanks to the dedication and valor of more than 200,000 of our brave \nmen and women in uniform, the Iraqi people have been liberated from the \noppressive and murderous grip of Saddam Hussein and, I believe, this \nNation and the world are safer today than they were a few weeks ago.\n  The successes of our Armed Forces in Iraq are unprecedented. In 3 \nshort weeks, our troops marched 300 miles to the heart of Baghdad, \nliberated fortified Iraqi cities along the way, and removed Saddam \nHussein's entrenched, brutal regime from power. All the while, they \nworked honorably to minimize civilian casualties, preserve Iraq's \ninfrastructure, distribute food and medical aid to innocent Iraqis, and \ntreat enemy POWs with dignity and respect. In short, our troops engaged \nin battle with purpose, determination, and compassion. They not only \ndefended but embodied American values.\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nTheir service on our behalf should make all Americans proud.\n  Yet we know that this war, like any war, was not won without cost. \nDespite the unprecedented achievements of Operation Iraqi Freedom, both \nin terms of a mission accomplished and the relatively few coalition \ncasualties, American lives were lost. More than 100 U.S. soldiers, who \nvolunteered to trade the comforts of family and home for a desert \nbattlefield halfway around the world, will not see the fruits of their \nsacrifice. They join those brave souls throughout our history who died \nfor freedom's cause. As we salute the members of our Armed Forces for a \njob well done, we pay solemn tribute to all those whose ultimate \nsacrifice helped make victory in Iraq possible.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, as we honor the collective sacrifice by all \nour military men and women, we remember our fallen heroes as \nindividuals. We recall the lives and legacy of those who died to \nprotect us. Each name represents a life--a mother, a father, a sister, \na brother, a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife. Each leaves behind \nsomeone who was touched by their goodness and sustained by their love. \nEach has a story that deserves to be told.\n  I would like to take a few moments to recall those fallen heroes from \nmy home State of Illinois. Seven young men from various parts of my \nState have lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Marine Captain Ryan Beaupre from St. Anne, IL, age 30, died piloting \na helicopter that crashed a few miles from the Iraqi border. Ryan was \nan honor student and athlete at Bishop McNamara High School and \nreceived a bachelor's degree at Illinois Wesleyan College. He left a \npromising career in the insurance business to serve his country and \nfulfill his boyhood dream of flying. Ryan lived his dream as a pilot in \nthe 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. According to friends and relatives, \nRyan was the ``boy next door''--red hair, freckles, and a wide smile. \nAs one friend put it, Ryan ``would be anybody's friend and apparently \nhe was.''\n  Marine Private Jonathan Lee Gifford from Decatur, IL, age 30, was \nkilled in an ambush in Southern Iraq. Jonathan served in the 1st \nBattalion, 2nd Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, which suffered \nheavy casualties in the first days of the war. A 1991 graduate of \nStephen Decatur High School, Jonathan joined the Marines in 2001, \nfulfilling an ambition he had harbored since he was a teenager. His \nloved ones say Jonathan was always for the underdog, an attitude which \nhelped motivate his service in Iraq. He leaves behind friends and \nfamily, including a much loved four-year-old daughter.\n  Marine Corporal Evan James from La Harpe, IL, age 20, was killed \ntrying to cross a canal in southeastern Iraq. CPL James, a recent \ngraduate from La Harpe High School, served with the 6th Engineering \nSupport Battalion based in Peoria, Illinois. Prior to being called to \nactive duty, Evan had been studying at Southern Illinois University to \nbe a physical fitness trainer. According to those who knew him best, \nEvan was an incredibly giving young man. As one high school friend \nsaid, ``Evan was an all-American boy. He would do anything for his \ncountry, for his school, for his friends.''\n  Marine Corporal Brian Matthew Kennedy from Glenview, IL, age 25, was \nkilled when his helicopter crashed south of Iraq. Brian attended \nGlenbrook South High School in Glenview, where his grit and \ndetermination enabled him to be a successful starting offensive lineman \nfor the football team at a mere 170 pounds. That same determination \nserved Brian well throughout his all too brief life. Brian's friends \nand family describe him as an extraordinarily conscientious young man \nwith a firmly positive outlook on life. As a member of the 3d Marine \nAircraft Wing, Corporal Kennedy was the quintessential marine: He took \npride in everything he did and met life's challenges with skill and \ndetermination.\n  Army Specialist Brandon Rowe from Roscoe, IL, age 20, was killed in \nan ambush near the Iraqi city of Najaf. A recent graduate of Hononegah \nHigh School, Brandon was the youngest of four siblings. Shortly after \nhis high school graduation, Brandon joined the 101st Airborne Division \nbased in Campbell, KY. Gifted with thoughtfulness and humor, Army SP \nRowe was known for using wit and laughter to put others at ease. \nBrandon's family said he genuinely believed in his mission and knew his \nservice would help liberate oppressed Iraqis.\n  Staff Sergeant Lincoln Hollinsaid from Malden, IL, age 27, was killed \nby enemy fire as he led his unit into combat. A soldier in the 11th \nEngineer Battalion, Lincoln joined the Army in 1995, shortly after \ngraduating from Princeton High School in Malden. Lincoln's father has \nsaid his son loved two things: the military and the outdoors. When he \nwasn't marching for the Army, he was marching through the mountains, \nhunting and fishing. Never one to shy from duty, SSG Hollinsaid had \ntransferred to a new military unit prior to the war to improve his \nchances for combat.\n  First Sergeant Edward Smith, age 38, grew up in Chicago. He died from \nwounds suffered in battle. Edward had been serving as a reserve police \nofficer in Anaheim, CA before being called to active duty as a member \nof the 1st Marine Division. Edward's wife Sandy described her husband \nthis way: ``He was an unbelievable man. He had such a good heart. He \ncared about people. He was just the best man I've ever known.'' Edward \nleaves behind a loving wife and three young children.\n  Mr. President, these young individuals were ordinary men who lived \nextraordinary lives of service to America and the cause of freedom. \nThey had many promising years ahead of them, and they leave behind \nfamily and friends who will miss them dearly. As we mourn their loss, \nwe honor their sacrifice. On behalf of the Senate and the proud state \nof Illinois, I salute these fine young men and all the other soldiers \nkilled in combat, and wish their loved ones comfort, peace, and peace \nof mind. To them I say on behalf of our country: Your loved ones were \ntruly heroes. Their bravery and dedication will live in our memories \nfor all time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5723-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5723-S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EINAR V.

This is certainly a fitting way \nto publicly express our gratitude to Governor Dyhrkopp for his \ncommitment and dedication to the Postal Service by naming the post \noffice in his hometown in his honor.\n  Governor Dyhrkopp was appointed a Governor to the U.S. Postal Service \nBoard of Governors by President William J. Clinton on November 24, \n1993. He served in this capacity with distinction until December 2002. \nDuring his tenure, he served as a member of the Capital Projects and \nCompensation Committees; Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee; \nVice Chairman; and Chairman of the Board of Governors for two terms.\n  Among the accomplishments of the Postal Service during his period of \nservice was an unprecedented 5 straight years of positive net income \nfor the Postal Service. In addition, the Postal Service improved \nperformance to the point where 94 percent of first-class mail destined \nfor next-day delivery received overnight service through most of the \ncountry. Also, the Postal Service achieved breakthroughs in \nproductivity which allowed the Postal Service to reduce its workforce \nthrough attrition. Finally, the Postal Service created a comprehensive \nTransformation Plan, proposing a new business model that would maintain \nuniversal service and strengthen the mail system.\n  Governor Dyhrkopp is President of Tecumseh International Corporation, \na coal marketing firm. Recently, he retired from an active banking \ncareer after nearly 35 years of service. Dyhrkopp's interests extend to \nagriculture, and he has been a livestock and grain farmer. In addition, \nGovernor Dyhrkopp has initiated land development and managed a \nconstruction company specializing in commercial and housing building. \nFor 22 years, he was chief executive officer and partner of a southern \nIllinois manufacturing firm specializing in electronic cabinetry for \nleading American firms.\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n  A former mayor of Shawneetown, Governor Dyhrkopp has served on \nseveral State of Illinois commissions, most recently the Commission on \nthe Future of Afro-American Males. Dyhrkopp is also a member of the \nRegional Advisory Board of the Southern Illinois University Public \nPolicy Institute.\n  During World War II, Governor Dyhrkopp served in the Navy on the \ndestroyer-minelayer U.S.S. Aaron Ward, DM 34, which endured major \nsuicide plane damage at the Battle of Okinawa.\n  Governor Dyhrkopp is married to Francis Lambert Saunders and they are \nthe parents of one son and three grandchildren. In addition to his \nrewarding family life, Einar is a member of the American Legion, the \nMasonic Lodge, the Scottish Rites Bodies, the Shrine, and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars.\n  Governor Dyhrkopp's contributions to the United States Postal Service \nand the Shawneetown community deserve special and lasting recognition. \nI have admired his dedication and appreciated his friendship.\n  In the words of my friend Senator Paul Simon, ``Einar Dyhrkopp \nrepresents responsible citizenship at its best. He has aided his \ncommunity and provided leadership on the State and national scene. He \nhas gone out of his way to help those who need assistance.''\n  Establishing the Einar V. Dyhrkopp Post Office in Shawneetown, IL, \nwill ensure that Governor Dyhrkopp's exemplary service to his community \nand Nation is properly and publicly acknowledged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/05/senate-section/article/S5724-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SUDAN--PM 30\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 5, 2003, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received the following message from the President of the \nUnited States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing herewith \na 6-month periodic report prepared by my Administration on the national \nemergency with respect to Sudan that was declared in Executive Order \n13067 of November 3, 1997.\n                                                      George W.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the ability \n     and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older \n     Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or \n     with one's own family and to become a productive member of \n     the community.\n       (2) Research on the provision of long-term services and \n     supports under the medicaid program (conducted by and on \n     behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has \n     revealed a significant funding bias toward institutional \n     care. Only about 27 percent of long term care funds expended \n     under the medicaid program, and only about 9 percent of all \n     funds expended under that program, pay for services and \n     supports in home and community-based settings.\n       (3) In the case of medicaid beneficiaries who need long \n     term care, the only long-term care service currently \n     guaranteed by Federal law in every State is nursing home \n     care. Only 27 States have adopted the benefit option of \n     providing personal care services under the medicaid program. \n     Although every State has chosen to provide certain services \n     under home and community-based waivers, these services are \n     unevenly available within and across States, and reach a \n     small percentage of eligible individuals. In fiscal year \n     2000, only 3 States spent 50 percent or more of their \n     medicaid long term care funds under the medicaid program on \n     home and community-based care.\n       (4) Despite the funding bias and the uneven distribution of \n     home and community-based services, 2\\1/2\\ times more people \n     are served in home and community-based settings than in \n     institutional settings.\n       (5) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     families of children with disabilities, working-age adults \n     with disabilities, and older Americans with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \n     needs;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize independence in the home \n     and community, including in the workplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reform the medicaid program established under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to \n     provide equal access to community-based attendant services \n     and supports.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they \n     reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive \n     statewide long-term services and supports, including \n     community-based attendant services and supports that provide \n     consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to designate Colombia under section 244 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act in order to make nationals of Colombia \neligible for temporary protected status under such section; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, amid all the discussions about \nreconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is easy for us\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nto lose sight of other humanitarian crises. One particularly pressing \nyet overlooked crisis is taking place right here in this hemisphere. \nFor almost 40 years, an internal conflict has ravaged Colombia. Rebel \nand paramilitary groups designated as terrorist organizations by the \nState Department have committed thousands of kidnapings, executions and \nother brutalities. With an estimated combined force of 25,000 \ninsurgents, they have disrupted life throughout the country and have \ndisplaced nearly 2 million people, creating the third largest internal \nrefugee crisis in the world. The Colombian people are doing everything \nin their power to fight the rebels and rein in the paramilitaries, but \nthe conflict shows no signs of ending anytime soon.\n  We should continue to help Colombia battle the terrorists in its \nmidst. In the meantime, however, it would be unconscionable for us to \nforcibly deport law-abiding nationals currently residing in the United \nStates, thereby placing them in danger of being tortured, kidnaped, or \neven murdered upon their return to their war-torn homeland. The bill I \nam introducing today will grant many of these people temporary \nprotected status from deportation until it is safe for them to return \nto Colombia. The bill will not grant amnesty to any illegal aliens, nor \nwill it place any immigrants on the path to citizenship. It is a purely \nhumanitarian act that enjoys plenty of precedent--refugees from several \nCentral American and African nations have benefited from temporary \nprotected status in the wake of natural disasters and political \nturmoil. Immigration laws state that this protection covers only \nextraordinary circumstances, but we must not hesitate to invoke it when \nthose circumstances arise. Extending temporary protected status to \nColombians is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Colombian Temporary \n     Protected Status Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Colombia has been embroiled in a 38-year internal \n     conflict, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of \n     civilians and combatants;\n       (2) the 2 main armed anti-government rebel groups, the \n     Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas \n     Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC) and the National \n     Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional, or ELN), \n     have engaged in military activities in 700 of 1,098 \n     municipalities in Colombia, and in recent years have \n     influenced local governments in as much as 40 percent to 50 \n     percent of Colombian territory;\n       (3) the FARC and ELN not only attack police and military \n     forces but also regularly attack civilian populations, commit \n     massacres and extrajudicial killings, collect war taxes, \n     compel citizens into their ranks, force farmers to grow \n     illicit crops, and regulate travel, commerce, and other \n     activities;\n       (4) paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense \n     Groups of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia or AUC), \n     originally established to protect rural landowners, have \n     grown dramatically in recent years to become a major national \n     military force in Colombia;\n       (5) paramilitary groups are responsible, according to human \n     rights groups, for the greatest number of extrajudicial \n     killings and forced disappearances in Colombia since 1995;\n       (6) the FARC, ELN, and AUC, all designated by the State \n     Department as foreign terrorist organizations, have an \n     estimated combined force of 25,000 combatants;\n       (7) the Government of Colombia, particularly during the \n     administration of President Andres Pastrana, has afforded \n     armed rebel groups numerous opportunities to negotiate a \n     peace agreement, including the extraordinary step in November \n     1998 of creating a safe haven for the FARC by withdrawing its \n     security forces from 5 municipalities covering some 16,000 to \n     17,000 square miles;\n       (8) despite having been given the opportunity to seek \n     peace, the FARC instead used the safe haven to enhance its \n     military capability to further its violent campaign against \n     the government and people of Colombia;\n       (9) while President Pastrana and the Colombian government \n     negotiated in good faith, the FARC proceeded to kidnap \n     political officials;\n       (10) in February 2002, the FARC's actions forced President \n     Pastrana to withdraw from the peace process and begin the \n     process of retaking the safe zone he had previously ceded to \n     the FARC and other rebel groups;\n       (11) after the election of Alvaro Uribe as Colombia's \n     President, the FARC began targeting mayors with letters \n     declaring that they had 24 hours to leave or would be \n     considered ``military targets'';\n       (12) although before the recent Presidential election the \n     violence had been mostly contained in rural areas, it has now \n     spread to the urban areas, with cities such as Medellin \n     experiencing an average of 13 killings a day;\n       (13) an average of 2.8 rebel bombs go off every day in \n     Colombia while bomb squads disarm another 5;\n       (14) the middle and upper classes have been targeted for \n     kidnaping, with an average of 3,250 Colombians being kidnaped \n     each year since 1998;\n       (15) between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 people have been \n     forced to leave their homes, representing the third largest \n     internal refugee crisis in the world; and\n       (16) between 1,500 and 2,500 Colombians were massacred in \n     contested rural areas in 2001.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, in view of the recent \n     escalation of the current civil war in Colombia, Colombia \n     qualifies for designation under section 244(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)(A)), \n     pursuant to which Colombian nationals would be eligible for \n     temporary protected status in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY \n                   PROTECTED STATUS TO COLOMBIANS.\n\n       (a) Designation.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Colombia \n     shall be treated as if it had been designated under \n     subsection (b) of that section, subject to the provisions of \n     this section.\n       (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such \n     designation shall begin on the date of enactment of this Act \n     and shall remain in effect for 1 year.\n       (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) pursuant to \n     the designation made under this section, subject to section \n     244(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1254a(c)(3)), an alien who is a national of Colombia meets \n     the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of that Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1254a(c)(1)) only if--\n       (1) the alien has been continuously physically present in \n     the United States since the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as \n     otherwise provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(A)), \n     and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under \n     section 244(c)(2)(B) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B)); \n     and\n       (3) the alien registers for temporary protected status in a \n     manner that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     establish.\n       (c) Consent to Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall give the prior consent to travel abroad \n     described in section 244(f)(3) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(f)(3)) to an alien who is \n     granted temporary protected status pursuant to the \n     designation made under this section, if the alien establishes \n     to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the \n     control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, \n     temporary trip abroad. An alien returning to the United \n     States in accordance with such an authorization shall be \n     treated the same as any other returning alien provided \n     temporary protected status under section 244 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 987. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for national standardized payment amounts for inpatient \nhospital services furnished under the medicare program and to make \nother rural health care improvements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nRural Health Care Fairness and Medicare Equity Act, that will help to \nmake Medicare reimbursement more fair and equitable for rural and small \nurban hospitals and physicians. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by Senator Burns.\n  First, let me take a few minutes to describe some of the challenges \nfacing rural health care systems and why I feel it is critical for the \nSenate to act now to reduce the inequities in Medicare funding between \nrural and urban providers.\n  Rural America depends on its small town hospitals, physicians and \nnurses, nursing homes, emergency ambulance services, and other members \nof our rural health care system. And because of past cuts in Medicare \nreimbursement, plus the historical unfairness in Medicare payments, \nthese vital services are in jeopardy. Fortunately, Congress acted in \n1999 and again in 2000 to address some of the cuts that turned out to \nhave a larger impact than intended.\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\n  However, additional legislation is still needed to improve Medicare \nreimbursement for health care providers in order to stabilize the \nMedicare program and ensure that beneficiaries, especially in rural \nareas, will continue to have access to their local hospitals, \nphysicians, nursing homes, home health, and other services. Many small \nrural hospitals in particular serve as the anchor for the full range of \nhealth care services in their communities, from ambulatory to long-term \ncare. Medicare is the single most significant payer for services at \nthese hospitals, and as such, it has an impact on the whole community.\n  Part of the problem in North Dakota is simply demographics: North \nDakota's population is the fifth oldest in the Nation, and about two-\nthirds of North Dakota's 103,000 Medicare beneficiaries live in rural \nareas. In addition, North Dakota's population--and the population of \nmany rural states in our Nation's Heartland--is shrinking daily. In \nfact, in 13 of North Dakota's counties, there were 20 or fewer births \nfor the entire county in 2001.\n  Admissions to rural hospitals have dropped by a drastic 60 percent in \nthe last two decades, and those patients who do remain tend to be \nolder, poorer, and sicker. This means that rural hospitals tend to be \ndisproportionately dependent upon Medicare reimbursement, to the extent \nthat Medicare accounts for 75 to 80 percent of the revenue for some \nrural hospitals. Obviously, given this reality, Medicare reimbursement \nhas a major impact on the financial health of rural hospitals.\n  Another part of the problem is that Medicare has historically \nreimbursed urban health care providers at a much higher rate than their \nrural counterparts. North Dakota Medicare beneficiaries pay the exact \nsame Medicare payroll taxes and premiums as beneficiaries elsewhere but \nreceive less benefit from the Medicare program. Medicare beneficiaries \nin North Dakota receive an average of $4,458 in Medicare benefits. This \nis $632 less than the national average spending per Medicare \nbeneficiary of $5,490, and $5,500 less than the spending for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Washington, DC. Moreover, most North Dakotans do not \neven have the option of Medicare+Choice plans because Medicare \nreimbursement for these plans is so low in rural areas that they are \nnot offered.\n  As a result of the skewed Medicare formula, North Dakota hospitals \nare reimbursed significantly less than hospitals of similar size and \ntype elsewhere in the country. For instance, North Dakota hospitals are \nreimbursed as much as $2,000 less for a Medicare beneficiary with heart \nfailure compared to hospitals of a similar size and mission in \nMinnesota, New York and California. More specifically, for example, St. \nAlexius Medical Center in Bismarck, North Dakota is paid about $4,000 \nfor a heart failure patient. A similar sized hospital, with a similar \nmission, would be paid $5,900 in California, $6,500 in New York, and \n$6,800 in Minneapolis, MN for caring for the same patient.\n  Likewise, a similar payment inequity exists for physicians. For \nexample, a physician in Beulah, ND is paid about $46 by Medicare for an \noffice visit, while a doctor in San Francisco is paid $63 for a \ncomparable office visit. A physician who inserts a pacemaker in a \npatient in New York City is paid about $646, but a doctor who performs \nthe exact same procedure in Fargo, ND is paid only $481, about a \nquarter less.\n  This inequity in Medicare reimbursement has real consequences for \nhospitals and clinics: They have to reduce services, have greater \ndifficulty recruiting staff, are less able to make capital \nimprovements, and struggle to give their patients access to the latest \ninnovations in medical care.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Rural Health Care Fairness and \nMedicare Equity Act, would address the rural inequity in Medicare \nreimbursement in five ways. First, this bill would equalize the \n``standardized payment'' which forms the basis for Medicare's \nreimbursement to hospitals. You would think something called the \n``standardized payment'' would already be standard, but the fact is \nthat hospitals in rural and small urban areas, including all of North \nDakota, receive a smaller standardized payment than large urban \nhospitals. This bill would raise all hospitals up to the same \nstandardized payment. The fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill \nenacted by Congress earlier this year takes a step in the right \ndirection by equalizing this base payment for the last six months of \nthis fiscal year, but my bill would make this equalization permanent.\n  Second, my bill would create a wage index floor for the hospitals in \nthis country with the very lowest wage indexes. The current wage index, \nwhich is an important factor in a hospital's total Medicare \nreimbursement, is based on an antiquated theory that it costs more to \nhire hospital staff in urban areas than it does in rural areas. That \nmay have been true once, but it is no longer true today. Today, \nhospitals in North Dakota are competing with hospitals in Minnesota, \nChicago and elsewhere for the same doctors and nurses, and they have to \npay competitive wages in order to recruit staff. However, their low \nwage index has the effect of limiting the salaries that many rural and \nsmall urban hospitals can afford to pay their staff. By creating a \nfloor, we would at least level the playing field a bit for hospitals \nwith a wage index under 0.85.\n  Third, this bill would reduce the importance of the wage index in \nfactoring a hospital's total Medicare reimbursement. The current \n``labor market share'' of 71.1 percent overstates the actual amount \nthat hospitals in North Dakota and nationwide pay for labor. For \ninstance, in North Dakota, a hospital in Bismarck has a labor market \nshare of 58 percent, while a small rural hospital in Cando, ND has a \nlabor market share of 55 percent. For hospitals in North Dakota and \nother states that already have a low wage index this overstatement of \nlabor costs magnifies the reimbursement inequity. My bill would set the \nlabor market share at 62 percent, which more closely reflects what the \ncorrect proportion should be. However, hospitals that would be \nadversely affected by this change would be held harmless.\n  In addition, this legislation creates alternative criteria for some \nhospitals to appeal to the Medicare program for a higher wage index. \nHospitals currently can qualify for reclassification to an area with a \nhigher wage index if they can demonstrate that they are proximate to \nthe area to which they seek to be reclassified and pay similar wages or \nhave a similar patient case-mix. The current reclassification process \nhas been used predominantly in areas with high population density as a \nway for hospitals to increase their Medicare reimbursement. According \nto a GAO study last year, two-thirds of all hospitals that are able to \nreclassify are in two areas--California and the northeast.\n  Unfortunately, however, many rural and small urban hospitals located \nin states with a large land base and lots of distance between \ncommunities largely have not been able to take advantage of the \nreclassification process because they cannot meet the proximity \ncriteria. This is the case even though, despite the longer distances \nbetween communities, hospitals are still competing against each other \nto recruit nurses and other staff. To address this concern, my bill \nwould create an alternative reclassification process for hospitals in \nsparsely populated states with large distances between metropolitan \nareas that do not meet the current proximity criteria but do meet the \nother reclassification criteria.\n  Finally, my legislation would establish a floor of 1.00 for the \nphysician work component of the Medicare physician payment system. The \nMedicare program currently adjusts physician payments based on a \n``geographic practice cost index'' that is intended to reflect regional \ncost-of-living differences. The result has been that physicians in \nrural areas are generally reimbursed less by Medicare for providing the \nsame exact level of care as doctors in urban areas. Since rural medical \npractices tend to serve higher proportions of Medicare beneficiaries, \nthey are doubly impacted by this payment inequity.\n  As many of my colleagues know, it is already very difficult to \nrecruit physicians to rural underserved areas. In fact, many small \ntowns in my State are increasingly relying on foreign physicians \nworking in the country under J-1 visas because they are unable to \nrecruit American physicians. I am very concerned that the disparity in\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nMedicare reimbursement for doctors provides yet another reason for \nphysicians to decline to serve in rural areas.\n  By establishing a floor of 1.00 for the work geographic practice cost \nindex, this legislation will ensure that doctors' work in rural areas \nwould at least be valued at the national average. However, it would \nstill allow for payments higher than the national average for \nphysicians serving in areas with a high cost of living.\n  In closing, I think we as a nation need to acknowledge that a strong \nhealth care system is an important part of our rural infrastructure. \nOver the years, we have determined that rural electric service, rural \ntelephone service, an interstate highway system through rural areas, \nand rural mail delivery, to name a few services, make us a better, more \nunified nation. We need to make the same determination in support of \nour rural health care system, and I will be fighting for policies, such \nas those reflected in this legislation, that reflect rural health care \nas a strong national priority. I encourage my colleagues to join \nSenator Burns and me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Rural Health Care \nFairness and Medicare Equity Act with my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, from North Dakota.\n  Many predominately rural States, such as my home State of Montana, \nface difficult challenges in the health care arena. Funding, staffing \nshortages, and inadequate reimbursement levels have plagued many \nhospitals and health care providers in the most rural areas of our \ncountry since the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I have \nbeen a strong supporter of improving access to health care in these \nareas through education and telemedicine, but many rural communities in \nparticular still face dangerous health care-related shortages.\n  The Rural Health Care Fairness and Medicare Equity Act seeks to make \nMedicare reimbursement more fair and equitable for rural and small \nurban hospitals and physicians by correcting the unintended inequities \nin the Medicare system put in place by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nwith five components. First, this act would provide a single \nstandardized amount under the Medicare inpatient Provider Payment \nSystem, PPS, by permanently raising the standardized amount for rural \nand other hospitals to the same standardized amount level as large \nurban area hospitals. My colleagues in the Senate and I recognized the \nimportance of doing this in the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations \npackage, which made this change for the remaining months of fiscal year \n2003. We should now standardize hospital levels by making this change \npermanent, and this bill does just that.\n  Second, this bill would change the hospital labor market share from \nits current level of 71.1 percent, to 62 percent, based on a study done \nby the University of North Carolina Rural Health Research and Policy \nAnalysis Center demonstrating that the current hospital labor market \nshare is too high. Hospitals that would be harmed by this change would \nbe held harmless. Third, this legislation would create a wage index \nfloor of 0.85 for hospitals that would otherwise have a wage index less \nthan the floor. Thirty of my colleagues and I cosponsored legislation \nin the 107th Congress that included a 0.925 floor, and I am hopeful \nthat by setting the floor at 0.85, this provision will be better \ntargeted toward rural hospitals with negative Medicare inpatient \nmargins, helping our rural health centers to not only keep their doors \nopen, but to continue providing quality, affordable health services to \nthe rural communities they serve.\n  Fourth, this bill would create new, alternative criteria for hospital \nreclassification. This bill would require the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to develop a new category of reclassiciation of \nhospitals for area wage index and standardized amount purposes. I am \ngreatly concerned that the current reclassification process, \nparticularly the proximity and adjacency criteria, has not been helpful \nto hospitals in States like Montana, with large land bases and lots of \ndistance between communities, even though these hospitals must still \ncompete with one another for nurses and other health care staff.\n  Two-thirds of all hospital reclassification take place in California \nand in the Northeast, largely because of these proximity and adjacency \ncriteria. This bill would allow hospitals located in sparsely populated \nStates that do not meet these prohibitive criteria to re-classify if \nthey otherwise need reclassification criteria. This bill defines a \nsparsely populated state to be one in which there are fewer than 20 \npeople per square mile of land, under which eight States, including \nMontana, qualify. Finally, the Rural Health Care Fairness and Medicare \nEquity Act would create a physician geographic adjustment floor of 1.0 \nfor the physician work component of the Medicare physician payment \nsystem, beginning in 2004. This provision would lessen the geographic \ndisparities in Medicare payment so gravely affecting physicians in the \nfield today.\n  Patients in both rural and urban areas depend on the availability of \nquality health care providers to offer superior, affordable health \nservices to people across the Nation. Medicare physician payments are \nintended to correspond to the costs that efficient providers incur. \nInstead, research has shown that the sustainable growth rate, SGR, \nunder which reimbursement rates are supposed to be adjusted annually \nfails to account for all the relevant factors that affect the cost of \nphysician payments, and maintains further inequities, such as Medicare \npaying different amounts for the same service, depending on where the \nservice is provided.\n  Cuts in Medicare reimbursement to health care providers have forced \nhealth providers to make difficult choices, including becoming a \nnonparticipating Medicare provider, moving to areas with better \nreimbursement rates or less Medicare patients, retiring from practice \nearly, limiting or discontinuing charitble care, reducing staff, or \nleaving Medicare entirely. The impact on these cuts has taken a serious \ntoll on rural communities, such as those in Montana. The most recent \ncut in physician payment levels was the largest in Medicare history, \nimmediately affecting 1 million health care professionals and the \ncountless millions of elderly and disabled patients they, in turn, \nserve. Not only does this create a negative health care environment so \nadverse to the principles of the Medicare system, but the inequities in \nphysician reimbursement rates have created a crisis situation for many \npatients in rural areas who do not have the luxury of choosing to see a \ndifferent health care provider who can still afford to take Medicare \npatients.\n  This bill is extremely important to ensure that America's seniors and \nlow-income have access to high quality physician services. It is \nimperative that Congress continue it commitment to rural health care \nquality, accessibility, and affordability, and the Rural Health Care \nFairness and Medicare Equity Act is an important step toward this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 988.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work at certain medicare \nproviders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Registered Nurses' \nSafe Staffing Act of 2003. I'm introducing this bill on behalf of the \nAmerican Nurses Association's Chief Executive Officer and President \nLinda Stierle, MSN, RN, CNAA and Barbara A. Blakeney, MS, APRN, BC, ANP \nrespectively. For over 4 decades I have been a committed supporter of \nnurses and the delivery of safe patient care. While enforceable \nregulations will help to ensure patient safety, the complexity and \nvariability of today's hospitals require that staffing patterns be \ndetermined at the hospital and unit level, with the professional input \nof registered nurses. More than a decade of research demonstrates that \nnurse staff levels and the skill mix of nursing staff directly affect \nthe clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. Studies show that when \nthere are more registered nurses, there are lower mortality rates, \nshorter lengths of stay, reduced costs, and fewer complications.\n  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that the risks of patient mortality rose by 7 percent for every \nadditional patient added to the average nurse's workload. In the midst \nof a nursing shortage and increasing financial pressures, hospitals \noften find it difficult to maintain adequate staffing. While nursing \nresearch indicates that adequate registered nurse staffing is vital to \nthe health and safety of patients, there are no standardized, public \nreporting or the enforcement of adequate staffing plans. The only \nregulations addressing nursing staff exists vaguely in Medicare \nConditions of Participation which states: ``The nursing service must \nhave an adequate number of licensed registered nurses, licensed \npractice, vocational, nurse, and other personnel to provide nursing \ncare to all patients as needed''.\n  This bill will require Medicare Participating Hospitals to develop \nand maintain reliable and valid systems to determine sufficient \nregistered nurse staffing. Given, the demands that the healthcare \nindustry faces today, it is our responsibility to ensure that patients \nhave access to adequate nursing care. However, we must ensure that the \ndecisions in which to provide this care are made by the clinical \nexperts, the registered nurses caring for these patients. Support of \nthis bill supports our nation's nurses during a critical shortage, but \nmore importantly, works to ensure the safety of their patients.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Registered Nurse Safe \n     Staffing Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are hospitals throughout the United States that \n     have inadequate staffing of registered nurses to protect the \n     well-being and health of the patients.\n       (2) Studies show that the health of patients in hospitals \n     is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses \n     working in the hospital.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of registered nurses in \n     the United States.\n       (4) The effect of that shortage is revealed in unsafe \n     staffing levels in hospitals.\n       (5) Patient safety is adversely affected by these unsafe \n     staffing levels, creating a public health crisis.\n       (6) Registered nurses are being required to perform \n     professional services under conditions that do not support \n     quality health care or a healthful work environment for \n     registered nurses.\n       (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services for individuals entitled to benefits under the \n     medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act, the Federal Government has a compelling \n     interest in promoting the safety of such individuals by \n     requiring any hospital participating in such program to \n     establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe provision taxing policyholder dividends of mutual life insurance \ncompanies and to repeal the policyholders surplus account provisions; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nsimplify the taxation of life insurance companies. I am joined by my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and my colleague from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  Our legislation repeals Sections 809 and Section 815 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. These provisions are no longer relevant given the \nsignificant changes in the life insurance industry over the past 25 \nyears, and repeal will simplify the tax code.\n  Section 809 was enacted in 1984 as a part of major revisions to the \nlaws governing life insurance companies. It was intended to ensure that \nmutual life insurance companies do not have a competitive tax advantage \nover stock life insurance companies. At that time, mutual life \ninsurance companies dominated the market. Now, however, mutuals account \nfor only 10 percent of the industry, and there are very few large \nmutuals in existence. Section 809 reduces the amount of policyholder \ndividends a mutual insurance company can deduct according to a complex \nformula based on the previous 3 years' earnings of stock companies. \nSection 809 is burdensome and raises very little revenue. Because its \noriginal purpose is no longer valid, our bill would repeal the \nprovision permanently. In last year's economic stimulus bill, Congress \ntemporarily suspended Section 809. In addition, President Bush included \nin his fiscal year 2003 budget submission a proposal to repeal Section \n809 permanently.\n  Section 815 has an even longer history, dating back to 1959. Tax \nchanges in 1959 created an accounting mechanism called a ``policyholder \nsurplus account'' for stock life insurance companies. Stock companies \nwere permitted to defer tax on one-half of their underwriting income as \nlong as that income was not distributed to shareholders. This income \nwas accounted for through the policyholder surplus account, PSA. In \n1984, Congress eliminated deferral of tax on underwriting income, but \ndid not address the issue of PSAs. The amounts in these accounts, which \nare just an accounting entry, and do not contain real money, remain \nsubject to tax if certain triggering events occur. Because virtually no \ncompany is willing to ``trigger'' the tax on the account, Section 815 \nalso raises little or no revenue. It does, however, directly inhibit \nthe business decisions of stock companies with PSAs.\n  Congress has worked hard over the last few years to modernize laws \ngoverning the financial services industry to encourage growth and \nenhance competitiveness. Elimination of outdated tax provisions such as \nSections 809 and 815 will complement this effort and provide more \nrational taxation of life insurance companies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 995. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to improve certain child \nnutritional programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my Child \nNutrition Initiatives Act of 2003. This legislation consists of a \nnumber of proposals that I believe will significantly improve the \nnutrition benefits available to our Nation's children through Federal \nchild nutrition programs.\n  I am hoping that this legislation will serve as a starting point in \nthe Senate's debate over how to improve child nutrition programs this \nyear. It is not meant to be a comprehensive proposal for \nreauthorization, nor does it represent all of the potential \nimprovements that could be made to the programs that I will be \nsupporting in the Agriculture Committee. I look forward to working with \nChairman Cochran and with Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee, as well as the rest of the Committee to craft a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  The Committee has already held two hearings on child nutrition \nlegislation, where we heard from a wide variety of nutritionists, \nschool food service operators and others interested in these programs. \nThey presented us with a wide variety of ideas, some of them appearing \nin my bill, which underlined the immense impact of these programs to \nthe nutritional health and well-being of all of our children and \ngrandchildren. Undersecretary Bost also testified, and he too offered \nan array of proposals for improving these programs. I look forward to \nmore detailed proposals from the Department of Agriculture on how we \ncan better serve the children in these programs.\n  I was encouraged to hear that the Administration is interested in \nproviding much-needed financial help for schools choosing to improve \ntheir nutritional environment. We know that many school food service \ndirectors and employees want to offer healthier, more appetizing \noptions to the children they serve, yet the cost of providing \nattractive fresh fruits and vegetables, or milk in child-friendly \nplastic containers kept chilled in a cooler, is often prohibitive. \nIncreased per-meal reimbursements will encourage school cafeterias to \nspend more on the foods that are healthiest for kids. With these funds, \nschools will be able to make the salad bar and the milk cooler just as \nattractive to school children as less nutritious foods.\n  Healthier food in the school cafeteria does little good if children \ndo not understand the benefits of eating apples over high-fat junk \nfood. For years, the Nutrition Education and Training, NET, program \nprovided critical support for state and local efforts to increase and \nimprove nutrition education in classrooms. It is in the classrooms \nwhere the most effective and innovative nutrition education is \nhappening, and NET offered teachers the resources they needed to \ndevelop a nutritional curriculum for their students. Unfortunately, \nthis program has not been funded in the last few years. My bill would \nreinstate funding for the NET program, and encourage strong nutrition \neducation at the local level.\n  It is amazing how many kids do not know where the food that they eat \ncomes from. It's also amazing how far some farm products travel to get \nto the cafeteria table. My bill includes a farm-to-cafeteria program \nthat will provide one-time grants to connect farms with their local \nschool system. These grants would be used to buy equipment and pay for \nother costs to provide the freshest farm products available to our \nchildren. Projects funded by the farm-to-cafeteria program would also \ngive children first-hand experience about how food is produced. This \nnew program would also provide economic benefits for small, local firms \nby keeping food dollars within the community.\n  My support for these new farm-to-cafeteria projects comes in part \nfrom the amazing successes demonstrated by the WIC Farmers Market \nNutrition Program. Years ago, I helped create this program, which \nprovides vouchers to WIC families good for fruits and vegetables at \ntheir local farmers market. The effects of this program have been \nstunning. In Vermont, recipients and farmers are raving about this \nprogram, which provides fresh, local, and healthy food to those who \nneed it most. There has also been an unexpected educational component \nto this program, with many recipients reporting that the farmers who \nsell them the food have also helped them learn how to best prepare it. \nThis is a win-win situation. My bill will secure steady and predictable \nfunding for the Farmers Market Nutrition Program.\n  Every State receives a small amount of funds to administer and ensure \nthe integrity of all Federal child nutrition programs. Though these \nfunds are distributed based on usage of the programs, there has been an \nall-State minimum to ensure that all States still have enough funds to \nmeet the basic administrative requirements mandated by law. This \nminimum, however, has not been raised since 1981, despite inflation and \nexpansion of the responsibilities of the states. My bill updates the \nminimum funding level to reflect inflation since 1981 and also indexes \nit for inflation into the future.\n  I am pleased that my bill has the support of the American School Food \nService Association, the National Association for Farmers Market \nNutrition Programs, the National Milk Producers Federation, the \nInternational Dairy Foods Association, and the Community Food Service \nCoalition.\n  Opponents of my bill will undoubtedly point to the cost of these \nprograms, stating ``there is no money for such programs.'' Well, I \nanswer them\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nwith one word: priorities. Our Nation is faced with a growing health \ncrisis. Children are growing up and growing out. They eat more, eat \nless nutritious foods and exercise less. It is a health epidemic that \nplagues them throughout life. By acting now, we can increase the \nquality of life for these children and save in healthcare costs down \nthe line. For example, a study for the American School Food Service \nAssociation and the National Dairy Council found that by improving the \nquality, and therefore consumption, of milk in our school lunch \nprograms, we could save between $800 million to $1.1 billion in health \ncare costs every year.\n  I joined with a number of fellow senators in requesting that Congress \nprovide a modest increase of $1 billion per year in the Budget \nResolution so that we on the authorizing committees might make some \nlong-awaited and essential improvements to the child nutrition \nprograms. I am disappointed that increased funds were not provided. The \nSenate sent a clear message to America's children: we would rather give \na several hundred billion dollar tax cut to a small minority of health \nadults than protect our children, through $1 billion in programming, \nfrom a health crisis.\n  The Federal Government reaches well over 25 million children each \nyear with these programs. We have a tremendous opportunity to be \nproactive--to teach kids about food and give them nutritious options. \nWe have a growing health crisis on our hands as our children grow wider \nbecause of unhealthy diets and less exercise. We must get serious about \nfinding solutions to the problem. Or we can wait, and allow a system \nalready doing its very best, working at maximum capacity, to \ndeteriorate. I am for acting now and I hope the Senate is too.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, at 3:45 p.m. on Friday afternoon, a \nthree-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia released a long-awaited decision in the case of McConnell \nv. FEC. That is the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, sometimes known as the McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  Over 80 different plaintiffs participated in the case, which was \ndefended by the Department of Justice and the Federal Election \nCommission. Six congressional sponsors of the law, Senator John McCain, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, Senator James Jeffords, Representative \nChristopher Shays, Representative Marty Meehan, and I, intervened as \ndefendants in the case.\n  A number of commentators and lawyers for the parties have commented \nthat the most important aspect of this decision is that it has finally \ncome down. I agree with that. From the very beginning of our effort to \nreform the campaign laws over a period of 7 years, we knew that the \nSupreme Court of the United States would decide the fate of the law. We \nprovided for expedited consideration of any challenge to the law's \nconstitutionality by having a three-judge panel hear the case as the \ntrial court with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.\n  Discovery and briefing in the case proceeded on a very fast track, \nand the court heard oral argument on December 4, 2002, an argument \nwhich I had a chance to attend in part. At that argument, the chief \njudge of the panel suggested that the panel would rule by the end of \nJanuary. It took considerably longer than that, and now we know why. On \nFriday, the court released over 1,600 pages of opinions. A shifting \nmajority among the three judges upheld some of the most important \nportions of the law while it struck down some others.\n  Now that the three-judge panel has finally ruled, the Supreme Court \ncan take the case and begin its consideration of the constitutional \nissues raised by the law. I hope the Court will act quickly, but I also \nhope it will act carefully and judiciously as, of course, we assume it \nwill. The decision of the Court will shape the conduct of elections and \nfundraising in this country for many years to come.\n\n  While the district court opinion will become a mere footnote to \nhistory once the Supreme Court rules, I believe it is useful to comment \non the decision today because the press coverage of the details of the \nruling has been sometimes contradictory, and unfortunately in a number \nof cases the press reports were simply inaccurate about what had \nhappened with the court decision. This is not surprising given the \ncomplexity of the ruling and the length of the opinions. For the \nbenefit of my colleagues, particularly those who supported our long \neffort to pass reform, I wanted to discuss today what the court did and \ndid not do.\n  The court's ruling was shaped by two different 2-1 majorities. U.S. \nCircuit Judge Karen Henderson would have struck down much of the law, \nwhile U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly would have upheld most \nof it. The deciding vote in most cases was U.S. District Judge Richard \nLeon, who sided with Judge Henderson on some issues and with Judge \nKollar-Kotelly on others. The three judges were unanimous on a handful \nof issues, mostly on some of the minor provisions in the bill, but also \non one very significant portion of the soft money ban.\n  Let me start with soft money, especially in light of the headlines \nthat screamed ``soft money ban struck down.'' Those headlines were not \ncorrect.\n  Let me start with soft money, which was the core of the reform effort \nand was dealt with in title I of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The court struck down our prohibition on national parties raising \nsoft\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nmoney. Under this ruling, national party committees may again raise \nunlimited contributions from unions, corporations, and wealthy \nindividuals. That, of course, assumes that the Supreme Court agrees \nwith this point, which frankly I believe they will not. State parties \nwere never prohibited from raising such money under McCain-Feingold. \nEach State's fundraising activities are governed by State law. That is \nquite key to understanding exactly what happened by the ruling.\n  The court left intact, however, the prohibition on the national \nparties spending soft money on public communications, such as broadcast \nadvertising, television ads, that promotes, supports, attacks, or \nopposes a Federal candidate. Over the past four election cycles, dating \nback to the 1996 campaign, both Federal and State parties have spent \nmillions upon millions of dollars of soft money on television ads \nattacking candidates of the other party.\n  Frankly, it was this practice, the use of soft money for television \nads, that more than anything else drove Senator McCain and I, and the \nother authors and supporters of the bill, to work so hard for 7 years.\n  This court, this district court, upheld the ban on ads being paid for \nby soft money.\n  The so-called issue ads are the biggest end run around the campaign \nfinance laws out there, and they were the core of what McCain-Feingold \nis trying to stop. I am pleased to say the district court upheld our \nefforts in that area.\n  Under this ruling, party committees can raise soft money but they \ncannot spend it on all those phony issue ads you see on television all \nthroughout the campaigns and about which so many people have \ncomplained. They can spend it, however, under this rule, on other \nactivities that Congress determined in BCRA had a significant effect on \nFederal elections, such as voter registration drives conducted near in \ntime to Federal elections and voter identification and voter \nregistration efforts.\n  In upholding the prohibitions on the parties spending soft money to \nfinance election-related advertising, I firmly believe the basic \nprinciple of McCain-Feingold was upheld. The court recognized the \ncorrupting effect of this money and the power of Congress to regulate \nit when it affects Federal elections. That is a significant finding.\n  Note that the court did not find that the first amendment or free \nspeech rulings or practices restrict or prevent a complete ban on ads \npaid for by soft money. That was the biggest issue out here in the \ndebate over 7 years, and even this district court agreed with that \nfundamental principle of McCain-Feingold.\n  When the case goes to the Supreme Court, congressional supporters of \nthe law and the United States will urge the Court to recognize that the \ncorrupting effect of soft money on our political process is not \neliminated by simply restricting its use to so-called party-building \nactivities. So there is no question, we hope for an even stronger \nruling from the Supreme Court. Furthermore, there is ample evidence, we \nbelieve, that the kinds of activities the district court determined can \nstill be financed with soft money do, in fact, have a major impact on \nFederal elections.\n  The same 2-to-1 majority that struck down the ban on national parties \nraising soft money also held unconstitutional the prohibition of \nparties raising soft money for or transferring soft money to advocacy \ngroups. The other 2-to-1 majority upheld the prohibition on State \ncandidates spending money on advertisements that mention Federal \ncandidates and promote, support, attack, or oppose these candidates.\n  Again, not only did the court say that at the Federal level the \nparties could not buy soft money TV ads, but also the State parties \ncannot run ads on behalf of Federal candidates using soft money--again, \nvery different from what you might have assumed had you been watching \nCNN late Friday afternoon.\n  All three judges, however--and I think this is very significant--\nuphold the crucial portion of the new law that simply prohibits Federal \nofficeholders and candidates from raising and spending soft money. This \nis a significant blow to those who wanted to believe when they first \nheard about this decision that it had somehow restored the status quo \nof political fundraising and campaign spending in this country.\n  Even Judge Henderson, who ruled against our side on virtually every \nother matter, rejected most of the new justifications of the new law \noffered by its proponents. Even she recognized the fact that there is \nan appearance of corruption created when Members of Congress or other \nFederal officials seek to raise huge donations from corporations, \nunions, or wealthy individuals. She upheld this provision under the \nhighest standard of review, strict scrutiny.\n\n  Today, just like last Thursday, it is still against the law--a \ncriminal violation--for a Member of Congress to call up a union, an \nindividual, or a corporate entity and ask for unlimited campaign \ncontributions. It cannot be done today any more than it could have been \ndone a few days ago.\n  It is important to know that the provision of the law upheld in this \npart of the court's opinion includes a prohibition not only on Members \nthemselves doing this, raising soft money for purposes of broadcast, \nbut also on entities directly or indirectly established, financed, \nmaintained, or controlled by Federal candidates or officeholders. As a \nmatter of fact, this is a complete prohibition on soft money \nfundraising by these entities.\n  I misspoke a minute ago saying it only related to broadcast. This \nprohibition on Federal officeholders and entities directly or \nindirectly established by them relates to any kind of fundraising for \nany kind of soft money whatever. Therefore, leadership PACs maintained \nby Members of Congress may still not raise soft money under this \nruling; nor can the congressional campaign committees which are clearly \nestablished and controlled by Members of Congress to aid the reelection \nefforts of themselves and their colleagues.\n  Now, unfortunately the former head of one such committee quickly \nannounced he would begin raising soft money immediately anyway. He \nmight want to get some legal advice first. Although the soft money \nportion of the court's ruling certainly changes much in the political \nfundraising landscape, it leaves one very important part of the new \nregime imposed by the McCain-Feingold bill: Members of Congress and the \nexecutive branch must stay out of the soft money game altogether. \nEspecially in this period of uncertainty between now and when the \nSupreme Court issues its decision, the spectacle of Members of Congress \ngetting out their old soft money Rolodexes and dialing for dollars \nagain would be more than the American people would stand.\n  So I am not only very pleased but relieved that the district court \nrecognized the importance of stopping the part of the soft money system \nthat some of us have referred to as legalized extortion or legalized \nbribery or, more directly, simply a shakedown.\n  Title II of the McCain-Feingold bill dealt with what we called \nelectioneering communications, the phony issue ads by outside groups \nthat commanded so much attention during the last few election cycles. \nHere again, the court was divided. It did strike down the primary \ndefinition of electioneering communications we had referred to on the \nfloor as the bright line test. Actually, we also referred to it as the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision. Under that formulation, an ad that ran within \n60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary could be financed \nonly with hard money; that is, only through a PAC set up by the \ncompany, union, or group running the ad.\n  Now, a majority of the district court panel believed this definition \nwas overly broad because it would capture a substantial number of \n``true issue ads'' as well as those aimed at electioneering.\n  Again, despite the initial erroneous reports, there was more to the \ndecision than that--quite dramatically more. The court upheld a \nfallback definition which was originally added on the floor by Senator \nSpecter during the debate in 2001. That definition uses language \nsimilar to that which we employed in the soft money ban to address \nphony issue ads run by the parties. So if an ad promotes, supports, \nattacks, or opposes a candidate, it still must be paid for with hard \nmoney. The court also\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nupheld the Wellstone amendment that applied this definition to ads run \nby advocacy groups in addition to labor unions and for-profit \ncorporations and upheld the disclosure requirements in the law.\n\n  The definition upheld by the district court actually is not limited \nto a 30- or 60-day window. So at any time during the election cycle, \nincluding today, groups may not use soft money to run ads attacking \ncandidates in this manner. This is very significant. The definition is \nbroader and will very likely cover many more ads in the primary \ndefinition of electioneering communications that we passed. The court \neven threw out a clause included by Senator Specter to attempt to \nnarrow the definition, declaring it made the overall definition too \nvague. Frankly, I don't know whether this ruling will survive when the \nSupreme Court rules on the case.\n  What is most interesting here is the majority of the court decided \nthat Congress is not limited to regulating advertisements that use the \nso-called magic words of express advocacy. Year after year, opponents \nof McCain-Feingold said you could only limit this to the magic words, \nvote for or vote against. That is not true under this court's ruling, \nand that is a major step forward, potentially. It recognizes the \nConstitution is not a straitjacket leaving the Congress powerless to \naddress clear efforts to evade the law through phony issue ads.\n  In our appeal to the Supreme Court, we will argue that the 30/60 \nprovision drafted by Senators Snowe and Jeffords is constitutionally \ndefensible because it gives groups certainty over what ad is covered \nand what is not. But either definition is preferable to the current \nvery narrow magic words test that allows a massive evasion of \ndisclosure and source requirements for the attack ads that tend to \ndominate the airways in the weeks before an election.\n  The court reached decisions on a number of other provisions of the \nbill. A number of these decisions were unanimous, and I will not take \ntime right now to go through each of them. I ask unanimous consent that \na summary of those rulings be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the next few days a decision will be \nmade whether to seek a stay of the district court's decision. I think \nthe arguments for such a stay are strong. The parties have been working \nunder the new campaign finance rules since November of last year.\n  To shift to another system for a few months while the Supreme Court \nreviews the case only to shift again when the Supreme Court rules, \nwhatever its decision might be, does not make much sense. It would be \npreferable for a variety of reasons to keep things the way they are now \nuntil the Supreme Court makes a final decision. That decision should \ncome in plenty of time for the parties to prepare for the upcoming \nelections.\n  One of the main arguments for a stay is that in order to put the \ndistrict court's decision in place, the FEC would almost certainly have \nto undertake a whole new set of rulemaking proceedings. The FEC worked \nto put implementing regulations in place in a timely manner, as \ninstructed by the new law. Many of those regulations are not \nparticularly useful under the law established by the district court's \ndecision. In any event, I call on the parties to act with restraint, \nespecially until the courts rule on any requests for a stay.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, we have always known that this case was \nheaded to the Supreme Court. I am pleased that the decision of the \nthree judge panel has come down and that the final stage of this legal \nprocess can now begin. I have great confidence in the Department of \nJustice and in the legal team that is representing the congressional \nsponsors. They did an extraordinary job in assembling a factual record \nand laying out the arguments for the law's constitutionality in the \ndistrict court.\n  These lawyers are acting to defend a legislative product that \nreflects not only political compromise, but also great care and \nattention to constitutional principles and the American people's desire \nfor a political system that is based on ideas and not money.

Mr. President, today I rise to share my concerns about \nthe recess appointment of Peter Eide to fill the post of general \ncounsel at the Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n  Recently, President Bush announced several recess appointments of \npending nominees to fill posts in his administration. One of those \nappointments was granted to Peter Eide. Mr. Eide's nomination has been \nunder active consideration by the Governmental Affairs Committee since \nits referral, and a public hearing to consider his appointment was held \non April 10. I am disappointed that the President chose to exercise his \ndiscretion to make this recess appointment rather than allowing the \nadvice and consent process to continue on course.\n  Mr. Eide's credentials would make him an impeccable candidate for any \nnumber of positions in the Federal Government. However, General Counsel \nat the Federal Labor Relations Authority is not one of them.\n  The position to which Mr. Eide was appointed is described under law \nas being a neutral party in the settlement of disputes that arise \nbetween Federal agencies and unions on matters outlined in the Federal \nService Labor Management Relations statute. However, for the past 12 \nyears, Mr. Eide has been an outspoken critic of labor protections on \nbehalf of the Chamber of Commerce. He has consistently supported the \ndilution of protections for workers. He opposed OSHA regulations on \nsafety and health programs, including ergonomics standards. He opposed \nprovisions of the 1991 Civil Rights Act that provide compensatory \ndamages and jury trials for violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. He advocated a policy that would exempt employers who \nhired former welfare recipients from employment discrimination laws for \n18 months. He consistently opposed increases in the Federal minimum \nwage. I find it disconcerting that someone who has been such a \npassionate and unrelenting foe of such labor protections for so many \nyears would not only seek this position, but feel he is qualified to be \nthe general counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n  Looking beyond his former policy positions, Mr. Eide also lacks the \nrequisite experience with Federal labor-management relations that I \nbelieve this important post necessitates. Most of his recent labor law \nexperience has been in the private sector representing\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nmanagement viewpoints. Nothing in his experience indicates he has the \nqualifications to perform a job representing Federal employee labor \nconcerns.\n  Given his background, Federal employee labor organizations are \nworried about Mr. Eide's ability to perform the functions of his new \npost. I believe they have good reason to be concerned. I am submitting \nfor the Record letters that I have received from Federal labor union \nleaders in opposition to Mr. Eide's nomination. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these documents be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  As I have previously stated, Mr. Eide has the qualifications to serve \nin hundreds of positions throughout the Federal Government. General \nCounsel at the Federal Labor Relations Authority is simply not one of \nthem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         The National Treasury Employees Union,\n                                   March 26, 2003, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The National Treasury Employees Union, \n     the largest independent union of federal employees, \n     respectfully opposes the nomination of Peter Eide to be \n     General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority \n     (FLRA).\n       As members of the Governmental Affairs committee are aware, \n     the General Counsel of the FLRA is charged with enforcing the \n     provisions of the Federal Sector Labor-Management Relations \n     Statute (FSLMRS). The General Counsel directs the operations \n     of the FLRA's regional offices in their investigation of \n     unfair labor practices and in their conduct of representation \n     matters, such as running elections and making appropriate \n     unit determinations. The General Counsel is the prosecutor \n     for the FLRA; the incumbent determines, in the first \n     instance, whether to pursue alleged misconduct and, if so, \n     under what legal theory. The refusal of the General Counsel \n     to issue a complaint on an alleged unfair labor practice \n     charge is unreviewable. If the General Counsel does issue a \n     complaint, he or she controls the course of the litigation \n     before the FLRA.\n       Mr. Eide, in our opinion, is not qualified to perform the \n     important responsibilities of the position of General \n     Counsel. Although the General Counsel is the chief \n     prosecuting lawyer for the FLRA, Mr. Eide has not been a \n     practicing lawyer since 1990. Moreover, his legal experience \n     up to the date was confined to private sector labor \n     relations. There is nothing in his record that indicates any \n     experience whatsoever in federal sector labor relations, \n     which differs in many major respects from its private sector \n     counterpart.\n       Perhaps even more troubling to NTEU, Mr. Eide's work for \n     the last twelve years has been as an advocate for the \n     dilution of statutory protections for employees. As Manager \n     and then Director of Labor Policy for the Chamber of \n     Commerce, Mr. Eide has worked to oppose OSHA regulations on \n     safety and health programs. For example, he has proudly \n     pointed to this role in spearheading a coalition of \n     businesses and associations opposing OSHA ergonomics \n     regulations. He has also worked vigorously to undermine the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act and to amend Title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964. In short, there is nothing in this record \n     to indicate that Mr. Eide would energetically enforce the \n     statutory protections of the FSLMRS, if confirmed as General \n     Counsel.\n       The General Counsel of the FLRA operates, to a large \n     extent, without review by the members of the Authority or by \n     any court. If he refuses to pursue allegations of misconduct, \n     the injured entity has no other legal recourse. This broad \n     prosecutorial discretion makes the incumbent an extremely \n     powerful figure in the federal sector labor relations. It \n     should not be entrusted to one whose career has been devoted \n     to advocacy of diminution of statutory protections for \n     workers.\n       NTEU therefore asks you to oppose the nomination of Peter \n     Eide to be General Counsel of the FLRA.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Colleen M. Kelley,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of\n\n\n                                 Government Employees, AFL-CIO\n\n                                    April 9, 2003, Washington, DC.\n     The Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the American Federation \n     of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I am writing to express our \n     opposition to the nomination of Peter Eide to be General \n     Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA).\n       The General Counsel of the FLRA is, in effect, the chief \n     prosecutor of unfair labor practices. Over 80 percent of \n     unfair labor practices in the federal sector are filed by \n     unions. The General Counsel of the FLRA, therefore, is \n     primarily called upon to enforce the labor statute on behalf \n     of unions. Mr. Eide's career, for over the past decade, would \n     indicate that he is ideologically incapable of performing \n     this task.\n       In this regard, our review of his resume clearly shows that \n     Mr. Eide has spent the last twelve years working for the \n     Chamber of Commerce as the chief architect of every Chamber \n     effort opposing every labor initiative. From his opposition \n     to Senator Edward Kennedy's ergonomics initiative to \n     promoting a diminution of Fair Labor Standards Act and Equal \n     Employment Opportunity protections, Mr. Eide's efforts have \n     been dedicated 100% of the time to opposing the labor \n     movement and worker-friendly statutes.\n       Section 7101, the ``findings and purpose'' section of the \n     Federal Service Labor-Management Relations statute, states \n     that:\n       ``(a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) experience in both private and public employment \n     indicates that the statutory protection of the right of \n     employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate \n     through labor organizations of their own choosing in \n     decisions which affect them--\n       (A) safeguards the public interest.\n       (B) contributes to the effective conduct of public \n     business, and\n       (C) facilities and encourages the amicable settlements of \n     disputes between employees and their employers involving \n     conditions of employment; and\n       (2) the public interest demands the highest standards of \n     employee performance and the continued development and \n     implementation of modern and progressive work practices to \n     facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient \n     accomplishment of the operations of the Government.\n       Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in \n     the civil service are in the public interest.''\n       AFGE respectfully submits that Mr. Eide's entire adult \n     career is inexorably inconsistent and opposed to the stated \n     Congressional ``findings and purpose'' of Section 7101, and \n     his nomination should be opposed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Bobby L.
