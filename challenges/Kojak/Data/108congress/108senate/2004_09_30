Mr. President, this morning, we will return to the \nconsideration of the intelligence reform legislation. Yesterday, in \naddition to disposing of a number of amendments, we were able to reach \nan agreement that all first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk \nby 4 p.m. today. I thank all Senators for allowing us to take this \nimportant step toward completion of this bill.\n  I also continue to encourage all Senators who still desire to offer \namendments to contact the bill managers this morning in order to set up \na queue for their consideration. I also hope Members will be reasonable \nwith their time requests on their respective amendments. Unfortunately, \nI anticipate that a large number of amendments will be filed, although \nwe are not encouraging Members to do so.\n  As the Democratic leader and I mentioned yesterday, and indicated on \nthe floor, we will be closely monitoring the progress of the bill over \nthe next several days because we will be departing October 8. We have a \nlarge number of issues to discuss and to address, as we always do at \nthe end of a session. Thus, we must bring this bill to closure and have \na final vote on this bill in the next couple of days.\n  I know there are a lot of colleagues who want to come to the floor \nand discuss and talk on the bill and discuss their amendments, and we \nask them to do so today and tomorrow. Both today and tomorrow must be \nvery full and productive days.\n  As we discussed on the floor yesterday, if it looks as though we are \nnot making adequate progress--again, we come to the floor again and \nagain to make sure people understand we need to move this bill \nexpeditiously--if it looks as though we are not bringing it to \nappropriate closure, we will consider filing cloture at the appropriate \ntime. Again, that will allow us to continue to work on the bill and \noffer and debate germane amendments, but it would be just an effort to \ngive further focus on the bill. This is clearly not a threat at all. It \nis just a plea in many ways for people to come to the floor now, this \nmorning, today, to work with the managers so their amendments can be \nconsidered.\n  This is an extremely important bill. It is a bill that we absolutely \nwill finish as well as the internal reorganization and oversight of \nthis body before we leave on October 8. We do want the Senate to work \nits will on this bill. I know there are caucus meetings and a lot of \nconferences going on off the floor on the bill and bringing people up \nto speed with all the ramifications of the bill. We want to continue to \nencourage that, but the process on the floor we need to continue to \nmove in an efficient way.\n  With respect to votes on Friday and Monday, the Democratic leader and \nI have not made announcements as to whether we will be voting. We \ncertainly will be voting on Monday. But as to Friday, we will make \nannouncements later today. But we need to make progress.\n\n  What we would like to do is have a number of amendments tomorrow, we \nhope as many as 10 amendments considered over the course of the day \ntomorrow--the managers will work with that as a focus--but as many \namendments today and tomorrow as possible. We will have more to say on \nthis later today. After the filing deadline is reached, we will look at \nthe amendments we have before us, and then we will talk further about \nscheduling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S9995-6", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9995-S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THANKING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to take a moment to \nthank\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\nthe Very Reverend Matthew William Searfoorce, who is with us this \nmorning, for a truly wonderful and inspiring opening prayer.\n  Reverend Searfoorce comes to us from the great State of Connecticut, \nwhere he has served for the past 33 years in the One Holy Catholic and \nApostolic Church there. He is currently rector at the Holy Virgin Mary \nOrthodox Church.\n  I had the opportunity to meet him through a very close personal \nfriend of mine, Ed O'Lear, and his wonderful mother, whom I have known \nfor the past, I guess, 34 years. It has been a tremendous friendship \nbetween me and the O'Lear family, including Ed's dad, who passed away, \nand his mom and Ed.\n  Ed has, in effect, become a member of our family and us a member of \nhis family. So it is through that friendship that I have had the \nopportunity to meet the Very Reverend Searfoorce, whose prayer we very \nmuch appreciate today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to a \ngood day and will likely be back over the course of the day as we talk \nabout further scheduling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S9996-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we have now done several days in a \nrow, both the majority leader and I have felt the need to impress upon \nour colleagues the urgency of completing our work on this bill. It is \nimportant that we maximize the next 2 days. I think my advice to the \nmajority leader will be that we have votes on Friday unless we can \nspecifically enumerate at least 10 amendments that can be offered and \ndebated and considered tomorrow.\n  There is absolutely no reason this body, with 100 Senators, if we are \nserious about completing our work, cannot find the time and the effort \nto use tomorrow to its fullest. So I am very hopeful Senators will come \nto us throughout the day to volunteer their willingness to come to the \nfloor tomorrow to offer these amendments. If that does not happen, then \nour only other recourse will, of course, be to have votes tomorrow and \nforce our colleagues to use the day that otherwise will be lost.\n  So please let either our managers know or leadership know your intent \nregarding these amendments. As the majority leader noted, you have \nuntil 4 o'clock this afternoon to file your amendments. As we noted \nyesterday, because of the backlog of legislative counsel, we appreciate \nthe logistical challenge this may require, but we are going to be \nunderstanding and flexible with regard to your ability to refine your \namendment at that time when it is considered. We have done that before. \nIt is important we accommodate Senators' needs to do that again this \ntime. So I ask, on behalf of leadership in particular, that we have the \ncooperation of all Senators.\n  We had a reasonably good day yesterday, but a lot more needs to be \ndone. We have about 300 amendments pending. Senators are going to have \nto be more realistic about their expectations with regard to offering \namendments. It is my hope that over the course of the next several days \nwe can find a more realistic appreciation of how many amendments there \nreally are and what kind of time will need to be allocated to consider \nthose amendments in the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S9996-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9996-S9997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FARM SUPPORT PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we left for the August recess, I \ncame to the Senate floor to express my serious concerns about this \nadministration's policies towards rural America.\n  On several critical issues, including disaster aid, renewable fuels, \nand market concentration, the decisions the President has made have \nbeen right for a very few large corporations, but wrong for the large \nmajority of rural Americans.\n  And now it appears the administration will once again stand against \nfarmers and ranchers by opposing the bipartisan disaster aid approved \nby the Senate 2 weeks ago. I am hopeful that given the extent of \ndisaster all across the nation and the large bipartisan support for \nthis aid, the administration will withdraw its opposition and agree \nthat farmers and ranchers who are impacted by natural disasters should \nnot be treated differently than others who are victims of hurricanes, \ntornadoes or floods.\n  Unfortunately, the pattern of neglect for rural residents has \ncontinued as the administration has made yet another decision that \ndiminishes the importance of family farmers and ranchers.\n  As part of the ongoing negotiations being held by the World Trade \nOrganization, the Bush administration has agreed to a 20-percent cut in \nthe allowable level of farm support and safety net programs for \nAmerican producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, and other crops.\n  Remarkably, the administration made this concession without receiving \nany assurances from our trading partners that American producers will \nget increased access to foreign markets in return. In other words, the \nadministration has agreed to unilaterally disarm our nation's farmers.\n  For the owners of large corporate agribusinesses, this deal may mean \nincreased profits. But for thousands of family farmers and ranchers, \nthis decision deepens their insecurity, and could lead to devastating \nconsequences the next time we enter a period of low prices.\n  The last time we confronted an extended period of low prices, in 1999 \nand 2000, our domestic support and safety net programs played a key \nrole in helping our rural communities weather the storm.\n  But if the deal that the Bush administration cut had been in effect \nthen, the consequences could have been even more devastating. We could \nhave fallen billions of dollars short of what was necessary to provide \nan adequate safety net for our Nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  In my home State of South Dakota alone, we could have fallen short by \ntens of millions of dollars, cuts that could have had a crippling \nimpact on my State's No. 1 industry, and the overall health of our \nrural economy.\n  One of the specific programs put at risk by the Bush administration's \nproposed cuts is the new countercyclical farm program.\n  Many States, including South Dakota, were pleased with this program, \nwhich pays producers when prices are low but allows no payments when \nprices are high. It uses a formula that updates bases and yields to the \ngreatest extent possible, and that was a big improvement for many \nStates. But this important countercyclical program could now be in \njeopardy because of the administration's framework agreement.\n  For producers in South Dakota who have seen years of drought and have \nnow suffered a large production loss due to an early frost, the \nPresident's trade negotiators have once again called into question \nwhether this administration is willing to back up its rhetorical \nsupport of farmers, ranchers, and rural Americans with the policies \nthat will actually make a difference for our rural economy.\n  South Dakotans understand the benefits of free trade, but they also \nunderstand that free trade must be fair if we are going to avoid a \ndestructive race to the bottom. And right now, the situation \nconfronting American producers is anything but fair.\n  The average worldwide tariff facing American producers is now 62 \npercent, while the average U.S. tariff on imported goods is only 12 \npercent.\n  With the playing field already so slanted, it is inexplicable to me \nthat we would do anything to further tip the scales against American \nproducers. But that is exactly what the Bush administration has done by \nagreeing to cut domestic farm support without getting anything concrete \nin return.\n  Even worse, the President's top agricultural negotiator has already \nindicated that the administration may agree to further reductions, and \nhe has actually told the media that the cuts to domestic support \nprograms could be as high as 50 percent.\n  This is no way to conduct negotiations on behalf of America's farmers \nand ranchers. We should be demanding mutual concessions from our \ntrading partners, not giving up vital safety-net\n\n[[Page S9997]]\n\nprograms based on some vague hope that other countries might open their \nmarkets in the future.\n  When I spoke about the challenges facing our rural communities back \nin July, I said we had a moral obligation to do right by our family \nfarmers and ranchers. That should be our standard whenever we make \ndecisions on agricultural policy: Are we doing right by rural America?\n  The administration's proposal to cut farm support and safety-net \nprograms fails that basic test. Like so many other decisions this \nadministration has made, it puts the interests of large agribusinesses \nahead of farmers and consumers, and it threatens the future health of \nour rural communities.\n  In short, the administration's proposal does wrong by rural America.\n  Last month, I wrote a letter to President Bush asking him to rescind \nhis administration's offer to cut farm support programs. Much to my \ndisappointment, the President's top trade negotiator, Ambassador \nZoellick, responded by saying that my concerns were outside the \n``mainstream of American agriculture.''\n  Well, I have some news: In South Dakota and across rural America, \nselling out farmers and ranchers for the benefit of big agribusiness is \nnot part of the mainstream.\n  I am also not reassured by Ambassador Zoellick's claim that, somehow, \nthe 20-percent cuts will not actually impact our support and safety net \nprograms.\n  Ambassador Zoellick has already touted these cuts as ``concessions'' \nthat brought other nations back to the table.\n  So, which is it, are they concessions or not? Who is being fooled, \nthe other 146 nations or American farmers and ranchers?\n  The administration can't have it both ways. Either the concessions \nmean something and that is what brought the negotiators to the table, \nor the administration fooled all our trading partners. Neither is good \npolicy.\n  My experience with this administration--an administration which \nopposed a robust farm bill--tells me that if there is a trade deal that \nis bad for agriculture but good for other segments of our economy, \nagriculture will lose out, whether that means a 20-percent cut, or even \na 50-percent cut.\n  And at that point, States like South Dakota, and all of rural \nAmerica, will be on the short end of the stick. That is simply \nunacceptable.\n  We can do better. We can return mainstream values to our agricultural \npolicies, and we can do right by America's heartland. It is not too \nlate to reverse the administration's misguided agricultural and rural \npolicies. The WTO negotiators are going back to the negotiating table \nearly next month. They can ensure that we do not give up important \nsafety-net programs without getting anything in return.\n  Those of us who stand with America's farmers and ranchers will \ncontinue to fight to ensure that they are once again treated with the \ndignity and respect that they not only deserve but are entitled to as \nthe anchors of so many of our Nation's communities, and a vital part of \nour Nation's economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S9997-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM ACT OF 2004\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with tonight's Presidential debate coming \nup, the whole Nation will be watching John Kerry and George Bush debate \nthe all important issue of why America went to war in Iraq, when Iraq \nwas not an imminent threat, had no nuclear weapons, no persuasive links \nto al-Qaida, no connection to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, \nand no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.\n  It is now clear that from the very moment President Bush took office, \nIraq was his highest priority as unfinished business from the first \nBush administration.\n  His agenda was clear: find a rationale to get rid of Saddam.\n  Then came 9/11. In the months that followed, the war in Afghanistan \nand the hunt for Osama bin Laden had obvious priority, because al-Qaida \nwas clearly the greatest threat to our national security.\n  Despite all the clear and consistent warnings about al-Qaida, \nPresident Bush treated it as a distraction from his obsession with \nSaddam. By the summer of 2002, President Bush was restless for war with \nIraq. The war in Afghanistan was no longer in the headlines or at the \ncenter of attention. Bin Laden was hard to find, the economy was in \ntrouble, and so was the President's approval ratings in the polls.\n  Karl Rove had tipped his hand earlier by stating that the war on \nterrorism could bring political benefits as well. The President's \nundeniable goal was to convince the American people that war was \nnecessary with Iraq--and necessary right away--because Saddam was a \nbigger threat.\n  That conclusion was not supported by the facts or the intelligence, \nbut they could be retrofitted to support it. Senior administration \nofficials kept suggesting the threat from Iraq was imminent.\n  At a roundtable discussion with European journalists last month, \nSecretary Rumsfeld insisted: ``I never said imminent threat.''\n  In fact, Secretary Rumsfeld had told the House Armed Services \nCommittee on September 18, 2002, ``. . . Some have argued that the \nnuclear threat from Iraq is not imminent--that Saddam is at least 5-7 \nyears away from having nuclear weapons. I would not be so certain.''\n  In May 2003, White spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked whether he went \nto war ``because we said WMD were a direct and imminent threat to the \nUnited States.'' Fleischer responded, ``Absolutely.''\n  What else could National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have been \nsuggesting, other than an imminent threat--an extremely imminent\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\nthreat--when she said on September 8, 2002, ``We don't want the smoking \ngun to be a mushroom cloud.''\n  President Bush himself may not have used the word ``imminent'', but \nhe carefully chose strong and loaded words about the nature of the \nthreat--words that the intelligence community never used--to persuade \nand prepare the Nation to go to war against Iraq.\n  In the Rose Garden on October 2, 2002, as Congress was preparing to \nvote on authorizing the war, the President said the Iraqi regime ``is a \nthreat of unique urgency.''\n  In a speech in Cincinnati on October 7 that year, President Bush \nechoed Condoleezza Rice's image of nuclear devastation: ``Facing clear \nevidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof--the smoking \ngun--that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.'' He says he did \nnot use the word ``imminent.'' What could be more imminent than talk \nlike that?\n  At a political appearance in New Mexico on October 28, 2002, after \nCongress had voted to authorize war, and a week before the election, \nPresident Bush said Iraq was a ``real and dangerous threat.''\n  At a NATO summit on November 20, 2002, President Bush said Iraq posed \na ``unique and urgent threat.''\n  In Fort Hood, TX, on January 3, 2003, President Bush called the Iraqi \nregime a ``grave threat.''\n  Nuclear weapons. Mushroom cloud. Unique and urgent threat. Real and \ndangerous threat. Grave threat. This was the administration's rallying \ncry for war.\n  When he was Secretary of Defense during the first Gulf War, Vice \nPresident Cheney said, ``We were not going to get bogged down in the \nproblems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.''\n  As Senator Edwards has said, Secretary Cheney was against getting \nbogged down in Iraq before he was for it.\n  Here is another quote from the New York Times in 1991, by Secretary \nCheney:\n\n       If you are going to go in and topple Saddam Hussein, you \n     have to go to Baghdad. Once you've got Baghdad, it's not \n     clear what you're going to do with it. It's not clear what \n     kind of government you would put in place. How much \n     credibility is that government going to have if it is set up \n     by the United States military when it is there? How long does \n     the United States military have to protect the people that \n     sign on for that government? What happens to it once we \n     leave?\n\n  That was Secretary Cheney, his words. He was against the war, too, \nbefore he was for it.\n  But, it was Vice President Cheney who first laid out the trumped up \nargument for war with Iraq to an unsuspecting public. In a speech on \nAugust 26, 2002, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he asserted: ``. . . \nWe now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons . . . Many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire nuclear \nweapons fairly soon.'' As we now know, the intelligence community was \nfar from certain. Yet the Vice President had no doubt.\n  On September 8, 2002, Cheney was even more emphatic about Saddam. He \nsaid, ``[We] do know, with absolute certainty, that he is using his \nprocurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich \nuranium to build a nuclear weapon.'' The intelligence community was \ndeeply divided about the aluminum tubes, but Cheney was absolutely \ncertain.\n  One month later, on the eve of the watershed vote by Congress to \nauthorize the war, President Bush said it even more vividly. He said, \n``Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes . . . \nwhich are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi \nregime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched \nuranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear \nweapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible \nline would be crossed . . . Saddam Hussein would be in a position to \npass nuclear technology to terrorists.''\n  In fact, as we now know, the intelligence community was far from \nunited on Iraq's nuclear threat. The administration attempted to \nconceal the disagreement from the public by classifying the information \nand the dissents by the intelligence community until after the war, \neven while making dramatic and excessive public statements about the \nimmediacy of the danger.\n  The second major claim in the administration's case for war was the \nlinkage between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate found no cooperative relationship \nbetween Saddam and al-Qaida. On the contrary, it stated only that such \na relationship might happen if Saddam were ``sufficiently desperate''--\nin other words, if America went to war. But the intelligence estimate \nplaced ``low confidence'' that, even in desperation, Saddam would give \nweapons of mass destruction to al-Qaida.\n  President Bush ignored all that. He was relentless in raising \nAmerica's fears about Saddam after the devastating 9/11 tragedy. He \ndrew a clear link--and drew it repeatedly--between al-Qaida and Saddam.\n  In a September 25, 2002, statement at the White House, President Bush \nflatly declared: ``You can't distinguish between al-Qaida and Saddam \nwhen you talk about the war on terror.'' How could any President make a \npreposterous statement like that?\n  He kept piling it on. In his State of the Union Address in January \n2003, President Bush said, ``Evidence from intelligence sources, secret \ncommunications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that \nSaddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-\nQaida.'' He said Saddam could provide ``lethal viruses'' to a ``shadowy \nterrorist network.''\n  Two weeks later, in his radio address to the Nation, a month before \nthe war began, President Bush described the ties in detail, saying \n``Saddam Hussein has longstanding, direct and continuing ties to \nterrorist networks...''\n  He said: ``Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and al-Qaida have met \nat least eight times since the early 1990s. Iraq has sent bomb making \nand document-forgery experts to work with al-Qaida. Iraq has also \nprovided al-Qaida with chemical and biological weapons training. An al-\nQaida operative was sent to Iraq several times in the late 1990s for \nhelp in acquiring poisons and gases. We also know that Iraq is \nharboring a terrorist network headed by a senior al-Qaida terrorist \nplanner. This network runs a poison and explosive training camp in \nnortheast Iraq, and many of its leaders are known to be in Baghdad.''\n  In fact, there was no operational link and no clear and persuasive \npattern of ties between the Iraq and al-Qaida. That fact should have \nbeen abundantly clear to President Bush, since Iraq and al-Qaida had \ndiametrically opposite views of the world.\n  Al-Qaida and its religious fanatics detested Saddam, because Saddam \nwas a secular dictator. Yet, President Bush had more than half the \ncountry believing that Saddam and al-Qaida were in cahoots on 9/11.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell now agrees that there was no link \nbetween 9/11 and Saddam's regime. So does Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld.\n  A bipartisan 9/11 Commission Staff Statement put it plainly: ``Two \nsenior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed \nbetween al-Qaida and Iraq. We have no credible evidence that Iraq and \nal-Qaida cooperated on attacks against the United States.''\n  The bipartisan 9/11 Commission report stated clearly that there was \nno evidence of a collaborative ``operational'' connection between \nSaddam and al-Qaida. The report said there was no evidence ``indicating \nthat Iraq cooperated with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any \nattacks against the United States.''\n  This past July, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan \nreport whose title was, ``Prewar Intelligence Regarding Iraq Weapons of \nMass Destruction and Links to Terrorism.'' The report said there was \nnot ``an established formal relationship'' between al-Qaida and Saddam \nHussein.\n  But in his march to war, President Bush exaggerated the threat \nanyway. It was not subtle. It was not nuanced. It was pure, \nunadulterated fear mongering, based on a devious strategy to convince \nthe American people that Saddam had helped commit 9/11 and had the \nability to provide nuclear weapons to al-Qaida, so that immediate war \nwas necessary.\n  America went to war in Iraq because President Bush insisted that \nnuclear weapons in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his ties to al-Qaida \nwere too\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\ndangerous to ignore. None of that was true, so all that President Bush \nsays now is that Saddam was a brutal dictator and that America and the \nworld are better off without him. Talk about flip-flops.\n  How dare President Bush accuse John Kerry of flip-flops on Iraq. My \nresponse is ``Physician, heal thyself.'' President Bush is the all-time \nworld-record-holder for flip-flops. Nothing John Kerry has said \nremotely compares with President Bush's gigantic flip-flops on the \nreasons he went to war.\n  The war in Iraq itself has not made America safer and has not made \nthe world safer. None of the President's post war rationalizations are \nsufficient to justify war.\n  Almost every week, President bush tries a new rationale for the war. \nHe's said our goal was ``sovereignty'' for Iraq, ``dignity'' for Iraq's \nculture, and ``for every Iraqi citizen, the opportunity for a better \nlife.''\n  On April 30, 2004, he suggested the war was about human rights, \nsaying ``there are no longer torture chambers or rape rooms or mass \ngraves in Iraq.''\n  He's suggested the war was for freedom and democracy.\n  He's said, ``The rise of a free and self-governing Iraq will deny \nterrorists a base of operation, discredit their narrow ideology, and \ngive momentum to reformers across the region.''\n  He has said the war was ``a victory for the security of America and \nthe civilized world.''\n  None of this rationale is an adequate justification for war, and the \nPresident did not even try to make them a justification until long \nafter the war began and all the other plausible justifications had \nproven false.\n  Saddam was not an imminent threat. The war in Iraq was a perilous \ndistraction from the real war on terrorism--the war against al-Qaida. \nPresident Bush got it exactly wrong. To him, the war in Afghanistan was \na distraction from the war he wanted against Saddam.\n  The war on in Iraq has clearly made America more hated in the world, \nespecially in the Islamic world, and it has made Americans more \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks both here at home and overseas.\n  We'll hear much more about this issue in tonight's Presidential \ndebate, and the debate will go in Congress and in communities across \nthe country between now and the election. The most important decision \nany President ever makes is the decision on war or peace. No President \nwho misleads the country on the need for war deserves to be reelected. \nAny President who does so must be held accountable, and November 2 is \nthe chance to do it.\n  Mr. President, we know that some defenders of the President are \ndesperate to support him. They say any dissent is only helping the \nterrorists. They even claim that al-Qaida wants John Kerry to win this \nelection.\n  It's despicable to make charges like that. It is not unpatriotic to \ntell the truth to the American people about the war in Iraq. In this \ngrave moment of our country, to use the words of Thomas Jefferson, \n``Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski.) The Senator from Oregon is now \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                         Senator Kerry and Iraq\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I have been privileged on a number of \noccasions to be in that chair when Senator Kennedy was speaking. I say \nthis with affection and admiration. Senator Kennedy has been clear from \nthe beginning of this conflict that he is against the war in Iraq, and \nI respect his clarity. But it is interesting that while the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts has been entirely clear and entirely \nconsistent, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, the Democratic \nnominee, could not have been in more confusion, leaving the American \npeople in a greater sense of chaos than words could make possible.\n  It is amazing, interesting, that we have in Senator Kerry a decorated \nVietnam veteran, and yet we have in Senator Kerry a man who now is \nfalling in the polls who faces tonight an opportunity to clarify for \nthe American people his position on Iraq. With plummeting poll numbers, \nit has to be asked, why has his fortunes as a war hero and veteran been \nso reversed?\n  I find the answer in the Good Book in a verse where Paul says:\n\n       For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall \n     prepare himself to the battle?\n\n  I do not know that there is a more certain sound than Senator \nKennedy. I cannot imagine a more uncertain sound than Senator Kerry.\n  Let's review the record. Whether you are for or against the war, \nthose are positions one can argue, as I have done on the side of the \nwar on terrorism that includes Iraq, or as Senator Kennedy has against \nIraq as a part of the war on terrorism, but let's review what Senator \nKerry has said to the American people.\n  Did going to war in Iraq make us more secure or less secure? \nApparently, Senator Kerry is not sure. He is saying now that we traded \na dictator for chaos in Iraq. That has made us less secure. But during \nthe primary season, he ravaged Howard Dean by saying:\n\n       Those who doubted whether Iraq or the world would be better \n     off without Saddam Hussein and those who believe we are not \n     safer with his capture don't have the judgment to be \n     President or the credibility to be elected President.\n\n  Yet those are two diametrically opposed positions.\n  Yesterday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Diane Sawyer asked him \nthis very question. He said: We won't know until we know whether this \nhas been successful or not. Thank Heavens President Roosevelt did not \nhave that position after Corregidor or President Lincoln after \nAntietam. I think John Kerry was right: People who cannot make up their \nminds should not be President of the United States.\n  But which is it? If, indeed, as Senator Kerry has claimed, we are \nless secure, then it seems that he is lacking a serious component of \njudgment.\n  Can Senator Kerry, by virtue of bringing a new face to the \nPresidency, convince some of our reluctant allies to participate more \nvigorously to bringing democracy in Iraq? He believes he can, despite \nthe fact that both the French and German governments have said time and \nagain, repeatedly, no matter the outcome of the American election, they \nwill not do more to help in Iraq.\n  So it seems to me that Senator Kerry is playing a rather false hand \nto the American people. It is an illusory promise. It just will not \nhappen.\n\n  I have heard the Senator complain that we do not have enough troops, \nand now he wants to pull the troops home. So the question is, Should we \nincrease the number of American troops or should we bring them home and \nleave Iraq to the Iraqis? This is a question about which reasonable \npeople can disagree, but Senator Kerry's statements indicate he \ndisagrees again with himself.\n  First he says we should do what the military leaders say, even if \nthat means deploying more troops to Iraq. Then he said he intends to \nget all Americans troops home in his first term. Then last week he said \nhe does not intend to increase troops at all. Specifically he said:\n\n       I believe as a new President, with new credibility, with a \n     fresh start, that I have the ability to be able to change the \n     dynamics on the ground.\n\n  I agree with him; he would certainly change the dynamics on the \nground. The enemies of freedom in Iraq would feel emboldened to wait it \nout until the United States leaves, rather than recognize the \ndemocratic process is irreversible. That is not the kind of dynamic I \nwant to see or the American people deserve to see.\n  When the Senate voted to give President Bush the authority to go to \nwar, did we mean he could actually start a war? This is a question that \nI, as a Senator, take very seriously. Senator Kerry voted for the \nauthorization, just as I did, but is now saying:\n\n       The authority was the authority to do the inspections. The \n     authority is the authority to build an alliance. The \n     authority was necessary because it was the only way to make \n     inspections happen so that you could hold Saddam Hussein \n     accountable.\n\n  And that the Senate also gave the President the ``authority not to go \nto war.'' End of quote from John Kerry.\n  Yet what did the resolution actually say, Madam President? It could \nnot be clearer. You heard what John Kerry said, what he thought it \nsaid, but he should have read it. It says: ``Joint Resolution to \nauthorize the use of the United States Armed Forces against\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nIraq.'' If my colleague read nothing else in the resolution but that \nfirst line, he would still have known what this resolution was designed \nto do.\n  Later in the text, in case anyone missed the intent, it states:\n\n       The Congress declares that this section--\n\n  Which authorizes the use of the Armed Forces--\n\n     is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization \n     within the meaning of 5(b) of the War Powers resolution.\n\n  There is no room for disagreement about what we are doing with this \nresolution. He voted for it. I did. An overwhelming majority did. And \nit does not say what Senator Kerry now says it said.\n  I take responsibility for voting on matters of war and peace very \nseriously, but we cannot have it both ways. We cannot expect to have \ncredibility in the world, that Senator Kerry so consistently states he \nwould bring, if we squander our words in meaning in such a way as he \nnow does on matters as important as authorizing war and peace.\n  What do we do going forward, Madam President? On September 20, \nSenator Kerry gave a speech outlining his latest plan for Iraq. He had \nfour main points.\n\n  The first: The President must get international support so American \ntroops do not have to ``go it alone.''\n  The fact is, 32 countries are contributing 25,000 soldiers to the \ncoalition effort in Iraq.\n  The second part of his plan: The President must get serious about \ntraining Iraqi forces.\n  Yet there are currently almost 100,000 fully trained Iraqi soldiers, \npolice officers, and other security personnel out of the 164,000 Iraqis \nout there on the front lines defending their freedom and protecting \ntheir country. An additional 75,000 Iraqis have received some form of \nsecurity training to guard important facilities.\n  The third point: The President must carry out a reconstruction plan \nthat brings tangible benefits to the Iraqi people.\n  Yet the United States has already spent more than a billion dollars \non urgent reconstruction projects in areas threatened by the \ninsurgency. In the next several months, over $9 billion will be spent \non contracts that will help Iraqis rebuild schools, hospitals, bridges, \nas well as upgrade the electricity grid and modernize the \ncommunications system.\n  This point is actually particularly laughable, given that Senator \nKerry, who now says we have to do this, voted against the money to do \nthis. He voted against the $87 billion before he says he voted for it \nthat included nearly $20 billion in vital reconstruction for Iraq. \nAgain, the uncertainty.\n  His final point: The President must take immediate steps to guarantee \nelections in Iraq will be held next year.\n  Yet an Iraqi electoral commission is now up and running and has \nalready hired personnel and is making key decisions about electoral \nprocedures. The commission launched a public education campaign to \ninform Iraqis about the process and encourage them to become voters, \nand United Nation's electoral advisers are on the ground in Iraq.\n  What is particularly interesting about this is that on May 24, 2004, \nnearly 4 months before Senator Kerry's speech in New York, President \nBush laid out a five-step plan for helping Iraq achieve democracy and \nfreedom. Everything Senator Kerry proposed was part of the President's \nplan he announced in May, and the administration has been implementing \nit.\n  In conclusion, at the present time, Senator Kerry issued a press \nrelease stating that the President's speech laid out general \nprinciples--and this is laughable--``most of which we've heard before'' \nbecause they are part and parcel of the President's plan.\n  So if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, no one will prepare to \nbattle, and that, I believe, is the reason for Senator Kerry's \nplummeting in the opinion polls of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, we are now going to resume \nconsideration of S. 2845. Senator Lieberman and I, along with the two \nleaders, encourage Members to come forward with their amendments. The \nleaders are determined that we will finish this bill very early next \nweek. In order to do so, we need the cooperation of all Senators who \nhave filed amendments, and we encourage them to bring them forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3797\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to speak on what \nI consider to be one of the most important areas of intelligence \nreform, and then I will offer an amendment to help advance that \nposition.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have been making a series of \nstatements on various aspects of intelligence reform. In my recent \nstatements, I have discussed the history of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity, the community's failure to adapt to changing conditions \nsince the end of the Cold War, the unfortunate reluctance of both the \nCongress and the administration to tackle these much needed and long-\nreported necessary reforms, the shape that I believe our reform should \ntake, and the danger that excessive Government secrecy poses to our \nnational security.\n  I have also expressed my gratitude to the independent 9/11 Commission \nand its predecessors for the work they have done in analyzing the \nstrengths and weaknesses of the American intelligence community and \noffering recommendations as to how these weaknesses can be remedied.\n  Today, I also thank several of my colleagues for the work they have \ndone in providing the groundwork for this legislation and moving it \nsubstantially toward fruition. Senators Collins and Lieberman have put \na substantial amount of work into crafting meaningful bipartisan \nintelligence reform legislation that seeks to correct current failings. \nThey and their staffs should be commended for that effort.\n  In addition, Senators McCain and Roberts have stepped forward with \nvery thoughtful proposals for reform, and as we work to fine-tune the \nCollins-Lieberman bill, their proposals will be an excellent source of \nideas and alternatives.\n  We all owe our gratitude to the other members of the Governmental \nAffairs and Intelligence Committees, especially Vice Chairman \nRockefeller on the Intelligence Committee, and their respective staff \nmembers for all the contributions they have made to the debate over the \ndirection of intelligence reform.\n  I spoke last week about the direction in which I thought we should \nmove with these reforms and the shape these reforms should take. I \nwould now like to discuss in more detail how we might accomplish that \nwithin this legislation.\n  I will offer an amendment which I hope will be a contribution to \nachieving these goals. First some background.\n  Our national intelligence community currently resembles our military \nas it looked prior to 1947. It is made up of a number of agencies that \noriginated at different times and with different structures, with \nshared common goals, but frequently found they had difficulty working \nwith one another because of their different histories, different \ncultures, different bureaucratic structures, and different priorities. \nThat would have also been a definition for the American military pre-\n1947.\n  In that year, at the urging of President Harry Truman, Congress \npassed the National Security Act, which brought together all of the \ncomponents of the military. There had been a Secretary of the Navy, \nthere had been a Secretary of War, sometimes referred to as the \nSecretary of the Army, and there certainly would have been a Secretary \nof the Air Force had the National Security Act not intervened. This new \nlegislation created for the first time a civilian leader at the top and \nuniformed service chiefs reporting to that leader.\n\n  This was an important reform, but it did not end all the rivalries \nand competition for actions and spending resources within the military. \nThere were a series of events that occurred in the late 1970s and early \n1980s which dramatized these continuing weaknesses. We were unable to \nrescue hostages who had been taken in Tehran. We were unable to avoid \nthe massacre of over 200 American marines in barracks in Beirut by \nHezbollah, and there were a series of missteps on the small island of \nGrenada. Reviewing all of these issues, in 1986, it was becoming\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\napparent that though all the services reported to a single departmental \nhead, they still had many problems communicating with one another and \nworking effectively together.\n  As it had in 1947, Congress again stepped forward with the Goldwater-\nNichols Act, which decentralized the military establishment. Control \nover military operations moved from the Pentagon to several joint \ncommands, each responsible for a different geographic area of the \nworld. As a result, the U.S. military has become more effective than \never before.\n  Given that our international intelligence community is currently in a \npre-1947 state, our challenge now is to enact both the equivalence of \nthe National Security Act of 1947 and the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 \nat the same time. In other words, we must centralize authority and then \nimmediately commence the process of decentralizing the bureaucracy.\n  We waited 39 years between the National Security Act and Goldwater-\nNichols. We cannot afford to wait 39 years between the action we will \nhopefully take this year and the time we will begin to decentralize the \nintelligence bureaucracies. It is essential that this legislation \ncreate a strong director of national intelligence and also lay out the \nbest possible structure for intelligence collection and analysis.\n  In my view and in the view of many others, our intelligence community \nwould be most effective if it were organized around the mission-based \nmodel that brings personnel from different agencies and specialties \ntogether to focus on whatever intelligence missions the national \ndirector deems to be most important.\n  In a recent publication called ``Intelligence Matters,'' I state:\n\n       This may seem counterintuitive, but for us to deal with \n     this decentralization, we must first centralize. Since their \n     inception, the agencies that make up our foreign intelligence \n     community have focused on assignments like the collection of \n     signals or visual images. While each agency focuses on its \n     own responsibilities, the larger realities--like the changed \n     nature of the enemy--go unattended. They are nobody's \n     business.\n\n  The structure we have before us today gives us an opportunity to \nplace those large issues of adaptation to new threats in an appropriate \nstructure.\n  The director will be responsible for giving the centers their \nmissions and assigning them the personnel and resources they need to do \ntheir job.\n  He or she can then be held accountable for the centers' performance \nand accomplishments.\n  This model was previously suggested by the 9/11 Commission.\n  In the conclusion of its report, it discusses the structural problems \nthat currently plague our intelligence community, and suggest that \nsignificant changes must be made in order to achieve unity of effort \namong the community's various agencies.\n  The Commission report recommends that a national center for \ncounterterrorism be established, and I am pleased that President Bush \nhas endorsed the creation of such a center, and it is contained in the \nlegislation before us today.\n  This center will bring together personnel from a variety of \ndisciplines and specialties from across the intelligence community to \nfocus on the problem of international terrorism.\n  By bringing them all together and placing them on the same staff, we \ncan overcome the bureaucratic and sociological barriers that have \nsometimes prevented them from being effective.\n  This will also help us use our intelligence resources more \nefficiently by ensuring that different agencies are not doing redundant \nwork on the same threat.\n  In addition to a national counterterrorism center, the Commission \nalso recommends that other centers be created to focus on different \nglobal challenges, such as nuclear proliferation, international drug \ntrafficking, or particular rogue states such as North Korea, and Iran.\n  These centers would be able to bring together personnel in the same \nmanner as the Counterterrorism Center, allowing us to be more efficient \nand effective in intelligence gathering and analysis.\n  The Commission recommended that management of these centers should be \none of the director's primary responsibilities. Their recommendation \nstates:\n\n       The current position of Director of Central Intelligence \n     should be replaced by a National Intelligence Director with \n     two main areas of responsibility: (1) to oversee national \n     intelligence centers on specific subjects of interests across \n     the U.S. government and (2) to manage the national \n     intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute \n     to it.\n\n  The national director must be given the flexibility to create, \nreorganize or even disband these centers as needed, just as the \nSecretary of Defense has the authority to shift the responsibility of \nthe unified commands.\n  For instance, Syria and Lebanon were once included in the European \nCommand, but as the international situation changed, it became more \nappropriate to move them to Central Command, which already included \ntheir Middle Eastern neighbors.\n  A second instance is the Caribbean region, which was previously \nincluded in the Atlantic Command and has since been moved to the \nSouthern Command, which includes the rest of Latin America.\n  Congress had empowered the Secretary of Defense to make these \ndecisions while maintaining its constitutional responsibility for \noversight and appropriations.\n  This wise allocation of authority has enabled the Department of \nDefense to do what the intelligence community has been unable to do; \nthat is to respond to changing conditions in a swift and decisive \nmanner.\n  The authors of Goldwater-Nichols gave the Secretary of Defense the \nnecessary level of flexibility and adaptability by not writing into law \nwhich commands should be created and what countries they should \ninclude.\n  Instead, we empowered the Secretary to establish or alter the unified \ncommands as circumstances dictate.\n  The current version of the Collions-Lieberman bill includes language \nto establish national intelligence centers, in accordance with the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations.\n  This is obviously a significant step in the right direction.\n  However, I believe that is necessary to make some modifications to \nthe language in order to clarify the purpose of the centers and to \nensure that the national intelligence director has the authority needed \nto manage them effectively.\n  Some of the provisions that we need to be aware of and include in the \nfinal version of this legislation as it relates to national \nintelligence centers are these:\n  First, we should include language making clear that the mission of \nthe national intelligence centers is to focus on specific threats.\n  In keeping with the Commission's recommendation, this would mean that \nsome centers might focus on specific countries or regions, while others \nwould focus on global problems such as nuclear proliferation.\n  Second, we must make the national intelligence centers the focal \npoint of intelligence gathering and analysis for their particular area \nof focus.\n  The centers should develop a strategy for the collection and analysis \nof intelligence regarding their area of focus and draw upon the \nresources of the various intelligence agencies to implement this \nstrategy.\n  To give an example of how this might work, imagine that the national \ndirector believes that we need a focus on counterproliferation of \nnuclear weapons, and surely we do.\n  In a very important recent book, ``Nuclear Terrorism,'' by Graham \nAllison, it is pointed out that there are two important truths as it \nrelates to nuclear terrorism. The first is that it is inevitable that \nnuclear weapons will come into the hands of terrorists who will use \nthem against us. The second truth is that inevitability is preventable.\n  Professor Allison points out a number of steps that must be taken in \norder to avoid the inevitable. Many of those relate to the intelligence \ncommunity's role. Professor Allison makes a number of suggestions as to \nwhat reforms are required in order to avoid a nuclear weapon in the \nhands of a terrorist who is destined to use it against the people of \nthe United States.\n  Just to summarize his points:\n  First, American intelligence must move beyond its Cold War mindset. \nThis legislation will help us achieve that goal.\n  Second, the United States must cultivate long-term strategic \nrelationships with foreign intelligence agencies. I believe having a \nstrong director\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nof national intelligence will contribute to that objective.\n  Third, the American intelligence community must enhance its data-\nmining efforts to process, analyze, and disseminate open sources of \nintelligence. This legislation provides a heightened awareness of the \nvalue and the credibility of open source information, that is \ninformation that is available, other than through clandestine means.\n  Finally and above all, intelligence assessments must be credible.\n  I believe this provision for the establishment of national \nintelligence centers will make a dramatic contribution toward enhancing \nthe credibility of U.S. intelligence.\n  The fact that we are creating within this legislation one national \nintelligence center, that for counterterrorism, and leaving the \ncreation of the other centers up to the discretion of the national \nintelligence director is essentially an accident of history. The 9/11 \nattacks were the use of conventional weapons--fire and gasoline--in a \nnonconventional manner--large airplanes flying into large buildings.\n  If the attacks of 9/11 had taken another form, such as a cargo \ncontainer which was loaded at a distant point and arrived in the Port \nof New York and was unloaded, and a week later found itself in downtown \nChicago, and because that container, in addition to its commercial \ncargo, also carried a dirty nuclear bomb, and that bomb, were it to be \ndetonated, we would have had an event multiple times of what, in fact, \nhappened on 9/11. And I can assure you that the center would have been \nwritten into this legislation and would have been the center on the \navoidance of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n  We are about to give that authority to the director of intelligence. \nI believe we should give it to him with as close as possible the same \nauthority and the same capability as we are statutorily giving to the \ncenter on terrorism. That is what this amendment attempts to do.\n  Finally, we must ensure that our national intelligence community is \nconstantly adapting in response to changes in the world around us. \nUnfortunately, our intelligence community, since its inception in that \nsame National Security Act of 1947, has had difficulty adapting to \nchanged circumstances. It had that difficulty in the 1950s. It has had \nthat difficulty since the last of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s \nthrough the early 1990s. Our intelligence agencies were slow in \nshifting their focus from the Soviet Union to the more diffuse threat \nsuch as terrorism, weapons proliferation, and rogue states.\n  As former CIA Director James Woolsey put it:\n\n       It was as if we had been struggling with a dragon for 45 \n     years and finally defeated it . . . and then found ourselves \n     in the jungle with a lot of poisonous snakes. The snakes were \n     harder to keep track of than the dragon.\n\n  The national director should be required to frequently review the \nmission and areas of responsibility of the intelligence centers, so \nthat we do not waste time staring at the dragon which we have already \nslain.\n  He must also have the ability to create new centers rapidly, so that \nthey are not slow to react to the appearance of snakes.\n  The amendment I am offering would modify the very instructive \npolicies in the Collins-Lieberman bill to lay the groundwork for \nreforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission, and ensure that the \nnational director has sufficient authority to carry them out.\n  Madam President and colleagues, I draw your attention to the fact \nthat I have discussed this amendment with Governor Kean and with former \nCongressman Lee Hamilton, the distinguished Chair of the 9/11 \nCommission. And I am pleased they have responded enthusiastically.\n  I have received a letter from Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton \nwhich includes this statement:\n\n       The importance of integrated, all-source analysis cannot be \n     overstated. Without it, it is not possible to ``connect the \n     dots.'' No one competent today holds all of the relevant \n     information. Our view is it is imperative to have unity of \n     effort across the intelligence community.\n       Therefore, we strongly endorse the creation of national \n     intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest across \n     the U.S. Government. Clearly, with regard to the high \n     priority of counterterrorism, the centers should be the \n     intelligence entity inside the national counterterrorism \n     center . . . we have proposed. Other national intelligence \n     centers--for instance, on counter-proliferation, crime and \n     narcotics, the Middle East, Russia and China--could be \n     created based on the President and National Security \n     Council's determination of need.\n\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       A true sharing of all relevant information among analysts, \n     and the creation of national intelligence centers offering \n     the best advice and analysis to the President--together with \n     the continued independence of State, Treasury, Energy and \n     Defense Department analytical units--provides a better way to \n     foster competitive analysis than does the status quo.\n       To keep the country secure, we believe the government must \n     build the intelligence capabilities it will need for the \n     broad range of national security challenges in the decades \n     ahead.\n\n  We have the opportunity to take a step which will fundamentally \nenhance the security of the people of America not only against the \nthreat that we know today, not only against the dragons with which we \nare currently grappling, but with those poisonous snakes that may not \nbe so obvious, the poisonous snakes which may be hiding just beyond the \nhorizon.\n  The national intelligence centers will be a key to our ability to do \nfor intelligence what Goldwater-Nichols did in 1986 for our military.\n  I urge my colleagues to seriously consider and to adopt these \namendments to the excellent legislation which is before us today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Governor Kean and \nCongressman Hamilton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 27, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham.\n       Dear Senator Graham: Thank you for your question about the \n     9/11 Commission's proposal to establish national intelligence \n     centers. The Commission made 41 recommendations that we \n     believe will significantly improve the security and safety of \n     all Americans. All of the recommendations are, in our \n     estimation, important.\n       We see a particular need for creating national intelligence \n     centers. We have reviewed your suggest amendment on the topic \n     of national intelligence centers. The language seems \n     constructive, and consistent with our proposed approach. As \n     far as how to proceed, we leave the tactics of floor \n     consideration to you and the bill managers.\n       In our investigation of the 9/11 attacks, we learned that \n     the national security institutions of the U.S. government are \n     still the institutions constructed to fight the Cold War. \n     National intelligence is still organized around the \n     collection disciplines of the home agencies, not the joint \n     mission.\n       The importance of integrated, all-source analysis cannot be \n     overstated. Without it, it is not possible to ``connect the \n     dots.'' No one component today holds all the relevant \n     information. Our view is that it is imperative to have unity \n     of effort across the intelligence community.\n       Therefore, we strongly endorse the creation of national \n     intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest across \n     the U.S. government. Clearly, with regard to the high \n     priority of counterterrorism, the center--should be the \n     intelligence entity (formerly the Terrorist Threat \n     Integration Center) inside the National Counterterrorism \n     Center we have proposed. Other national intelligence \n     centers--for instance, on counterproliferation, crime and \n     narcotics, the Middle East, Russia, and China--could be \n     created based on the President and National Security \n     Council's determination of need. These centers will draw from \n     the talent of the individual agencies and become truly \n     national intelligence centers on their respective issues.\n       The National Intelligence Director that we have proposed \n     would oversee the national intelligence centers to provide \n     all-source analysis and plan intelligence operations for the \n     whole government on major problems. Under our proposals, the \n     National Intelligence Director would retain the present \n     Director of Central Intelligence's role as the principal \n     intelligence adviser to the president. We hope the president \n     will come to look directly to the directors of the national \n     intelligence centers to provide all-source analysis in their \n     areas of responsibility.\n       A true sharing of all relevant information among analysts, \n     and the creation of national intelligence centers offering \n     their best advice and analysis to the president--together \n     with the continued independence of State, Treasury, Energy \n     and Defense Department analytical units--provides a better \n     way to foster competitive analysis than does the status quo.\n       To keep the country secure, we believe the government must \n     build the intelligence capabilities it will need for the \n     broad range of national security challenges in the decades \n     ahead. National intelligence centers should be among those \n     capabilities.\n       We deeply appreciate your interest in the Commission's \n     recommendations, and we look\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\n     forward to working with you on the national intelligence \n     centers proposal, as well as on our other recommendations.\n           Very respectfully,\n     Tom Kean.\n     Lee Hamilton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wonder if I could, through you, ask \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas if he is going to comment on \nSenator Graham's amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. No. I was going to comment on an amendment that we \nadopted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, after Senator Pryor comments, I will \nbe glad to speak for Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today with a note of \nencouragement; that is, one of the things I have noticed through the \ncommittee process, and certainly on the Senate floor, is how \nbipartisan--or maybe in a better sense of the word, nonpartisan--this \ndebate has been. I think the Senate is very committed to following up \non the 9/11 recommendations in the 9/11 report. I think we are \napproaching this in a way that is very constructive and very positive, \nand which we all hope and pray in the long term is very effective for \nour national security and for our intelligence.\n  I know there are a number of amendments that we have still pending. I \ndon't know exactly what is going to be offered or what will be agreed \nto, but my plan is to listen very carefully to all of those amendments. \nI think they all have value. I may vote against some of them; \nnonetheless, I think it is important that we have this discussion, have \nthis debate, and show our leadership for this Nation on this very \nissue.\n  There are two Members, two really great leaders, I wish to commend; \nthat is, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman. They have done a \nfantastic job and have demonstrated the patience of Job through this \nprocess in their determination and commitment. They are a prime example \nof how this Senate can work and should work and how great things can be \naccomplished by working together.\n  I think it is incumbent for us as a Senate and as a Congress to \nprovide the tools and the structure that we need in our intelligence \ncommunity to connect the dots.\n  I think the 9/11 Commission said this in a number of ways in a number \nof cases. But at one point, the 9/11 Commission report said:\n\n       Of all our recommendations, strengthening congressional \n     oversight may be among the most difficult and important.\n\n  I know because I have talked to many of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle that this body is committed to reforming itself when it \ncomes to intelligence issues.\n  Let me read, if I may, from the report one short paragraph found on \npage 105 of the 9/11 Commission Report. It says:\n\n        Fourth, the oversight function of Congress has diminished \n     over time. In recent years, traditional review of the \n     administration of programs and the implementation of laws has \n     been replaced by ``a focus on personal investigations, \n     possible scandals, and issues designed to generate media \n     attention.'' The unglamorous but essential work of oversight \n     has been neglected, and few members past or present believe \n     it is performed well. DCI Tenet told us: ``We ran from threat \n     to threat to threat. . . . [T]here was not a system in place \n     to say, `You got to go back and do this and this and this.' \n     '' Not just the DCI but the entire executive branch needed \n     help from Congress in addressing the questions of \n     counterterrorism strategy and policy, looking past day-to-day \n     concerns. Members of Congress, however, also found their time \n     spent on such everyday matters, or in looking back to \n     investigate mistakes, and often missed the big questions--as \n     did the executive branch. Staff tended as well to focus on \n     parochial considerations, seeking to add or cut funding for \n     individual (often small) programs, instead of emphasizing \n     comprehensive oversight projects.\n\n  Madam President, my hope is when we finish this bill--it looks as \nthough next week, realistically at this point--we will then turn to the \nwork of reforming congressional oversight. Members on both sides of the \naisle are very committed to doing that.\n  Let me speak for a moment or two about an amendment I was able to \ntack on in committee. Again, I thank the leadership in the committee \nbut also thank the entire committee because in the end, after we \nexplained this and worked through this and walked through this, we \ndecided this was an amendment that should be added to the bill, and it \ncurrently is in the proposed legislation.\n  Basically, one thing the 9/11 Commission Report said is we need to \nhave a way to evaluate our intelligence structures. It is important as \nwe pass this reform legislation, the most significant reform of \nintelligence since 1947, to build into it some sort of look-back \nprovision. That is what we have tried to do with my amendment. I am \nglad the committee has agreed with this and has been able to go along \nwith this.\n  Basically, it requires the GAO to give a report in 2 years, an \nindependent objective look at what we have done--have we been \nsuccessful? Have we failed? Do we need to take away a little bit here \nor add a little bit there? But an independent evaluation, nonpartisan \nlook at exactly what we have done to make sure it is working. It is too \nimportant to not get it right the first time.\n  For example, the 9/11 Commission found a need-to-know culture of \ninformation protection rather than a need-to-share culture of \nintegration. The GAO review can indicate whether adequate mechanisms \nhave been put in place to change this culture and be more productive \nand better, long term, for U.S. intelligence.\n  I thank the committee for its hard work. I thank the two leaders for \ntheir hard work. I thank this entire body for approaching this \nchallenge in a very nonpartisan way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for \nthe diligence with which he approached the hearings throughout the \nAugust recess and the writing of this important legislation. I very \nmuch appreciate the comments of the Senator from Arkansas. He is always \ngenerous to me, as well as to the ranking member. We would be remiss if \nwe did not thank him for his contributions to this bill. He was \nterrific about redoing his schedule throughout the August recess to \nparticipate in our numerous hearings. He was instrumental in drafting \nprovisions of the bill including the requirement for the GAO report. I \nrecognize his hard work and leadership and thank him for his kind \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3797\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I send to the desk the amendment \nconsistent with the statement I have just made and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3797.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the authorities with respect to the national \n                         intelligence centers)\n\n       On page 94, line 14, insert before the period the \n     following: ``, whether expressed in terms of geographic \n     region, in terms of function, or in other terms''.\n       On page 95, line 3, insert after the period the following: \n     ``Each notice on a center shall set forth the mission of such \n     center, the area of intelligence responsibility of such \n     center, and the proposed structure of such center.''.\n       On page 96, line 7, insert ``of the center and the \n     personnel of the center'' after ``control''.\n       On page 96, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       (5) If the Director of a national intelligence center \n     determines at any time that the authority, direction, and \n     control of the Director over the center is insufficient to \n     accomplish the mission of the center, the Director shall \n     promptly notify the National Intelligence Director of that \n     determination.\n       On page 97, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (5) develop and unify strategy for the collection and \n     analysis of all-source intelligence;\n       (6) integrate intelligence collection and analysis, both \n     inside and outside the United States;\n       (7) at the discretion of the NID develop interagency plans \n     for the collection of all-source intelligence, which plans \n     shall--\n       (A) involve more than one department, agency, or element of \n     the executive branch (unless otherwise directed by the \n     President); and\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\n       (B) include the mission, objectives to be achieved, courses \n     of action, parameters for such courses of action, \n     coordination of agencies intelligence collection activities, \n     recommendations for intelligence collection plans, and \n     assignment of departmental or agency responsibilities;\n       (4) ensure that the collection of all-source intelligence \n     and the conduct of operations are informed by the analysis of \n     all-source intelligence; and\n       On page 99, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (g) Review and Modification of Centers.--(1) Not less often \n     than once each year, the National Intelligence Director shall \n     review the area of intelligence responsibility assigned to \n     each national intelligence center under this section in order \n     to determine whether or not such area of responsibility \n     continues to meet intelligence priorities established by the \n     National Security Council.\n       (2) Not less often than once each year, the National \n     Intelligence Director shall review the staffing and \n     management of each national intelligence center under this \n     section in order to determine whether or not such staffing or \n     management remains appropriate for the accomplishment of the \n     mission of such center.\n       (3) The National Intelligence Director may at any time \n     recommend to the President a modification of the area of \n     intelligence responsibility assigned to a national \n     intelligence center under this section. The National \n     Intelligence Director shall make any such recommendation \n     through, and with the approval of, the National Security \n     Council.\n       (h) Separate Budget Account.--The National Intelligence \n     Director shall, in accordance with procedures to be issued by \n     the Director in consultation with the congressional \n     intelligence committees, include in the National Intelligence \n     Program budget a separate line item for each national \n     intelligence center under this section.\n       On page 99, line 21, strike ``(g)'' and insert ``(i)''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Graham, for introducing this amendment that \nclarifies the role of the national intelligence centers that the NID is \nempowered to create under our bill.\n  Senator Graham, as former chair of the Intelligence Committee, and \nhaving just published a book on intelligence, provides this body with a \nvery important perspective in this debate. His amendment strengthens \nthe role of the national intelligence centers by placing them on par \nwith the National Counterterrorism Center. This amendment provides much \nneeded flexibility to the national intelligence director in \nestablishing the centers. It allows the director to establish criteria \nfor the centers to focus on vital areas of expertise.\n  The amendment also directs the national intelligence director to \nprovide an annual report to Congress on the responsibilities of each of \nthe centers that are created. This is an important aspect of this \namendment. We can no longer afford to maintain the same percentage of \nRussian linguists today, for example, as we had during the Cold War. We \nhave new wars, new challenges, new threats, and they demand new \ncapabilities and responses as the 9/11 Commission Report indicated.\n  This amendment is well within the intent of the 9/11 Commission \nReport and recommendations as is evident by the letter that the Senator \nhas from the chairman and vice chairman of the committee. I endorse the \namendment on my side. I am happy to accept it. I thank the Senator for \nworking closely with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to support the amendment, as \nwell, and to thank Senator Graham for the characteristic thoughtfulness \nhe brought to this matter and the very constructive additions this \namendment makes to the bill and to clarify the authority and the \nimportance of these centers.\n  This is one of the central contributions of this legislation and \nderivatively of the 9/11 Commission Report. It grows out of the \noutrageous failure to share information prior to September 11 that the \n9/11 Commission Report documents in riveting detail.\n  As the Chair knows, we would establish on the passage of this, a \nnational counter terrorism center to focus all of our efforts from all \nagencies--unity of effort, joint command operations, et cetera--in the \nfight against terrorism. We also take this basic idea and say to the \nnational intelligence director, you can set up other centers to deal \nwith other particular problems--maybe a specific threat like weapons of \nmass destruction or nuclear proliferation specifically or a country or \nsubgroup that may be threatening--the United States, set up a center on \nNorth Korea or Iran--and you would guarantee, thereby, in these other \ncenters that all the arms of our Government would know what the others \nwould be doing, would be sharing intelligence and analysis of \nintelligence through these centers, being able to plan joint operations \nfor the collection of intelligence, very critically important to inform \nthe President and the officers of our Government how to deal with these \ncrisis. Senator Graham's amendment makes clear how important these \ncenters are that the NID can create.\n  I stress, also, the centers are not permanent. They are part of the \nvision that comes out of the 9/11 Commission Report. The Collins-\nLieberman bill before the Senate now is about modern management, 21st \ncentury management. If there is a problem, create a center with all \nyour best people around the table planning how to collect and analyze \nintelligence about the problem, advise the President, Secretary of \nState, Secretary of Defense, whomever. Once that problem is resolved, \nthat center can and should be terminated. That is the kind of \nflexibility involved.\n  Senator Graham, as Senator Collins has said, is building on an \nextraordinary record of experience and very constructive leadership, \noutspoken, appropriately outspoken leadership in the area of \nintelligence, and has given us the benefit of that experience with this \namendment. I thank him for it. I am happy to accept the amendment on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3797) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I extend my deepest gratitude \nto Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman and also my appreciation for \nthe Senators' kind remarks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is deserved.\n  I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside the \npending business so I may offer an amendment which is at the desk.\n  Before I finish, I want to say this on behalf of Senator Chambliss \nand myself. My intention is to speak on it now, then come back to it--\npursuant to an agreement that will be worked out with the managers of \nthe bill--sometime early tomorrow afternoon, and people who are opposed \nto it will have been able to come to the floor and debate it. So we \nwill talk on it right now for a little while, but the purpose for \nproceeding now is to get it pending so we can later reach an agreement \nand set it for debate at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Chambliss, and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3801.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To modify the privacy and civil liberties oversight)\n\n       On page 52, strike beginning with line 21 through page 56, \n     line 8.\n       On page 154, strike beginning with line 8 through page 160, \n     line 11 and insert the following:\n       (d) Functions.--\n       (1) Advice and counsel on policy development and \n     implementation.--The Board shall--\n       (A) review proposed legislation, regulations, and policies \n     related to efforts to protect the Nation from terrorism, \n     including the development and adoption of information sharing \n     guidelines under section 205(g);\n       (B) review the implementation of new and existing \n     legislation, regulations, and policies related to efforts to \n     protect the Nation from\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\n     terrorism, including the implementation of information \n     sharing guidelines under section 205(g);

and\n       (C) other actions by the executive branch related to \n     efforts to protect the Nation from terrorism to determine \n     whether such actions--\n       (i) appropriately protect privacy and civil liberties; and\n       (ii) are consistent with governing laws, regulations, and \n     policies regarding privacy and civil liberties.\n       (3) Testimony.--The Members of the Board shall appear and \n     testify before Congress upon request.\n       (e) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--The Board shall periodically submit, not \n     less than semiannually, reports--\n       (A)(i) to the appropriate committees of Congress, including \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate, the Committee on Government Reform of the House \n     of Representatives, the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives;

Mr. President, neither the 9/11 Commission nor the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, nor anyone else that I am aware of, has said \nthe problem leading up to the attack of 9/11 was due to too much \nintelligence. The problem, obviously, arose because we didn't have \nenough intelligence. We could not gather enough information in a timely \nway to put together all of the possibilities--some say connect the \ndots--in order to predict that a particular kind of attack was going to \noccur on that day.\n  We have had a lot of good, constructive suggestions from the 9/11 \nCommission, from the Senate Intelligence Committee, from the \nadministration, from the work of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nand from other commissions in trying to understand why we didn't have \nenough intelligence and why we could not put all of this together. Many \nof the recommendations of the Commission and the legislative solutions \nin the proposed bill try to correct that problem of not having enough \ngood intelligence.\n  None of the problems identified suggested that we had too much \nintelligence and the problem was that people's civil liberties were \nsomehow being jeopardized, or that their privacy rights were being \njeopardized. Nobody has ever said that was a problem.\n  Subsequent to 9/11, we passed the PATRIOT Act. It has been signed \ninto law and most law enforcement officials, the administration, and \nothers argue persuasively, I think, that it has done a lot to help them \nwin the war on terror by collecting additional intelligence. Some have \nconcerns about some of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act with respect \nto civil liberties or privacy rights. But those are issues that have \ncome up subsequent to 9/11.\n  My point is that the problem before 9/11 was not having too much \nintelligence and that jeopardized people's privacy or civil rights. \nTherefore, it comes as a great surprise to me that there is such a huge \nemphasis in the committee bill on privacy, civil rights, on having an \nombudsman to protect people's rights, on having such an emphasis within \nthe national intelligence directorate on these subjects, having a \nspecial board that would look into it, with subpoena powers, outside \nthe intelligence community, and so on. It is my considered judgment, \nhaving served on the committee for 8 years, and having heard testimony \nfrom a great many people, including Richard Clark, by the way, who \ntestified that risk aversion was one of the key problems leading up to \n9/11--it is my judgment that the overkill of all of these provisions in \nthe bill is a fatal flaw in this legislation, which must be corrected, \nor else what we would have done is to rearrange the bureaucracy here, \nputting a person in charge as the national intelligence director and \nmaking some other changes but crippling his effort and the efforts of \nthe intelligence collection gatherers, analysts, and others in their \nability to protect us by gathering intelligence.\n  Risk aversion, which is a big problem today, will be a huge problem \nin the future because, in addition to the people today who are looking \nover the shoulders of the intelligence community, we will have a whole \narray of new entities with great powers looking over their shoulder; \nand all of the effort that we are going through to try to begin saying \nthat people should think outside the box, should be bold, innovative, \nand imaginative, that we need more human intelligence, and that those \nhuman intelligence agents are going to do things to gather more \nintelligence--we should have people who are willing to think outside \nthe box. All of that is going to be significantly jeopardized because \nof the risk aversion that will be blanketed over all of the community \nwith all of these different entities saying, wait a minute, we \nunderstand you are trying to collect intelligence, but we have people's \ncivil rights and privacy rights and all the rest to be concerned about \nas well.\n\n  Of course those are legitimate concerns. That is why we have entities \ntoday that help to ensure that privacy and civil rights are not \njeopardized. It is enough. This bill creates so many new opportunities \nfor people who object to intelligence gathering and analysis in the way \nwe know it needs to be done that they are going to be able to ball up \nforever any ability to get meaningful intelligence if we are not \ncareful about how we construct this bill.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about what I am talking about. Here is a \nbit of background. Risk aversion--we understand what it means. It was \ntestified to by people such as Richard Clark and others before the \nIntelligence Committee as the mindset which exists if you do anything \nout of the ordinary, if you go against the grain, if you collect by \nunorthodox measures, if you analyze intelligence in a way that might be \ncontrary to the superiors above you in the organization, or to what \nsomebody in Congress or somebody else wants to see, or if the actions \nthat you take have some degree of risk associated with them--either \npolitical risk or legal risk, or certainly operational risk in terms of \ncasualties and the like--therefore, because of all of these things \nthere is an aversion to taking those risks.\n  Government employees who have a career, who have their retirement in \nmind, and who want to continue to work with the agency want to be sure \nthey are able to continue their careers, do their jobs, and not, \nbecause they perhaps work outside of the box, be penalized for doing \nthat.\n  Agent Rowling of the FBI talked about this in her inability to get \nthe FBI to act on a warrant request she\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\nsought to look into Zacarias Moussaoui's computers. One of the reasons \nthey didn't act was out of a ``political correctness''--their term, not \nmine--that concerned them about the view that it would look like they \nwere going after somebody on the basis of racial profiling, or some \nkind of profiling, rather than because they were under suspicion of \ncommitting a crime.\n  This is the kind of risk aversion that everybody agreed was part of \nthe problem with the intelligence gathering and analysis prior to \nSeptember 11. How do you make that situation worse? You do it by adding \nnew layers of people who are second-guessing these intelligence agents \nand analysts. There are enough people second-guessing them already, \nimposing the legal and political layer or filter of approval of the \nactions of the people in the field. But what the bill does is to create \nwhole new layers.\n\n  First, it follows a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission to create \nsome kind of outside board, but goes far beyond the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations in empowering this board with subpoena power, literally \nthe authority of this outside board, that is not within the \nintelligence community at all, a citizen board, to haul in any agent \nanywhere in the world and grill him about what he did or did not do or \nwhat he concluded or did not conclude, with no guidance whatsoever. \nThis is a recipe for disaster.\n  In addition, as if that were not enough, of the six assistant \ndirectors of the national intelligence directorate, fully a third of \nthem, two out of the six, have nothing to do with intelligence \ncollection or analysis; they are the privacy and civil rights division.\n  First, one wonders why those are not the same thing and, second, why \nyou would have to have two out of the six directorates specifically \ncharged with this responsibility. We already have an inspector general \nwhose responsibilities include any situation in which an agent or \nagency went beyond legal authority or beyond other appropriate \nauthority in the conduct of his or her business. But in addition to the \ninspector general, in addition to the officers who currently exist in \neach of the agencies of the intelligence community--virtually all of \nthem--to deal with privacy and civil rights concerns--these already \nexist--we create two new directorates with this legislation: this \noutside civilian board and an ombudsman.\n  In looking through the ombudsman's responsibilities, for example, \npity the poor intelligence agent who raises a question that causes this \nombudsman to have to question him.\n  This is not even to get into the congressional oversight which we \nwant to enhance. Our working group, which is developing the \nimprovements to the Intelligence Committee operation, will be soon, I \nthink, be making a recommendation to the body, either in conjunction \nwith the underlying bill or as an amendment to it, that will also fold \nin enhanced congressional oversight.\n  We want enhanced congressional oversight, but it is a double-edged \nsword because it has been abused in the past and can be abused in the \nfuture.\n  When Members have not intelligence as their first priority but \nquestioning somebody within the intelligence community, they can be \npretty hard on the intelligence community. We can go all the way to the \nChurch Commission in 1976 to see what kind of damage that can do. So we \nneed to be careful about this congressional oversight, but it is going \nto be enhanced. We are going to improve our ability to oversee the \nintelligence community.\n  In addition to the offices that exist today, and in addition to the \ninspector general, and in addition to the enhanced congressional \noversight, we are creating two more directorates, an outside board, and \nan ombudsman, all of whom have essentially the same general \nresponsibility of questioning whether the intelligence agents, \nagencies, analysts, and others are doing their job properly. Then we \nwill ask ourselves why we could not get anybody to think outside the \nbox, to be forward leaning, to try to be aggressive in collecting \nintelligence, why everybody was meekly following a very single straight \nline.\n  The fact that we are creating a national intelligence director \ncreates a bit of a problem in this regard in the first place because \ninstead of having a wider array of entities involved, each with their \nown points of view, sort of the devil's advocate concept recommended by \nmany, including the 9/11 Commission, to get out of a single-channel \norientation group-think, we are making the problem worse, in my view, \nby creating this single national intelligence director.\n\n  If you want a career in the agency, you better not run afoul of what \nthe director wants and what his views are. That is the reality of \nbureaucracy, and it exists in every agency of the Government, not just \nthe intelligence community. But in the intelligence community, it is \nparticularly important because we want people who are willing to \nquestion, to go against the grain, to disagree with their boss, to take \na risk.\n  If we look back at President Clinton's directives to the intelligence \ncommunity, he tried to be forward leaning, especially with regard to \nal-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. To paraphrase, in effect what he said is \nwe have to do everything we can to try to get these guys. Repeatedly, \nefforts were made to bring to his attention operations that would \neither improve our intelligence or operationally deal with al-Qaida and \nOsama bin Laden. They were shot down by the Pentagon, by the Secretary \nof State, by the National Security Adviser, by the lawyers, by the \nintelligence community itself, the Director of the CIA. Every time we \ntried to do something, almost, somebody said this is too risky; we \ncannot do it. That was why the 9/11 Commission, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and many other observers have said we have to get out of \nthis stultifying risk-aversion environment where people are afraid that \nsomebody is looking over their shoulder and is going to jump on them if \nthey do anything that is the least bit out of the ordinary or risky. We \nhave to have the out of the ordinary and risky if we are ever going to \ndefeat this very unconventional enemy.\n  What does the bill do? It does not try to solve the problem; it makes \nit far worse. The purpose of our amendment is to say we will follow the \n9/11 Commission recommendation and set up this outside commission, but \nfor Heaven's sake, let's not give it the kind of subpoena power--\nCongress already has that, the inspector general already has the \nability to look into all of these things. We do not need an outside \nboard of five, or whatever, people accountable to nobody with the \nability to totally disrupt what the intelligence community is doing.\n  It is fine to report to Congress, to analyze what they think the \nsituation is and let us know what their concerns are. But that is far \ndifferent from operationally getting right down into the bowels of the \norganization with hands that can extract anything, classified or not, \nsubpoena anybody, whether in Afghanistan or Langley or wherever, and \npublicly question what is being done.\n  That is the first part of the amendment.\n  The second part of the amendment is to say we do not need all these \nnew entities given the fact we already have existing civil rights and \nprivacy controls. I do not want to be misunderstood. It would be very \neasy to characterize or mischaracterize what we are trying to do by \nsaying these are people who do not care anything about civil rights; \nthese are people who want the agency to run roughshod over American \ncivil rights, and people can get pretty revved up about that very \nquickly.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The folks who are \nunderstandably going to put a high priority on protecting civil rights \nneed to balance their legitimate concerns about civil rights with a \nconcern about the lives of American citizens, to balance the \nlegislation that is supposed to help fix the problem in such a way that \nwe do not put so many constraints on our intelligence community that it \ncan't do its job.\n  One of the biggest problems identified, this problem of risk \naversion, will be horribly exacerbated if we simply blindly follow the \nrecommendation of those who brought this bill to the floor--and I \nunderstand there were a lot of compromises made in order to get \nunanimous approval out of the committee, but sometimes getting \nunanimous approval is the wrong goal.\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nSometimes you need to make tough choices and you need to reject \nproposals that are offered by people who then agree to vote for the \noverall bill if they get their amendment in the bill. That is what \nhappened with this bill, and there are too many little amendments that \ngot in which, when added up, are going to create a huge problem with \nour intelligence community with respect to this issue of risk aversion.\n  I cannot stress strongly enough, and this will be my final point, our \ngoal ought to be to improve our intelligence collection, to improve \nhuman intelligence, to improve analysis, to foster a sense within this \ncommunity that they do not have to just follow the narrow channel of \ngroup-think that was criticized so strongly by the 9/11 Commission, \nthat they do not have to feel risk averse, that they can take a chance \nsometimes because we need people to be imaginative and innovative and \nthink about possibilities that before 9/11 we could not have even \ndreamed of.\n  I know now some people like to go back and ask: Why did you not think \nup the fact that people could fly planes into these buildings? Well, \none reason was because as soon as one starts thinking about those kinds \nof things, somebody is going to come down on them like a ton of bricks \nand say: Get back to your job and stay within the channel here. We do \nnot have time for that kind of fantasizing. You are living in a fantasy \nworld.\n  We have to have people who are willing to ask these tough questions \nand think in ways that they are not going to get slapped down when they \ndo. The sure recipe, the prescription for that occurring is by piling \non layer upon layer of outside groups, ombudsmen, civil rights, privacy \ndivisions, all of these groups that are duplicative of what we already \nhave, to call into question what our agents and analysts are doing.\n  There is simply no need to have so many people performing the same \ntask, which, in any event, does not add to intelligence, but, by its \nvery nature, is designed to restrict intelligence activity. Surely, we \ncan protect civil liberties and privacy without setting up a situation \nin which it is going to be incredibly difficult for the intelligence \ncommunity to effectively perform its mission.\n  After all, our chief objective is to make it easier to predict and \nprevent a terrorist attack, not more difficult.\n  Excessive oversight will result in our intelligence officers being \nmore cautious than they should be, and deter them from taking the risks \nthat may be necessary to keep our country safe.\n  Indeed, an aversion to taking risks, even when they should be taken, \nalready plagues our intelligence community. Time and time again, this \nhas contributed to intelligence failures, most recently, of course, 9/\n11 and the intelligence community's claims about Saddam's weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  There are numerous reasons for this culture of risk aversion--unclear \nauthorities, legal restrictions, and excessive oversight are among \nthem.\n  The deterioration of our intelligence community's clandestine service \noffers a good example.\n  According to the 9/11 Commission's report, James Pavitt, the head of \nthe CIA's Directorate of Operations, recalled that covert action had \ngotten the clandestine service into trouble in the past, and he had no \ndesire to see it happen again.\n  The ``trouble'' he referred to was at least partly the result of the \n1973 Church Committee hearings in Congress. Added to that were the \nrestrictive guidelines promulgated by then-CIA Director John Deutch in \n1995, which severely limited the ability of CIA case officers to meet \nwith and recruit foreign nationals who may have been involved in \ndubious activities or have blood on their hands.\n  The end result was out intelligence community's inability to \npenetrate al-Qaida's command structure. Before 9/11, we had not one \nsource inside that command structure. Unclear authorities, excessive \noversight, and burdensome restrictions prevented our people on the \nground from being effective.\n  I recognize that privacy and civil liberties are substantively \nentirely different matters. However, the end result of unnecessary \nbureaucracy, restrictions, and excessive oversight will be the same. We \nwill cultivate a culture within the intelligence community that makes \nit less likely that people will be willing to do the jobs we are asking \nthem to do, and more likely that they will want to ``play it safe.''\n  My amendment would very simply delete sections 126 and 127, which \nrequire officers for privacy and civil liberties with the National \nIntelligence Authority; it would strike section 212, requiring privacy \nand civil liberties officers with a long list of Executive Branch \ndepartments and agencies; and it would modify the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board established by section 211.\n  The National Intelligence Authority does not need three individuals \nassigned to the same task. The IG of the National Intelligence \nAuthority will be in place to ensure privacy and civil liberties \nreceive adequate attention and oversight.\n  Similarly, it is redundant to require privacy and civil liberties \nofficers within almost every national-security related department and \nagency.\n  My amendment would retain the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard, as the 9/11 Commission recommended. However, it would limit \nBoard's ability to interfere in the activities of relevant departments \nand agencies.\n  I hope that Members will support this amendment. It follows the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations with respect to privacy and civil \nliberties, and ensures adequate oversight and protections, but does so \nwithout hamstringing the community.\n  I urge my colleagues when we debate this amendment further tomorrow \nto please read the bill, look at the relevant portions of the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations, look at the testimony of those who have \nraised this kind of question and ask whether the bill as presented is \nnot a little bit out of balance--I contend a great deal out of balance.\n  I do not cast any aspersions on the people who worked so hard to \nbring this bill to the Senate floor. There are not enough compliments \nfor the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Connecticut for the \nhard work they have done and all of the others who have worked so hard \non it. This is not in any way meant as personal criticism, but I fear \nif we do not very carefully analyze this and try to correct it--and \nremember, that was part of what this was all about: let's get the bill \nto the floor; we can always make corrections here. This is the time to \ndo it. We have not written a bill on the floor for a long time, but \nthis is too important not to take the time to do right.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us not make the mistake of rushing forward \nwith this, putting a rubberstamp on the committee's bill because we \nhave to do something before we leave on October 8. We will spend years \nruing the day we took this kind of action if we are not careful about \nwhat we do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the transition between Presidential \n                            administrations)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE __--PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION\n\n     SEC. __01. PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION.\n\n       (a) Services Provided President-Elect.--Section 3 of the \n     Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by adding after subsection (a)(8)(A)(iv) the following:\n       ``(v) Activities under this paragraph shall include the \n     preparation of a detailed classified, compartmented summary \n     by the relevant outgoing executive branch officials of \n     specific operational threats to national security; major \n     military or covert operations;\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\n     and pending decisions on possible uses of military force. \n     This summary shall be provided to the President-elect as soon \n     as possible after the date of the general elections held to \n     determine the electors of President and Vice President under \n     section 1 or 2 of title 3, United States Code.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g); and\n       (3) by adding after subsection (e) the following:\n       ``(f)(1) The President-elect should submit to the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation or other appropriate agency and then, \n     upon taking effect and designation, to the agency designated \n     by the President under section 115(b) of the National \n     Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the names of candidates for \n     high level national security positions through the level of \n     undersecretary of cabinet departments as soon as possible \n     after the date of the general elections held to determine the \n     electors of President and Vice President under section 1 or 2 \n     of title 3, United States Code.\n       ``(2) The responsible agency or agencies shall undertake \n     and complete as expeditiously as possible the background \n     investigations necessary to provide appropriate security \n     clearances to the individuals who are candidates described \n     under paragraph (1) before the date of the inauguration of \n     the President-elect as President and the inauguration of the \n     Vice-President-elect as Vice President.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate Regarding Expedited Consideration \n     of National Security Nominees.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President-elect should submit the nominations of \n     candidates for high-level national security positions, \n     through the level of undersecretary of cabinet departments, \n     to the Senate by the date of the inauguration of the \n     President-elect as President; and\n       (2) for all such national security nominees received by the \n     date of inauguration, the Senate committees to which these \n     nominations are referred should, to the fullest extent \n     possible, complete their consideration of these nominations, \n     and, if such nominations are reported by the committees, the \n     full Senate should vote to confirm or reject these \n     nominations, within 30 days of their submission.\n       (c) Security Clearances for Transition Team Members.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this section, the term ``major party'' \n     shall have the meaning given under section 9002(6) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) In general.--Each major party candidate for President \n     may submit, before the date of the general election, requests \n     for security clearances for prospective transition team \n     members who will have a need for access to classified \n     information to carry out their responsibilities as members of \n     the President-elect's transition team.\n       (3) Completion date.--Necessary background investigations \n     and eligibility determinations to permit appropriate \n     prospective transition team members to have access to \n     classified information shall be completed, to the fullest \n     extent practicable, by the day after the date of the general \n     election.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding section 341, this \n     section and the amendments made by this section shall take \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I believe most of my colleagues know, \nSenator Lieberman and I made a commitment to the families and the 9/11 \nCommission that we would ensure that all of their 41 recommendations \nwere considered one way or another in this legislation. Because of the \nlack of scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee, there were several \nrecommendations which were not considered.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have already proposed and had adopted several \namendments addressing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. There \nare three remaining issues. One of them is noncontroversial, which I \nwill be proposing at this time and would hope would be voice voted \nsince it is noncontroversial. Then there are two additional amendments \nconcerning two additional recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Both \nof those are controversial, so I would propose those amendments and \nthen ask that they be set aside after they are placed for \nconsideration. Then they would be disposed of after debate, discussion, \nor however the managers would like to dispose of those additional two \namendments.\n  I hope I made myself somewhat coherent in that explanation.\n  The amendment that is at the desk addresses the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendation to improve the transitions between administrations. It \nis nearly identical to title IV of the 9/11 Commission Report \nImplementation Act, which we introduced on September 7, except that it \ndoes not include the security clearance-related provisions that were \nadopted by the Governmental Affairs Committee and are already in the \nunderlying bill, S. 2845.\n  The Commission report states:\n\n       Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no \n     notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption \n     of national security policymaking during the change of \n     administrations by accelerating the process for national \n     security appointments. We think the process could be improved \n     significantly so transitions can work more effectively and \n     allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as \n     quickly as possible.\n\n  As recommended by the Commission, this amendment is designed to help \nensure an incoming President-elect has his or her national security \nteam in place during a transition between administrations. The \namendment would direct the outgoing administration to provide the \nPresident-elect, as soon as possible after the general election, a \ndetailed, highly classified summary of current threats to the national \nsecurity, major military and covert operations, and pending decisions \non possible uses of military force.\n  It also provides that the President-elect should submit to the agency \nresponsible for background checks the names of possible candidates for \nhigh-level national security positions as soon as possible after the \ndate of the Presidential election. In turn, it requires that agency to \nundertake and complete, to the fullest extent possible, the background \ninvestigations necessary to provide appropriate security clearances to \nthese individuals by the date of inauguration.\n  Finally, it urges the Senate to consider the nominations of top \nnational security appointees as soon as possible, preferably within 30 \ndays of the submission of a nominee.\n  As the chairman of a committee which has responsibility for the \nconfirmation of many Presidential nominees, I assure my colleagues that \nI consider the Senate's advise and consent responsibilities to be very \nimportant. This amendment is not proposing that we shirk our duties in \nany way but that we act in the most efficient manner possible to \nthoroughly review the nominees to national security-related positions \nand allow for their confirmation so they can carry out the very \nimportant duties to which they are charged.\n\n  I recognize that some, including administration officials, would \nprefer that we go further. It has been suggested and I believe the \nHouse bill even proposes that if the Senate has not voted to confirm a \nnominee within 30 days after the nominee's name has been submitted, the \nPresident alone should have the power to make that appointment. I, for \none, cannot support such a proposal, and I doubt that it would have the \nsupport of the majority of Members in this body.\n  Let me also point out that this amendment does not include the \nCommission's recommendations that the Senate should not require \nconfirmation of such national security executive appointees below \nexecutive level 3. One of the reasons our amendment does not address \nthat particular proposal is that upon review of such positions, we \nlearned that it would eliminate the Senate's advise and consent duties \nfor many important security positions that we believe merit the \nSenate's action. Executive level 4 includes all of the Assistant \nSecretary positions, many of which one would argue are important \nnational security-related positions. Examples of these positions \ninclude the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Threat \nReduction, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International \nSecurity Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force \nManagement Policy, and others.\n  We believe that instead of removing the Senate's advise and consent \nobligations, a better approach would be for the Senate to fulfill its \nobligation in as expeditious a manner as possible. We hope this body \nwill make a greater effort to hold confirmation hearings and report \nthose national security-related nominations to the full Senate for \nswift consideration. To help spur swift Senate consideration, this \namendment includes a sense of the Senate urging the President-elect to \nsubmit the nominations for high-level national security positions to \nthe Senate by the date of the inauguration. It also calls for Senate \ncommittees to hold nomination hearings and consider these nominations \nto the fullest extent within 30 days of their submission.\n  The amendment before the Senate is but one proposal that we need to \nmove\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\nforward. The more critical proposal which we still need to act on is \ncongressional reorganization and oversight over intelligence and \nhomeland security. As the Commission very directly pointed out, not \nonly are Government agency reforms needed, so too are institutional \nreforms within Congress. The Commission went so far as to call \ncongressional oversight as ``dysfunctional.''\n  I remain hopeful that the bipartisan working group tasked by the \nleadership to develop a proposal for congressional restructuring will \nbe successful. We owe it to the American public to fulfill our \ncollective responsibilities. These are not normal times. We are at war.\n  I just want to say again, as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have seen particularly the Defense Department, as well as \nother national-security-related positions, literally vacant for months \nand months and months. This is really not an acceptable situation, and \nit has grown worse and worse. Background security checks have \nlengthened in their time. The Senate doesn't get moving until a couple \nof months after we are in session. It is not fair. It is not fair to \nthe nominees, it is not fair to the country, it certainly is not fair \nto the Departments that are deprived of the services of a new \nPresident's team. So I hope we will support this amendment.\n  I do not believe there is any controversy, so I ask for a voice vote \nbefore I move to a second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment with Senator McCain. This, again, is part of our attempt to \nimplement through legislation as many of the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission Report as we possibly can.\n  This is a critical one. The Commission made a finding not usually \nfocused on, as part of its work, that there is a danger because of the \nslowness of the transition from one administration to the next that \nAmerica will be vulnerable. We have an enemy out there, a terrorist \nenemy, that follows this kind of information. I don't make a causal \nstatement now, but the fact is that it was in 1993, the first year of \nthe Clinton administration, when the World Trade Center was first \nattacked by terrorists with a truck bomb. And it was 2001, of course, \nwhen the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and other targets were attacked, \nin the first year of the Bush administration.\n  These are very good recommendations. I do want to point out simply \nthat the underlying bill incorporates a related recommendation by the \nCommission to consolidate security clearance investigations in one \nagency and encourage reciprocity among agencies with respect to those \nclearances, which should help streamline what is now a frustratingly \nBalkanized system for determining who can have access to sensitive \ninformation.\n  This is very constructive. I do not believe it is controversial at \nall.\n  To reiterate, this amendment will help ensure that our vital national \nsecurity capabilities do not suffer undue disruption during a \npresidential transition.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended several measures to provide a swift \nhand-off between incoming and outgoing national security teams during a \nchange in presidential administrations, and this amendment reflects \nthose recommendations.\n  First, it directs the outgoing administration to provide the \nPresident-elect with a detailed, classified summary of critical \noperational threats, including major military or covert operations and \npending decisions on the use of military force. The most important \nmember of the national security apparatus is the Commander in Chief. \nThis provision will help the President-elect begin focusing on these \nissues, and considering any imminent high stakes decisions that might \nneed to be made, well in advance of the day he or she takes office.\n  The amendment also includes several measures to help assure that the \nPresident-elect will have a qualified team of national security \nadvisors in place early in the new administration and who are able to \nhit the ground running.\n  It calls on the President-Elect to submit the names of likely high \nlevel national security personnel for security clearances as soon as \npossible after the election, and directs the appropriate Federal agency \nor agencies to complete the necessary investigations for those \nclearances as quickly as possible, preferably before the inauguration.\n  The amendment also urges the administration to submit nominees for \nthe top national security positions by Inauguration Day and, if it does \nso, urges the Senate to act on those nominations within 30 days \nwherever possible. I think this language is a useful reminder to both \nthe executive branch and the Senate that we should act to fill these \npositions with all deliberate speed--mindful that delay has costs, but \ndedicated as well to careful selection and review of nominees for these \nsensitive positions.\n  Finally, the amendment would allow major party candidates to seek \nsecurity clearances for prospective transaction team members prior to \nthe election, with the goal of having those clearances available the \nday after the election.\n  I should note that the underlying bill already incorporates a related \nrecommendation by the Commission to consolidate security clearance \ninvestigations in one agency and encourage reciprocity among agencies \nwith respect to clearances. This should help streamline what is now a \nfrustratingly balkanized system for determining who can have access to \nsensitive information.\n  We do not include the Commission's recommendation to eliminate Senate \nconfirmation for national security nominees below the Executive \nSchedule III pay grade. This category would include many Assistant \nSecretaries with critical policymaking responsibilities. Given the need \nfor strong Congressional oversight of the intelligence community and \nother national security operations, it does not seem wise to remove \nthis important layer of Congressional review and accountability.\n  I believe this amendment helps ensure that we do not loosen our \nfooting in the war on terriorism at moments of presidential transition. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join Senator Lieberman in commending \nSenator McCain for offering this amendment. It would make several \nchanges to the Presidential transition process, changes that are \nconsistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  The Governmental Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Voinovich, \nheld a hearing on this issue at which two of the Commissioners, Fred \nFielding and Jamie Gorelick, discussed how the current transition \nprocess does not serve our country well in the handing over, the \ntransitioning of important national security decisions from one \nadministration to another. One reason is that it is such a slow process \nto get the new administration's team in place.\n  I believe this amendment would greatly improve the process. I know of \nno opposition to it. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3806) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3807\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3807.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment may be subject to more \ndebate and discussion and may require a recorded vote. I intend to \npropose this amendment, discuss it, and recognize that there will be \nfurther discussion about this amendment.\n  This amendment addresses the terrorist travel and screening sections \nof the 9/11 Commission report. Contained in this amendment are the \nrecommendations found on pages 383-390\n\n[[Page S10010]]\n\nof the 9/11 Commission report. The text of this amendment is nearly \nidentical to Title VI of S. 2774, which was introduced September 7.\n  In addition to working with the Commission on this amendment, Senator \nLieberman and I have sought the advice and counsel from as broad a \nrange of interested parties as possible. Meetings have been held to \naddress the concerns of many of the interested groups. While some may \nprefer that we do not address these provisions, that is simply not an \noption. We must act one way or the other on all of the recommendations \nin the Commission report.\n  Despite the hard work by the people at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, it is apparent that our Government has just begun to carry \nout some of the reforms necessary to prevent terrorists from entering \nour country. Much remains to be done to target terrorist travel, \ncombine our multiple screening systems and ensure that identification \ndocuments used to enter this country or to be used as feeder documents \nare trustworthy.\n  Additionally, more must be done to improve the training we provide to \nour immigration and consular officers. These people represent the first \nline of defense in the security of our borders. We must ensure that \nthese officers have access to the best training, technology and \ninformation available.\n  According to the Commission Report:\n\n       Better technology and training to detect terrorist travel \n     documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce \n     America's vulnerability to clandestine entry.\n\n  By restricting terrorist access to travel documents, we increase the \ndifficulty to travel into the United States. Our legislation aims to \naddress this pressing issue by requiring the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to work with multiple Government agencies to develop a unified \nstrategy for combining terrorist travel intelligence, operations and \nlaw enforcement into a cohesive effort to intercept terrorists, find \nterrorist facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility domestically \nand internationally. All agencies responsible for guarding our Nation \nagainst terrorist attack must be on the same page in our approach to \nkeeping terrorists out.\n  In order to efficiently screen those entering the United States, the \nmultiple terrorist screening systems already in place must be \nintegrated. Our legislation would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to develop a comprehensive screening system that brings \ntogether an integrated network of screening points that includes the \nNation's border security systems, transportation system, and critical \ninfrastructure and facilities. The Department of Homeland Security will \nbegin to address this issue as they carry out the orders given in HSPD-\n11; however, our amendment represents a more comprehensive approach to \nuniting our various screening systems.\n\n  Fundamental to increasing the security of our borders is the quick \nand full implementation of US VISIT. I, like many of my colleagues, \nhave been troubled by the pace in which this system has been rolled \nout. This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and implement a plan for the accelerated and full \nimplementation of the US VISIT system. Additionally, the amendment \ndirects the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement a single, \nconsolidated program designed to expedite the travel of previously \nscreened travelers across the borders of the United States.\n  Lastly, this amendment would implement 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendation that the Federal Government set standards for the \nissuance of birth certificates, driver's licenses, and other sources of \nidentification. It has been well documented that many of the hijackers \nand their associates used counterfeit social security numbers and other \nfraudulent documents to obtain legal driver's licenses or State-issued \nID cards--or were able to simply but fake ID's--which they then used to \nopen bank accounts, rent cars, board airplanes, and attend flight \nschools. The ease with which these basic documents of American life can \nbe counterfeited or obtained fraudulently is clearly a gaping hole in \nhomeland security.\n  Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, at least half the \nStates have passed legislation to tighten up their eligibility \nrequirements and procedures for issuing driver's licenses and State ID \ncards. These initiatives are commendable and have improved security, \nbut the report of the 9/11 Commission, and numerous reports by Federal \nagencies and other organizations have all concluded that additional \nmeasures must be taken to improve the security of driver's licenses and \nother forms of identification.\n  One study deserves special note. Over a 10-month period in 2002 and \n2003, the Government Accountability Office--GAO--conducted an \nundercover investigation of State driver's license practices and \nprocedures, visiting seven States--Arizona, New York, Michigan, South \nCarolina, Virginia, Maryland, California and the District of Columbia. \nIn every jurisdiction, GAO investigators were able to obtain a driver's \nlicense or State-issued ID using fraudulent documents, including fake \nbirth certificates and fake licenses from other States.\n  Our amendment would require birth certificates and driver's licenses \nto meet new minimum Federal standards in order to be accepted by a \nFederal agency for any official purpose. Minimum standards would be \nestablished for proof and verification of identity by the applicant, \nand to make the documents themselves more resistant to counterfeiting \nand tampering. The amendment also would require minimum standards for \nthe processing of applications to address a widely recognized and \ngrowing problem of fraud within the offices that issue licenses and \nbirth certificates, including the Arizona Department of \nTransportation's Motor Vehicle Division. The amendment would authorize \ngrants to the States to assist them in meeting the new standards and to \nhelp States computerize and match their birth and death records.\n  To improve the security of social security numbers, the amendment \nwould restrict the number of replacement cards that can be issued to an \nindividual; require verification of records used to obtain an original \nsocial security card; and add death, fraud, and work authorization \nindicators to the social security number verification system. DHS and \nthe Social Security Administration would also be tasked to take other \nsteps to safeguard social security cards from counterfeiting and \ntampering, and increase enforcement against the fraudulent use of \nsocial security cards.\n  Today, incredibly, the Social Security Administration will issue any \nindividual up to 52 replacement cards a year, a practice GAO has cited \nas increasing the potential for misuse and fraud. Roughly two-thirds of \nthe 12.4 million social security cards issued by SSA in 2002 were \nreplacement cards. I am also incredulous that the system SSA uses to \nverify social security numbers does not include notations for death, \nfraud, or work authorization. Employers often use the system to verify \nthe social security number of new employees. Because there is no \nnotation on the records for death, a social security number for a \ndecreased individual used fraudulently by another person will be \nverified as valid.\n  This amendment would not mandate a national ID card. It would not \ninfringe upon the right of the States to determine who can get a \ndriver's license. It would not establish a national database with \ninformation on all drivers. And it would prohibit the establishment of \na single design for driver's licenses and birth certificates. We \nbelieve it fulfills the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission without \ntrampling on States' rights, privacy, or civil liberties.\n  We must face the fact, however, that rightly or wrongly, the driver's \nlicense is the basic form of ID in the United States. We use it to \nboard airplanes, to purchase alcohol and cigarettes, to cash checks, \nand for a host of other purposes. We cannot ignore that the security of \ndriver's licenses and State-issued ID cards affect homeland security. \nAnd we cannot ignore that driver's licenses can and indeed have been \nused as an enabler for terrorism. There is a legitimate Federal role in \nestablishing minimum standards for these documents.\n  As the 9/11 Commission noted in its report, ``At many entry points to \nvulnerable facilities, including gates for boarding aircraft, sources \nof identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are \nwho they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists.'' \nMaking these documents more\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\nsecure will help make our country more secure, and help prevent another \nterrorist attack on our country.\n  In closing, this amendment was carefully crafted to translate the \ncommission recommendations into legislative language. I applaud the \nwork of the commission and fully believe that the reforms they suggest \nin this section of their report will go a long way towards increasing \nthe security and safety of all Americans.\n  The Commission released their report in late July. Their \nrecommendations are taking on a life of their own. The Commission \nreport is the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller on both the New York Times \nand the Washington Post bestsellers list. The public is taking their \nrecommendations very seriously, and so too should we. The people will \nhold us accountable for our failure if we don't enact these \nrecommendations.\n  I would like to point out a couple of additional facts.\n  Today, each State has a different set of requirements for driver's \nlicenses. Some States allow more than 30 different documents to be used \nby applicants as proof of identity. How in the world can an employee at \nthe department of motor vehicles be expected to verify the authenticity \nof the applicant?\n  I am amazed what some States will accept as proof of identity in \nsupporting documents. For example, one State allows a picture from a \nhigh school yearbook to be used as one form of identification. Another \nState allows the school report card to be used as long as it is less \nthan 1 year old. A third allows a snowmobile permit to be used as a \nform of identification. Several States allow permits for concealed \nweapons to be used in getting a driver's license. One State still has \nlicenses without a photograph of the license holder.\n  I recognize that we are on very interesting ground on this issue. On \nthe one hand, we are trying to balance people's civil liberties. We are \ntrying to make sure everyone has a right to privacy. We are trying to \nmake sure there is no national database which would be used to follow \npeople around the country. At the same time, if someone can \nfraudulently obtain a driver's license and that driver's license is \nused in obtaining access to places where acts of terror can be \ncommitted, we have to try to see that does not happen.\n  What we have done with this amendment is try to carefully balance the \nrequirement for some better way of assuring identity and at the same \ntime not infringe on Americans' civil liberties. That is why I believe \nthis amendment probably will be the subject of some debate and \ndiscussion and will probably require a recorded vote.\n  If somebody has a better idea, I would like very much to hear it, but \nI do not know that there is a better idea. We have done extensive \nresearch, have had extensive discussions and an extensive amount of \ninvestigation building on the 9/11 Commission's findings and \nrecommendations.\n  It seems to me that this is a reasonable approach. But to have the \nstatus quo in America where people can easily and fraudulently acquire \nidentification which allows them then to be able to commit acts of \nsabotage, espionage, or terror and risk the lives of others is not a \nstatus quo by which I think we can abide.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration. I look forward to the \ndebate.\n  If the distinguished manager would perhaps illuminate as to how she \nwould like to handle this particular amendment, I would be agreeable to \nwhatever the manager's procedure would be.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, once again, I thank the Senator from \nArizona for bringing up another series of recommendations made by the \n9/11 Commission.\n  This is a very broad amendment. There is much in it which I support, \nand I agree with the Senator that there is a significant problem with \nfraudulent documents, including driver's licenses. Nevertheless, \nseveral groups, including the National Governors Association, the \nNational Council of State Legislatures, and the American Civil \nLiberties Union, have expressed concerns regarding the degree to which \nsome of the provisions in this amendment would infringe on the powers \ntraditionally exercised by the States to set standards in the area of \ndriver's licenses, for example. Therefore, I would like to suggest to \nthe Senator that we continue working on these issues to see if we can \nresolve some of these concerns and that we set this amendment aside for \nthe time being to allow for that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the manager. At this time I will not be proposing \na further amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the manager \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maine yield the floor?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor temporarily.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of Members in and out of \nthe Chamber who want to know when they can offer amendments and/or \nspeak. Senator Cornyn is here, Senator Feinstein, Senator Lautenberg is \nhere. I wonder if at least for these three can we get a queue set up so \nthey will know when they can be expected to speak.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest, based on the conversations I \nhave had with all who are present in the Senate now, we first yield to \nthe Senator from California, who is going to discuss her proposal while \nwe are continuing to work at the staff level on the language of her \namendment; that we then go to the Senator from Texas, who has two \namendments he would like to discuss--again, we are still working with \nthe Senator from Texas--and we then proceed to the amendment Senator \nLautenberg has proposed.\n  Mr. REID. If I could be recognized to further this dialog, I wonder \nif we could then have a consent agreement that the Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Texas be \nrecognized on his two amendments for no more than 15 minutes, and the \nSenator from New Jersey would be recognized after that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California be \nrecognized for 10 minutes; following that, the Senator from Texas be \nrecognized for 15 minutes; and Senator Lautenberg be recognized for 15 \nminutes to offer his amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, that unanimous consent agreement would \nwork well from my perspective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We will now then go to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3718\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee. I have indicated I am withdrawing one \namendment, No. 3719, which clarifies the tactical intelligence part of \nthe bill. I don't believe that is necessary. It has been withdrawn. I \nam also withdrawing amendment No. 3715 to strike the prohibition on co-\nlocation.\n  At this time I call up and then set aside amendment No. 3718.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3718.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve the intelligence functions of the Federal Bureau \n                           of Investigation)\n\n       On page 4, line 4, insert ``foreign intelligence'' after \n     ``means''.\n       On page 4, strike lines 5 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) The term ``foreign intelligence'' means information \n     gathered, and activities conducted, relating to the \n     capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign \n     governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, or \n     foreign persons, or international terrorist activities.\n       (3) The term ``counterintelligence'' means--\n       (A) foreign intelligence gathered, and activities \n     conducted, to protect against espionage, other intelligence \n     activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on \n     behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign \n     organizations, or foreign persons, or international terrorist \n     activities; and\n       (B) information gathered, and activities conducted, to \n     prevent the interference by or disruption of foreign \n     intelligence activities of the United States by foreign \n     government or elements thereof, foreign organizations, or \n     foreign persons, or international terrorists.\n       On page 6, line 12, strike ``counterintelligence or''.\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\n       On page 7, beginning on line 5, strike ``the Office of \n     Intelligence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation'' and \n     insert ``the Directorate of Intelligence of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation''.\n       On page 8, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (8) The term ``counterespionage'' means counterintelligence \n     designed to detect, destroy, neutralize, exploit, or prevent \n     espionage activities though identification, penetration, \n     deception, and prosecution (in accordance with the criminal \n     law) of individuals, groups, or organizations conducting, or \n     suspected of conducting, espionage activities.\n       (9) The term ``intelligence operation'' means activities \n     conducted to facilitate the gathering of foreign intelligence \n     or the conduct of covert action (as that term is defined in \n     section 503(e) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 413b(e)).\n       (10) The term ``collection and analysis requirements'' \n     means any subject, whether general or specific, upon which \n     there is a need for the collection of intelligence \n     information or the production of intelligence.\n       (11) The term ``collection and analysis tasking'' means the \n     assignment or direction of an individual or activity to \n     perform in a specified way to achieve an intelligence \n     objective or goal.\n       (12) The term ``certified intelligence officer'' means a \n     professional employee of an element of the intelligence \n     community engaged in intelligence activities who meets \n     standards and qualifications set by the National Intelligence \n     Director.\n       On page 120, beginning on line 17, strike ``, subject to \n     the direction and control of the President,''.\n       On page 123, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (e) Discharge of Improvements.--(1) The Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation shall carry out subsections \n     (b) through (d) through the Executive Assistant Director of \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation for Intelligence or such \n     other official as the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation designates as the head of the Directorate of \n     Intelligence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (2) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     shall carry out subsections (b) through (d) under the joint \n     direction, supervision, and control of the Attorney General \n     and the National Intelligence Director.\n       (3) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     shall report to both the Attorney General and the National \n     Intelligence Director regarding the activities of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation under subsections (b) through (d).\n       On page 123, line 7, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(f)''.\n       On page 123, line 17, strike ``(f)'' and insert ``(g)''.\n       On page 126, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 206.

I reiterate my strong support for this bill and the \nbalance that has been struck by the committee in the drafting of this \nbill. It strikes the right balance. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  In my remarks on Monday, I mentioned I was going to be submitting an \namendment concerning the relationship between the FBI foreign \nintelligence functions and the national intelligence director. I thank \nboth the majority and the ranking member staff for working with my \nstaff to work out this amendment. It will be worked out and it will be \nthe chairman's intent to present this amendment for unanimous consent.\n  However, I will clearly state the intent of the amendment. The FBI \nfunctions as part of the intelligence community in the gathering, \nanalyzing, and disseminating of information about the plans, \nintentions, and capabilities of our foreign enemies, including, most \nimportantly, counter-terrorists. That effort, in my view, should be \nunder the overall supervision of the national intelligence director.\n  Let me be clear, though, this amendment does not mean the national \nintelligence director should run or control operations inside the \nUnited States. When the FBI, under the operational control of the FBI \ndirector and the Attorney General, works as a foreign intelligence \nagency, it should do so as part of that community under the general \nguidance of the national intelligence director.\n  An excellent example of this issue is now part of the extensive \nrecord of structural intelligence failure prior to the September 11 \nattacks, the way the intelligence community handled, or I should say \nmishandled, the so-called Phoenix document information and the \nMoussaoui information. Here we had in two different places FBI agents \nacquiring factual information which is of clear foreign intelligence \nvalue: that foreign individuals, associated with foreign terrorist \norganizations, may have been learning to fly passenger planes. At the \nvery same time, the rest of the intelligence community had information \nthat al-Qaida was preparing to strike against the United States and \nalso that there had been past consideration of the use of airplanes in \nan attack methodology.\n  Putting together these two disparate pieces of information is the \nbusiness of an effective intelligence community. But it did not happen, \nin part, I believe, because the FBI part of the communication was not \nlinked up with the Central Intelligence Agency and the National \nSecurity Agency parts of the community.\n  The bill before the Senate goes far toward remedying this by placing \nthe FBI foreign intelligence elements under the overall supervision of \nthe national intelligence director. I am concerned the bill presently \ncontains ambiguities that, if left in, will cause confusion in the \nfuture. That is because the bill incorporates, with no change, current \nlaw which defines the role of the FBI intelligence activities. However, \nthat law is confusing, it is internally inconsistent, and I believe it \nis the source of many of the problems which beset the FBI as part of \nthe intelligence community.\n  This amendment does three basic things to fix this. I want the record \nto reflect that. It clarifies critical definitions in the law. It makes \na small alteration in the current law to make clear that the term of \nart ``counterintelligence'' is a subset of foreign intelligence, not an \nalternative to foreign intelligence.\n  Second, it makes clear that when the FBI is engaged in law \nenforcement, it is not part of the national intelligence program or \nunder the NID supervision, but removes the word ``counterintelligence'' \nfrom this so-called carve-out language. This is critical because this \nlanguage in existing law was the confusing foundation upon which much \nof the wall between the FBI and the rest of the intelligence community \nwas built.\n  This amendment creates a directorate of intelligence in the FBI. As \nwritten presently, the bill places the activities of the Office of \nIntelligence of the FBI clearly within the national intelligence \nprogram. This is good, but because the Office of Intelligence has no \nstatutory basis, it could be rendered useless in the future if that \noffice is removed or changed by a future FBI director.\n  This amendment renames the office the Directorate of Intelligence and \ngives it a clear basis in law.\n  Finally, this amendment introduces some clarifying language to ensure \nthat the section governing ``FBI improvements'' is read to ensure that \nthese improvements come as part of a larger, coordinated effort, led by \nthe national intelligence director to improve the standards and \npractices of the entire intelligence community.\n  It does this by ensuring that the FBI Director's improvement program \nis\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\nguided by the national intelligence director. And it defines a \n``certified intelligence officer''--that is a term introduced for the \nfirst time in the underlying bill--to make sure that ``certification'' \nmeans meeting intelligence community standards, developed by the \nnational intelligence director.\n  The bottom line is that the FBI's intelligence functions must be part \nof a larger effort, guided by a strong leader, and linked carefully \nwith all the other agencies and Departments in the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  There are still two parts of this amendment that are being worked out \nby staff. I appreciate their hard work very much and thank them. I also \nwould like to thank the chair and the ranking member for their \ncooperation. I am very hopeful this amendment can later be adopted by \nunanimous consent.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3718 be set \naside for the present time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank both managers of the bill, the \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and the ranking member, \nSenator Lieberman, for the great work they are doing on this bill. I \nknow it is not easy, but it is vital that we achieve the kinds of \nreforms the 9/11 Commission and the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and others, over the years, have said would help make our \nNation stronger.\n  Yesterday, I proposed an amendment to this bill which dealt with a \nrelatively narrow area but one I think is certainly relevant to what \nthe 9/11 Commission recommended and, indeed, to the ultimate purpose of \nmaking America a safer place. Unfortunately, it is one that tends to be \noverlooked. That does not have to do with our physical security, \npotential cause of death and injury to the American people on our own \nsoil but, rather, a body blow to our economic security.\n  Indeed, one of the consequences of 9/11 was not just the terrible \nloss of life and injury but also the disruption to our economy, which \nresulted in chaos and many people being laid off work because of the \neconomic disruption.\n  This amendment had to do with cyber-security. I know it is something \nwe do not think about very much but, indeed, now that we are so \ndependent upon computers for our way of life, to enhance our \nproductivity, to communicate with one another, to do business, we \nsomehow perhaps take for granted that they will always be secure. And \nparticularly when it comes to our water utilities, our communications \nsystems, our transportation systems, and financial networks, there is a \nvery real danger that cyber-terrorists, those who would try to attack \nand dismantle and disrupt our financial, transportation, \ncommunications, and utility networks could wreak a terrible blow to the \nAmerican economy.\n\n  Now, my interest in this subject dates back several years to when I \nconvened a panel in Texas, the State Infrastructure Protection Advisory \nCommittee, as attorney general. We met hundreds of hours with both \nprivate and public sector participants, as well as people in the \nacademic community, to try to figure out what we could do, No. 1, to \nidentify what the problem was, and what we could do to make it better.\n  Well, what we found is that in many instances because of liability \nconcerns, because of concerns about trying to achieve and maintain \npublic confidence in one's business or product, that the private sector \nwas much better prepared than the Government was for cyber-attacks.\n  I am pleased to say that Congress has begun to work to address this \ncritical need for security in our computer networks by passing the \nFederal Information Security Management Act, or FISMA. Its purpose is \nto improve the information security of our computer networks and \nsupport Federal agencies by requiring top-to-bottom agency planning for \ninformation security and compliance with mandatory standards and \nbenchmarks developed by the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology.\n  FISMA also requires Federal agencies to conduct an annual evaluation \nof their computer security programs and to submit an effectiveness \nreport to the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.\n  For several years, the House Government Reform Subcommittee, chaired \nby Congressman Adam Putnam, the Technology, Information Policy, \nIntergovernmental Relations and the Census Subcommittee, has been \nworking with the General Accounting Office to produce a report card for \n24 Federal agencies to see how well they are complying with \ncongressional intent as expressed in FISMA, the Federal Information \nSecurity Management Act.\n  What I would like to show you, Mr. President and my colleagues, is \nthe report card that has been generated because I think it is \nindicative of the problems we have had and, indeed, the problems we \nstill have, and how modest our improvement has been.\n  Indeed, you can see from this chart showing the Federal computer \nsecurity report card, issued on December 9, 2003, that overall \nGovernmentwide, Government agencies, when it came to security of their \ncomputer systems, got a D, not a grade any one of us would be proud to \ntake home. But I must say, as bad as a D is, in 2003, it is better than \nthe F that many agencies got in 2002, before Congress began to get \ninvolved in trying to upgrade the security of our computer networks.\n  But you can see, some of these agencies have improved from an F to a \nD. Indeed, the Department of Defense in 2002 had an F. In 2003, it got \na D. The Small Business Administration went from an F to a C-. But we \nhave some--the Department of the Interior, the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nDepartment of State--that in 2002 got an F and in 2003 got an F.\n  So I am not sure Congress is as successful as we should be or as we \nwould like to be in getting the attention of the people who work in \nthose agencies and who should be committed to carrying out this \ninformation security provision and protecting our Government computer \nsystems from the potential of cyber-attack and the potential disruption \nto our economy.\n\n  But I want to say in conclusion on that matter how much I appreciate \nthe willingness of the Senator from Maine, the distinguished chair of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Senator from Connecticut, \nthe distinguished ranking member of that committee, to work with us and \nconsider this amendment and, indeed, to agree that the amendment should \ngo forward because I think this is an easily overlooked but, \nnevertheless, a very important part of our security.\n  Mr. President, I have two other amendments that have not yet been \nfiled that I will obviously not call up but I would like to just \npreview for my colleagues. I have talked, also, to the chairman of the \nbill and the ranking member. We are going to continue to work with them \nand their staffs to try to make sure these matters can be worked out, \nif that is at all possible, much in the same manner we worked out this \ncyber-security provision.\n  These matters have to do with other recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. Here again, the job that is before us is vast, indeed, as \nreflected by the 41 different recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nand the need for intelligence reform reflected in the bill before us.\n  But perhaps it is because of the perspective I have as a Senator from \nthe State of Texas, which has the longest border of any State with the \ncountry of Mexico--and, of course, beyond Mexico on to Central America \nand South America--the source of many concerns relative to human \nsmuggling and to enforcement of our immigration and other laws related \nto those issues.\n  First, we intend to offer an amendment to increase the penalties that \ncan be assessed upon a successful prosecution for the crime of human \nsmuggling. As the 9/11 Commission said: There is evidence to suggest \nthat, since 1999, human smugglers have facilitated the travel of \nterrorists associated with more than a dozen extremist groups and that \nhuman smugglers clearly have the credentials necessary to aid terrorist \ntravel. They also noted that many countries, because of their lack of \nsecurity, make human smuggling an attractive avenue for terrorists in \nneed of travel facilitation.\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n  In terms of our southern border, Under Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security Asa Hutchinson has told me and others that there is \nno documented instance of a terrorist actually coming across our \nsouthern border, but the truth is, it is very porous. If the motivation \nis high enough and the price is right, the same person who can be \nsmuggled across the border for economic reasons because they want to \ncome to work in this country outside of our laws, someone from a \ncountry other than Mexico, perhaps an Islamic extremist, somebody who \nwanted to take advantage of that porous border would, indeed, hire a \nhuman smuggler to bring them across our southern border into the United \nStates and do us harm.\n  It is important that our Federal policy and our criminal laws reflect \nboth the strongest possible concern about this issue and express the \nwill of Congress that human smugglers will be punished in a way \ncommensurate with the threat they pose to the American people.\n  The truth is, we cannot ignore this issue and believe that it is just \nrelated to people who want to come here and work. Money talks. And \nwhere human smugglers exist, they will go to the highest bidder to \ndeliver their services in a way that could indeed deliver terrorists on \nto our soil. That relates to one amendment on which we will continue to \nwork with the distinguished chairman and ranking member and their \nstaffs to see if we can work out an agreement.\n  The next amendment relates to another provision in the 9/11 \nCommission report. The Commission, under the subheading ``Immigration \nLaw and Enforcement,'' said:\n\n       There is a growing role for state and local law enforcement \n     agencies. They need more training and work with federal \n     agencies so they can cooperate more effectively with those \n     federal authorities in identifying terrorist suspects.\n\n  Again, on page 383 of the 9/11 Commission report, the Commission \nsaid:\n\n       The challenge for national security in an age of terrorism \n     is to prevent the very few people who may pose overwhelming \n     risks from entering or remaining in the United States \n     undetected.\n\n  This amendment, which we intend to file and call up later--and we \nwill continue to work with the managers of the bill on it--has to do \nwith the authority of State and local law enforcement authorities to \ndetain a certain narrow class of persons who are illegally in the \ncountry. Those relate to what I would think are three noncontroversial \ncategories: Those who are absconders--in other words, 80,000 felons who \nare in the country illegally and running from justice. We don't have \nthe capacity to know exactly where they are now because we have, \nunfortunately, ignored the crisis in our immigration enforcement for \nmany years.\n  Indeed, more than that, there are approximately, according to some \nguesses, between 300,000 and 400,000 people under final orders of \ndeportation in the United States, and we simply don't have the Federal \nauthorities sufficient to locate them and enforce final orders of \ndeportation.\n\n  This bill would narrowly address those who are under final orders of \nremoval, those who have signed voluntary departure agreements, and \nthose who have revoked visas. It would not, as some previous \nlegislation that has been filed both here and in the House, offer an \nopportunity for local and State law enforcement officials to enforce a \nwhole broad range of our immigration laws. This relates to a narrow \ngroup who are absconders from justice, including convicted felons and \nothers, and reaffirms the authority of State and local law enforcement \nboth to enforce those violations in the normal course of carrying out \ntheir duties and will make sure that we get the army of additional law \nenforcement authorities to assist the current Federal authorities who \nare mainly located along our border region when it comes to our border \nsecurity and homeland security interests.\n  Finally, this bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security \nto take custody within 48 hours of these persons so detained by State \nor local officials or else pay the locality to detain these particular \nclass of aliens. Currently, the process is that once someone has been \nidentified and perhaps detained for a violation of one of a host of our \nimmigration laws, the common practice is to tell them to come back for \na future hearing for deportation. It is no surprise to any of us that \nabout 90 percent of them melt into the landscape and are never heard \nfrom again.\n  Simply put, we need to have law enforcement authorities at all \nlevels--national, State, and local--join forces, as the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended, to deal with this certain narrow class of people who are \nunder final orders of deportation from our country, those who have \nsigned voluntary departure agreements, and those who have had their \nvisas revoked. These are people who have exercised any right they may \nhave to due process and should have no further recourse.\n  I look forward to working with the manager and the ranking member and \ntheir staffs to try to see if we can work this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ncomments. We look forward to working with him on his two additional \namendments. We were pleased to be able to pass his first amendment to \nthis bill last night. We appreciate his cooperation.\n  In consultation with the Senator from Nevada, the Democratic whip, I \nask unanimous consent that the consent request previously entered into \nbe altered so that Senator Byrd would be recognized for up to 25 \nminutes prior to Senator Lautenberg offering his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd likely will not use that much \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                        People Deserve the Truth\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I also thank the distinguished Senator, \nMs. Collins, and our distinguished whip, Mr. Reid, who is always to be \nfound on the floor or near it, always ready to assist us, any of us on \nboth sides of the aisle. I thank the distinguished manager of the bill \non this side of the aisle for his diligence, for his hard work always \nin his committee and outside his committee. He is ever ready.\n  Mr. President, I take the floor on a point of personal privilege on \nbehalf of the people of West Virginia.\n  Growing up, we all heard the legend--which was probably mythical--of \nyoung George Washington. As the story goes, his father, after seeing a \ntree chopped down on their land, approached young George and asked if \nhe was responsible. The story continues that the boy responded: \n``Father, I cannot tell a lie. I cut down that cherry tree.''\n  The boy who grew up to be President knew the value of truth. \nUnfortunately, however, when it comes to Presidential politics these \ndays, telling the truth is seriously out of style.\n  That point was brought home sharply to me last weekend when I \ntraveled to West Virginia, where I learned of a scurrilous campaign \nbeing waged in West Virginia to scare voters--think of it--to scare \nWest Virginia voters into registering and voting Republican. \nIncredibly, the weapon being brandished is the Holy Bible itself. If \never there were one book that should never be used for political gain, \nif ever there were one book that should never be the subject of lies \nand deception, it is the Bible, which I hold in my hand.\n  Over my 52 years of serving in the Congress, there have been \noccasions--few in number--when I brought the Holy Bible on the floor of \nthe body in which I have spoken. I don't claim to be a minister. I \nwould not be worthy of that title. But this is the Holy Bible. It is \nthe King James version, first published in 1611 under the reign of King \nJames I. I will only read this Bible at my house; I don't read any \nother Bible. Again I say, if ever there were a book that should never, \never be used for political gain, that should not be the subject of \ndeception on the part of politicians, or anybody else, it is the Bible. \nYet that is exactly what is happening today. I found, last weekend, \nthat it was happening in West Virginia. I read somewhere that it was \nalso happening in Arkansas.\n  Two weeks ago, the Republican National Committee sent a mass mailing\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\nto West Virginia suggesting that liberals--in other words, everyone but \nRepublicans, I suppose--are out to ban the Bible. Get that: Out to ban \nthe Bible. Can you imagine? They are out to ban the Bible. What a \nridiculous claim. It is foolish on its face; it is absolutely \nridiculous on its face. It is a flatout, no-doubt-about-it, silly, \njuvenile, sophomoric charge. The Republican National Committee is \nspreading this tripe--it is putrid, this tripe--to smear Democrats. The \nPresident ought to demand that the Republican National Committee \napologize to the people of West Virginia.\n  The hypocrisy of the Republican National Committee's desperation \ntactic is an insult--an insult--to the intelligence of voters in my \nState. The ninth of the Ten Commandments, passed down from God to \nMoses, states:\n\n       Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\n\n  What could be more false? What could be more false than an \nadvertisement implying that so-called liberals want to ban the Bible? I \nnever knew I was a liberal. When I came to this Senate, I was to the \nright of Barry Goldwater, and I always considered myself to be a \nconservative in most things--certainly most things, other than matters \naffecting the economy. The political hacks behind that blasphemous \nflyer should be required to reread the Book of Exodus. There is no free \npass from the Commandments in an election year. They are still there. \nThere is no waiving of the Commandments in an election year.\n\n  All West Virginians, from the northern tip of the State to the \nsouthern tip, from the east to the west, should be insulted by such \ndirty tricks on the part of the Republican National Committee. Paid \nhenchmen who talk about Democratic politicians who are eager to ban the \nBible obviously must think that West Virginians are gullible, ignorant \nfools. They must think that West Virginians just bounced off the turnip \ntruck. They must think that spreading nonsense about banning the Bible \nis a sure-fire way to get votes in an election year. But the people of \nWest Virginia are smarter than that. We are not country bumpkins who \nwill swallow whatever garbage some high-priced political consultant \nmakes up. West Virginians are smarter than that, and they deserve an \napology from the Republican National Committee for this insulting \nmailing.\n  Here it is. Take a look at this. Those of you who are viewing this \nSenate floor through those electronic lenses, look at this: ``The \nBible, banned. This will be West Virginia.''\n  I suppose the same flyer was used in Arkansas, with a few words \nchanged from West Virginia. Here it is again: ``if you don't vote--if \nyou stay away from the polls--the Bible, banned.''\n  Such tripe. That is what West Virginians think of that. As a Senator, \nI am appalled by the Republican National Committee's utter ignorance of \nthe Constitution.\n  I am appalled, let me say it again, by the Republican National \nCommittee's utter ignorance of this Constitution, the Constitution of \nthe United States, which I hold in my hand. Our Constitution--let me \nsay to the people of West Virginia and the people of Arkansas--our \nConstitution protects this Bible. So never fear, never fear that the \nBible will be banned.\n  The first amendment begins:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .\n\n  And yet this flier, paid for by the Republican National Committee, \nfeatures a picture of the Bible, just as I have shown Senators--let me \nshow it again--with the word ``banned'' across its cover. The people of \nWest Virginia should not have to put up with such trash. It is a crass \ninsult to the people and to their faith.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  But false claims seem to be the modus operandi in politics these \ndays. The truth gets tailored to fit the occasion. Nowhere is this more \nevident than on the subject of Iraq. Whether it be weapons of mass \ndestruction or an imminent threat or mushroom clouds, the reason for \nthe war changes faster than the weather. Talk about flip-flops. There \nyou have it.\n  The White House said that our troops would be welcomed with flowers, \nand yet our soldiers saw mortar attacks and suicide bombings. The White \nHouse said the world would be with us in the war and the reconstruction \nin Iraq, but the coalition of the willing was never that large and has \nbecome the coalition of the wilting. How can the American people trust \na White House that cannot get its stories straight? The flipping and \nthe flopping from this slippery fish crowd is a sight to behold.\n  Even now, the White House is trying desperately to portray Iraq as a \nnation that is getting back on its feet. Listen to the September 29 \nWashington Post. The headline: ``Growing Pessimism on Iraq. Doubts \nIncrease Within U.S. Security Agencies.''\n  Let me read just the first few paragraphs:\n\n       A growing number of career professionals within national \n     security agencies believe that the situation in Iraq is much \n     worse, and the path to success much more tenuous, than is \n     being expressed in public by top Bush administration \n     officials, according to former and current government \n     officials and assessments over the past year by intelligence \n     officials at the CIA and the Departments of State and \n     Defense.\n       While President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld \n     and others have delivered optimistic public appraisals, \n     officials who fight the Iraqi insurgency and study it at the \n     CIA and the State Department and within the Army officer \n     corps believe the rebellion is deeper and more widespread \n     than is being publicly acknowledged, officials say.\n       People at the CIA ``are mad at the policy in Iraq because \n     it's a disaster, and they're digging the hole deeper and \n     deeper and deeper,'' said one former intelligence officer who \n     maintains contact with CIA officials. ``There's no obvious \n     way to fix it. The best we can hope for is a semi-failed \n     state hobbling along with terrorists and a succession of weak \n     governments.''\n\n  Yesterday's New York Times reports--what I just read was from \nyesterday's Washington Post--yesterday's New York Times reports that \nthere have been 2,300 attacks by insurgents. They have been directed \nagainst civilians and military targets in Iraq in a pattern that \nsprawls over nearly every major population center outside the Kurdish \nnorth.\n  So there you have it--an average of 80 attacks against our forces \neach day. The situation in Iraq is far more dire and the future far \nmore uncertain than White House officials are ever going to admit, and \nso the lives of America's sons and daughters are on the line in Iraq, \nand still we hear happy talk about success right over the horizon.\n  Misleading scenarios about Iraq or ludicrous nonsense about banning \nthe Bible insult the values and the intelligence of West Virginians and \nthe millions of other Americans who share the beliefs of West \nVirginians. Such stuff must not be tolerated. The people of this \ncountry know about honesty, and they must start demanding it from their \nleaders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for his remarks today. I have tremendous respect for his \nbelief and his knowledge of the Constitution. I share that belief and I \nonly hope my knowledge can at some time reach the level his is in terms \nof understanding and being able to expound on the Constitution that is \nsuch a treasure and a blessing for this country.\n  More importantly, I share in his belief and his execution in the \nteachings of the Bible. Like the Senator from West Virginia, I try very \nhard each and every day to follow the Ten Commandments, which are a \ncornerstone in the faith that we both practice in our Christian \nreligion. I try hard to witness my faith each and every day in my \nactions and in my words. Among the Commandments, ``thou shalt not bear \nfalse witness'' is one I work desperately on. In our modern language, \nwe know it as ``do not tell lies,'' something we were taught by our \nparents and we were taught by our faith.\n  Now, I have not been in public service nearly as long as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, but I have been around long enough to know that \npeople say things in campaigns that come awfully close to breaking that \nCommandment. I have learned to turn the other cheek and brush aside the \nlittle white lies of political commercials and direct mail pieces. I do \nnot know if brushing aside and turning that cheek at this juncture is \nthe most appropriate thing to do, because I think we find ourselves at \na time when that has definitely been taken to the extreme.\n  The mailing the Republican National Committee sent to the people \nliving in my home State of Arkansas, as well as\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\nthose in the State of West Virginia, goes beyond any political smear I \nhave witnessed. I hope my colleagues in this great body, as members of \nthat committee, would denounce such abusive action because I think it \nis completely inappropriate. To insinuate that members of the \nDemocratic Party, simply because they are Democrats, would ban the \nBible is absolutely absurd. It is outrageous, and it is outrageous that \nwe in this Nation would stand for that.\n  I am a Democrat. I was raised in a Democratic family. But I also grew \nup with the opportunity and encouragement to find my own belief and to \nreach out and find out, Who am I? What do I stand for? What is it that \nI want to contribute to this great world?\n  I realized, not only as a Democrat but at a very early age, that I \nwas first and foremost a Christian. I take that very seriously. I take \nmy witness and my commitment to my faith as a part of my everyday walk. \nI try hard to walk my talk each and every day. I fight hard, both \npersonally and professionally, every day to fulfill my witness to my \nfaith, to care for those who are less fortunate than I am, to reach out \nand be kind to those who need kindness, to be able to look beyond the \ncover of what I might see in someone and look for the best of what God \ncreated in that human being as well.\n  I know that we are all a part of God's creation on this Earth. I know \nthat my God is a loving God, one who believes in me and who wants \neveryone in this body to reach their potential. But I also know, \nthrough my faith, that reaching that potential means being able to have \nthat same kind of unconditional Christian love for my fellow man.\n  It is amazing to me that we would see such action, such assumption, \nand such disregard for the intelligence of the people of our States.\n  My faith has always been an important part of my life because I was \nraised in a Christian family, with parents who had strong principles, \nwho had tremendous love, and continue to, and an ability to share with \nme what that love could produce in my life if I, too, were willing to \nshare it with others.\n  I worked as a youth group director while I was in college. I taught \nSunday school while I worked here on the Hill as a staffer--in \nWashington, DC. I contribute time to homeless shelters here in DC, and \nat home, working with the Red Cross through many kinds of devastating \nnatural disasters in my home State--finding incredible opportunities \nwhere I could provide that love and that assistance to my fellow man.\n  My husband Steve and I make sure our family is regularly at church, \nwhether we are here in the Washington area or at home in Arkansas with \nour family. There is rarely a meal that goes by in my home where we \ndon't all join hands and say a prayer of thanksgiving and gratefulness \nfor all of the many blessings in our life. We end each day saying \nprayers with our boys when they are tucked into bed. We talk about the \nday's events and how, through those prayers, we can ask for the \nassistance for others and to improve ourselves and provide the \nunbelievable talents God has given us to be a great part of making this \nworld a better place.\n  I am not the only one, as a member of my political party, whose faith \nis important to them. There are other members of my political party who \nare of other faiths who take their faith very seriously. There are \nother Christians in my political party who take their faith very \nseriously and act it as a real part of their everyday life.\n  It is unbelievable to me that the Republican Party would try to claim \nthat members of my party would want to ban the Bible. What do they base \nthat on? Where is their credibility to say that? What evidence is there \nthat would lead them to say that and to use that in such an \nimportant part of what we stand for in this Nation, the political \nprocess of being able to elect our leaders? I don't know. I don't know \nwhere that comes from.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, who is running for President, has \ntold the American people that his faith is important to him as well. He \nsays he is a man of God, and I believe him. Unlike some other political \ncandidates, he has not sought to gain political advantage by boasting \nof his faith or wearing it on his sleeve, but I do believe his actions \nin defending so many of his fellow men, children, low-income families, \nthe elderly, are certainly clear examples of how important his \nresponsibility to his faith is to him.\n  Maybe he was raised in a region of the country where people are not \nso outspoken about their faith, just as they are more reserved in most \nother aspects of their lives. I was raised in the South where we love \nto talk about it, where it is an important part of who we are and we \nwant to talk about it, where we like to hug and we like to be close. \nThere is no doubt that there are differences in the regions of our \ncountry in how we express things. Sometimes my colleagues say I even \nneed a translator because my accent is so thick. There is nothing wrong \nwith the differences in the regions of this country. There is nothing \nwrong in the different ways we choose to show our faith. But there is \nsomething deeply wrong with people using the political process to \naccuse people of not being true to their faith.\n  The man from Massachusetts, maybe he is quiet, but less visible \nexpressions of faith do not warrant such judgmental political \nstatements from the Republican Party. I hope, I hope deeply, that the \nRepublican Party, which has produced this pamphlet that was so well \ndescribed by my colleague from West Virginia--I hope there will be an \napology for their claims that Democrats want to ban the Bible and the \ninferences that Democrats, for some reason, cannot have a faith as \nclose or as deeply held as the other party. I find that to be the pit, \nthe absolute bottom of what is wrong in the political process.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to come to the Senate \nfloor and, even as a southerner, express something that maybe I am not \nas well equipped to express as others, but I promise you, it is not \nless heartfelt than any other Christian Member of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas and tell her, I, No. 1, never have any trouble understanding \nher, and, No. 2, I always enjoy giving her a hug.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank our esteemed friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, for his words--always words of wisdom and words of \nrage when he sees such an affront to the basic tenets of our society.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the pending question? Do we \nhave an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an amendment pending.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3802\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3802 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3802.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To stop corporations from financing terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TERRORIST FINANCING.\n\n       (a) Clarification of Certain Actions Under IEEPA.--In any \n     case in which the President takes action under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     et seq.) to prohibit a United States person from engaging in \n     transactions with a foreign country, where a determination \n     has been made by the Secretary of State that the government \n     of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism, such action shall apply\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\n     to any foreign subsidiaries or affiliate, including any \n     permanent foreign establishment of that United States person, \n     that is controlled in fact by that United States person.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Controlled in fact.--The term ``is controlled in fact'' \n     includes--\n       (A) in the case of a corporation, holds at least 50 percent \n     (by vote or value) of the capital structure of the \n     corporation; and\n       (B) in the case of any other kind of legal entity, holds \n     interests representing at least 50 percent of the capital \n     structure of the entity.\n       (2) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' includes any United States citizen, permanent \n     resident alien, entity organized under the law of the United \n     States (including foreign branches), wherever located, or any \n     other person in the United States.\n       (c) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--In any case in which the President has \n     taken action under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and such action is in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     not apply to a United States person (or other person) if such \n     person divests or terminates its business with the government \n     or person identified by such action within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Actions after date of enactment.--In any case in which \n     the President takes action under the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to a \n     United States person (or other person) if such person divests \n     or terminates its business with the government or person \n     identified by such action within 90 days after the date of \n     such action.\n\n      SEC. __.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment to this \nintelligence reform bill because I think it is consistent with the \nmission of that bill. There has been a lot of work and a lot of debate \nabout the bill, and I personally am supporting it, but I offer an \namendment to do something we very much intend to have happen, and that \nis to shut down the source of revenue for terrorist organizations.\n  The 9/11 Commission report talks about the critical issue of \nterrorist financing because as President Bush has said, money is the \nlifeblood of terrorist operations.\n  Amazingly, some of our very own corporations help provide revenue \nindirectly to terrorists by doing business with state sponsors of \nterrorism. My amendment would close the loophole in the law that allows \nthis to happen, thereby cutting off a major source of revenue for \nterrorists.\n  As the 9/11 Commission stated:\n\n       Vigorous efforts to track terrorists' financing must remain \n     front and center in the U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\n\n  We took pains to check with the Parliamentarian about the \ngermaneness, the relevance of our amendment, and it was confirmed that \nthis would be relevant.\n  We need to starve the terrorists at the source and that is why our \nsanctions program in law is so critical, but now we know a loophole in \nthe law exists that enables companies to do business with Iran, which \nopenly boasts about its support for Hamas and Islamic jihad.\n  Iran also funded the 1983 terror attack in Beirut that killed 241 \nU.S. Marines; 241 of our finest young people killed by Iranian terror, \nand yet we are permitting U.S. corporations to provide revenue flows to \nthe Iranian Government. We have to put a stop to it as quickly as we \ncan.\n  How do companies get around terrorist sanction laws? It is a fairly \nsimple process. They simply establish a foreign subsidiary and run \ntheir Iranian operations. It is demonstrated on this chart which says \nthat U.S. corporations have subsidiaries all over the place and that is \ncommon in our economic and business structure. Once a foreign \nsubsidiary is created, then people can do business with Iran or other \nrogue nations, people who are determined to kill our citizens, can do \nbusiness with them and provide services--intentionally, I do not \nbelieve--but nevertheless to people like Hamas and Hezbollah. It is a \nterrible thing to recognize that American companies can be providing \nsustenance to countries that support terrorism actively.\n  Our American sanctions law prohibits American companies from doing \nbusiness with Iran, but the law does not mention an American company's \nforeign subsidiaries. As long as a loophole like this is in place, our \nterrorist sanction laws are considerably diminished in their force.\n  After brutally murdering 241 of our young marines in their sleep in \nBeirut in 1983, an Iranian-backed terrorist killed two American women \nwhom we show in these photos. Look at these young faces. They are \npeople at the dawn of life. Sara Duker was a constituent of mine, a 22-\nyear-old from the town of Teaneck, NJ. She was a summa cum laude \ngraduate of Barnard College. Sara was killed with her fiance when the \nbus she was riding in in Jerusalem in 1996 was blown up by Hamas. An \nAmerican court confirmed that Iran was responsible and assets were \nseized to try and provide compensation to the families.\n  Hamas receives its funding and support from the Iranian Government \nand that is why this attempt to sequester assets was done.\n  Last year, Abigail Litle, a 14-year-old Christian missionary \noriginally from New Hampshire, was riding home from school in Haifa, \nIsrael, when her bus exploded as a result of a suicide bomb. That \nattack killed 15 people and was directly linked to terrorists funded by \nSyria and Iran.\n  I was in Iran with several other Senators and we talked to the \nPresident of the country about supporting terrorism. He denied any \nsuggestion that they might be operating out of his country, but the \nIsraelis last week apparently took an action to eliminate the head of \none of the terrorist organizations who was clearly functioning there.\n  We have to worry about these countries and we cannot give them any \nlatitude, any encouragement to continue with their killing ways. We \nalso have to worry about providing revenue to Iran because of its well-\nknown desire to build a nuclear bomb and other weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The 9/11 Commission concluded:\n\n       Preventing the proliferation of [WMD] warrants a maximum \n     effort.\n  Certainly, ``maximum'' includes providing funding for some of these \nfirms. So allowing U.S. companies to provide revenue to rogue WMD \nprograms is clearly not a maximum effort.\n  Some people think this is an isolated problem, but it is not. \nAccording to a report by the Center for Security Policy, there are \nlarge numbers of companies doing business with Iran and other sponsors \nof terror.\n  Iran sponsors terrorism, period. The terror they help fund has killed \nhundreds of Americans. Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons and \nyet U.S. companies are using a loophole in the law in order to do \nbusiness with the Iranian Government. It is wrong. It is not illegal \nyet, but this amendment would change it. I am sure when my colleagues \nexamine what we are talking about, they will consider joining us, I \nhope, enthusiastically.\n  It is inexcusable for American companies to engage in any business \nthat provides revenue, any business practice that provides revenues to \nterrorism. We have to stop it. We have a chance to do that with this \namendment. I remind our distinguished colleague, the chairperson of the \ncommittee, that she supported this amendment before and I hope she will \nonce again support the amendment and let all of us close the terror \nfunding loophole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are today, in this country, convulsed by \nthe situation in Iraq. It is an extraordinary crisis. It is taxing our \nmen and women in uniform, and it is certainly taxing our resolve.\n  I think one of the problems is that the administration has not \nfocused on the reality on the ground, what is really happening on the \nground. They are\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\nhoping, but hope is not a substitute for planning; hope is not a \nsubstitute for a very candid and hard look at the situation on the \nground. The reality is that there is widespread violence and \ninstability throughout Iraq.\n  Yesterday, the New York Times reported that\n\n     over the past 30 days more than 2,300 attacks by insurgents \n     have been directed against civilians and military targets in \n     Iraq in a pattern that sprawls over nearly every major \n     population center outside the Kurdish north, according to the \n     comprehensive data compiled by a private security company \n     with access to military intelligence reports and its own \n     network of Iraqi informants.\n\n  You would think, given this information, that the administration \nwould begin to reflect on the difficult circumstances on the ground, \nbut that is not the case. They continue to pursue both policies and \nrhetoric which suggest that all is not well yet it is quickly getting \nthere.\n  But there is something else they have done which I think is \nstartling, and that is in a related story in the Washington Post, \ninformation such as what I just quoted, that data from private security \ncompanies is not being recognized and evaluated. It is being \nsuppressed.\n  According to today's Washington Post, the\n\n       USAID said this week that it would restrict distribution of \n     reports by Kroll Security International showing the number of \n     daily attacks by insurgents in Iraq has increased.\n       On Monday, the Washington Post published a front-page story \n     saying that the Kroll report suggests a broad and \n     intensifying campaign of insurgent violence. A USAID official \n     sent an e-mail to congressional aides stating: This is the \n     last Kroll report to come in. After the Washington Post \n     story, they shut it down in order to regroup. I will let you \n     know when it restarts.\n\n  If we don't have accurate information, if we are not able to tell \ndifficult truth one to another, we will never be able to effectively \ndesign a policy for Iraq.\n  It is concerning to me that the administration would try to respond \nto the facts by suppressing the facts, but that is just one example of \nwhat is going on.\n  I know this. The country, with some exception, is wracked by \nviolence. The Kurds in the north have had a semiautonomous region for \nmany years. It is under our informal protection and formal protection. \nThat is a part of the country where there is a certain stability, but \nthere is political tension building there because the Kurdish sense of \nautonomy will invariably clash with the need to create a central \ngovernment in Iraq.\n  The focal point of that clash could be the oil around Kirkuk, which \nis the second biggest source of oil for the country of Iraq. Those oil \nfields could be in jeopardy as a pawn, if you will, in a struggle \nbetween the Kurds asserting their autonomy and the central government \ntrying to maintain its authority.\n  We also understand clearly that Sunni provinces have ``no-enter \nzones''--areas in which the United States cannot even send its troops \ntoday successfully. One of these areas is Ramadi.\n  According, again, to a story in the Los Angeles Times on September \n28:\n\n       The erosion of order in Ramadi illustrates the success of \n     the insurgents' methods and the serious problems facing the \n     interim government and its U.S. backers in maintaining \n     stability in Iraq. It also threatens to thwart plans for a \n     national election in January. . . . An election that omits \n     key population centers in the so-called Sunni Triangle \n     region would have greatly diminished credibility.\n\n  In Fallujah, there are similar situations where there are areas we \ncannot enter. In the Shia South, there is the instability principally \ngenerated by Sadr, the young cleric who has defied the central \ngovernment and also the U.S. repeatedly.\n  We generally see the violence in Iraq as a function of attacks \nagainst our troops, but when we do that we miss a very important \nreality; that is, this violence is only a small portion of the violence \nthat the Iraqi people feel each day--not from terrorists but from \nrobbers, burglars, rapists, and murderers.\n  In June, a poll was conducted. They asked the Iraqi people to list \ntheir top three priorities. Fighting crime represented one of the top \nthree priorities of 92.8 percent of the people of Iraq. Stopping \nattacks on coalition forces represented a top priority of 17.5 percent \nof the people of Iraq. On a daily basis, we are seeing not just attacks \nagainst coalition forces and security forces of Iraq, we are seeing a \nsituation in many places which is beyond chaotic to the point which the \nIraqi people are quickly beginning to assume that we not only are \noccupying but we are inept occupiers. We cannot even provide the level \nof stability that they enjoyed previously. They have already decided we \nare occupiers. They have decided we must go.\n  The struggle now politically, I think, is you have to recognize that \nin this type of conflict it is essentially a political struggle. We can \nwin tactical victories one after another--and we will--but unless we \ncreate a political dynamic which will coalesce support around the new \nIraqi Government and coalesce cooperation with us, our efforts \ntactically will be marginal.\n  What is happening, though, politically in Iraq now is the fact that \neach of these groups and subgroups have one eye on the current \nsituation, our presence there, but their other focus is on what happens \nwhen we go. Will they be in power? Will they survive? Will they \nsucceed? That creates a dynamic that is very difficult for us and very \ndifficult for stability in Iraq.\n  How did we get there?\n  It is in some respects a triumph, as I said before, of hope over \nhistory, of ideology, of political calculation, arrogance in some \ncases, ignorance that has led us to enter the country ill prepared.\n  There is a litany of mistakes that are quite obvious: No real plans \nfor stabilization and reconstruction in Iraq. We should have sensed \nthat.\n  I can recall in the fall of 2003 and in succeeding days and months \nleading up to the attack last year where we had a situation where we \nwere trying to get information about stabilization. We didn't have \nthat. We did not have that information.\n\n  In addition, there were insufficient forces to stabilize Iraq and we \nwere left unprotected for weeks and months, which today has led to a \nproliferation of weapons in Iraq, IEDs particularly, the improvised \nexplosive devices that are bedeviling our forces. We cannot secure \nthose. We could not secure the borders. We need more troops.\n  There was a failure to secure multinational support, not only in the \nsense of getting the good will, good wishes, and support of the \ninternational community, but particular failures.\n  We were not able to convince the Turkish Government to allow the use \nof Turkey as a point of entry into Iraq. The Fourth Infantry Division, \npoised to move through Turkey, to attack in the north, to roll up and \nenvelop all of the Iraqi forces to the north, was rerouted to the south \nbecause of that lack of cooperation. The consequence on the ground was \nliterally thousands of Iraqi soldiers were never effectively contested. \nThey gave up, they disappeared, and apparently reformed as insurgents. \nThat is another example of the lack of international cooperation that \ncould have materially assisted us.\n  We made a significant error in disbanding the Iraqi Army. Rather than \ndisbanding the army, we should have marched them back to their barracks \nand tried at that point to see if we could, through some type of \nvetting of officers and senior enlisted people, or some procedure, get \nthem to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. They \nare part of the problem today. Many of these insurgent leaders, I \nbelieve, have roots going back to the army and the military force \nstructure, the security forces of Iraq.\n  Then we conducted a de-Baathification program that applied across the \nboard. We put that in the hands of Chalabi and others who had no real \nlegitimacy in the country. As a result, for months and months and \nmonths we prevented teachers and professionals from working. It did not \nhelp in terms of getting schools going quickly. It certainly created \nthis atmosphere among the Sunni community that they were going to \neffectively be marginalized as people and as citizens of Iraq. That \nprocess was a mistake.\n  Part of that, as I mentioned, was putting misplaced reliance on \nChalabi and his colleagues. I recall he sat as a guest of the First \nLady at this year's State of the Union speech, yet today is accused of \ncooperating and perhaps spying for the Iranians. That has been a \nmistake.\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\n  The CPA, Coalition Provisional Authority, turned out to be not up to \nthe great task with which they were entrusted. The administration \nrejected the traditional agencies of the State Department and their \ndivisions who have experience in stabilization operations in terms of \npolitical governments, reconstruction, economic development, and put \ntogether an ad hoc group of people who were the architects of what was \na lost year of progress that we should have been making with respect to \nIraq.\n  And, of course, there was the failure to recognize this insurgency. \nWe all recall Secretary Rumsfeld's remarks about a few dead-enders. It \nwas much more than a few dead-enders. It has metastasized into a \nvirulent and effective force attacking our troops on a daily basis and \nattacking the citizens of Iraq.\n  There was a failure then simply to read the intelligence. We are \ndebating this intelligence bill today because we have to create--\nindeed, it is necessary to create--an intelligence system that is more \neffective. Let me point to an intelligence success. This was the \nnational intelligence estimate. According to a report in the New York \nTimes,\n\n       The estimate came in two classified reports prepared for \n     President Bush in January 2003 by the National Intelligence \n     Council, an independent group that advises the Director of \n     Central Intelligence. The assessments predicted that an \n     American-led invasion of Iraq would increase support for \n     political Islam and would result in a deeply divided Iraqi \n     society prone to violent internal conflict.\n\n  Very perceptive. It was disregarded by the administration, and I \nthink disregarded for several reasons. They had a view, which was not \nsubstantiated by the facts, that we would be greeted with open arms. \nPrincipals in the administration said that.\n  As we debate this intelligence reform, we also have to understand it \nis not just producing good intelligence; it is having leaders who \nunderstand and use that intelligence wisely.\n  Then one of the most critical issues is that we have wasted a year to \ntrain Iraqi security forces. I can recall, as many of my colleagues \nrecall, being briefed over the past many months. It seemed each \nbriefing would contain another pie chart showing the growing, growing \nIraqi security forces and the diminishing United States involvement. \nAll of that was an illusion. These forces were untrained, ill equipped, \nunprepared. It took us a year to recognize that and we are only \nbeginning now to recognize what we have to do to ensure that Iraqi \nsecurity forces can, in fact, provide for the security of their \ncountry.\n  Part of it was a result of the notion that we could do it ourselves, \nthat this was just a few diehards, as Secretary Rumsfeld said, that we \ncould root them out and we could deal with them with the coalition \nforces. Then it was reluctance to develop an Iraqi security force \nbecause of the fear that they would become another power player in the \nvery complicated politics of Iraq where it seems the only institutions \nthat have any type of strength and coherence are the mosques or the \nmilitias, and they sometimes overlap. So for all these reasons, despite \nthe evidence of growing instability, despite the proliferation of \ncrime, we have just gotten down to begin to train an effective Iraqi \nsecurity force of police, army, national guard, and special operations. \nThat is a year wasted, a year that should not have been wasted. The \nsigns were quite clear.\n  Indeed, even as we focus on this, there have been reports in the \npress that General Petraeus, who has been put in charge of this \noperation, has not yet received his full complement of American \npersonnel to help, another example of a delayed reaction, a reaction \nbased upon hopes that did not materialize. While those hopes were \nbandied about here in Washington, the situation got much worse.\n  All of this leads to an Iraq today that is imposing extraordinary \ncosts on this country. One of the most obvious and poignant costs is \nthe loss from American fighting men and women in battle: 1,054 soldiers \nhave been killed and 7,532 soldiers wounded, who have served this \ncountry with great fidelity and great courage. Their families deserve \nour profound respect. We owe them, and we owe their colleagues who \nstill fight, more wisdom and more truth.\n  That is why it is particularly frustrating to see this example of a \nreaction where, when the facts are uncomfortable, those facts are \nsuppressed. That is not appropriate given the sacrifices we have seen.\n  The costs to our Army, particularly, are significant. Personnel \ncosts. We all understand there were misgivings about the full size of \nthe force being deployed. When General Shinseki was asked, he did not \nvolunteer, about the size of the force needed, he said, ``something on \nthe order of several hundred thousand soldiers,'' and was immediately \ncastigated by Secretary Rumsfeld, saying this estimate was ``far from \nthe mark,'' and Secretary Wolfowitz, who called the estimate \n``outlandish.''\n  Then in his few remaining days in the Army, General Shinseki was \npersonally shunned by the leadership and made to feel entirely \nuncomfortable--and I am being very polite. He did not deserve that. \nThis is a professional soldier who was asked his honest opinion and he \ngave it. I wish there were more folks like him in uniform. Certainly \nthe comments of Secretary Wolfowitz and Secretary Rumsfeld were very \nfar off the mark. We have over 100,000 troops in place. They probably \nwill be there for years. There is a strong sign that we need more.\n\n  This is a great stress on our military, 17 months after President \nBush declared the end of major combat operations, with over 138,000 \ntroops still stationed in Iraq. They are there because of a patchwork \nof different policies the Department of Defense has had to undertake \nbecause they do not have sufficient soldiers. Approximately 16,000 \nactive-duty soldiers have already had two tours in Iraq and if they \nstay in the service longer, they will have another. In order to keep \nthe strength up, they have resorted to stop-loss orders, essentially \ntelling a soldier, once your unit has been alerted, you are there until \nthe unit returns home, even if you can leave the service in that \ninterim. In the words of some, it is a ``backdoor draft.''\n\n  Since September 11, DOD has announced six stop-loss policies for the \nArmy, two for the Navy, five for the Air Force, and two for the Marine \nCorps. Only the Army still has a stop-loss policy in place. That is \nanother way in which to create soldiers by means other than a strictly \nvoluntary approach.\n  One of the greatest burdens falls on the Guard and Reserves. Today, \nwe cannot continue our mission without the brave men and women of our \nArmy and Air Force Guard and Reserve units. We are asking them to go \nway above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Since September 11, 2001, 422,950 members of the Reserve component \nhave been mobilized; 51 percent of the Army Guard and 31 percent of the \nAir Guard. The average duty days have climbed as a result. Guard and \nReserve men and women are now serving, on average, about 120 days a \nyear. In fact, back in 2002, it was only 80, and before that it was \nmuch less.\n  We are looking at a situation which the GAO described as fraught with \nconsequences. In their words:\n\n       DOD policies were not developed within the context of an \n     overall strategic framework. . . . Consequently the policies \n     underwent numerous changes as DOD strove to meet current \n     requirements. These policy changes created uncertainties for \n     reserve component members concerning the likelihood of their \n     mobilization, the length of their overseas rotations and the \n     types of missions that they would be asked to perform. It \n     remains to be seen how these uncertainties will affect \n     recruiting, retention and the long term viability of the \n     reserve components.\n\n  We have already seen the National Guard report that they have not \nbeen able to meet their recruiting objectives for the most current \nyear. So the evidence is beginning to accumulate.\n  This operation tempo will mean more and more pressure on the military \nforces, particularly land forces, and, as a result, you will see the \nstress even more, in recruiting and retention, challenging our military \nleaders. We need more troops, I believe, as an initial response to the \nsituation in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. We should do that \nhonestly and directly. We should not rely upon supplemental \nappropriations. We should not rely on emergency authorizations for \nadditional troops. We should increase the end strength of the Army and \nprovide for the payment of that end strength through the regular budget \nprocess, not by supplementals.\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\n  Senator Hagel and I offered an amendment to do this last October. In \nMarch, again, Senator Hagel, joined by Senator McCain and I, introduced \na bill that would increase the Army end strength by 30,000 troops. In \nMay, we together offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Defense \nauthorization bill to increase the size of the Army by 20,000 \npersonnel, a figure the Army says it could absorb in an efficient way \nin 1 year. This was accepted by the Senate, and it is now in conference \nwith the House.\n  One point I should make, though, is that, once again, the \nadministration insisted--even though they oppose the end strength--if \nit was to be put in the bill, it still had to be paid for by emergency \nfunds. That is not the right way to do this. We have to make sure we \nhave a suitably sized Army.\n  This is not a spike. This is not a temporary situation. Every time \nthe President speaks, he talks about staying the course, our long-term \ncommitment to Iraq. That is not a temporary promise, I do not think. I \nthink that requires a permanent fix to the size of our Army and to our \nMarine Corps.\n  Now, one of the things that has happened since our debate on the \nfloor is that the Defense Science Board, a panel of experts appointed \nby Secretary Rumsfeld himself, stated: ``Current and projected force \nstructure will not sustain our current and projected global \nstabilization commitments.'' There are ``inadequate total numbers'' of \ntroops and a ``lack of long term endurance.''\n\n  That is the conclusion of experts who have studied this issue, who \nhave looked at all the things the Army is doing through modularity, \nthrough technical improvements and technological innovations to \nminimize the need for additional troops, and they have concluded, as a \nresult of the study requested by the Secretary of Defense, that we need \nmore troops.\n  It is not only troops. We also need equipment. The Army has sustained \n$2.439 billion in equipment battle losses in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nPresently, the Army has an unfunded requirement for $1.322 billion for \nmunitions.\n  Last year, the Army spent $4 billion on equipment reconstitution--\nresetting it, repairing it, and getting it ready to go again.\n  The Marine Corps expects to need over $1 billion to reconstitute \nequipment next year.\n  The GAO reports that since September 11, the Army Guard has \ntransferred 22,000 pieces of equipment from nondeploying units to units \ndeployed in Iraq. What we have is a huge reshuffling going on, as units \nback in the United States take their equipment and give it out to units \nthat are deploying forward. It leaves these units back in the United \nStates without equipment. If they are called upon to perform a mission, \nanother international mission, a homeland security mission, or a \nmission involving a natural disaster, where are they going to get the \nequipment they deployed overseas? How are they going to be affected?\n  In addition to the National Guard and Reserves, the Active Army is \nresetting itself under new battle formations, modularity, which is a \nconcept that I think is ingenious, a concept that should be supported. \nBut as they are doing this, they too are shuffling equipment about. \nThere are some units that are not yet up to speed with all their \nequipment. They will have it, I am sure, before they are deployed \noverseas, but it is another example of the turmoil in terms of \nequipment we are seeing within the military.\n  In order to respond accurately, correctly, and directly to the \nsituation in Iraq, we have to increase our Army, I believe, and make \nsure they have the resources to have the equipment they need to do the \njob.\n  Now, the funding for our operations in Iraq has been primarily \nthrough supplementals. In the past 17 months, President Bush has \nrequested and Congress has appropriated $187 billion for the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan. For comparison, the budgets for the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of \nEducation, and the Department of Interior total $163 billion. So we \nhave been spending in Iraq more money than we allow for discretionary \nspending for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Interior.\n  The last supplemental, for $25 billion, was passed in May 2004. At \nthat time, the administration said they would not need the funding \nuntil January or February of next year, 2005. Yet it has been reported \nthis week that $2 billion of this fund has already been used, showing \nthe huge, huge pressure, the huge cost of our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Last week, President Bush announced he plans to divert nearly $3.5 \nbillion from Iraqi water, power, and other reconstruction projects to \nsecurity, another indication, I think, that the security situation is \nin very difficult circumstances.\n  We have been funding these operations with supplementals. But we \ncannot continue to do that because there will be a point, I believe, at \nwhich the American people will be very concerned, when each year we are \nforced to vote on $60, $70, $80 billion of supplemental funding for \nIraq and Afghanistan. We know this effort is going to take many, many \nyears. People talk about it as a generational struggle, and I think \nthat is right. We have to prepare for that struggle, but we cannot do \nit in ad hoc supplemental budgeting.\n  We also have seen, of course, the terrible incidents of abuse in Abu \nGhraib, with too few troops in that prison to do the job, ill-trained \ntroops in that prison to do the job, but it is not just those troops. I \nthink it is wrong simply to single out people we know from photographs \nwho have done despicable things. They will be punished. They are being \npunished. We have a responsibility to look not only at the young \nsoldiers, but the leadership, the chain of command, the policies they \nadopted or did not adopt, the confusion they created and did not \nresolve. We have had several investigations so far. Each one goes a \nlittle bit down the road but then seems to stop.\n  We waited, frankly, for months for the report of General Fay and \nGeneral Jones, thinking this would be the final authoritative report \nthat would look from the level of three star and four star all the way \ndown. It turns out that for one of the most significant issues, the \nissue of ghost detainees--those individuals who were not properly \nrecorded by the authorities when they came into our custody--General \nJones and Fay had no real answers because they didn't get any \ncooperation from the Central Intelligence Agency. Now we have another \ninvestigation presumably conducted by the IG and the Department of \nDefense. This is not the way to get to the core of what happened. It \nmight be an effective way of postponing real review and investigation, \nbut it is not the way to get the answers.\n  These answers are important, not simply because of individual \nculpability of soldiers up and down the ranks, but because we have to \nhave a military force that understands that they are subject to the \nlaws, that it is not optional for leaders to ignore some or modify them \nat will. This is the very challenging situation, but it is an example, \nonce again, of the lack of preparedness, the lack of sufficient \npersonnel, and the lack of clear guidance that has plagued our \noperations in Iraq from the beginning.\n  I have spent a great deal of time talking about Iraq. The interesting \nthing in some respects is what we are not talking about. We are not \ntalking about North Korea. But just this week on Monday, at the United \nNations, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Su Hon said North Korea had been \nleft with ``no other option but to possess a nuclear deterrent'' \nbecause of U.S. policies that he said were designed to eliminate his \ncountry. He stated:\n\n       We have already made clear that we have already reprocessed \n     8,000 wasted fuel rods and transformed them into arms.\n\n  Reprocessing 8,000 rods would extract enough plutonium for as many as \neight nuclear warheads. Here is a situation where, as we focused on \nIraq, we have sat by as the North Koreans blatantly and boldly opened \nup the cans in which IAEA sealed the rods and, according to their \ncomments, have reprocessed this material into nuclear weapons. One of \nthe worst possible situations, a nuclear-armed North Korea, may have \nevolved. We are at this point taking troops out of South Korea to \nfulfill our requirements in Iraq. What signal does that send to the \nNorth Koreans?\n  It is not a question of deterrence. We have the capability of \ndeterring the\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\nNorth Koreans from coming south. But it certainly is not aiding us in \nwhat ultimately must be our objective of disarming North Korea, \nhopefully through peaceful means and through negotiations, not just our \nefforts alone but the world community, because the great fear that we \nall have, that transcends the current struggle in Iraq, is that \nterrorists will obtain nuclear material and nuclear weapons.\n  Here we have a situation where over the last several months the North \nKoreans have finally said: We have them. Part of our lack of response \nis an internal debate within the administration that has been going on \nfor months, if not years: Do you negotiate, which means some type of \narrangement between the world and North Korea, or do you once again \nembark on a regime change operation? The difference over the last \nseveral months is the growing realization that Iraq has put so much \nstress on our military forces, that in the event of a need to disarm \nNorth Korea, there would be far fewer forces to draw on. So that is \nanother huge cost of our involvement in Iraq.\n  Then add another development: The Iranians continue to insist they \nhave every right to a full, complete nuclear fuel cycle. Of course, the \nconcern--not just of the United States but the international \ncommunity--is that if they achieve that cycle, they will be able to \nobtain material with which to construct a nuclear weapon.\n  Despite their protestations that that is not their objective, there \nis a growing suggestion, if not conclusive evidence, that certainly \nthat possibility might exist. And once again, what are we doing? Why \nhave we not focused attention on Iran in a more meaningful and decisive \nway?\n  One has to question a strategy that has led us into Iraq, to the \ninstability, to the costs, to the lost opportunity, when there appear \nto be much more serious threats abroad.\n  We have an opportunity to be much more candid, much more truthful \nabout what is going on. That is an opportunity I would hope the \nadministration would embrace because unless we operate with the facts \nand unless we operate with the reality of the situation, there will be \nno way we can effectively plan to deal with the threats we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before initiating my remarks, let me \nexpress the admiration and respect I have for the chairman of this \ncommittee, Senator Collins of Maine, as well as the ranking Democrat, \nSenator Lieberman of Connecticut. What they have presented to the \nSenate is an extraordinary work product, if one considers the fact that \nwe first received the 9/11 Commission report on July 22, and a mere 8 \nor 9 weeks later we are on the floor of the Senate considering landmark \nlegislation. The first reaction of anyone who listens to those dates \nwould be that they must be acting in haste.\n  The fact is that no sooner did Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman \nreceive this report than they announced they would take it extremely \nseriously and they would do some things unprecedented around this \ninstitution to try to move the legislation on a timely basis. It meant \nasking Senators to return in the month of August, a month when we are \nusually either back in our States or vacationing with our families, to \ncome back and to have a series of hearings, starting with Governor Kean \nand Congressman Hamilton, Chair and Vice Chair of the Commission, and \nthen a long series of many scores of witnesses who came and talked to \nus about aspects of this report.\n  They followed those hearings in August and early September with a \nmarkup last week which I attended as a member of the committee, a \nmarkup which considered 33 different amendments. Those were serious \namendments, complicated amendments. Each one of them tested us to think \nlong and hard about the 9/11 Commission report as well as the bill that \nis before us.\n  The interesting thing about the amendments that were considered is \nthat when all was said and done--some had been adopted, some had been \ndefeated--not a single amendment passed or was defeated on a partisan \nrollcall.\n  It wasn't Republicans versus Democrats. That is a good sign. It shows \nwe took to this task in a bipartisan fashion and made concessions to \ntry to find solutions.\n  I, frankly, do not disparage debate on the Senate floor. It is an \nimportant part of what we do. Even heated debate I find informative and \nsometimes entertaining. But this morning at the town meeting which I \nhad with Senator Fitzgerald, a constituent from Illinois came up and \nsaid: Why do you argue so much? Why don't you just get together, the \ntwo political parties, and solve the problems?\n  I understand that sentiment. And though our arguments and debate may \nsound adolescent or a waste of time, they are, in fact, the noise of \ndemocracy. The debate in our committee, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which led to the adoption of some amendments and rejection \nof some amendments, led to a good bipartisan work product which we \nbring to the Senate floor today. I am proud to support it and proud to \nbe a cosponsor.\n  There are two parts of it in which I take particular pride. One \nrelates to the civil liberties board. The civil liberties board was an \nidea of the 9/11 Commission. They understood, as I think all of us do, \nthat historically when the United States was concerned about security \nissues and safety issues, those were the moments when our Government \nasked for more power to protect America, usually at the expense of \nindividual rights and liberties. It is a delicate balance and delicate \nnegotiation between security and liberty.\n  Again, after 9/11, the first invasion in the continental United \nStates since the British stormed this building in the War of 1812, \nafter that our Government came and asked for more authority to go after \nthe terrorists and to protect our Nation. On a bipartisan basis we gave \nthat authority to the Government.\n  We understood that it was a risky decision. We were enacting the \nPATRIOT Act at a time of high emotion, when we were still very mindful \nof the tragedy of 9/11 and the thousands of innocent Americans killed, \nas well as their families who were grieving. We gave that authority to \nour Government and said we will put a time limit on some of these new \npowers and we will revisit them in the future to see if we have gone \ntoo far.\n  At every step of the way, we want to balance the security of this \ncountry and the liberty of Americans, and not to go too far in giving \npowers to Government at the expense of the rights and freedoms that we \nenjoy and which make us America. This civil liberties board, proposed \nby the 9/11 Commission, was consistent with that value. On a bipartisan \nbasis, the Commission came and said, create within the executive branch \na civil liberties board; this civil liberties board will be a guardian, \nif you will, of the basic rights of Americans. It will measure the \npolicies and activities of our intelligence community and report \nregularly, on a public basis, as to whether there has been a Government \neffort that has gone too far.\n  I am not sure there is another board like this in any other part of \nour Government, but I applaud the 9/11 Commission for suggesting it. I \ncertainly applaud Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman for \nincorporating the original civil liberties board in this legislation \nand accepting several amendments that I offered, which I think make the \nboard even more independent and worthy of the duties that are entrusted \nto it.\n  Senator Kyl of Arizona came to the floor this morning and suggested \namendment No. 3801. It is an amendment to the civil liberties board \nsection. In my estimation, it would really undermine the effectiveness \nof this civil liberties board.\n  The Senator from Arizona said Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman \nfailed to make tough choices, in his words, because they were trying to \nwin unanimous approval of the bill. It is true the bill was reported \nunanimously from the committee; despite reservations of some members, \nwe all came together to report it out. I disagree with the Senator's \npremise that this unanimous vote was at the expense of making hard \nchoices. Trust me, hard choices were made on almost every page of this \nlengthy legislation. There is nothing wrong with trying to work\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. I think Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman did just that. They made some of the toughest choices.\n  This legislation would authorize the most significant reorganization \nof our intelligence community in 50 years. I believe this legislation \nwill save lives.\n  In his remarks on the amendment, Senator Kyl of Arizona suggested \nthose who were concerned about our fundamental constitutional rights \nneed to balance our concerns with concerns about the lives of American \ncitizens. If that is the premise of his position, I don't quarrel with \nit. It is always a balance. If you give the Government too much \nauthority to make us safe and take away from individuals the basic \nrights of our country, then what do we have left? When it is all over, \nthose unique American values have not been protected. Rather, they have \nbeen taken by the Government. So we always want to make sure we have \nenough authority in the Government to protect us, but not too much. \nThat is what this legislation does.\n  One of the issues we weighed heavily was how to fight the war on \nterrorism, while protecting basic liberties. The American people expect \nno less.\n  Let me quote from the 9/11 Commission when they addressed this issue:\n\n       While protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful \n     of threats to vital personal and civil liberties. This \n     balancing is no easy task, but we must constantly strive to \n     keep it right.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended this board and, following their \nrecommendation, the legislation included it.\n\n  In fact, the Commission has already endorsed the board created by \nthis bill. Commissioner Slade Gorton, a former Republican Senator from \nthe State of Washington, and a member of the 9/11 Commission, and \nRichard Ben-Veniste, a Democratic appointee to the Commission, told the \nHouse Government Reform Committee:\n\n       A civil liberties board of the kind we recommend can be \n     found in the Collins-Lieberman bill in the Senate.\n\n  Those were the words of two commissioners. If nothing else, it is a \nseal of approval of what we offer on the floor today.\n  I am not surprised that there is some opposition to the board, as \nthere is some opposition to other provisions in the bill. The board is \na new entity, and many of us are trying to understand exactly what it \nwould do. But I urge my colleagues to read carefully what we have \nachieved with this board. It is an integral part of intelligence \nreform. It is independent. Those who serve on the board will be \nnominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and have fixed \nterms.\n  In addition, there is a requirement for public reporting. So what the \nboard discovers will not be kept deep in some file or on some computer \nin an intelligence agency, but will be reported to the public through \nMembers of Congress and their committees.\n  The board will help to ensure that a powerful consolidated \nintelligence community does not violate privacy and civil liberties. I \nam afraid the Kyl amendment will upset this delicate balance. I want to \nspeak about three problems associated with that amendment.\n  Number one, very wisely, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman \nincluded in their bill a standard of review for the civil liberties \nboard. I think you need to give the board guidelines as they review \ngovernment actions. The board is to determine, under current language, \nwhether Government power actually materially enhances security, whether \nthere is adequate supervision of the use of the power to ensure \nprotection of civil liberties, and whether there are adequate \nguidelines and oversight to properly confine its use.\n  Where did we find this particular approach? We found it in the 9/11 \nCommission report.\n  Frankly, I cannot understand Senator Kyl's amendment on this issue. \nHe wants to take out the 9/11 Commission's standard of review. Should \nCongress not give this guidance to the board? Shouldn't the members of \nthe civil liberties board understand their charge and responsibility? \nCan it be stated more simply and clearly than in the language I just \nread from the 9/11 Commission report? Taking away the standard of \nreview is to leave the board with no guidance from Congress. That is an \nabdication of responsibility.\n  Secondly, the bill gives the board the authority to obtain the \ninformation they need to determine whether the Government is violating \ncivil liberties. If somebody outside the Government refuses to provide \ninformation, the board would have the power to issue a subpoena to \nobtain it.\n  That is common sense. An investigative body doesn't have much \nauthority in this society if it cannot, in compelling circumstances, \nsubpoena materials it needs.\n  It is not unusual to give this subpoena authority to a federal \ncommission or board. Let me name a few of the Federal agencies with \nsimilar authority: National Labor Relations Board, Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  The Senator from Arizona, in speaking to his amendment this morning, \nsuggested this subpoena authority would give the power to the board to \n``haul in any agent anywhere in the world and drill him.'' I am afraid \nthat statement is not accurate. The subpoena authority in this bill is \na narrow one. It only applies to people outside the Government. So for \nthe Senator from Arizona to argue that we are going to call in an \nintelligence agent before the board and drill him is to overlook the \nobvious: The subpoena authority in the bill only applies outside of the \nGovernment.\n\n  The obvious question is, why do you need subpoena authority outside \nof the Government? Here are two specific examples: First, the Abu \nGhraib prison scandal. Implicated in that scandal were private \ncontractors hired by our Government to interrogate prisoners. \nInformation they generated might be the domain and property of these \nprivate companies. If the civil liberties board wanted to look into \nprisoner abuse and the companies refused to provide that information \nvoluntarily, they would need a subpoena. That is why this subpoena \npower is in the bill.\n  In addition, if our Government engages in a cooperative agreement to \nobtain data from a private company to protect America from a terrorist \nattack, materials possessed by that private company would not be \nreviewable, except on a voluntary basis, by the civil liberties board, \nunless they had subpoena power. Senator Kyl wants to take away that \nsubpoena power. In doing that, he will tie the hands of this board when \nit comes to gathering the necessary information to meet its \nresponsibility.\n  The other thing the Kyl amendment addresses is the section of the \nbill entitled ``Informing the Public,'' which requires this civil \nliberties board to share information about its work with the public. \nThis is a good thing, from my point of view. It is a healthy aspect of \nthe bill. We make provisions so that if the Board is dealing with \nclassified information, there is no requirement to disclose it. \nOtherwise, we say the civil liberties board should inform the public \nabout their work.\n  So if the Government has gone too far, there is a public report that \ncould be reviewed to understand how the civil liberties board reached \nits conclusion.\n  The Kyl amendment would delete this section from the bill so that the \nboard would not be required to inform the public about its activities. \nThis directly contradicts the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nAs Commissioners Gordon and Ben-Veniste told the House Government \nReform Committee:\n\n       Such a board should be transparent, making regular reports \n     to Congress and the American public.\n\n  I think sunshine is a great disinfectant, and I think the fact that \nthis information will be made public is a further incentive for those \nin our Government not to abuse their power. In the name of protecting \nAmerica, they should not destroy America's values and America's \nfreedoms in a way that jeopardizes what is truly the character of this \nNation.\n  I think the Kyl amendment, in those three instances, not only \nviolates the spirit of the 9/11 Commission Report but directly violates \nlanguage in the 9/11 Commission Report that has guided this committee \nin the creation of this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment to another \nprovision in this bill that is near and dear to\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\nme. As I mentioned earlier, when we went through the lengthy hearings \non this legislation, there were many things that motivated us--this \ngreat Commission report on a bipartisan basis, the need to protect \nAmerica as effectively as possible and as quickly as possible--but \nthere was another factor.\n  At many of our hearings, in fact, even appearing as witnesses, were \nthe survivors in the 9/11 families, the men and women who lost a loved \none in the tragedy of 9/11. I want to take a moment and salute them. \nThey gave of their time and their lives. They made a commitment to make \ncertain that those they love did not die in vain. They came to this \ncommittee and asked us to do our part, and we did. I think this \ncommittee was faithful to its charge: to follow the 9/11 Commission and \nto come up with a reasonable change in reforming our intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Why is reform necessary? It almost goes without saying. We found in \nthe 9/11 Commission Report ample evidence that our intelligence \ncommunity failed us before September 11. In the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on which I serve, we took a review of the intelligence \nleading up to the invasion of Iraq. As hard as it is to believe, with \nthe millions of dollars and thousands of conscientious people involved, \nthe intelligence gathering before the invasion of Iraq was in many \nrespects just plain wrong.\n  The American people, and many Members of Congress, were convinced \nthat we needed to invade Iraq because of charges that there were \nweapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons programs, linkage with al-\nQaida--things that turned out to be patently wrong. The intelligence \nfailed us.\n  In one celebrated book, an author wrote that the head of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, in response to the President's question, Are you \nsure there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? is reported to have \nsaid: It's a slam dunk. He said with some certainty the weapons of mass \ndestruction were there. When we arrived, they could not be found.\n  We understand the gravity of the threat of terrorism. Those of us who \nremember 9/11 and understand the seriousness of this threat want to get \nit right, and intelligence is truly our first line of defense. But I \nhave to tell my colleagues that the 9/11 Commission Report kept \nreturning to one basic and recurring theme when it came to improving \nintelligence and making America safe.\n  Let me show my colleagues what they said because I think it \ndemonstrates in a few words why this section of the bill is so \nimportant to me and why I am glad it is part of our work effort.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report said:\n\n       The biggest impediment to all-source analysis--to a greater \n     likelihood of connecting the dots--is the human or \n     systemic resistance to sharing information.\n\n  And that turned out to be a major obstacle.\n  We have a weak system for processing and using the information that \nwe need to make America safe, and the Commission pointed that out. I \nhave said this before on the Senate floor, and it bears repeating, that \nthose who think our information technology was adequate to the task on \n9/11 should consider the following.\n  The computer system at the FBI, the premier law enforcement agency in \nAmerica on 9/11/2001, did not have e-mail within their system, had no \naccess to the Internet, was unable to sort and trace by more than a \none-word reference, and when they finally came up with the photographs \nof the 19 terrorists on September 11, the computer system of the FBI \nwas incapable of sending a photograph over its computer system. They \nhad to overnight the photographs to their regional offices.\n  That, to me, is as solid a condemnation of the computer system at the \nFBI as anything I read. That is a fact. And if you wonder why we failed \nto gather information, to process it, analyze it, and use it \neffectively, that is what it comes down to.\n  On July 10, 2001, an FBI agent in the Phoenix field office sent a \nmemo to FBI headquarters and to two agents on the international \nterrorism squads in the New York field office advising of the \n``possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden'' to send \nstudents to the United States to attend civil aviation schools. The \ndate of that memo is July 10, 2001. The agent based his theory on the \n``inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest'' \nattending such schools in Arizona.\n  The agent made four recommendations to the FBI. The agent recommended \nthat we compile a list of civil aviation schools, establish a liaison \nwith those schools, discuss the theories about bin Laden with the \nintelligence community, and seek authority to obtain visa information \non persons applying to flight schools. This was July 10, 2001. Those \nwere the recommendations in the FBI memo.\n  The flare went off. The notice was there. Something needed to be \ndone. His memo was forwarded to one field office. Managers of the bin \nLaden unit and the radical fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters were \naddressees but did not even see the memo until after September 11. No \nmanagers at headquarters saw the memo before September 11. The New York \nfield office took no action. It was not shared outside the FBI.\n  As its author told the 9/11 Commission, the Phoenix memo was not an \nalert about suicide pilots. His worry was more about a Pan Am 103 \nscenario in which explosives were placed on aircraft. Because it was \nnot shared, because it was not processed, we find ourselves in \nsituations more vulnerable.\n  Mr. President, let me give another illustration of why this \ninformation sharing is so important.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report tells us that on August 15, 2001, the \nMinneapolis FBI field office initiated an intelligence investigation of \nZacarias Moussaoui, a name well known to us now. This man entered the \ncountry on February 23, 2001, began flight lessons at a flight school \nin Oklahoma City, and began flight training at Pan American flight \ntraining school in Minneapolis on August 13. Mr. Moussaoui had none of \nthe usual qualifications for flight training on Pan Am's Boeing 747 \nflight simulators.\n  Contrary to popular belief, he did not say he was not interested in \nlearning how to take off or land. Instead, he stood out because, with \nlittle knowledge of flying, he wanted to learn how to take off and land \na Boeing 747. The FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with \nthe INS representative on the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force \nsuspected Moussaoui of wanting to hijack airplanes. This is August 15, \n2001.\n  If these respective agencies had the benefit of the Phoenix memo, \nbrought it together with this information about Mr. Moussaoui, wheels \nwould have started to turn and dots would have been connected. But, \nsadly, that information was not shared.\n  I can go through other illustrations about why we need to share \ninformation when it comes to ships coming into the United States using \nthe Great Lakes, which are near and dear to me as a Senator \nrepresenting the great State of Illinois, and the city of Chicago, and \nhow we can use existing information technology to link up facts and \ndraw good conclusions to protect America.\n  Sadly, what we have found, despite the passage of 3 years since 9/11, \nis we still have not figured out how to make critical information in \nour Government computers and other systems of records compatible and \ncombat terrorism with that new information.\n  In a statement before the House Government Reform Committee last \nmonth, James Dempsey, executive director for the Center for Democracy \nand Technology, a nonprofit public interest group, validated my \nconcern. He wrote:\n\n       To date, however, the government still does not have a \n     dynamic, decentralized network for sharing and analysis of \n     information.\n\n  He goes on with a much longer statement, but to think that 3 years \nafter 9/11, after the omissions, errors, and shortcomings which I have \npointed out, we still do not have a dynamic decentralized method for \nsharing and analyzing information, which is one of the key elements in \nthe 9/11 Commission Report.\n  A case in point I frequently cite is the chronic delays in \nintegrating FBI and Border Patrol fingerprint databases. This problem \ngoes back at least 6 years, where the agencies have been unable to work \nout the transfer of information. In March of this year, the\n\n[[Page S10024]]\n\nJustice Department's Inspector General reported it will take at least 4 \nmore years to combine fingerprint systems. In other words, fingerprints \ncollected at the border cannot be checked against fingerprints at the \nFBI in an integrated fashion so that a suspect at the border can be \nfound to have been someone with a criminal record or a history which \ngives us caution and pause. How can we be any safer if that basic \ntechnology cannot be in place? Six years we failed to come up with it. \nThe estimate is another 4 years is needed before it might happen.\n  The FBI fingerprint database contains about 43 million ten-finger \nsets of known criminals' prints; the Border Patrol's separate \nfingerprint system, about 6 million two-finger sets of prints. One has \nto ask, at some point in time, did anyone think that both agencies \nshould collect the same number of fingerprints from each person? Today \nit is much different. They did not integrate their effort because they \nwere not going to integrate their information. Not integrating that \ninformation does not make us any safer.\n  For well over 2 years I have urged that we do something significant \nand historic to address this failure of our information-sharing system. \nI refer back to GEN Leslie Groves, who was authorized and empowered by \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor to start what was then \nknown as the Manhattan Project.\n  General Groves understood the possibilities of an atom bomb. At that \npoint, there had been a cursory and casual inquiry into how it might be \nweaponized. After Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt said: We need to \nget serious. We need to develop these atom bombs. He said to General \nGroves: Turn to the private sector, turn to Government, turn to \nacademia, bring them all together, and do it in a hurry. We may need \nthis atom bomb to end this war.\n  That is how the Manhattan Project was born. I have argued for quite \nsome time now that if General Groves could accomplish that historic \ntask in 1,000 days, we can in even less time see dramatic progress in \ndeveloping the information technology we need as a Nation. I am sad to \nremind my colleagues in the Senate, it has been over 1,000 days since \nSeptember 11, and reports from agencies across the board tell us we \nhave not done that.\n  The Commission offers two key recommendations for achieving this \nunity of effort in sharing information. First, information procedures \nshould provide incentives for sharing to restore a better balance \nbetween security and shared knowledge. Second, the President should \nlead the Governmentwide effort to bring the major national security \ninstitutions into the information revolution.\n  This is from the 9/11 Commission Report:\n\n       He should coordinate the resolution of the legal, policy \n     and technical issues across the agencies to create a \n     ``trusted information network.''\n\n  We understand that without this sharing of information we cannot be \nsafer as a nation. No agency can do this alone. They have to cooperate \nwith one another. Throughout the eight hearings of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee conducted over the past 9 weeks, I have urged that we \nmake revolutionary change in information sharing an essential element.\n  I will tell my colleagues what section 206 of this bill, which \ncomprises a large portion of the bill, does. We set forth precise and \nprudent directives for implementing a trusted information-sharing \nnetwork. The President is directed to establish this network. The \nnetwork is to be an environment consisting of policies and technology \ndesigned to facilitate and promote sharing. It is modeled on the \ncomprehensive proposal by the Markle Foundation Task Force on National \nSecurity in the Information Age, which I would like to salute as \nanother major factor in the development of this section of the bill, as \nwell as the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  The network must have certain attributes. This network of information \nmust be a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated environment; \nbuilt upon existing systems' capabilities currently in use across the \nGovernment; utilize the industry's best practices, including minimizing \nthe centralization of data and seeking to use common tools and \ncapabilities whenever possible. I want to dwell on this for one moment.\n  Some of the critics have the wrong notion that we are trying to \ncreate a massive Government database. That is not what this bill sets \nout to do. What it sets out to do is to share the information to solve \nproblems, to alert America to threats to our security. It is not a \nmassive Government database.\n  Employ an information access management approach that controls access \nto data rather than just networks; facilitate sharing of information; \nprovide directory services for locating information; and incorporate \nprotections for privacy and civil liberties. This is another one that \nis absolutely essential. We want to have this information collected, \nprocessed, analyzed, and shared every step of the way.\n  Through the civil liberties board and express language in this \nlegislation, we are mindful that we do not want to compromise the \nliberties and freedoms of Americans unless there is an absolute need to \nprotect our lives and our security.\n  Guidelines must be issued. Requirements satisfying governing the \ncollection, sharing, and use of information have to be made known so \nthat this will be an item that is followed very closely.\n  Let me say what the network is not. Describing what the network is is \nonly half of the issue. First and foremost, the network called for in \nthis bill is not a centralized, consolidated system or database. \nFurthermore, it is not a mere network; it is a capability. It does not \nmove data from current systems. It does not require all new systems. It \nis a means to make information in existing legacy systems sharable to \nauthorized users. It is not based on any one architecture or platform. \nIt does not require one encryption standard. It does not contemplate or \nrequire broad distribution of personally identifiable information. It \ndoes not remove authorization and access control from existing \nprocesses. It is not limited to supporting just the IC. It does not \nrequire next-generation technology to implement.\n  I see other Members have come to the floor of the Senate to address \naspect of this bill, and I have spoken for a little over 30 minutes. I \nwant to give them a chance to express their feelings. I will return to \nthis issue next week.\n  I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will understand that \nthis historic bill includes in it what I consider to be some of the \nmost important weapons and important tools for protecting America \nagainst another terrorist attack. We have to be creative, which the 9/\n11 Commission Report admonishes us to do, but we also have to use \ninformation in sensible, thoughtful ways to make us safer.\n  A large section of this bill is directed towards that information \nsharing. I tried to engage the Senate in this debate when we created \nthe Department of Homeland Security, but the time was not right. \nEverybody nodded in agreement, but I could not get anything done on the \nbill. Thank goodness this bill on the future of the intelligence \ncommunity is different, and thank goodness on a bipartisan basis we \nhave come to understand and believe that if we follow the 9/11 \nCommission Report, with trusted information sharing, America will be \nsafer.\n  I thank Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman for providing this \nsection in the bill. I look forward to working with them on the passage \nof this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \nadditional illustration on information sharing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Illustration No. 3 Ship in U.S. Waters\n\n       Of course, representing Chicago and Lake Michigan, I \n     understand the importance of port security. Take a ship \n     entering the U.S. waters that comes down the St. Lawrence \n     Seaway. It comes into the Great Lakes.\n       What happens? Four agencies of the Federal Government \n     collect information on that ship. One agency determines \n     whether the ship is carrying contraband. Another Federal \n     agency checks whether the ship has paid its tariffs and fees. \n     Another agency determines whether the ship and its crew \n     comply with immigration law. And another agency checks for \n     adherence to health and safety regulations. One ship, four \n     different Federal agencies.\n       Much of this information will end up in separate data \n     systems. One of those, a $1.3\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\n     billion Customs Services project known as the automated \n     commercial environment, is an import processing system. \n     Another, the student exchange and visitor information system, \n     is being developed by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement within Homeland Security. Other border protection \n     is held on databases held by the Coast Guard and by the \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       The Transportation Security Administration also will \n     collect and hold relevant information in its systems. \n     Consider how many different agencies are concerned about the \n     one ship that we might fear may be bringing the wrong people \n     with the wrong cargo to threaten the United States.\n       None of these information systems are designed to \n     communicate with one another. How in the world can we assure \n     the American people of their safety when we are ignoring the \n     most basic requirement--that these agencies--both people and \n     technology--work together and share information? Don't we \n     want to make certain that the FBI and the CIA had access to \n     that information? In addition, the NSA, DoD, Department of \n     Defense, State Department, State and local officials, all of \n     them could benefit by having access to that information.\n       Observation: The information sharing environment of the \n     Network would facilitate full and timely information access \n     and exchange of the disparate information housed in each of \n     the data systems. The Network would allow information to \n     remain where it is created, but using standards, guidelines, \n     and rules to be developed, make it share-able and accessible \n     to authorized Network participants.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nterrific contributions to this bill. He was the individual who brought \nto the committee's attention the woefully deficient information systems \nthat have hindered the war against terrorism.\n  I remember how shocked I was at our first hearing, when the Senator \nfrom Illinois described the FBI being unable to transmit pictures of \nthe 9/11 terrorists to its field offices. He also told us the FBI did \nnot have the capacity to transmit fingerprints to the Border Patrol. \nThose underscored, in a way that few have been able to do, the lack of \nan adequate, integrated communications network within the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We worked very closely with the Senator from Illinois on this section \nof the bill. It incorporates his thoughts, his language, and it is his \nleadership that is behind those important provisions. So I salute him \nfor being out in front on this issue and helping us come up with \nprovisions that I think are going to make a real difference.\n  I salute and thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, even I want to thank the Senator from \nIllinois, a dear friend, a great colleague. He has made a very \nsubstantial contribution to this bill.\n  Senator Durbin has a quality of service in the Senate that I have \nnoted in some of the best colleagues with whom I have had the honor to \nserve. He thinks about matters, focuses on a problem, comes up with a \nsolution, and he doesn't let it go until he gets it done. He saw a real \nproblem here which others have seen but, frankly, have not focused on \nor grabbed ahold of as much, which is the woeful, outrageous, \ninfuriating inability, up until this time, of our Government to put the \nbest information technology at the disposal of those who are working to \nprotect us.\n  The terrorists have figured this out. We all know about the \nopportunities for cyberterrorism. If you look at the number of hits \nthat are made on even Defense Department sites, you can see the \npotential. We are beginning to have a very good capacity to launch our \nown offensives here, but this is about something else. This is just \ntaking information, which is a key to protecting ourselves in the age \nof terrorism, and moving it quickly to the places it can do the most \ngood. Talk about connecting the dots.\n  Anyway, Senator Durbin is really singlehandedly responsible for this \nsubstantial title of the bill. I thank him very much for his \ncontribution. It is part of why this bill is going to make a real \ndifference in protecting the security of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3823\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I know Senator Conrad is waiting to have a colloquy with \nthe managers of the bill. I do have an amendment that I think I can \ndispose of very quickly. I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside. On behalf of Senator Voinovich, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Collins), for Mr. Voinovich, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3823.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the financial disclosure process under the Ethics \n                       in Government Act of 1978)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND RECORDS.\n\n       (a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Office of Government Ethics shall \n     submit to Congress a report--\n       (1) evaluating the financial disclosure process for \n     employees of the executive branch of Government; and\n       (2) making recommendations for improving that process.\n       (b) Transmittal of Record Relating to Presidentially \n     Appointed Positions to Presidential Candidates.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this section, the term ``major party'' \n     has the meaning given that term under section 9002(6) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) Transmittal.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 15 days after the date on \n     which a major party nominates a candidate for President, the \n     Office of Personnel Management shall transmit an electronic \n     record to that candidate on Presidentially appointed \n     positions.\n       (B) Other candidates.--After making transmittals under \n     subparagraph (A), the Office of Personnel Management may \n     transmit an electronic record on Presidentially appointed \n     positions to any other candidate for President.\n       (3) Content.--The record transmitted under this subsection \n     shall provide--\n       (A) all positions which are appointed by the President, \n     including the title and description of the duties of each \n     position;\n       (B) the name of each person holding a position described \n     under subparagraph (A);\n       (C) any vacancy in the positions described under \n     subparagraph (A), and the period of time any such position \n     has been vacant;\n       (D) the date on which an appointment made after the \n     applicable Presidential election for any position described \n     under subparagraph (A) is necessary to ensure effective \n     operation of the Government; and\n       (E) any other information that the Office of Personnel \n     Management determines is useful in making appointments.\n       (c) Reduction of Positions Requiring Appointment With \n     Senate Confirmation.--\n       (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``agency'' \n     means an Executive agency as defined under section 105 of \n     title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Reduction plan.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the head of each agency shall submit a \n     Presidential appointment reduction plan to--\n       (i) the President;\n       (ii) the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate; \n     and\n       (iii) the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (B) Content.--The plan under this paragraph shall provide \n     for the reduction of--\n       (i) the number of positions within that agency that require \n     an appointment by the President, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate; and\n       (ii) the number of levels of such positions within that \n     agency.\n       (d) Office of Government Ethics Review of Conflict of \n     Interest Law.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Government Ethics, in consultation with the Attorney General \n     of the United States, shall conduct a comprehensive review of \n     conflict of interest laws relating to Federal employment and \n     submit a report to--\n       (A) the President;\n       (B) the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (D) the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (E) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Content.--The report under this subsection shall--\n       (A) examine all Federal criminal conflict of interest laws \n     relating to Federal employment, including the relevant \n     provisions of chapter 11 of title 18, United States Code; and\n       (B) related civil conflict of interest laws, including \n     regulations promulgated under\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\n     section 402 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \n     App.).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has a great \ninterest in the issue that we are about to briefly discuss. The \namendment of Senator Voinovich would require the Office of Government \nEthics to report to Congress on recommendations for streamlining the \nfinancial disclosure forms for the executive branch. In addition, the \namendment would require each executive branch agency to examine the \nnumber of positions requiring Senate confirmation. It would ask the \nOffice of Government Ethics to conduct a comprehensive review of the \nGovernment's conflict of interest laws, and it would require the Office \nof Personnel Management to provide Presidential candidates with a list \nof all appointed positions within 15 days of their party's nomination. \nThis amendment is based on legislation that was favorably reported by \nthe committee during the last Congress.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended that the Senate should not require \nconfirmation of appointees within the national security team below \nlevel 3 of the executive schedule. The Voinovich amendment lays the \ngroundwork for this recommendation by requiring the executive branch to \nidentify which positions could be eliminated from the confirmation \nprocess.\n  Review of that information by all Senate committees will help those \nof us in the Senate make a more informed and thoughtful decision on \nreducing specific positions that now require confirmation.\n  The financial disclosure requirements have been in effect for almost \n25 years. Unfortunately, in some cases, they have deterred very good \npeople from serving in the Federal Government. I hope this will lead to \nmore effective, more efficient, and simpler requirements so it no \nlonger will deter potential nominees from serving, or force them to go \nthrough great expense in order to comply with overly burdensome laws \nand regulations.\n  Again, this proposal is very consistent with the recommendations made \nby the 9/11 Commission and I urge acceptance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of \nour committee in urging acceptance of this amendment. I thank Senator \nVoinovich and the occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, for their work on this issue.\n  This is a topic we have been talking about in the Congress for a long \ntime. The occupant of the chair, having been vetted, considered, and \nconfirmed for a Cabinet position in the past, knows the difficulties he \nand others have faced in fulfilling all those obligations, well beyond \nwhat most would deem to be reasonable.\n  What motivates this now is an extra dimension of concern. The \nSeptember 11 Commission made it very clear that a catastrophic attack \nmight well be more likely to occur during the transition from one \nadministration to the other. Therefore, the Commission recommended that \nwe should do anything we could reasonably think of that would speed up \nthe process of filling national security positions in our Government.\n  Earlier today, I am pleased to say, the Senate adopted an amendment \nthat Senator McCain and I and others introduced to accomplish some of \nthose specific recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. This amendment \nbuilds on that, goes beyond it, and makes the bill stronger by helping \nan incoming administration fill a wide range of its appointive \npositions more promptly, in some cases, doing what is just plain \nlogical: requiring the OPM, Office of Personnel Management, to send \ninformation to Presidential candidates 15 days after they are \nnominated; describing positions that must be filled in the new \nadministration. This would not only allow time to prepare it, it would \ncreate a sense of optimism and fantasy in the minds of candidates \nnominated as to what they would do when they were elected. The \namendment also calls for reports that will help us and the President to \nconsider ways to further improve and streamline the process of getting \nofficials appointed and put into place.\n  It is a very good amendment. It builds on some substantial \ncontributions Senator Voinovich made to the bill in committee. I am \npleased to urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no further debate, without objection the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3823) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask a number of \nquestions of my colleagues who are managing the bill. I have very high \nregard for the chairperson, Senator Collins. I have worked with her on \nother matters and found that she is an extremely able and diligent \nMember. I admire the way she has handled this legislation. I have \nwatched the process as it went through the committee. I am not on the \ncommittee but I watched as it was being televised. I thought it was a \nvery professional process.\n  I also have very high regard for the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman. I am not on the relevant committees. I am not on the \nIntelligence Committee. I am not on the Defense Committee. I am on the \nBudget Committee and the Finance Committee and deal with these issues \nfrom a budget point of view and financing point of view.\n  With that said, I come to the floor to ask a series of questions. I \nwant to indicate that I have with me charts that were prepared by the \noffice of Senator Lieberman to talk about what the structure currently \nis and what this legislation would do to change it and to raise a \nnumber of concerns that I have about that change.\n  First, I think we should indicate the problem we are confronting with \nthe American intelligence community, where there is a lack of \ncoordination and communication, which has been clearly outlined in a \nseries of hearings and a series of reports, including the report by the \n9/11 Commission, including the report by the Intelligence Committee, \nincluding the work of the very able chairman, the Senator from Maine, \nall that has been laid across the record very clearly.\n  This chart from the office of Senator Lieberman shows the \norganization of the intelligence community as it is, with the President \nand the National Security Council overseeing the various agencies of \nGovernment, including the Director of Central Intelligence, the \nSecretary of Defense, but has within it the National Security Agency, \nthe National Geospacial-Intelligence Agency, the National \nReconnaissance Office, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the \nMilitary Services and Combatant Commands. The large majority of the \nfunding of the intelligence community is in the Department of Defense.\n  I think maybe that is too little understood by the general public. \nBut that is fact. The large majority of the funding is not at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. I think people in the United States \nprobably assume that is the case; it is not. The vast majority of the \nfunding for intelligence operations is within the Department of \nDefense.\n  Other agencies that have a significant role, of course, are the \nAttorney General's office, because he oversees the FBI, and the FBI has \nresponsibility for intelligence operations within the United States.\n  Then we have the Secretary of Homeland Security within which we have \nthe Information, Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Director and \nthe Coast Guard intelligence. The Secretary of State has the Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research, and the Secretary of Treasury has an \nintelligence branch, as does the Secretary of Energy.\n  The problem with this structure, which has been pointed out \nrepeatedly, is that these are a series of stovepipes, basically leading \nonly to the White House. There is nobody that is in overall \ncoordination and direction of these various intelligence agencies. And \nthe idea has been to have a national intelligence director that would \nhave responsibility to coordinate and communicate with respect to these \nvarious agencies.\n  So the proposal before us is to create a national intelligence \ndirector with these other various agencies already\n\n[[Page S10027]]\n\nexisting reporting to the national intelligence director, so there is \nsomeone in a position to coordinate and ultimately communicate what \nintelligence agencies are finding.\n\n  Let me just say that I thought that what was going to happen with the \nnational intelligence director is that funds were going to be brought \ntogether and we would not have the continuing existence of all of these \nother agencies.\n  That is really what I want to ask the managers about. The concern \nthat I have is if we have a failure of communication and coordination, \nespecially between the FBI and the CIA, how does adding another entity, \nhow does adding another player improve the chances for coordination and \ncommunication?\n  Let me say that I was trained in business management. My career \nbefore I came here was to manage organizations. My experience has been \nthe more layers, the less communication, the more inefficient the \ncommunication.\n  When this was first outlined and I found out that the CIA is still \ngoing to exist, I must say I was taken aback. I was surprised by that. \nI thought the Central Intelligence Agency would become the new \nintelligence, with a new national intelligence director. Therefore, we \nwouldn't be adding another player to the mix, but we would be putting \nsomebody in a position of authority so that we could hold them \naccountable.\n  The concern I have is instead of that, we have maintained a Central \nIntelligence Agency and all of the other intelligence agencies we had \nbefore, and added a national intelligence director.\n  The fundamental concern I have and the question I have is, Why has \nthe committee concluded that this is the right way to proceed? Why \nwouldn't it be better by joining the function, reducing the number of \nplayers, reducing the number of boxes on the organizational chart, \ninstead of adding a layer?\n  I would be quick to say I think you need to have a national \nintelligence director, somebody who is in overall coordination and \ncontrol because before we did not have that.\n  That is really the question I came to the floor this afternoon to \nquery the chairman and ranking member about.\n  I would be happy to yield so they might respond.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his questions. I want to assure him, first, there will be no rental \ncharges for the charts that were a joint product of Senator Collins's \nand my office.\n  To very briefly give the background, most immediately from the 9/11 \nCommission Report, when we said here repeatedly, and Lee Hamilton said \nduring the course of our hearings during the investigation about how 9/\n11 happened, the Commissioners very often would say, Who is in charge? \nThe answer more often than not was: No one. They concluded it was an \norganization without a head. That explained why the CIA would have \ninformation and not share it with the Immigration and Naturalization \nService about people they would want to keep out of the country, or the \nFBI would have information and not share it with the CIA.\n  The result was we are athletes--a homelier analogy--that the American \nintelligence community is like a football team with a lot of very good \nplayers but no quarterback. So they are kind of doing their own thing; \nsome of them sometimes seem to be in another stadium and we are not \ngetting the benefit of the billions of dollars that we are investing.\n  The Commission recommended that we put someone in charge as a \nnational intelligence director.\n  Right now, the President is at the top on the chart. The President \ncan't exercise day-to-day control over the intelligence community.\n  Incidentally, this was the report of the 9/11 Commission. Most \nimmediately, it was essentially the recommendation of the Joint \nIntelligence Committee of the Congress, and in the recent past created \na national intelligence director. The Scowcroft report--though we have \nnot seen it--everybody knows that it says there has to be a national \nintelligence director. In fact, these recommendations go way back to \n1947 when the National Security Act was passed post-Second World War \nand the CIA was officially created. Here is part of the problem. This \nis part of what I want to answer about the question.\n  Part of the problem that all of these groups found was that the \nDirector of Central Intelligence--as that position exists today, which \nwas the same person as the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency--effectively became only the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. That is part of why nobody was really directly \noverhead.\n  As we can see in the first chart, the director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency is over the CIA. The major recommendation was we \nhave to separate those two, have a separate CIA Director, and then the \nnational intelligence director who will be over all those stovepipes.\n  How will he or she break them up? Two things. First, and this goes on \nfrom Colin Powell and others, we said the existing DCI was supposed to \noversee the whole intelligence operation. We gave them some power but \ndid not get them budget power. As my friend from North Dakota said, 80 \npercent of the budget for intelligence goes through the Department of \nDefense.\n  In an episode that Senator Collins and I were struck by in the 9/11 \nreport, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, in 1998, after a \nseries of al-Qaida attacks, sends out a directive--then classified, now \npublic--to the agencies under him and says, war has been declared \nagainst us by these terrorists: They hit the World Trade Center in 1993 \nwith the bomb, they went after the embassies in Africa, et cetera. This \nis a declaration of war by us and the American intelligence community \nagainst al-Qaida, a war on terrorism. And no one responded. No one did \nanything because he is a general without authority.\n  It is the old biblical line, at the sound of the trumpet, be \nuncertain who will follow into battle and, unfortunately, here, one of \nthe elements of a certain trumpet in the Washington bureaucracy is \nmoney, budget authority. So no one did anything.\n  When the Commission asked one of the heads of the boxes on the chart, \nWhy didn't you respond to George Tenet, he said, We didn't think we had \nto; we thought that was a memo.\n  Separate CIA from the Director so he is not responsible only for that \nagency but everyone in the community, with the budget authority to \nenforce decisions, with transfer authority for personnel within the \nintelligence community and, one of the most important, form the budget. \nDo not let other agencies do it. Actually do the budget.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is one of the Senate's experts on \nbudgeting, one who worries most about whether we are getting taxpayers \ntheir money's worth. Billions of dollars--it is a classified number, so \nI cannot state it--but billions go into intelligence every year.\n  One of my hopes, because we do not talk about it much, we talk about \nconnecting the dot, the national intelligence director will, one, be a \ntough budget official; two, make sure we get our money's worth; and \nthird, more budget authority and oversight over the constituents. And, \ntoo, maybe decide this box under me is getting more money in terms of \nthe current threat to America than it should, but this one is not \ngetting enough; I have to move this money around.\n  One more point. A critical element under the national intelligence \ndirector to help him or her connect the dots is the National \nCounterterrorist Center. The other centers he can create for separate \nproblems such as nuclear proliferation or separate geographic public \nareas like Iran and North Korea. This is the place where he will bring \ntogether as never before all the constituent parts of the intelligence \ncommunity. They will sit down. He can transfer people to those centers. \nHe can give them assignments. Most of all, he can make sure they will \npool their collection of intelligence, their analysis of intelligence \nand, very importantly, since they are around the table--they are \ntalking with one another, they see the problem, they have an idea from \nthe best intelligence, signal intelligence, imagery from the satellites \nwe have, human intelligence from people on the ground--they will do \nsome joint operational planning as to how to deal with the problem. How \ndo we get bin Laden? Or if there is a terrorist cell in America, what \nis the best way to pool our resources to get them? We put somebody in \ncharge and we give them real authority.\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\n  Incidentally, there will be amendments introduced, or already have \nbeen, that will come to a vote in the next 2 or 3 days aimed at cutting \naway at that power. I say, with all respect, probably folks worried \nabout the Department of Defense losing some authority--Senator Collins \nand I are both on the Armed Services Committee. We have a deep \ncommitment to the warfighters. We are confident this structure will \nactually give better intelligence to the warfighters.\n  That is my answer to your question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I ask a followup question, because the Senator \nreferenced these earlier reports going all the way back from 50 years \nago. I fully support the concept of a national intelligence director. \nMy concern is how we are implementing it. Did the earlier reports, \nincluding the most recent from the Intelligence Committees, from the 9/\n11 Commission, contemplate with the creation of a national intelligence \ndirector we would still have a Central Intelligence Agency?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. They did. Interesting question. As a matter of fact, \nthis was a real priority for the 9/11 Commission, that we separate the \nCIA from the national intelligence director. The point is that the CIA \nis only one element of the remarkable assets we have in our \nintelligence community, including the so-called signal intelligence, \nthe imagery from the satellites we have, the work coordinating domestic \nand foreign. Because the terrorists do not separate between domestic \nand foreign, now for the FBI it is made statutory under the bill \ncreating a new directorate of intelligence, counterterrorism, working \nwith the CIA under the national intelligence director. So the answer is \nyes.\n  In fact, my understanding of the original proposal for the National \nSecurity Act post-World War II was there be a separate national \nintelligence director overlooking a whole community and a separate CIA. \nFolks in the military community were able to blend the two and \ndiminish--here in Congress we were worried about this--and diminish and \nseparate the power of the DCI. We look back now, and the 9/11 \nCommission certainly did, and say that was part of the problem. They \ncreated the vulnerabilities and weaknesses and openings the terrorists \ntook advantage of on September 11.\n  Mr. CONRAD. One additional question, if I could, on the budget \nauthority inherent in this plan. I indicated the vast majority of \nresources actually go to the Department of Defense and the various \nintelligence operations within the Department of Defense. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut indicated it was as much as 80 percent.\n  In terms of management of an operation, are we going to be left with \na circumstance in which 80 percent of the funding is at the Department \nof Defense? And if so, how do we avoid a circumstance in which the tail \nis wagging the dog? That is, typically one finds in organizations that \ninitiative and power follows money. If there is at the top a relatively \nweak national intelligence director, with most of the functions and \nresources in a subordinate agency, that creates its own management \nchallenges.\n\n  I am interested to know what the concept is with respect to budget \nauthority. Who will have that overall authority over resources?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He is \nabsolutely right in his statement.\n  We heard from witness after witness in our committee's deliberations \nin August and into September that probably worse than the status quo--\nwhich is bad, without leadership--would be to create a national \nintelligence director and not give him the power to direct. This may be \nan old quote my friend is familiar with, but former CIA Director Jim \nWoolsey said: In Washington, there is a different definition of the \ngolden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.\n  We are making sure the national intelligence director has the gold, \nwhich is to say the budget authority, both to formulate the budget for \nthis entire community of national intelligence--the so-called tactical \nmilitary intelligence budget--that stays with the Department of \nDefense.\n  But while I cannot say the specific percentage, I will tell you under \nour proposal--again this is classified, but well over 50 percent of the \nbudget authority will now go from the Department of Defense to the \nnational intelligence director. So that position will have that budget \nauthority in two ways. The first is to formulate the budget. Again, \nthis is a very important colloquy because we are going to see some \namendments that are intended to reduce the authority of the national \nintelligence director over budget to say he basically has to accept the \nbudget proposals of the constituent agencies. That is not so in our \nbill.\n  The second very important point: Right now the budget for the \nintelligence agencies goes to the Department of Defense. Even for the \nCIA it goes to the Department of Defense, then to the CIA. In our \nproposal, the money goes to the national intelligence director and then \nthat position parcels it out to the others.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I just conclude on that point, and then I am \nfinished. I know there are other Senators waiting. I waited to have \nthis opportunity because I think this is very important. These are \nquestions I am getting.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In my position on the Budget Committee, people are asking \nme, how is this money going to be controlled? People are given \nresponsibility. Do they have authority?\n  The final question I have with respect to the Department of Defense \nis, we heard the other day from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary \nRumsfeld, who has a very strong management background. He expressed \ngreat concern, and I think it is a concern that absolutely deserves \nfull consideration. His great concern, as I heard it the other day in \nour briefing, was that he is going to have a separation of \nresponsibility from authority; that is, resources that are currently \nunder his control and direction are going to move up the line to the \nnational intelligence director. He and the warfighters have a \nfundamental responsibility and need for intelligence. He is concerned, \nwith the separation of these resources--as the Senator describes, much \nof the budget moving from the Department of Defense level up to the \nnational intelligence director--that he not be shortchanged and that \nhis combatant commanders not be shortchanged of the resources they need \nto make tactical and strategic decisions.\n  This is my final question: What is the response of the leadership of \nthe committee to his concerns?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I will begin, and if the Senator from Maine wants to \nget into this, I would welcome her doing so.\n  First, I would say, again, Senator Collins and I are members of the \nArmed Services Committee of the Senate. If we felt there was the \nremotest possibility this proposal of ours would shortchange the \nwarfighters, we would not make it. And believe me, it does not.\n  A couple things to say: First, we make a distinction in this bill \nbetween the tactical military budget on one hand and the national \nintelligence budget on the other. The tactical military budget--\nintelligence officials who are working for individual services; Army, \nNavy, combatant commanders working on joint programs within the \nmilitary for more than one service--that money all stays with the \nDepartment of Defense. But the national intelligence assets, which are \nused, let's say, for satellites--which are clearly used by the military \nbut also provide information that is critically important for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security or the State Department in advising the \nPresident on critical foreign policy decisions--that is under the \nnational intelligence director, as it should be.\n\n  The fact is, a lot of this is worked out in a consulting, consensus \nway. But we want to just raise that national interest here. The \nmilitary will always be a priority customer of the intelligence \ncommunity, but it is not the only customer. The President of the United \nStates is the most important recipient of intelligence. The Secretary \nof State is very important; now the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I believe we have struck exactly a balance here in making sure the \nwarfighter is well supported. We had very interesting testimony, which \nI can share with my friend, from two generals who are heads of two of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nconstituent national intelligence agencies. They said to us they \nbelieve this proposal establishing a national intelligence director \nwould be an improvement and be an improvement from the point of view of \ntheir agencies because it ended the ambiguity that exists now which \nthey think is not good for their agencies and ultimately not good for \nthe military.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Maine wants to get into this and answer \nsome of the very good questions my friend from North Dakota has asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for the thought he has given to this issue. I know he has \na great interest in management structures, in making sure we have the \nmost efficient structure possible to serve the taxpayers. So I very \nmuch appreciate the spirit with which he has raised these questions.\n  I want to make three concluding points to emphasize some of the \npoints already made by my colleague from Connecticut.\n  First, it was evident as we studied this issue and read the 9/11 \nCommission Report that the current system does not foster the kind of \ncommunication and cooperation we desperately need. It is a series of \nstovepipes with no one having the ability to make the final decisions, \nto resolve conflicts, to move resources and people where they are most \nneeded. You cannot go to the President of the United States on \neverything.\n  I have seen that firsthand in the staffing of the Terrorist Threat \nIntegration Center where the Director feels he needs more resources, \nother decisions have been made by various agency heads, and there is no \none to step in and set the priorities, move the people, and direct the \nresources. I think our bill really changes that.\n  Like Senator Lieberman, I was struck by Director Tenet's 12/98 memo \nin which he does this call to be at war and that all resources should \nbe marshaled, and virtually nothing happened. That will change under \nour structure. There will be accountability under our structure because \npeople will know who is in charge and whose call it is, and that is the \nnational intelligence director. Our organization \nenhances accountability, cooperation, coordination, communication, and, \nmost of all, results.\n\n  Second, the 9/11 Commission considered doing the kind of structure \nyou have raised questions about. Essentially, that would be creating a \ndepartment of intelligence. You would take all of these units out of \nthe other agencies and do a brandnew department. And it felt--and I \nagree--that would be too disruptive, particularly at a time when we are \nat war; that it would be expensive, it would be complicated, it would \ntake a long time to put into effect.\n  We have seen that with the Department of Homeland Security. That has \nbeen a massive undertaking. I am very proud of the leadership of \nSecretary Ridge and Admiral Loy, but it has not been without its \ngrowing pains. We just could not afford that kind of disruption right \nnow.\n  Third would be the reaction of DOD if we took all of those entities \nout and put them in a new department. There was testimony of a former \nhead of the Defense Intelligence Agency at a hearing on the House side \nin August. He said if you pulled those agencies, like the National \nSecurity Agency, the DIA, the NGA, the NRO--those that serve DOD and \nother consumers--if you pulled them out, you would see DOD re-creating \nwithin the Department new entities to replace those if you severed that \nlink and transferred them. To quote William Odom, ``You're just going \nto end up with a big mess'' if you do that. That is why we came up with \nthis structure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The last reference of winding up ``with a big mess,'' \nwhose quote is that?\n  Ms. COLLINS. William Odom, who is a former head of DIA. So we felt \nthe case was very persuasive for the kind of organizational structure \nwe came up with. That was recommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n  Having said that, I am sure it is not perfect. I am sure we are going \nto learn from it. That is why we have reports required back to Congress \nafter a year's time and by the General Accounting Office Accountability \nOffice in 2 year's time, because we want to make sure we get this \nright.\n  I think we have struck the right balance in the organizational \nstructure we propose.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me conclude on this note: The thing I am most \nconcerned about is having an entirely separate Central Intelligence \nAgency and an office of national intelligence director. The thing that \nI have a difficult time understanding is how that is not going to \ncreate its own turf battles, its own communications problems. I hope I \nam proved wrong by this, but it is the one thing I looked at and I was \nsurprised by and, I must say, I wondered about.\n  I read the reports on the difficulties we had with the coordination \nbetween the CIA and the FBI and their turf battles and their \nunwillingness to share information. When we preserve the Central \nIntelligence Agency and create an office of national intelligence \ndirector and we still have, of course, the FBI's Office of \nIntelligence, I wonder whether we don't wind up with more turf battles. \nI know the intention is to avoid that and to appropriately create a \nplace that will coordinate all the work of the intelligence community.\n  My great management concern is that we will wind up with additional \nturf battles. I hope that is not the case. I am glad the reviews are \nbuilt in because I think that is important. I wanted to express these \nconcerns publicly. I wanted to raise these issues and have a chance for \nthe managers to fully respond.\n  I very much thank the chairman and the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know Members are eager for us to vote \non Senator Lautenberg's amendment, which I believe is the pending \namendment. I hope to conclude the debate on that shortly and move to \ntable his amendment. Senator Stevens is in the Chamber and would like \nto lay down a couple of amendments. I will delay the debate on the \nLautenberg amendment until after Senator Stevens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so \nSenator Stevens may offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3839\n\n       (Purpose: To strike section 201, relating to public \n     disclosure of intelligence funding)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have filed a series of amendments. I \nwould like to address the one on disclosure of intelligence funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3839.\n       On page 115, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 116, line 23.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I direct the attention of the Senate to \npage 115. This is title II. It pertains to the amounts to be disclosed. \nIt deals with amounts authorized and appropriated in each fiscal year.\n  My amendment follows the recommendation of the administration and, I \nmight add, the intelligence community to think twice before we do this. \nIt may be that we will want to do this after the NID comes into being \nand we all have a better knowledge of how these funds are going to be \nhandled.\n  This amendment would require a further study of the disclosure of \nfunds that are provided for intelligence programs. The basic need for \nthis amendment rests on the testimony of the Acting Director of Central \nIntelligence John McLaughlin before the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nHe said:\n\n       I would not go so far as to declassify the numbers for the \n     individual agencies. I think that gives too much opportunity \n     for adversaries to understand how we are moving our money \n     from year to year from technical programs to human source \n     collection and to other objectives.\n\n  In the administration's statement of policy, the administration is \nalso concerned that the committee bill mandates disclosure of sensitive \ninformation about the intelligence budget. The\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\nlegislation should not compel disclosure, including to the Nation's \nenemies in war, of the amounts requested by the President and the \namounts provided for the conduct of the Nation's intelligence \nactivities.\n  I understand that the committee intends to comply with the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission with regard to this. But I think \nit is time we slow down a little bit and respond at least in part to \nsome of the comments of those people who have spent their lifetimes now \nin our intelligence service.\n  I can tell you that I have not spent my whole lifetime there, but I \nhave spent some 30 years now in terms of watching over the Defense \nAppropriations Committee and being part of it at least. In terms of \nbeing chairman and ranking member, it has been now 23 years. This \nconcerns me greatly because one of the problems of the appropriators is \nto find ways to have an honest budget but to put the money where the \nenemies of this country, those who want to do us harm, do not know what \nour emphasis is way out into the future.\n  I remember when we started transitioning to electronic intelligence \nand how we traveled from place to place to look at these new satellites \nand the things they were going to do and got briefings on capacities. \nThose were developed over a series of years, and they got more \ncomplicated as they went along. But the money that was involved was \nsubstantial.\n  To have a disclosure of ``we are engaging in an entirely new effort \nin intelligence'' would be highly unwise.\n  I quote from the second page of the administration statement:\n\n       The Administration is also concerned that the Committee \n     bill mandates disclosure of sensitive information about the \n     intelligence budget. The legislation should not compel \n     disclosure, including to the Nation's enemies in war, of the \n     amounts requested by the President, and provided by the \n     Congress, for the conduct of the Nation's intelligence \n     activities.\n\n  I am deeply concerned about some of the problems of how we find a way \nto maintain the secrets of this country with regard to what we are \ndoing in terms of human intelligence. We are building up human \nintelligence at the same time as we are changing the utilization of the \nelectronic concept of intelligence. And while I believe the time may \ncome when we can find a way to disclose certain portions of the budget, \nI have a real resistance to this proposal that says:\n\n       Congress shall disclose . . . for each fiscal year after \n     fiscal year 2005 the aggregate amount of funds authorized to \n     be appropriated, and the aggregate amount of funds \n     appropriated by Congress for such fiscal year for the \n     National Intelligence Program.\n\n  Then it directs the study of disclosure of additional information. We \nare certainly not opposed to the study. It is the mandate beginning in \n2005. We are going to start, for the fiscal year 2006, disclosing these \namounts at a time when there is great change in the intelligence \ncommunity. The whole structure of the intelligence community will be \nchanged by this bill. To start disclosing where money is going is to \ntell the enemies of this country where our emphasis for the future is. \nIt is the future I am concerned about in terms of disclosure.\n  In the future we set up reserve accounts, and I will be talking about \nsome of those soon. But if we set up reserve accounts, the reserves are \nclassified as reserves because that is where they get the money for \ninnovation and new developments. We don't have to disclose it. We don't \nhave to tell them: Yes, we are going to build new satellites or we are \ngoing to build other devices that can listen to transmissions in the \nair and on the land and under sea.\n  We have a lot of secrets in this country. They are all related to \nintelligence. Let me repeat that. Every one of our secrets is related \nto intelligence. They are highly classified. Many of them are known \nonly to the President and a close circle. Part of that circle includes \nMembers of Congress who deal with the very high-level, classified \nprograms of the intelligence services.\n  I urge that the Senate listen to us and listen to the administration \nand to those who have been involved in these activities. Again, I call \nto the attention of the Senate that when we returned and found there \nwere a whole series of people who had not been heard on their \nviewpoints--they wanted to express their concerns--we held a hearing \nand listened to the intelligence people, who had great, distinguished \nrecords in the past. We listened to Secretary Kissinger and a whole \nseries of people who wore our uniform and have been the top officers of \nour military. To a person, they do not believe we should move this fast \non this disclosure item.\n  Let us have the study. We are entirely in favor of the study. But to \nmandate the disclosure in the bill we will prepare in 2005, I think, is \nmuch too early, in view of the changes taking place in the area of \nintelligence. This is where we are going to start to see if there is \nany reaction to those who have had experience in the area, to the \nPresident, and to those who have reviewed the whole thing. Is the \nSenate going to listen to these people with some experience and say, \nOK, let's study it, but not make the judgment first and then study it?\n  This disclosure in the next fiscal year is wrong, until we know what \nthe policies of the NID are and what are going to be the policies of \nCongress and how we are going to handle this appropriation. It appears \nto me that the result of this bill will be to fractionalize the \nintelligence appropriation, anyway. Part of it is going to go to the \nDepartment of Defense; part will be split up into several agencies \nwithin the NID.\n  I think we ought to know first what we are doing before we decide \nwhat we are going to disclose so we can maintain the secrecy that is \nrequired in order to prepare for the future. This is not something to \ncorrect mistakes of the past; this is something to prevent making \nmistakes in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for the Senator \nfrom Alaska. He is an extraordinary Senator, with many years of \nexperience. I do want to assure the Senator from Alaska that, contrary \nto the implication in his statement, the committee did not adopt the \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission to declassify the aggregate \nbudget totals of all the agencies that make up the national \nintelligence program. We did not adopt that recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission because, based on our hearings and the testimony of our \nwitnesses, we concluded that that goes too far and might well reveal \ninformation that would be helpful to those who would do us harm.\n  The only declassification in the Collins-Lieberman bill is the top \nline aggregate amount for the entire national intelligence program. It \ndoes not declassify the specific appropriations amount distributed to \nagencies such as the National Security Agency, or the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, or the CIA, even though the 9/11 Commission \nrecommended declassification at that level.\n\n  Declassification, the top line, only that aggregate figure which has \nbeen estimated in the newspapers many, many times, I believe, will \nimprove congressional and public oversight of the intelligence budget. \nIt will help us with better decisionmaking on resource distribution, \nand it will make the structure and the management of the intelligence \ncommunity more transparent.\n  We asked our witnesses, including the Acting Director of the CIA, \nJohn McLaughlin, his views. And he, like most of our other expert \nwitnesses, told us that as long as the specifics of the intelligence \nbudget remain classified, there was no harm to national security to \ndeclassify just that top line aggregate amount.\n  I think we struck the right balance in this regard. What we did is we \nincluded a study asking the national intelligence director to report \nback to us--to the Congress--on whether further declassification was \nappropriate. But the only step we took was that top line aggregate \namount. If you don't declassify that in order to have a separate \nappropriation, then you end up, I fear, with the status quo--the money \ngoing through DOD accounts once again. That greatly weakens the budget \nauthority of the national intelligence director.\n  Again, I have enormous respect for the Senator from Alaska. I wanted \nto make clear what our bill does and what it doesn't do, because I \nthink we have reached the right decision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am looking at the bill. The bill says the President \nshall disclose to the public for each fiscal year after fiscal year \n2005 the aggregate amount of funds authorized and appropriated for the \nnational intelligence program. Then I go back to the page 6 for the \ndefinition of national intelligence programs. It says:\n\n       Refers to all national intelligence programs, projects, and \n     activities of the elements of the intelligence community;\n       Includes all programs, projects, and activities (whether or \n     not pertaining to national intelligence) of the National \n     Intelligence Authority, the Central Intelligence Agency, the \n     National Security Agency, the National Geospatial-\n     Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the \n     Office of Intelligence of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Office of Information Analysis of the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  That involves five different bills in the appropriations process. We \ncurrently put in any one of those five bills a portion of the \nclandestine activities we are financing with these moneys. So what you \nare going to tell us is, we no longer can use any portion of those \nbecause we are going to disclose the whole amount in every one of those \nbills.\n  Listen to me. You have not lived with how we have financed the \nintelligence community. The money is not disclosed. It is put in parts \nof the budget and you don't know where it is. It rests with Senator \nInouye and me, to be honest about it, and we make sure that is what it \nis. Maybe four people in the House and Senate know where this is. You \nare telling us to disclose it, without regard to where we put that \nmoney--disclose the money that is in each account and it goes into five \nseparate bills. I say that is wrong. Wait until the NID comes into \noffice and have him tell us how we can disclose what should be \ndisclosed to the public. The public should not ask us to disclose this \nvery classified, secret information to protect the future of the \ncountry through clandestine activities and acquisitions.\n\n  I ask the question, does the Senator understand what her bill does? \nIt will disclose the aggregate amount of funds--disclose them all, \nincluding the very, very top secret items, which probably three or four \npeople in the White House, a few people in the CIA, or the DIA, and \nmaybe eight people in the Congress would know.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I direct the attention of the Senator \nfrom Alaska to line 16 on page 115, which clearly says that:\n\n       The President shall disclose to the public for each fiscal \n     year after fiscal year 2005 the aggregate amount of \n     appropriations requested . . . for the National Intelligence \n     Program.\n\n  It does not say that we are requiring disclosure of the \nappropriations for the elements that make up the national intelligence \nprogram.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It says:\n\n       The aggregate amount of funds authorized to be \n     appropriated, and the aggregate amount of funds appropriated, \n     by Congress for each fiscal year for each element of the \n     intelligence community.\n\n  Both authorized and appropriated. That is on page 116, line 9.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I say respectfully to the Senator from \nAlaska that that refers to the study on whether there should be further \ndeclassification. It does not refer to the disclosure. The disclosure \nis only--and it is very clearly stated--of the aggregate amount of the \nappropriations for the national intelligence program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a very important discussion \nabout another critical part of this bill. Obviously, the Senator from \nAlaska has had an extraordinary record of leadership in this and so \nmany areas of the Senate. He knows the subject matter. He has lived \nwith it a long time. I understand what we are proposing represents \nchange. He is quite sincerely concerned about it from the point of view \nof our national security interests.\n  I most of all want to assure him we spent a lot of time thinking \nabout this. We did not just go for the 9/11 Commission recommendation. \nThe 9/11 Commission recommended that we disclose not only the bottom \nline of the national intelligence budget but, in fact, the budget of \nevery single agency.\n  Their argument, as I am sure the Senator from Alaska knows, was that, \none, the public has a right to know. Of course, we have to balance it--\nwhat we disclose to our enemies--against national security, but if the \nbudgets of those constituent agencies were out in the public, then \nmaybe over the years the public and more Members of Congress might have \ndecided we were not putting enough money into human intelligence, CIA, \net cetera, and that we were putting too much into signal intelligence \nand that we would not have had the shortfall many people think we have \nnow.\n  In our committee, Senator Collins and I decided we were not ready to \nmake that leap of disclosing the budgets of the 15 constituent agencies \nof the intelligence community because we thought there was some risk \ninvolved about signaling the movement of our resources to those who \nwish us ill.\n  Incidentally, there were some members of the Commission who felt very \nstrongly about the disclosure of the budgets of all the agencies, \nincluding some former Members of this Chamber who really feel this was \nat the heart of it. We did not think so, and that is why we called for \nthe study.\n  We think we have, however, achieved something for asking for the \ndisclosure of the bottom line because at least that tells the taxpayers \nand all the Members of Congress how much money we are spending for \nintelligence.\n  In the course of this investigation, I asked some specific questions, \nobviously in closed settings, about the amount of money we are spending \noverall and for each individual agency. I was surprised at the answers \nI got. I think maybe more Members of Congress should ask those \nquestions.\n  But this is what I think we do achieve by having the bottom line \ndisclosed. We are fulfilling a responsibility to the taxpayers to let \nthem know how much money we are spending on intelligence because it is \njust the bottom line, without giving any particular guidance to our \nenemies as to where we are putting that money.\n  The second point is, one result of this might be when more Members of \nCongress and the public see what we are spending on intelligence, which \nis so critical in the war on terrorism--intelligence is always critical \nin warfare and even more critical today because of the nature of this \nenemy which strikes at undefended targets, innocent civilians, and is \ncrazy enough to blow themselves up.\n  So the more we can see and hear and know what they are planning, the \nmore likely we are going to be able to stop them.\n  One conclusion, I say to my friend from Alaska, might be that Members \nof Congress and the public might conclude we are not spending enough on \nintelligence if they see the bottom line.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The problem is not that, from my point of view. My \nproblem is we are going through a transition and saying for the very \nfirst year we are going to be asked to disclose the full amounts \nappropriated to the whole intelligence community.\n  My amendment strikes all of section 201, in effect. I urge, at the \nvery least, that we strike that provision that requires disclosure in \n2005. Let's have the study. I hope the NID will be able to make studies \nand get back to us sometime next year. But why put on us the \nrequirement that we must collate and take all the moneys going to the \nintelligence community in 2006 when we are going to be working on that \nand, at the same time, he is making his adjustments in the whole \ncommunity?\n  My effort is to protect the clandestine amounts, protect the amounts \nthat are necessary for security. Why can we not at least agree to make \nit just the study? We all agree on the study. Maybe the Commission is \nright, and the Senator from Connecticut is wrong and I am wrong. Why \ndon't we have the study and find out what the NID people think is right \nand then let us act on 2006?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, it is \nimpossible that he and I can both be wrong.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have been there before.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We have been there before.\n  Listen, because of who you are and what you stand for, Senator \nCollins\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\nand I will certainly think about this. We think we have struck a good \nbalance in just asking for disclosure of the bottom line, no details, \nbeginning public consideration of what we are spending on intelligence, \nand this study we ask for in 180 days, 6 months, and then we can make \nsome judgments beyond that.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator. This is an important \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe I am a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, Mr. President, the Senator is, along with Senator \nInouye.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a debate we had many years on the floor of the \nSenate. It has been a debate we have talked about so many times, and \nthere has been a consistency in the voting in the Senate to recognize \nthe wisdom not to release the budgets.\n  As yet, with all due respect to our managers and others, I have not \nheard an absolutely convincing argument to turn back at least several \ndecades that this has been an issue of debate on this floor. What is it \nin the public interest or, most importantly, our national security \ninterests that requires us at this time to reverse positions that have \nbeen taken by this Chamber, together with the other body, over the \nperiod of several decades that I have been privileged to serve here?\n  My concern is that this world today is so rapidly changing, and with \nthe advancement of electronics and so many devices to determine what we \nin an open society are doing, why put the roadmap on the table for all \nto begin to search?\n  It has been my experience that if you put out half a loaf, it will be \nfollowed by a request to get the other half of the loaf. Were this \nprovision to prevail, we would be back here in a very short time, some \ncolleagues with the best of intentions, saying: Why don't you put it \nall out? Why should we have any of it secret? That, coupled with the \nfact I have in my lifetime never seen a period where there is greater \nuncertainty about the security of this country--because of the \nprogression of weapons of mass destruction, because of the progression \nof terrorism, and the proliferation of individuals who are willing to \ngive up their lives to do harm in this country and other parts of the \nworld--I just do not think at this point in time, without following, I \nthink, the sage advice of our distinguished President pro tempore, we \nneed to reverse what this Chamber has considered and decided upon year \nafter year that I have been here.\n  So I urge colleagues to support the amendment of the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska. I intend to strongly do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I heard the last part of the comments of \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I suggest we put this aside and see if we \ncan come to some conclusion.\n  The Senator makes a good suggestion of putting a time limit on the \nstudy and getting us to the point where we might be able to follow this \nsuggestion by the fiscal year 2006 bill. That bill will, in all \nprobability, move through the Congress, I would say, by the May, June, \nand July timeframe. With the 180 days, I am afraid the Senator may be \nreferring to the start of the fiscal year. That bill goes through the \nHouse and Senate. These are the first bills--Defense and Homeland \nSecurity, and Intelligence. Obviously; It is going to be in the first \nthree without any question.\n  So the 180 days is going to be June, and this bill will be moving \nthrough the House before that time.\n  We probably could catch it before they finish in terms of if there is \na recommendation we need, but I would urge my colleagues to consider \nrepealing the requirement for disclosure and say that we urge the NID \nto give us the earliest possible date for that disclosure, when it \ncould be done in the national interest.\n  We are putting a lot of control and power in this person. Let's have \nhim tell us when and if it should happen rather than direct it now. \nMake the study and leave it up to him to recommend to us, at least to \nwhat extent we should disclose, commencing in fiscal year 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to read a few sentences from the \n9/11 Commission Report on page 416 which I think are relevant. It says:\n\n     . . . Opponents of declassification argue that America's \n     enemies could learn about intelligence capabilities by \n     tracking the top-line appropriations figure. Yet the top-line \n     figure by itself provides little insight into U.S. \n     intelligence sources and methods. . . .\n\n  Here is a point that one of the members of the Commission, again a \nformer member of this body, made from the 9/11 Commission Report.\n\n       The U.S. Government readily provides copious information \n     about spending on its military forces, including military \n     intelligence. The intelligence community should not be \n     subject to that much disclosure. But when even aggregate \n     categorical numbers remain hidden, it is hard to judge \n     priorities and foster accountability.\n\n  That is in defense of disclosing the 15 individual agency budgets.\n  I say to the Senator from Alaska, who knows this better than I--and I \nam honored to serve on the authorizing Armed Services Committee--we \ngive a fair amount of detail of the budget in terms of military \nprograms.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Unfortunately, that is not a part of the report. That is \na comment after the recommendation. It sort of demonstrates the extent \nof the knowledge they had about what they were dealing with in the \nrecommendations, because that is not true. We do not disclose the \namount we appropriate for defense intelligence. We disclose the amount \nin the budget that we support defense intelligence agencies with pay, \nfacilities, and offices, but the amounts of their programs are not \ndisclosed.\n\n  What I am saying to the Senator is, as we approach this, I think \nthere is a growing desire to know how much money we are spending. The \nSenator may be right. Maybe people want us to spend more. I have wanted \nto spend more for a long time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I know that is true.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The problem is people ought to know what they are \ntalking about before they change the system. In these budgets are both \nmoneys for acquisition and for salaries, and somewhere in there is some \nmoney that everybody knows, in the intelligence community, where it is \nand what it is for.\n  In the Defense authorization bill there is a classified portion of \nthat budget.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not even sure, other than the chairman and ranking \nmember, if the Senator knows what is in there. I am saying so \napologetically, but the system that requires secrecy in this country on \nsome things is kept secret. This disclosure prematurely might trigger \nsomeone saying ``watch that'' in answering the question, and that would \nbe bad because if they answer the question about what they knew was in \nthere, that would disclose what they did not know was in there.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. A final response on this point. The Senator from \nAlaska says correctly if one looks at the overall budget of a given \nmilitary agency, it does not tell what they are spending on different \nprograms. So I want to assure the Senator from Alaska that under the \ncommittee's proposal, not only do we not talk about what is being spent \non specific programs and specific intelligence agencies, we do not talk \nabout what is being spent in those agencies. We talk about the one \nnumber, the conglomerate bottom line or top-line number, and I think \nthat only gives a general idea of what we are investing in \nintelligence, far from any specific information about what we are \ninvesting in particular kinds of intelligence, signal, human, image, \nlet alone specific programs.\n  I would not do this if I thought it would jeopardize our national \nsecurity. In fact, that is why we did not call, as the Commission \nrequested, for disclosure of individual agency budgets because we \nworried it might, and that is why we are asking for a report from the \nnational intelligence director.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will quote Acting CIA Director John \nMcLaughlin from our September 8 hearing on this very issue. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\n\n       If there is a separate appropriation for the foreign \n     intelligence program, the national intelligence program, as \n     distinct from the current arrangement where that \n     appropriation is buried in the larger Defense Department \n     bill, I think it would make some sense to declassify the \n     overall number for the foreign intelligence program.\n\n  That was typical of our witnesses.\n  I also note that the top line has been made public on occasion in the \npast. It was made public in 1997 and 1998 by the DCI.\n  At this point there are numerous Senators who are asking what the \nplan is for today and who are trying to catch planes. I ask for the \nregular order with respect to Lautenberg amendment No. 3802, and I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 2 minutes on each side prior to a \nmotion to table the amendment. I further ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat that would set aside the pending amendment and take up that \nprocedure. We would come back to this amendment. Or is there another \namendment in the queue by regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no other amendment in the queue by \nregular order.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3795\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I call up my amendment numbered 3795.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3795.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To propose a substitute.)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATOR.\n\n       (a) National Intelligence Coordinator.--There is a National \n     Intelligence Coordinator who shall be appointed by the \n     President.\n       (b) Responsibility.--Subject to the direction and control \n     of the President, the National Intelligence Coordinator shall \n     have the responsibility for coordinating the performance of \n     all intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States Government, whether such activities are foreign \n     or domestic.\n       (c) Availability of Funds.--Funds shall be available to the \n     National Intelligence Coordinator for the performance of the \n     responsibility of the Coordinator under subsection (b) in the \n     manner provided by law or as directed by the President.\n       (d) Membership on National Security Council.--The National \n     Intelligence Coordinator shall be a member of the National \n     Security Council.\n       (e) Support.--(1) Any official, office, program, project, \n     or activity of the Central Intelligence Agency as of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act that supports the Director of \n     Central Intelligence in the performance of responsibilities \n     and authorities as the head of the intelligence community \n     shall, after that date, support the National Intelligence \n     Coordination in the performance of the responsibility of the \n     Coordinator under subsection (b).\n       (2) Any powers and authorities of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence under statute, Executive order, regulation, or \n     otherwise as of the date of the enactment of this Act that \n     relate to the performance by the Director of responsibilities \n     and authorities as the head of the intelligence community \n     shall, after that date, have no further force and effect.\n       (f) Accountability.--The National Intelligence Coordinator \n     shall report directly to the President regarding the \n     performance of the responsibility of the Coordinator under \n     subsection (b), and shall be accountable to the President \n     regarding the performance of such responsibility.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I support the Hollings-Stevens \namendment, numbered 3795. My amendment strikes and replaces the \nunderlying bill with language creating a national intelligence \ncoordinator, or NIC. Important work since September 11th of the 9/11 \nCommission, numerous Senate committees and others has convinced all of \nus that we must enact intelligence reform. I am impressed by the \nefforts of my friends Senators Collins and Lieberman, and others, who \nhave used their considerable skills to implement most of the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. But I worry that the Senate is \nmoving ahead with enormous restructuring, when we could address the \nmain problem more immediately. 9/11 was clearly an intelligence \nfailure, and we must act now to fix the most glaring problem--the lack \nof an intelligence coordinator.\n  My amendment fixes this most obvious, most severe problem with our \nintelligence structure by creating a national intelligence coordinator, \nor NIC. It will be the NIC's responsibility to sift through the work of \nall of our intelligence entities, both foreign, domestic and military \nand keep the President abreast of the intelligence community's findings \nin a coordinated, complete way. As it exists, the intelligence \ncommunity's communications with the President cannot help but be \nhaphazard. The President needs to have the huge volumes of intelligence \ninformation coordinated by someone he trusts, so he can make informed \npolicy judgments. Thus, my amendment allows the President to select an \nintelligence coordinator as a member of the National Security Council, \nnot subject to Senate approval. Just as President Bush has Karl Rove, \nwhom he trusts and who coordinates the political intelligence \nthroughout this Administration, the President needs a Karl Rove for \nnational security intelligence.\n  This NIC will need sufficient staff and resources. So my amendment \nassigns to the NIC in his or her role as coordinator of intelligence \nactivities, the staff and resources currently assigned to the Director \nof Central Intelligence, or DCI, that is now employed in the \nperformance of his role as coordinator of the intelligence community, \nwhich he is not doing.\n  Many of the dozens of provisions in Collins-Lieberman would likely \nimprove our system of intelligence. The Senate should study each of \nthese provisions carefully, and enact the best of these provisions \nafter such consideration. My amendment fixes the main problem in the \nmeantime--the lack of a coordinator.\n  Collins-Lieberman creates a National Intelligence Director, or NID, \nand gives that person considerable power over budgets and personnel. \nThe NID will control a new national counterterrorism center, and \ngenerally manage the intelligence community. The bill is problematic \nbecause the NID will wield unheard of influence over work of the \nintelligence entities, before that work even gets done. This is \ngroupthink--personnel from 15 agencies work to get the Director the \nanswers they know he wants. Personnel will neglect intelligence that \ntakes them in directions they know the NID opposes. Reform should \nencourage more creativity, not less; more diversity within the \nintelligence community, not less. These agencies each do different \nthings well--we need to take advantage of differentiation, not squelch \nit under the NID.\n  The national intelligence coordinator created by my amendment is \nunlikely to lead to this problem of Groupthink. The NIC will not \ncontrol personnel and budget decisions. He will not have the power to \nfire people in other agencies that he disagrees with, or promote only \npeople who share his worldview. He will not be able to manipulate \npolicy direction of intelligence agencies and centers we may create. \nThe NIC will coordinate, not meddle in the work itself. The 9/11 \nCommission decided that part of the reason the 9/11 plot was successful \nis the lack of creativity in our intelligence community. Stopping \ncomplicated terror plots before they happen requires flourishing \nintelligence diversity, and Collins-Lieberman will undermine diversity \nby concentrating intelligence output in one manager--the NID. We don't \nneed a Director of Intelligence. We need a coordinator. We need to \nchange the NID to NIC, the ``D'' to ``C''.\n\n  I would like to address concerns I have with the underlying bill \nrelated to Defense. In deciding what to do with\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\nthe Department of Defense's control over most intelligence dollars, \nCollins-Lieberman splits the baby. The bill transfers control over the \nbudgets and some personnel decisions of the National Security Agency, \nthe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National \nReconnaissance Office, from the Secretary of Defense to the NID without \ntransferring control of the agencies themselves to the NID. The NID \nwill develop and present the President with an annual budget request \nfor these and other intelligence programs. It is unclear whether the \nSecretary of Defense or the NID will control the actual payroll. Under \nCollins-Lieberman, ``tactical'' military intelligence and the Defense \nIntelligence Agency will remain under the DOD. But the bill does not \ndefine ``tactical.'' Obviously, DOD will seek to define that term \nbroadly, and the NID will seek to define it narrowly. I understand \nSenator Feinstein may offer an amendment that would define ``tactical'' \nand provide some clarity, but even if that amendment is enacted, the \nbattle will be waged over how to interpret the Feinstein definition of \n``tactical.'' My friends Senators Specter, Roberts, Shelby, DeWine, \nBond, Wyden, Bayh and others already think the NID should have even \nmore control over agencies currently within the DOD than the Collins-\nLieberman bill would allow, but their amendment failed.\n  In short, there is confusion over what Collins-Lieberman transfers \nfrom the DOD to the NID and what it does not transfer. There is \nconfusion over what ought to be placed underneath the NID, and what \nstays with the DOD. There is confusion over how budget, personnel and \nother types of authority can be bifurcated and trifurcated. This is a \ntime for clarity, not confusion. The NID will also receive the \nappropriation for these and other intelligence programs, and in \nCollins-Lieberman the NID can transfer funds from one office to another \nas the Director sees fit. If the underlying bill is enacted as it is \ncurrently written, I forecast open warfare between the Secretary of \nDefense and the NID. Especially during a time of war, DOD will insist \non funding defense/military-related intelligence work its way. This \nkind of turf war is bad for the country, and we should not enact \nintelligence that we can see is likely to pit the Secretary of Defense \nagainst the NID. If this painful transition needs to occur, we should \nat least consider waiting until after combat operations in Iraq have \nended.\n  I am also concerned about some potential problems with the underlying \nbill's blurring of domestic and foreign intelligence. While I support \nthe concept of fusing foreign and domestic intelligence, because that \nis what modern investigating and technology requires, this is a very \nsensitive and tricky area. Our Nation's history of domestic covert \ngovernmental operations shows the need to be careful here. Collins-\nLieberman places the FBI's domestic counterterrorism activities and \nthose of the CIA and DOD under the NID. But it does not address \nproblems with locating domestic covert operations outside the FBI. The \nNID would have the power to ask the CIA or DOD to engage in such covert \ndomestic operations. Our current governmental arrangements keep the CIA \nfrom participating in domestic intelligence activities, yet none of \nthis would apply to the NID. Who is to say that the NID will not begin \nusing the CIA to conduct extensive covert domestic activities? This new \nrole for the CIA may actually be appropriate, but we have to be careful \nto draw rules for CIA domestic conduct that respect our Bill of Rights \nand other basic traditions. Using agencies other than the FBI for these \ndomestic tasks also removes the Attorney General from its supervisory \nfunction. The Department of Justice is qualified to make difficult Bill \nof Rights judgments, but these other agencies may not be. These other \nagencies may not even be inclined to exercise restraint when they are \ninvestigating Americans. We could ruin cases against suspected domestic \nterrorists, because our intelligence operatives do not conduct their \ninvestigations according to constitutional requirements, and the cases \nget thrown out. And unless the stovepipes we hear so much about are \neradicated immediately under this bill, which seems unrealistic, we may \neven have multiple agencies conducting duplicate investigations against \nAmerican citizens, trampling all over each other and the law.\n\n  Collins-Lieberman also enacts the largest ever surveillance \nintelligence network, which can be data-mined by personnel in various \nlevels of government. Senator Stevens and others point out that we do \nnot even have the technology to meld all this intelligence in one \ndatabase. While coordinating information among agencies is laudable, it \nis unclear that Collins-Lieberman addresses dangerous side effects of a \nnew network database. Collins-Lieberman directs the White House to \nviolate privacy protections, but of the three branches, the executive \nbranch has the least incentive to balance individual rights concerns. \nCongress never held any hearings to address the civil liberties \nproblems with such a network, or with turning over to the White House \npower to write privacy guidelines. Administration guidelines and a \ncivil liberties board, contained in the bill, are not as likely to \nstrike the correct balance over privacy issues as Congressional \noversight and public debate would. At the very least, we need committee \nhearings to consider the consequences to our civil liberties of \nenacting a national network database.\n  At this time I would like to say a few words about this underlying \nbill's possible impact on a couple of our intelligence agencies. \nBecause of the bill's considerable scope, I will only raise a few of \nthe potential problems with the bill's agency reforms. The bill hampers \nthe FBI Director's ability to manage the FBI. The bill creates \nconflicting reporting requirements for the FBI's Executive Assistant \nDirector for Intelligence, making her responsible to the FBI Director \nand the NID. She will support not only the FBI's counterterrorism and \ncounterintelligence programs, under the NID, but also the FBI's \ncriminal and cyber missions, which are not under the NID. The bill \nprovides no clear way to separate FBI criminal investigations from its \nintelligence work. I would not want to be the Executive Assistant \nDirector of Intelligence under this structure--with dueling bosses and \nduplicative reporting requirements. Also, will the National Security \nCouncil's role be weakened by the creation of a separate board chaired \nby the NID? Will the NID be allowed to deny the Secretary of State and \nother cabinet-level Secretaries personnel decision-making over their \nown subordinates? I understand Collins-Lieberman will give the NID \nauthority over analysis. Where does this leave CIA analysts? The bill \ndoes not address what the new role for CIA analysts will be. Have these \nmatters been worked out, or even discussed in a public forum? I have \nfocused on several agencies I am particularly acquainted with through \nmy experience on the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I am sure my colleagues are raising similar problems with \nreforming the agencies under their Committees' jurisdictions, and I \nencourage them to come forward and help us understand these important \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to say a few words about policy too. This \nadministration is extremely reticent to spend money in Afghanistan, and \nit was trying to funnel to Iraq funds Congress allocated for \nAfghanistan long before the President started the Iraq war. Collins-\nLieberman empowers the NID to transfer funds and personnel directed by \nCongress from one agency to another. For example, this body may \nsubstantially increase U.S. assistance to Afghanistan--I understand \nSenators McCain and Lieberman have advocated just such an increase. If \nwe add funds for Afghanistan onto this bill, the NID could scrap the \nfunds for Afghanistan and transfer them to fund a new operation in \nSyria or Iran. The NID would have a responsibility to inform Congress \nthat he had moved this money, but these funds would be moved \nnonetheless. It is Congress's duty to allocate such funds. Empowering \nthe NID to override Congress's funding priorities is bound to lead the \nNID to undermine Congress's powers, and instead use shift funds \nallocated by Congress to advance the administration's agenda.\n  As we consider this bill under great political pressure and with the \nelection looming, we have considerable analogous precedent to \nreference. Recent hasty Congressional enactments of Homeland Security \nlegislation and the Patriot Act show the need for more\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\nmeasured action. Collins-Lieberman is thrown together in a matter of \nweeks. Surely most of us agree that at least some of its provisions are \nproblematic. Much of the conversation I have heard on the floor this \nweek sounds more like campaigning than legislating. The White House \nidentifies problems throughout Collins-Lieberman--will the House \nversion appeal more to the White House? A hastily thrown together \nconference resolving differences in the House and Senate versions will \nnot be conducive to finding and fixing these inevitable problems. My \nfriend Senator Stevens says, ``Do no harm''. Whatever comes back from \nconference will have a tremendous head of steam behind it. By acting \ntoo fast on Collins-Lieberman, the Senate may get stuck with House \nprovisions in a conference report that are unpalatable. Once reform is \nenacted, fixing missteps is extremely difficult. Experiences of \nhomeland security legislation, passed right before an election, and the \nPatriot Act, prove that hasty restructuring results in confusion, \nmistakes and paralysis.\n  I conclude by asking my colleagues to support my amendment. Let's act \nnow and enact my amendment, which fixes the main problem of the lack of \na coordinator, and then let's continue to act as we learn. Let's sift \nthrough the litany of approaches being advanced by my colleagues in the \nunderlying bill, and the rival approaches being advocated by others \nboth within this body and outside it. My amendment starts us on the \nright track to improving our intelligence structure, and it avoids the \npotential to start us on the wrong track.\n  I appreciate the outstanding work Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman have done and thank them for that. They met over the break in \nAugust and worked around the clock to produce a product so we could get \nsomething done before we leave in time for the elections in November.\n  However, in those pressures of time, they have come out with a \nproduct that needs many more hearings, more deliberation, and more \nconsideration. In essence, they have a national intelligence director \nwho directs and manages. Immediately that raised the red flag for this \nparticular Senator.\n  When I say ``raised the red flag for this particular Senator,'' let \nme tell of an experience. It was 50 years ago we had the Hoover \nCommission Task Force investigating the intelligence activities of this \nNation. We had the McCarthy days, McCarthy charging there were \nCommunist spies and agents within the State Department, within the \nDefense Department, within the executive branch, and everywhere \nthroughout the Government. President Eisenhower appointed the Doolittle \nCommission and they came out with what was considered generally in the \nCongress as a whitewash. The White House and Congress got together and \nagreed efforts should be conducted to reorganize the executive branch, \nthus, President Hoover's commission came to be.\n  A task force was headed by General Mark Clark. I served as one of \nthose members of the task force investigating the CIA, the FBI, the \nArmy, Navy, air intelligence, Secret Service, Q clearance, atomic \nenergy intelligence, and on down the list. We spent some 2 years. After \nhearings and consideration of the generally speaking minute \nintelligence information at that time--I say ``minute'' for the simple \nreason that the intelligence information now correlated by the various \nentities and departments and agencies is like drinking water out of a \nfire hydrant. You have much, much greater volume. But even then we \nfound the need for a coordinator.\n  I can see Allen Dulles of the Central Intelligence Agency. Director \nDulles of the CIA said, I have my hands full trying to get the work \ndone properly of the CIA, much less as the head of intelligence \nactivities in the Government, namely the coordinator of all \nintelligence, the centralizer of all intelligence. That is why it was \ncalled the Central Intelligence Agency. He said, I have too much work \nto do. What we need is one single intelligence coordinator to \ncoordinate all of it--my work, the FBI, Defense Department, military.\n  In those days all we had was foreign intelligence and military to \nbother with. We did not have terrorism threats and counterterrorism \nwithin the continental limits. Now we have heaped upon the \nresponsibilities of the intelligence community all kinds of duties that \nneed further deliberation and estimation because, as I say, the \ndirector of the national intelligence, when they said ``direct,'' when \nthey said ``manage,'' I said heavens above, here is a flaw of September \n11 intelligence. It was directed. It was managed. Everyone knows that \nnow after the hearings.\n  The Vice President had his own little cabal in that Department of \nDefense. They had met with the head of the Defense Advisory Council, \nRichard Perle, and Scooter Libby and that group. They had submitted to \nthe country of Israel in 1996--Benjamin Netanyahu was coming in as \nPrime Minister, and they submitted at that time that Saddam ought to be \nreplaced with the Hashemite rule and they wanted to democratize Iraq \nback in 1996.\n  When Netanyahu refused doing that, they came back and organized \nthemselves into the Project for the New American Century and they have \nbeen pressing forward ever since.\n  So when you direct and when you manage intelligence, you have a \nflawed product. We need coordination. You need to take the best of the \nbest from the CIA, from the FBI, from the National Security Agency, \nfrom the National Reconnaissance Organization, and all these other \nentities and coordinate into a product to give to the President.\n  Suppose you were President in the next 10 minutes and you heard about \na terrorist threat, not only foreign but domestic. What you would want \nin line, you would want a Karl Rove on intelligence. Now, the President \nhas a Karl Rove on political intelligence. Karl Rove can tell you for \nany section of the country what is going on in any particular State. He \nhas pollsters. He can give a consummate judgment or alternative to the \nPresident to make a judgment. That is fine business. We have that \nwithout legislation.\n  We need just that in security intelligence--not only foreign, not \nonly domestic, not only military, but all three--security intelligence \ncoordinator.\n  So when I say the national intelligence director directing and \nmanaging, I am saying, here is a flaw of September 11. You know the \ngroup-think policy of the President. If you are directing and managing \nintelligence, what you do is go immediately and give that intelligence \nto the folks making the Presidential policy and you develop a group-\nthink and a flawed product.\n  We do not want, necessarily, a director, certainly with all the \nduties that this particular director is burdened with but, rather, we \nwant a coordinator. He should be or she should be in the National \nSecurity Council, appointed by the President, without confirmation by \nthe Senate. You have to have your own person in there. And you have to \nnot have him or her running over to several committees in the Senate \nand several committees in the House testifying about this management, \nthis direction, this decision, this or that policy. He will have his \nhands full just with what the President wants.\n\n  Necessarily, we transfer those coordination responsibilities from the \nCIA over to this national intelligence coordinator. This is a short, \ntwo-page amendment by Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Cochran, \nand myself. This was worked out this afternoon. I was trying to listen \nto the debate, and the more I listened, the more it impressed me that \nwe needed much more deliberate work and consideration, and not the \ncrunch of a national election to get all of us out of town and do \nsomething. So we are trying to respond to that edict of ``don't just \nstand there, do something.'' I am afraid we are going to enact the \n``Alka Seltzer'' intelligence bill: I don't believe we passed the whole \nthing.\n  Look what it does. It directs and manages, but what intelligence is \nunder the Department of Defense and what intelligence is under the \nnational intelligence director. I searched and I found conflicts \nthroughout the particular Collins-Lieberman measure, especially during \na time of war. I can tell you, you are going to find all kinds of \nconflicts there. There are conflicts going on right now with the war in \nIraq and the Secretary of Defense saying he is not going to stand for \nit. The national intelligence director has the defense intelligence \nbudget, but then the\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\nsecretary of intelligence has the defense intelligence function and \nresponsibility. And the Secretary of Defense does not have budget \ncontrol over what he has responsibility. And then there is the ``ying'' \nand the ``yang'' of defense intelligence versus tactical intelligence. \nAnd I have listened to some, the distinguished Senator from California \nand others, on what they consider tactical intelligence.\n  On civil liberties, there are real grave concerns there because there \nis within the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that investigates crimes \nand protects civil liberties, a culture, a paradigm, and a discipline. \nThe Justice Department has developed that over the years of different \nFBI Directors. Now, with respect to the national intelligence director, \nhe can direct covert activity to be taken on by the FBI with none of \nthat discipline and none of those checks and balances.\n  You have heard the distinguished Senator from Alaska with respect to \nthe national intelligence director's transfer of funds, not only the \nreporting of funds. I can tell you now that will never happen where you \ncan transfer funds because the Appropriations Committee has that \nresponsibility.\n  I can go down the different disclosure of funds and various other \nthings. What I want to emphasize is that I am not trying to disparage \nany of the wonderful work being done by our Governmental Operations \nCommittee. They have a product out here now that we can develop and \nwork upon and iron out the differences. But it should not be under the \npressure that we are in and having passed ipso facto the Collins-\nLieberman bill. You would not satisfy the problem of 9/11, and that is \ncoordination.\n  You need the President's man or woman in that National Security \nCouncil, auditing, gaining, and getting. And mind you me, don't worry \nabout getting it, now that you have a coordinator sitting there with \nthe President. For example, that Arizona flight school information that \ndid not get through the FBI to the coordinator, because they did not \nhave one, is excused. That Minnesota terrorist who did not want to land \nthe plane, all he wanted to do was fly it into a building; that came to \nthe CIA but did not get to the White House. Known terrorists came into \nthe country, passed the Immigration department, and the Naturalization \nService. That did not get to the Director.\n  But mind you me, if you have a coordinator, and the information of \nthat importance does not get through to that coordinator, the opposite \nis going to be true. Rather than the old days when you held within your \nparticular department or agency your intelligence and your information, \nand you did not tell the FBI, and the FBI did not tell the CIA, here \nyou are going to try to regurgitate and spit up and throw out and \nreport to that coordinator. Because if he does not get it at the White \nHouse level, heads are going to roll.\n  So we have changed the culture and discipline by having one \ncoordinator. That is all you need. We can go home and know that the job \nis done. The FBI is working. The CIA is working. The National Security \nAgency now knows not to wait until tomorrow to translate their go \nsignal. As they went into the World Trade Towers, they were a day late \nin translating documents.\n  We can go home and know that the President is equipped with a \ncoordinator. And immediately, if I am running the CIA or FBI, I am \ngoing to start getting my information out rather than hiding it. That \nis the real difficulty: The dots were there, but the dots were not \njoined. With the Collins-Lieberman bill what you are instituting and \nlegislating into law is the flaw of 9/11. You have a director of \nintelligence. You have a manager of intelligence. And that is how they \ngot into the World Trade towers and into the Pentagon. It was managed.\n  I can see the President on October 7, 2002, in Cincinnati. ``Facing \nclear evidence of peril, we cannot wait until the smoking gun is a \nmushroom cloud,'' he said. Seven days later I voted for the authority \nto go to the war when the President asked--I did not sit on the \nIntelligence Committee. When my Commander in Chief says: ``Facing clear \nevidence of peril, we cannot wait until the smoking gun is a mushroom \ncloud,'' I voted aye. Then I found out there weren't no smoking guns, \nthere were no mushroom clouds, there were no facilities, there were no \nweapons, there were no terrorist threats. But that is another argument.\n  I am trying to get something done where we in good conscience can \nprotect our national security, protect us against domestic terrorism. \nAnd we can fix this bill.\n  Now, let me add one little thing. I don't know whether Senator \nStevens, my dear colleague, or Senator Inouye or Senator Cochran wants \nto talk. But I would agree, I don't need, unless I am questioned, \nanother 10 minutes. And I know they have amendments of their own. So I \nwould agree to a time limit on either side if the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill are trying to get to a vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. How much more time does the Senator from South Carolina \nbelieve he would require?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me reserve 10 minutes. I don't know if I will use \nit.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina be accorded up to 10 minutes more for his debate, \nand then that Senator Lieberman and I have up to 10 minutes for us to \nuse in opposition to the Hollings amendment. Then it is my intention to \nmove to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will use just 1 minute for the \nHollings-Stevens-Inouye-Cochran amendment. It is my policy, and it is \nnot to be treated casually. It is to be treated seriously because what \nwe are going through is this exercise here. And if you had the Collins-\nLieberman bill up, I would vote to get it to the House and let them try \nto hammer it out. They don't have the coordinator.\n  I was just about to say, the reason they didn't have that coordinator \nis that the 9/11 Commission is even Stephen, Republican-Democrat. And \nthey wanted to have a unanimous report, and I agree with that. So they \ndidn't hammer and zero in or bull's-eye the real need and the real \nfault of 9/11. They didn't join the dots. They didn't have a \ncoordinator. And if they were going to come out on that unanimously, \nthey would have found fault at the White House level. It is just as \nsimple as that.\n  I know another time in the history of this Government where we knew \nfull well that President Reagan knew about the Contras, at least I was \nconvinced so. But you couldn't report it. You couldn't say it. You \ncouldn't do it for the simple reason that these so-called commissions \nthat are now sanctified are really politically balanced, and they leave \nout the necessary one. In this particular instance, we need a \ncoordinator. You can get all of the directors. You can get all of the \nbudgets. You can get all hammered out about the Defense Department. \nJust leave it all alone or put it all through. And you haven't \nsatisfied and gotten a coordinator at the National Security Council.\n  We had that amendment early on last year, and the vote was 49 to 48. \nWe put him on. I had that amendment up. It was a partisan vote.\n  Now I have worked yesterday and today to explain it to colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, and it is bipartisan by the most \nresponsible of Senators other than myself. I hope we don't treat it \ncasually as something to be tabled and walk away and say: Let's have \nanother amendment. We don't want to vote on Friday. Let's get some \nvotes.\n  We are all thinking about procedure and not thinking about the \ncountry. We are all thinking about the campaign and not the country.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina eviscerates the underlying bill. I want to be very clear \nabout that. His amendment takes a radically different approach to \nintelligence reform. The Hollings amendment creates a national \nintelligence coordinator and transfers to this individual the \nresponsibility and authority that the Director of Central Intelligence \nnow has as head of the intelligence community. The DCI would remain as \nhead of the CIA and principal adviser to the President.\n  This approach is completely contrary to the recommendations of the 9/\n11\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nCommission. It is completely contrary to the report of the \ncongressional joint inquiry. It is completely contrary to numerous \ngovernment and private sector reports over the past five decades.\n  The Hollings amendment gives the national intelligence coordinator \nthe responsibility to manage the intelligence community but does not \ngive that individual any additional authority to allow him to \naccomplish that task. The Hollings amendment also provides that except \nas otherwise provided by law, the national intelligence coordinator \nshall not be accountable to Congress regarding the performance of the \nresponsibility of the coordinator. It is difficult to imagine why we \nwould establish such a position with a list of legally defined \nresponsibilities and authorities currently in the National Security Act \nof 1947, very important responsibilities and authorities which affected \nthe security and the liberty of the American people, and then \nspecifically provide that this individual is not accountable to \nCongress.\n  I am strongly opposed to this amendment. It guts the entire Collins-\nLieberman bill. I urge my colleagues to defeat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Hollings \namendment. The Senator from South Carolina raised a question: Who cares \nabout the country? Who is putting the country's interests and security \nfirst?\n  I assure him that Senator Collins and I, the members of our committee \nfrom both parties, care about the country, care about the security of \nthe country, worry about the imminence of a terrorist attack, read the \nreports, came in in July and August and September, worked real hard to \nproduce this proposal.\n  Talk about treating something casually, the amendment of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina would casually eliminate all our work and that of \nthe 9/11 Commission and a series of commissions going back to 1947, \nwhen the National Security Act was adopted, recommending a strong \nnational intelligence director.\n  What you are doing is creating a position that is cosmetic, that has \nno teeth to it, and will not be able to do what we need to do. It will \nbring us back to where we were before September 11, with no one in \ncharge and, even worse, the appearance of someone in charge.\n  Witness after witness--people no one would treat casually, \nSecretaries of State, heads of the intelligence community, the past \nthree or four of those people said: The worst thing you can do is to \ncreate a position and not give that position the authority to direct \nthe intelligence community.\n  With all respect, that is what the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is doing.\n  Secretary Powell said to us on September 13 of this year at a \nhearing:\n\n       A [Director of Central Intelligence] was there before, but \n     the DCI did not have that kind of authority. And in this \n     town, it's budget authority that counts. Can you move the \n     money? Can you set standards for people? The [national \n     intelligence director]--\n\n  The one created in our bill--\n\n       will have all of that, and so I think this is a far more \n     powerful player. And that will help the State Department.\n\n  Stansfield Turner, CIA Director under President Carter, told us on \nAugust 16:\n\n       I think it's empowering somebody to run a $40 billion a \n     year . . . operation. And we just don't have that. And we \n     need to have a CEO. So the real issue is just how much \n     authority to give that CEO and still protect the Department \n     of Defense. And I, as a military officer, would err on the \n     side of giving it to the national intelligence director.\n\n  That is what we do.\n  With all respect, not casually, we have built in a lot of time and \neffort that this committee put in over a period of time on a totally \nbipartisan basis. This amendment would take us back to where we were \nwhen we were struck on September 11, 2001. I don't want to go back \nthere, and that is why I oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, two points quickly: I don't go back to 1947, but \nI go back to 1953 and 1954 under the Hoover Commission. And I would \nrefer you to that report. They ask for a national intelligence \ncoordinator. Allen Dulles would say--he was directing Central \nIntelligence--you can run the National Security Agency, you over at the \nDepartment of Defense, and you can direct and manage military \nintelligence and these different departments. But take those cold \nturkey facts of intelligence and information and have them \ncoordinated--not superduper $40 billion. It sounds pretty on paper, but \nI can tell you right now, that is what was wrong with 9/11. The \nintelligence was directed, was managed.\n  Why do you think the head of the CIA hammered and slammed his fist on \nthe desk of the President and said, Slam dunk, Mr. President, we got \nall the information you need on weapons of mass destruction, when he \ndidn't even have an agent in downtown Baghdad. We were about to invade \nIraq, and we had not an agent. That was the same director who was the \nstaff director before Gulf Storm and Senator Bill Cohen and I came back \nto be briefed on Iraq and Baghdad, against Saddam. And George Tenet, \nthe staff director at that time, said: Gentlemen, we don't have an \nagent in Baghdad. We don't have one in Iraq. We will have to call over \nto the Defense Department. Here, 11 years later, we still don't have \nsomebody down there. Now we have operative agents and everything else \ntrying to manage elections and what have you. So the idea is to \ncoordinate impartial, objective intelligence facts, not manage \nintelligence.\n\n  Secondly, the Congress stays out of it, Senator Collins, most \nrespectfully. The Congress stays out of the affairs of Condoleezza \nRice. She is the National Security Adviser. We don't call her up willy-\nnilly before 15 different committees here on the Hill and say testify \nhere and there. You don't want that. If you are the President, you want \nit coordinated subject to you. That is what you need. You don't call \nKarl Rove up here and ask him about political intelligence; you have \nhim working around the clock. He has us Democrats on the run.\n  I want the same kind of job done in domestic intelligence, foreign \nintelligence, and military intelligence. I want it coordinated for the \nPresident so the buck doesn't stop here because the dots were not \njoined. Now we are about to join the dots in this amendment. Of all \npeople, they say let's don't join them, let's just manage; and we have \n$40 billion or $30 billion, whatever it is, and we are going to manage \nindirectly and we are going to screw up the Defense Department, the \nFBI, civil rights, and everything else, in the head-on rush we have \nhere this afternoon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I move to table the Hollings amendment \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer, along with Senator \nHutchison, and also Senator Roberts and Senator Mikulski, this \namendment. I will explain it in further detail. But the main objective \nof our amendment is to institutionalize much needed reform, based upon \nour recent experience, which is, namely, the practice of alternative \nanalysis, or, as we say, ``red teaming,'' in the production of \nsignificant intelligence assessments.\n  As to this Rockefeller-Hutchison amendment, I am very pleased to say \nI believe the distinguished chair and ranking member of the Committee \non Governmental Affairs have indicated their support for this \namendment--that is my hope--and that, therefore, the amendment will be \naccepted by them and supported, obviously, by our colleagues without \nthe need for a vote.\n  Section 123 of the Collins-Lieberman bill provides for placement of \nthe National Intelligence Council within the office of the national \nintelligence director. The Council is currently under the Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  As the Senate Intelligence Committee report on prewar intelligence on \nIraq explains, National Intelligence Estimates are the intelligence \ncommunity's most authoritative written judgments--they are the golden \nstandard--on national security issues.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill reforms the work of the National \nIntelligence Council, based in significant part on the findings of the \nIntelligence Committee's Iraq review.\n  Importantly, it requires the National Intelligence Estimates to \ndistinguish between the intelligence underlying estimates and the \njudgments of analysts about the intelligence itself. The bill also \nrequires that the estimates describe the quality and reliability of the \nintelligence underlying the analytical judgments, present and explain \nalternative conclusions, and characterize any uncertainties. Our \namendment builds upon this important reform in two ways.\n  First, our amendment applies these reforms not only to National \nIntelligence Estimates, to which they are currently limited, but also \nto other analytical products of the National Intelligence Council, \nwhich is the senior group made up of intelligence people and people \nfrom public and private sectors--the senior group.\n  Second, our amendment will institutionalize a method of ensuring that \nan alternative analysis is used in the preparation of National \nIntelligence Estimates and is available to policymakers reviewing the \nestimates so they get the full picture.\n  It does this by providing for the establishment within the national \nintelligence authority of an office of alternative analysis, whose head \nwill be appointed by the national intelligence director. The national \nintelligence director is required to ensure the independence of the \noffice of alternative analysis. The unit is directed to review every \nNational Intelligence Estimate, and any other intelligence report \ndesignated pursuant to guidelines established by the director.\n  The important purpose of the Rockefeller-Hutchison bill is the \nfollowing: To thoroughly examine all facts, all assumptions, analytical \nmethods, and judgments used in the estimate--in other words, the \nability to question, to\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nbe a contrarian, to dig deeper, to ask questions that otherwise and \nheretofore have not been asked. To make sure that the alternative \nanalysis is available to policymakers, our amendment also requires that \neach National Intelligence Estimate or other product that is subject to \nan alternative analysis include the alternative analysis in its \nappendix.\n  While our Intelligence Committee's Iraq review did not include \ncommittee recommendations, I can assure our colleagues of the \nwidespread support within our committee of the importance of \nalternative analysis or ``red teaming'' as it is called informally. It \nremains important for the body of the National Intelligence Estimate to \nstate dissent from within the intelligence community. But beyond that, \nit is vital for a dedicated group of analysts to examine all aspects of \nan estimate--data, assumptions, analytic methods, and judgments.\n  The ultimate objective is to enable the National Intelligence Council \npersonnel, the national intelligence director, and the executive and \nlegislative branch policymakers to appraise the intelligence \ncommunity's analysis on matters central to our national security.\n  I would like to express my special appreciation to Senator Hutchison \nwho has been working on this for a long time and had a similar \namendment. Our staffs worked flawlessly together. Senator Roberts, \nchairman of the full Intelligence Committee, also had a related \namendment making it clear that the national intelligence director is \nresponsible for ensuring competitive analysis throughout the \nintelligence community. I thank both Senators for their contribution.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to Congresswoman Jane Harman \nfor developing in the House an alternative analysis proposal from which \nwe have benefited preparing this amendment.\n  I hope the Rockefeller-Hutchison amendment is acceptable.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from the State of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rockefeller for \nworking with me on this amendment. We had very similar amendments that \nboth of us filed independently and our staffs got together with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nCollins, and the ranking member, Senator Lieberman, and I think we have \ncome up with a comprehensive approach to competitive analysis. It is \nsomething the majority of people who have served on the Intelligence \nCommittee know is desperately needed. Particularly as we are \nconsolidating agencies and trying to make our agencies mesh better \ntogether. It is very important that we keep the competition of ideas, \nchallenge assumptions, and ensure a forum is provided for alternative \nideas and recommendations. The end result is an office which will \nperform what many refer to as ``red teaming'' that is so important to \nan effective intelligence network.\n  When Dr. Henry Kissinger testified before the Appropriations \nCommittee, of which I am a member, he said, particularly with the \nconsolidation of intelligence oversight, you have to make sure that you \nhave some way of finding out if there were different conclusions \nreached with the same or even other extraneous material.\n  We had the challenge of making sure that the competition of ideas was \nnot lost. I believe the Rockefeller-Hutchison amendment does exactly \nthat.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I appreciate \nSenator Roberts also working with us on this, and Senator Mikulski. \nSenator Kyl was interested in this as well. Everyone came together, and \nI think the result will be an office which is able to quickly adapt to \nterrorist threats. It will be an office of alternative intelligence \nanalysis that will be able to challenge the assumptions and make sure \nthat our highest policymakers, including the President of the United \nStates, have access to this alternative analysis so that he will be \nable to make the very best decisions.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee. I thank Senator Rockefeller. I think we have a wonderful \napproach, a wonderful amendment that will add greatly to the bill and \nthe goal we are all trying to reach of a quality intelligence product \nwith which our President and our Secretary of State, Secretary of \nDefense can make decisions.\n  I yield the floor and urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nHutchison for their amendment to improve the quality of intelligence \nanalysis by creating a red team. Both of them talked to me very early \non about the need for this improvement in our bill. Senator Roberts and \nSenator Mikulski have also been very interested in this issue. I am \nvery pleased they have been able to come together. They have produced \nan excellent amendment that will improve the quality of intelligence \nanalysis.\n  I also urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues from West \nVirginia, Texas, and Kansas for this amendment. It has been a priority \nof our focus, Senator Collins and mine and the committee, to make sure \nthat intelligence is not only coordinated by the national intelligence \ndirector and the dots are connected, but that intelligence be high \nquality and objective and subjected to the competition of ideas. This \namendment makes that basic approach even stronger.\n  I thank our friends for all they have done. Senator Rockefeller, \nagain, if I haven't said it on the floor, has been a tremendous \ncontributor to our effort. I thank him for all the support he has \ngiven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 3815?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3815) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3942\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  Without objection, the amendment is in order, and the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3942.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise with Senator McCain to offer \nthis amendment that takes the fight against terrorism right to where \nthey live--right to their front lines.\n  This amendment says we will identify terrorist havens and--working \nwith our allies--we will break them up and keep them on the run.\n  They will have no peace, no rest, no time to settle in and plot \ndestruction.\n  This amendment also says we will attack and cut their most vital \nsupply line--the disaffected young who serve as recruits.\n  We will do this by showing the Muslim world--especially the young--\nthat we believe in and can help them achieve their dreams of living in \na 21st century world that still respects the tenets of Islam.\n  These goals are a challenge. But if we succeed--and we must--this \ngeneration will see the calls to jihad fade and the global chorus \ncelebrating our shared humanity and peaceful futures grow.\n  Let us start with the challenge of eliminating terrorist sanctuaries \nand their sense of safety.\n  As the 9/11 Commission reported, terrorist cells stretch from \nAfghanistan right into the major cities of Europe. And as 9/11 proved, \ninto the United States as well.\n  To fight and win this war, we need to identify these pockets of \nterrorist sanctuaries and, working with other nations, develop \nstrategies that in the words of the Commission:\n\n       Keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all \n     instruments of national power.\n\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\n\n  The Commission did identify specific countries where we should \nconcentrate our immediate efforts and I would like to focus on two of \nthem.\n  One is Afghanistan. This almost goes without saying.\n  This is where al-Qaida trained its killers. This is where the 9/11 \nplot was hatched. This is where the tyrannical Taliban rulers enslaved \nan entire nation except for those who plotted global destruction.\n  This amendment says that Congress needs to authorize the aid and \nsupport necessary for the entire Afghan nation to finally realize its \nfreedom, which is so close but still so fragile.\n  At this stage, half measures in Afghanistan are the same as throwing \na five-foot rope to someone drowning 10 feet away. We can't let that \nhappen.\n  Another country identified by the Commission was Pakistan.\n  In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Pakistani government made the \nchoice to stand with us in the fight against terrorism at great risk to \nthe stability of the nation and the lives of its leaders.\n  We have no choice but to stand by them.\n  Pakistan may be an imperfect ally at times. But they have been a \nloyal ally--committing troops on their own frontiers to hunt down al-\nQaida fighters and denying them safe bases.\n  This amendment says we not only need to maintain our current \nfinancial support of Pakistan, but let the Pakistanis know we are \nmaking a long-term commitment to the future of their nation.\n  They need to know they have our support for as long as they remain \ntrue to their goals of defeating domestic extremists, promoting a civil \nsociety and preserving the hope of Pakistani democracy that can become \nanother beacon for the Muslin world in the years to come.\n  Just imagine if one of the outcomes of the global war against \nterrorism was stable democracies in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.\n  This goal is within our grasp. It is within our means. Only our \nvision can fail us now.\n  And vision--long-term vision--is what we will need to fulfill the \nsecond part of the strategy outlined in this amendment.\n  We must win over the minds of the Muslim world, especially the young, \nby reaching out and talking to them in ways we never have before.\n  Let me pose a question the 9/11 Commission asked.\n  How can a man hiding in a cave be communicating more effectively with \nthe Muslim world than the nation that invented mass media and the \nInternet?\n  The 9/11 Commission report said:\n\n       To Muslim parents, terrorists like bin Laden have nothing \n     to offer their children but visions of violence and death.\n       America and its friends have a crucial advantage. We can \n     offer these parents a vision that gives their children a \n     better future.\n\n  But it doesn't matter if we don't effectively communicate that \nvision.\n  This amendment says we must improve our mass communications efforts \nwith the Muslim world through sustained and well-funded broadcast \nefforts on satellite television and radio.\n  That is a good start. But this can't just be an air war. Minds are \nwon over more by actions than words.\n  And this amendment looks to engage the minds of Muslim youth by \nrebuilding scholarship, student exchange and library programs.\n  It also calls for establishing an International Youth Opportunity \nFund--that other nations would be asked to contribute to--that would \nhelp build and operate primary and secondary schools in Muslim nations \ncommitted to public education.\n  Why do this? Because most of these nations are too poor to pay for \npublic education.\n  Instead, students attend Madrassahs that far too often are classrooms \nwhere hatred is taught and bigotry affirmed.\n  Consider this: In Karachi, Pakistan, 200,000 students attend \nMadrassahs; 200,000 in one city alone. Multiply that over the entire \nMuslim world. We can't possibly keep up with those numbers year after \nyear.\n  The challenges ahead of us are daunting. But with this amendment we \nsay that we are ready and willing to go to the front lines of the \nterrorist world and take away the sanctuaries where they hide--and take \nback the minds that they steal.\n  This is another in a series of amendments that Senator McCain and I \nhave offered to carry out the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nThis one has to do with recommendations they have made with regard to \nforeign policy. It has been cleared on both sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3942) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3781, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to turn to the \nconsideration of amendment No. 3781 which is pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification or has \nthe modification been cleared by the leader?\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is the modification is accepted by the \nmanagers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 119, strike lines 16 through 18 and insert: ``The \n     National Intelligence Director shall convene regular meetings \n     of the Joint Intelligence Community Council.''.\n       ``(e) Advice and Opinions of Members Other Than Chairman.--\n     (1) A member of the Joint Intelligence Community Council \n     (other than the Chairman) may submit to the Chairman advice \n     or an opinion in disagreement with, or advice or an opinion \n     in addition to, the advice presented by the National \n     Intelligence Director to the President or the National \n     Security Council, in the role of the Chairman as Chairman of \n     the Joint Intelligence Community Council. If a member submits \n     such advice or opinion, the Chairman shall present the advice \n     or opinion of such member at the same time the Chairman \n     presents the advice of the Chairman to the President or the \n     National Security Council, as the case may be.\n       ``(2) The Chairman shall establish procedures to ensure \n     that the presentation of the advice of the Chairman to the \n     President or the National Security Council is not unduly \n     delayed by reason of the submission of the individual advice \n     or opinion of another member of the Council.\n       ``(f) Recommendations to Congress.--Any member of the Joint \n     Intelligence Community Council may make such recommendations \n     to Congress relating to the intelligence community as such \n     member considers appropriate.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me explain the modification. The original text \nrequired that the national intelligence director, in his capacity as \nchairman of the to-be-created joint intelligence community council that \nwas part of the President's message, originally I had it that he would \nhave monthly meetings of the council or meetings upon the request of \nthe members of the council. But I think it more appropriate that that \nbe modified, which has now been done, such that the amendment will \nread: Strike that paragraph and in its place put the national \nintelligence director shall convene regular meetings of the joint \nintelligence community council. And then I will address the balance of \nthe amendment.\n  It has been my concern, and I think from a fair reading of the 9/11 \nCommission report, that we have to keep the views of those individuals \nprimarily responsible for the collection, dissemination, and analysis \nof intelligence, those individuals who are on, incidentally, the \ncouncil, who are your principal Cabinet officers--and that is the \nSecretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, Treasury, and \nthe Attorney General--those individuals from time to time could develop \npositions regarding an intelligence issue which are at variance with \nthe national intelligence director.\n  That collection of Cabinet officers is a vast array of individuals \nwho will be working on issues of intelligence, collaborating with other \nagencies. From time to time, I am of the opinion that one or more of \nthe members of the council might well have opinions that are at \nvariance with the national intelligence director, and that when the \nnational intelligence director goes to brief the President, there \nshould be an obligation in law--I feel that strongly\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\nabout it--that those opinions at variance with the national \nintelligence director must be given to the President and such others \nwho may be in attendance at the time the national intelligence director \npresents his or, as the case may be, her viewpoint.\n  The strength of our intelligence system has to be predicated on \ncompetition of thinking. I have always liked the word that the 9/11 \nCommission seized upon, ``imagination.'' It seems to me that type of \ncompetition and imagination is likely to develop better if we have the \ncertainty that the viewpoints the President receives from the national \nintelligence director are not held by one or more of the members of \nthat council, but that the President will receive the benefit of the \nother viewpoints. I think that system has to be made and put into law. \nIt is so vitally important because, for example, as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, when we examined, in extensive hearings \nconducted by Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller, the issue \nof weapons of mass destruction--and the conclusion that is being \nreached is that there was a substantial variance between the \nintelligence opinions and what is evolving as the actual, factual \nsituation--it appears that the caveats were not given the proper \nemphasis by people, from the President on down, as they reviewed the \nwork of the various intelligence-collecting agencies.\n  For example, the CIA had its position. From time to time, the \nDepartment of Energy had opinions at variance with the CIA. At times, \nthere were opinions of the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, which \nwere at variance with the opinions of other departments and agencies. I \nthink it is essential. Those caveats, in the case of weapons of mass \ndestruction--I will use the phrase that they were not given the \nemphasis that was needed. That is a whole chapter. It is all laid out \nin a very extensive report developed by the Intelligence Committee, \nwhich is now public record.\n  This amendment, hopefully, will go a long way to ensure that diverse \nopinions will be given to our President. That is the thrust of it. It \nis patterned after the Goldwater-Nichols Act--a piece of legislation on \nwhich I was privileged to have a very active role, enacted by the \nCongress in the late 1980s--which organized some elements of the \nDepartment of Defense and, most specifically, the joint staff.\n  Mr. President, the act said that when the Chairman of the Joint Staff \nmeets with the President of the United States, if there were members of \nthe Joint Chiefs--i.e., Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval \nOperations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine \nCorps--who held opinions at variance with the Chairman, the Chairman \nwas obligated under law to share those opinions with the President and \nsuch others as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was \naddressing. That has been a very effective piece of legislation.\n  This amendment is patterned almost verbatim after, and consistent \nwith, the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Frequently, the 9/11 Commission, quite \nproperly, paid a great deal of respect to that piece of legislation.\n  In concluding my remarks--and I have worked on this, but I have not \nfound a solution yet--this Senator is concerned about the future of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency as an organization and the role of the head \nof that agency--now our former distinguished former colleague, Porter \nGoss. Therein resides an enormous wealth of professional people in all \nthe nations of the world, in one way or another, who have come up \nthrough the ranks, training and taking risks, often commensurate with \nthe risks the men and women of the Armed Forces take, often with long \nseparations from their families in some of the more difficult posts in \nthe world. All of that infrastructure is going to remain under the \nDirector of the CIA, who will now report no longer directly to the \nPresident but to the concept of the new national intelligence director. \nThat has been decided.\n  I may eventually come up with the solution. I am trying to figure out \nhow, if the Director of the CIA has a view that is held strongly, and \nit is at variance with the viewpoint of the national intelligence \ndirector, how that view can be properly emphasized and given to the \nPresident and such other persons as the NID will be addressing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment. As I \nlisten to the Senator from Virginia, I wonder, I don't see anything in \nthis bill that allows the separate agencies to communicate with the \nCongress, as they have in the past, such as the CIA and the NRO. They \nhave all come directly to us. Would your amendment preserve the right \nof the people who would disagree with the NID to communicate with the \nCongress, as well as the Executive?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. My last section, recommendations to Congress, says:\n\n       Any member of the Joint Intelligence Community Council may \n     make such recommendation to Congress relating to the \n     intelligence community as such member considers appropriate.\n\n  So in this particular law is specific authority for those Cabinet \nofficers and others to come directly to the Congress. I am glad my \ncolleague brought that up.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Virginia and I both served for a while \nin the executive branch. We know Cabinet officers often put down in the \nlaw about who can contact Congress on what. I don't know if it happened \non your watch. It happened on mine.\n  Mr. WARNER. It happened on mine when I was in the Department of \nDefense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Some people don't believe this language is necessary. \nWould the Senator agree if there is going to be the right to \ncommunicate, to go up the line toward the President or to the Congress, \nit has to be in the law? People's rights have to be protected to \ncontact us?\n  (Mr. CORNYN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it does, and that is why I have \nput in this paragraph, which is very explicit. This paragraph relates \nto the members of the Joint Intelligence Community Council, which I \nenumerated before as the several Cabinet officers--Secretaries of \nState, Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, and the Attorney General.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield once more, I \nsort of feel we have to put some meat on the bones of this commission a \nlittle bit as we go along to allow the Secretaries of the whole \ncommunity to participate in the process--budget, management, and \noversight. Will not the amendment of the Senator from Virginia \nstrengthen oversight by giving the people involved in oversight the \nchance to hear the dissenting opinions as well as the opinion of the \nNID?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  I yield the floor for a moment for the purpose of receiving the \ndistinguished chairman's views on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I very much \nappreciate the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, working with Senator Lieberman and me \nto modify his amendment so that it is consistent with the goals of our \nlegislation.\n  The JICC was suggested by the White House when we drafted our bill. I \nview it as an important component of the Collins-Lieberman bill because \nit provides a forum for the national intelligence director to solicit \nthe views of and to receive advice from key Cabinet members on a wide \nvariety of issues.\n  It is important for the members of the JICC--the Secretaries of \nState, Defense, Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, and other \nDepartments, Treasury as well--to see the council as a way to \ncommunicate their views freely to the NID to help the NID reach the \nright decisions and to be a forum for a wide variety of issues.\n  It is also important for the NID to remain firmly in control as \nchairman of the council, and I believe the modification makes clear \nthat it is the NID who is the chairman and who will regularly convene \nthis council.\n  Senator Warner's amendment, as modified, meets both those goals. It\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\nstrengthens the bill. I can speak on behalf of the ranking member of \nthe committee in urging its adoption. I thank the Senator again for \nworking with us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, the manager. Might I solicit her views on the concern I \nhave--and I have not figured out how to do it. The views of the \nSecretaries of State and Defense are very important because they have \ntheir own internal intelligence functions and they are subjected to \nthis, particularly those two Cabinet officers, on a daily basis.\n  The Director of the CIA will report to the national intelligence \ndirector. The national intelligence director--I do not know quite what \nthe infrastructure will be. It is conceived, as the Senator from Maine \nsaid earlier today and several times, that she is not creating a whole \nnew department. But the CIA Director will remain in charge of what I \nsay is the most magnificent reservoir of professionals to be found \nanywhere in the world. I cannot give, because of classification, the \nnumbers, but it is in the tens of thousands of these individuals all \nover the world. The CIA Director has instantaneous contact with them \nand personal association as he travels--or she, as the case may be--\nworldwide. It is a network of these intelligence people who have \nknowledge that comes back up to the Director. He is hands on. The NID \nwill not have that hands-on experience, cannot possibly because he has \nso much to manage.\n\n  One of the reasons for this legislation is to split off the functions \nof the former head of the CIA, the Director of the whole Central \nIntelligence, and to give those responsibilities, as it relates to the \nnational collection of the intelligence program, portions of it to the \nNID to operate now, leaving the Director of the CIA to manage primarily \nthat agency.\n  Supposing the Director of the CIA has a strongly held opinion and \nviewpoint which is at variance with the national intelligence director, \nbut when the national intelligence director goes in to brief the \nPresident and the Security Council, in all likelihood the Director of \nthe CIA will be at Langley. I am not certain how that varying opinion \nis given to the President and the other structure at the White House \nand the other Cabinet officers who may be present--for instance, at the \nmeetings of the council, how that opinion can be expressed. I have not \nthought of it. Maybe the chairman and I can work on this in the few \ndays remaining on this bill. But I am concerned about it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would be happy to consult further with \nthe Senator about his concern in this area. I note that the 9/11 \nCommission and numerous other commissions have determined that the CIA \nDirector has too many roles right now; that he has three roles. He is \nthe principal adviser to the President for intelligence, he is the head \nof the CIA, and he is the manager of the intelligence community. There \nis widespread consensus that is too much for the CIA Director to have, \nso our legislation alters those roles.\n  The CIA Director would run the CIA. The national intelligence \ndirector would not run the day-to-day operations of the CIA, but the \nnational intelligence director would become the principal adviser to \nthe President on intelligence. The national intelligence director would \nalso be the manager of the national intelligence programs. So we have \ndefined those roles in that manner, but we have not altered the fact \nthat the CIA Director would still be a Presidential appointee, he would \nstill be confirmed by the Senate, and he would still have lots of \naccess, in my view, just as Cabinet members are always going to be able \nto get their views to the President.\n  I think the structure the Senator has improved, the joint \nintelligence community council, strengthens that flow of communication, \nbut that structure is there. I do not believe that is going to be a \nproblem.\n  I also point out to the Senator that the Senator made an excellent \npoint earlier when he was talking about the need for competitive \nanalysis for a variety of viewpoints to be presented to the President \nand that we did not see that work as well as it should have in recent \ncases.\n  We have put in extensive language in our bill due to amendments \nauthored by Senator Levin, as well as the work Senator Lieberman and I \nand others have done, that makes very clear, for example, that when a \nNational Intelligence Estimate is produced, that it has to highlight \ndissenting views. That does not happen now sufficiently. Often those \ndissenting views are hidden away in a footnote when they really should \nbe up front for us to be aware that there are dissenting views and who \nhas those dissenting views.\n  Another example: We require these estimates to have a confidence \nlevel attached to the prevailing view so we will know how much support \nthat prevailing view has.\n  So throughout our bill there are requirements to make sure that \ndissenting views are heard. Indeed, the Rockefeller-Hutchinson \namendment we just adopted also strengthens that by having the office of \nalternative analysis. So I think there are numerous safeguards to make \nsure that all voices are heard; that competitive analysis is \nstrengthened; that dissenting views are highlighted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, all along I have expressed complete \nconcurrence in what the Senator has done in this bill to the extent the \nSenator and I have looked at various sections. I may have reservations \nabout others and tomorrow I hope to engage with the Senator on a number \nof amendments.\n  As to the basic charter that the Senator outlined in her opening \nremarks, I am not going to at this time in any way indicate an \nobjection. I just wanted to focus on this one individual, the CIA \nDirector, who, as the Senator knows, under previous Presidents, and \ncertainly President Bush, was in his office one way or another almost \nevery day of the week working with him.\n  The CIA Director had this--I understand all of these responsibilities \nmay be too much for one individual and I am not arguing about shifting \nthat at the moment, but I am talking about this magnificent collection \nof individuals--and he is the boss--who take all of these risks \ntogether, collect and analyze and develop opinions and it comes up to \nhim and he may form a view which is totally opposite to the NID, and \nthe NID goes into the President. I have guaranteed here that the \nCabinet officers have the right to have their views presented \nsimultaneously, one view after another, to the President, but I am not \nsatisfied yet that the views of the CIA Director, which could well be \ndifferent than the analysis and conclusion of the NID, would be given \nto the President with the weight and sufficiency I think they merit.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am certainly open to working with the distinguished \nSenator to address his concerns. I believe it would work similarly to \nhow the views of the head of the NSA, the NRO, the NGA, and DIA get to \nthe President now through the Secretary of Defense.\n  Under our bill, the CIA Director clearly reports to the NID, much as \nthe head of the NSA reports to the Secretary of Defense. Nothing \nprevents the CIA Director or the NSA Director from going to the \nPresident, but we have changed the structure.\n  We are making the NID the principal adviser to the President for \nintelligence, but I cannot conceive of a situation where the NID would \nnot be relying very heavily on the CIA Director for the advice that he \nis giving to the President. It would be foolhardy for him not to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the Senator's point. The Senator put out a very \nclear example of the NRO, the NSA, the old mapping agency, they report \nto the SECDEF--we have just given the SECDEF the right to have his \nviews presented simultaneously if they are at variance with the NID at \nthe time he meets with the President. That is not present in the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. If those views vary, there is no \nobligation under the law to see that they are presented simultaneously.\n  The Senator says she cannot envision how they would not be. Well, it \ndepends on the human factor, that these two individuals would get along \nand have a mutual respect. I can remember in my first term on the \nIntelligence Committee, there was a very colorful Director of the CIA, \nMr. Casey. He was an extraordinary man. I remember he used to come in \nand testify before the committee. All the members would lean up like \nthis because they could not understand him, to be honest. He spoke in a \nrather unusual way. I think he did that\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\nto get through his testimony pretty quickly and get out of that hearing \nroom. I am trying to put a note of humor into some serious things, but \nlet us hope the Senator is right that as this law goes forward those \nindividuals entrusted, the NID and CIA Director, can have a mutual \nrespect and a mutual professional bond that will enable the views of \nthe CIA Director to be given to the President if they are at variance \nwith the NID. That is left up to the human quotient. This amendment, if \nadopted, puts it in law, not for the CIA Director but for the other \nmembers.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I say to the distinguished Senator that I think the \nanalogy is very similar. The Secretary of Defense is not required to \npresent the views of the NSA to the President. I think this works in a \nmore collaborative way than we are giving the system credit for.\n  We have to be careful, while we put in all of these safeguards--and I \nsupport the chairman's amendment--that we do not create a situation \nwhere it is unclear who is the principal adviser to the President. And \nthat, under our bill, is the national intelligence director.\n  Mr. WARNER. In no way do I wish to in any way diminish the \nsignificance of the NID that is now being created presumably by law in \nthe future. I think we have had a healthy discussion. I appreciate the \ndistinguished manager accepting this amendment, and I will continue to \nwork on the Director of the CIA issue which I continue to be concerned \nabout. Maybe as a consequence of this colloquy, those who might be \nfollowing it could come up with an idea. I hope they would communicate \nit to me or to the distinguished chairman.\n  If there is no further debate, I ask that the amendment be agreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors to the amendment: Senators Stevens, Inouye, Talent, Allard, \nDole, Chambliss, Cornyn, Ensign, and Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3781, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3781), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to express my appreciation to the distinguished \nmanager. I look forward to rejoining her tomorrow. Let us hope that \nthose amendments that I bring forward largely with my colleague Mr. \nStevens will add to the strength of this bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his contributions. \nIt is always a pleasure to work with him, particularly on an issue that \nis so important to our Nation's security.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are still on the bill being managed by \nSenators Lieberman and Collins?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside any pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Schumer, I ask unanimous consent it be \nin order to call up eight amendments, and after their reporting, they \nbe set aside. Senator Schumer understands these can be acted upon in \ndifferent ways, but we offer those on his behalf. He indicated to me \nthat a number of these he thinks will be accepted. This gives the staff \na chance to look at them and the manager can tell Senator Schumer which \nof those will not be accepted and he can come and debate those.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nDemocratic whip that those amendments be interspersed with Republican \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate. I modify my request that that be the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3887 through 3894, en bloc\n\n  Mr. REID. I call up amendments numbered 3887 to 3894, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] for Mr. Schumer, \n     proposes amendments numbered 3887 through 3894, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3887\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to \n  cover individuals, other than United States persons, who engage in \n   international terrorism without affiliation with an international \n                            terrorist group)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

COMMISSION ON THE UNITED STATES-SAUDI ARABIA \n                   RELATIONSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite improvements in counterterrorism cooperation \n     between the Governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia \n     following the terrorist attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on \n     May 12, 2003, the relationship between the United States and \n     Saudi Arabia continues to be problematic in regard to \n     combating Islamic extremism.\n       (2) The Government of Saudi Arabia has not always responded \n     promptly and fully to United States requests for assistance \n     in the global war on Islamist terrorism. Examples of this \n     lack of cooperation have included an unwillingness to provide \n     the United States Government with access to individuals \n     wanted for questioning in relation to terrorist acts and to \n     assist in investigations of terrorist activities.\n       (3) The state religion of Saudi Arabia, a militant and \n     exclusionary form of Islam known as Wahhabism, preaches \n     violence against nonbelievers or infidels and serves as the \n     religious basis for Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. Through \n     support for madrassas, mosques, cultural centers, and other \n     entities Saudi Arabia has actively supported the spread of \n     this religious sect.\n       (4) The Secretary of State designated Saudi Arabia a \n     country of particular concern under section 402(b)(1)(A) of \n     the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. \n     6442(b)(1)(A)) because the Government of Saudi Arabia has \n     engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, and egregious \n     violations of religious freedom.\n       (5) The Department of State's International Religious \n     Freedom Report for 2004 concluded that religious freedom does \n     not exist in Saudi Arabia.\n       (6) The Ambassador-at-large for International Religious \n     Freedom expressed concern about Saudi Arabia's export of \n     religious extremism and intolerance to other countries where \n     religious freedom for Muslims is respected.\n       (7) Historically, the Government of Saudi Arabia has \n     allowed financiers of terrorism to operate within its \n     borders.\n       (8) The Government of Saudi Arabia stated in February 2004 \n     that it would establish a national commission to combat \n     terrorist financing within Saudi Arabia, however, it has not \n     fulfilled that promise.\n       (9) There have been no reports of the Government of Saudi \n     Arabia pursuing the arrest, trial, or punishment of \n     individuals who have provided financial support for terrorist \n     activities. The laws of Saudi Arabia to combat terrorist \n     financing have not been fully implemented.\n       (b) Commission on the United States-Saudi Arabia \n     Relationship.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established, within the \n     legislative branch, the National Commission on the United \n     States-Saudi Arabia Relationship (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the Commission are to \n     investigate, evaluate, and report on--\n       (A) the current status and activities of diplomatic \n     relations between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia;\n       (B) the degree of cooperation exhibited by the Government \n     of Saudi Arabia toward the Government of the United States in \n     relation to intelligence, security cooperation, and the fight \n     against Islamist terrorism;\n       (C) the status of the support provided by the Government of \n     Saudi Arabia to promote the dissemination of Wahabbism; and\n       (D) the efforts of the Government of Saudi Arabia to enact \n     domestic measures to curtail terrorist financing.\n       (3) Authority.--The Commission is authorized to carry out \n     purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (c) Composition of Commission.--The Commission shall be \n     composed of 10 members, as follows:\n       (1) Two members appointed by the President, one of whom the \n     President shall designate as the chairman of the Commission.\n       (2) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Two members appointed by the minority leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (4) Two members appointed by the majority leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (5) Two members appointed by the minority leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) Report.--Not later that 270 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the \n     President and Congress a report on the relationship between \n     the United States and Saudi Arabia.

While I have the floor, we have a lot more amendments filed \nthan I ever dreamed. Everyone should understand there will have to be \nsignificant movement on this bill in the next 24 hours in the way of \noffering amendments. I hope people offer amendments tomorrow. It will \nbe terribly embarrassing to the leaders if Monday we have nothing to \nvote on. I think that will not be the case, but I think we are to the \npoint where there may have to be something done to move this along more \nquickly than it has been. That may include filing cloture in the next \n24 hours.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of the \nassistant Democratic leader. I echo his hope that Members will come to \nthe Chamber tomorrow to offer and debate their amendments. We will \ndelay the votes on those amendments until Monday, but we have an awful \nlot of work to be done. Senator Lieberman and I will be here tomorrow \nready to engage on these amendments. I ask my colleagues to be here as \nwell and help make progress on this very important bill. We are making \nsome progress, but we are not making enough progress and we need to \npick up the pace. We need to whittle down that amendment list. We need \nto have some of those amendments simply go away. I hope that will \nhappen.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I rise today to address one of the most \ntimely and sensitive recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the \ncreation of a civil liberties board to provide checks and balances \nagainst the ``enormous authority'' granted the government by the \npeople. Critically, the 9/11 Commission concluded: ``We must find ways \nof reconciling security with liberty, since the success of one helps \nprotect the other.''\n  There is no doubt that such a board is needed given the heightened \ncivil liberty tensions created by the realities of terrorism and modern \nwarfare. The tools of the information age include precise data-\ngathering, networked databases, and tracking and sensing technologies \nimpervious to the common eye. As Vice Chairman Hamilton noted, in a \nrecent Judiciary Committee hearing, as he commented about the security \nsteps and the technology that are quickly becoming ubiquitous in our \npost-9/11 world, these developments are ``an astounding intrusion in \nthe lives of ordinary Americans that (are) routine today in \ngovernment.'' With such powerful tools come heightened responsibility.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that there are mechanisms in place \nthat will see to it that this power is subject to appropriate checks \nand balances and Congressional oversight. An effective civil liberties \nboard can provide those checks and contribute to preserving both \nliberty and security.\n  We need a civil liberties board that can think critically and \nindependently about the policies we implement as a nation and about how \nthey affect our fundamental rights. The board must be able to \nparticipate in the policymaking\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\nprocess, review technology choices and options, peer into various \nagencies and assess actions, review classified materials and \ninvestigate concerns. This board must have the versatility to work \nclosely with government officials, but at the same time it must be \nsufficiently independent to assess those government policies without \nfear, favor or compromise. Given these significant responsibilities, it \nis equally important that the board be accountable to Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  The civil liberties board outlined in the Collins-Lieberman bill \nmakes great strides in meeting these goals. It represents a true \nbipartisan effort from conception to introduction. I was pleased to \nwork with these Senators along with Senator Durbin to make this civil \nliberties board the kind of board that would honor the 9/11 \nCommission's intent.\n  It establishes a bipartisan board that would have access to the \ndocuments and information needed to assess our counterterrorism \npolicies that affect the vital civil liberties of the American people. \nIt provides a mechanism for them to work closely with administration \nofficials, including working with a network of newly created \ndepartment-level privacy and civil liberty officers, whose proximity to \ndecision makers will ensure that these concerns are considered from the \nearliest stages of policy formation. It requires the board to report to \nCongress on a regular basis, and without compromising classified \ninformation, inform the public about policies that impact their vital \nliberties.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Kyl's amendment No. 3801 attempts to gut the \ncarefully crafted, bipartisan civil liberty and privacy provisions that \nare the hallmark of the Collins-Lieberman bill. It is inconsistent with \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and would undermine the \ncivil liberties that we cherish.\n  First, Senator Kyl's amendment attempts to cut off the information \nflow that would ensure that the board could accurately, reliably and \neffectively advise on the impact of policies on privacy and civil \nliberties. It would also eliminate the board's ability to subpoena \npeople outside of the government who may have important information, \nsuch as private sector data collectors working on behalf of the \ngovernment. It would also eliminate the privacy officers, as well as \npublic hearings and reports to the public.\n  It is clear that the commission intended for the board to have access \nto the information that it needed in order to effectively assess \npolicy. In a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, Vice Chairman \nHamilton said, ``The key requirement is that government agencies must \nbe required to respond to the board.'' He went on to note that the \ncommission itself had subpoena power, and ``if we had not had it, our \njob would have been much, much more difficult.'' I would note that the \nCollins-Lieberman bill does not go as far as to mandate subpoena power \nover government officials, but rather only over relevant non-government \npersons.\n  Given the secrecy and civil liberty concerns that have been pervasive \nin this administration, we should be enhancing information flow and \ndialogue, not eliminating it. It is ironic that at the same time that \nthe administration has been making it more difficult for the public to \nlearn what government agencies are up to, the government and its \nprivate sector partners have been quietly building more and more \ndatabases to learn and store more information about the American \npeople.\n  Second, Senator Kyl's amendment would eliminate a provision that \ngives the board important guidance on how to review requests by the \ngovernment for new and enhanced powers. This is a critical omission. In \norder to balance liberty and security, we need to ensure that the board \nwill be looking at policies through a prism that would allow for \nheightened security protection, while also ensuring that intrusions are \nnot disproportionate to benefits, or that they would unduly undermine \nprivacy and civil liberties.\n  Contrary to assertions that this would be a ``citizen board'' gone \nwild that would ``haul any agent in anywhere in the world and grill \nhim,'' this board would consist of highly accomplished members who have \nthe appropriate clearance to access classified information, who have \nextensive professional expertise on civil liberty and privacy issues, \nand who have the knowledge of how to view these concerns in the context \nof important anti-terrorism objectives.\n  It simply cannot be that the government can create and implement \npolicies that impinge on our liberties without having to account to \nanyone. While that may make things convenient or easy, it certainly \ndoes not preserve the ideals of the country we are fighting to protect.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment is just the latest of recent attempts to \nundermine the 9/11 Commission's clear recommendations for an effective \nboard. The administration recently issued an executive order that \nattempted to foist upon us an anemic civil liberties board. I and \nseveral of my colleagues noted in a letter to the President that the \nboard was not a bipartisan or independent entity. It had no authority \nto access information and no accountability. It was housed in the \nDepartment of Justice, and comprised solely of administration officials \nfrom the law enforcement and intelligence communities, precisely the \ncommunities that the board would have an obligation to oversee. It was \nthe proverbial case of the fox guarding the henhouse. This would not \nhave resulted in a vigorous consideration of policy that the Commission \nintended.\n  As the Commission noted, the ``burden of proof for retaining a \nparticular governmental power should be on the Executive, to explain \n(a) that the power actually materially enhances security and (b) that \nthere is adequate supervision of the Executive's use of the powers to \nensure protection of civil liberties. If the power is granted, there \nmust be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its \nuse.''\n  We should be looking for ways to ensure that this burden of proof \nwill be met, rather than weakening oversight and accountability.\n  As the 9/11 Commission noted, when it comes to security and civil \nliberties, ``while protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful \nof threats to vital personal and civil liberties. This balancing is no \neasy task, but we must constantly strive to keep it right.''\n  Senator Kyl's amendment fails to ``keep it right,'' and I urge that \nthe Senate honor the spirit of the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, and reject it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1957, when America was caught off guard \nby the Soviet Union's launch of a satellite named Sputnik, Congress \npassed a massive education bill, the National Defense Education Act, \nwhich poured federal funds into the study of math, science and \nstrategic languages like Russian. Thirty-two years later, the Soviet \nUnion fell. Following the 9/11 attacks and the Commission's report, we \nneed to rise to the challenge once again. We must intensify the study \nof strategic foreign languages, like Arabic, Pashto and Korean.\n  According to the Department of Education, only 22 of the 1.8 million \nAmerican students who graduated from college last year earned degrees \nin Arabic. This figure has remained about the same over the last \ndecade. And as the 9/11 Commission reported, and the Washington Post \nand the New York Times reiterated on Tuesday, the lack of qualified \npersonnel has left hundreds of thousands of pages of intercepted \nterrorist communication untranslated.\n  On page 77 of the Commission's report, the Commission notes the FBI \n``lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key \nlanguages, resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated \nintercepts.'' On page 92, the report adds, ``Very few American colleges \nand universities offered programs in Middle Eastern languages or \nIslamic studies.'' The 9/11 report also calls for both the CIA and the \nFBI to strengthen their language programs and for the FBI to improve \nability to attract candidates with technological skills.\n  At a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee on September 14, 9/11 Commissioner \nFred Fielding described the lack of language skills at intelligence \nagencies as: ``embarrassing.'' FBI Assistant Director for \nAdministrative Services Mark Bullock testified that while the agency is \nreceiving thousands of applicants, the agency has found it ``difficult \nhiring agents with language skills, skills in the right languages.''\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\n  We can do better.\n  The bill we are considering today does address education, but not \ncompletely. This bill calls for better coordination of joint training \namong the intelligence agencies and authorizes, but does not direct, \nthe National Intelligence Director to collaborate with the intelligence \nagencies to establish a scholarship program, in which students agree to \nwork for an agency in exchange for financial assistance with their \neducation. I commend the managers of the bill for including this \ninnovative education subsidy-for-service approach. This is an important \nmechanism to put in place, although we need to do more to expand \ninstruction in critical foreign language, particularly in the area of \nscience and technology. If no one is teaching the classes we need, we \ncan't improve the pool of qualified applicants from which the \nintelligence community can recruit.\n  The amendment my colleagues from Florida and Hawaii and I sponsored \nwill expand targeted educational opportunities to promote integration \nof intelligence collection and analysis and to prepare intelligence \npersonnel to work with other agencies.\n  We ask the National Intelligence Director to assess the current needs \nof the intelligence community with respect to language skills; \ndetermine whether the community's needs for critical foreign language \nskills and understanding science and technology terms in those \nlanguages are being met; and report to Congress recommendations for \nprograms to help meet those needs.\n  In developing its report, the NID is directed to take into account \nexisting education grant programs through the Departments of Education \nand Defense. The first report is due to Congress within one year of \nenactment, and then again each year after that.\n  I thank the Senators from Florida and Hawaii for their willingness to \nwork together in developing language to strengthen the critical \nlanguage education component of the reorganized intelligence community. \nAnd I thank my colleagues from Maine and Connecticut for their \nleadership in crafting and managing this important piece of \nlegislation, which now includes this additional focus on strengthening \nnecessary language skills in this country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I noted on the floor yesterday, the \nSenate is now engaged in perhaps the most important debate of the 108th \nCongress. Increasing the security of our country against terrorist \nattack requires new strategies, new ways of thinking, and new ways of \norganizing our Government. That is what this legislative debate is all \nabout.\n  Earlier this month, I joined with Senator Lieberman and others in \nintroducing comprehensive legislation to implement all the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. Along with Senator Lieberman, I pledged \nthat the Commission's recommendations--including the ones not already \naddressed in the underlying bill--would be fully debated. Yesterday, we \noffered an amendment that was designed to address the Commission's \ntransportation security-related recommendations. Now we will offer an \namendment that encompasses the Commission's diplomacy, foreign aid, and \nmilitary-related recommendations.\n  I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Bayh, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  This amendment is very similar to Title V of S. 2774, the 9/11 \nCommission Report Implementation Act of 2004, which we introduced \nearlier this month. In drafting this amendment, we have worked with the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to develop consensus language \nconcerning areas of their jurisdiction, and with the Senate Armed \nServices and Banking Committees to develop language for other \nprovisions.\n  As the Commission report observed, there were many deficiencies that \nled to the terrorist attacks of September 11. Not the least was the \nfailure of the United States to adapt its foreign policy to address the \nchanged realities of the post-cold war era. In hindsight, it is evident \nthat we did not do enough to prevent the creation of terrorist \nsanctuaries, encourage the democratization of the Greater Middle East, \nand engage countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia in \ntheir battles against fundamentalism.\n  In light of this realization, the Commission found that no single set \nof strategies is sufficient to prevent future terrorist attacks. The \nUnited States must use all of the instruments at our disposal to \ncounter the short-and long-term threats posed by international \nterrorism. For this reason, it is critical to pay due attention to the \nrole of diplomacy, foreign aid, and the military.\n  Consistent with the Commission's recommendations, this amendment \nrequires the executive branch to develop a strategy to address and, \nwhere possible, eliminate terrorist sanctuaries. It renews the U.S. \ncommitment to Pakistan's future, in light of the critical role that \ncountry plays in the war on terror, and authorizes assistance to \nAfghanistan--aid that many of us believe must be increased. The \namendment addresses our relations with Saudi Arabia and suggests \nestablishing an international contact group to develop a multilateral \ncounterterrorism strategy.\n\n  Our amendment also calls on the U.S. Government to work with our \ncoalition partners to develop a common approach to the treatment of \ndetainees, and reiterates standards for the humane treatment of enemy \ndetainees--standards that our soldiers and officials should have been \nfollowing all along. Most of this language was taken directly from the \nSenate-passed version of the Department of Defense Authorization bill, \nwhich is now pending in conference. The Senate has already spoken on \nthis issue once; however, it has yet to be enacted. We must continue \npressing to ensure that America treats individuals in its custody \nhumanely, as the Commission rightly advocates. As the 9/11 Commission \nrightly pointed out, allowing torture of prisoners only makes it more \ndifficult to build the alliances and support we need to defeat \nterrorism. Portrayals of inhumane treatment of captured terrorists \nhinder our ability to engage in the wider struggle against them.\n  Other provisions in this amendment are designed to enhance America's \nability to fight the war of ideas by promoting universal values of \ndemocracy, tolerance, and openness. It authorizes funding for U.S. \nbroadcasts to Muslim countries, and authorizes an increase in our \neducation and exchange programs. In addition, it establishes an \nInternational Youth Opportunity Fund that will provide financial \nassistance for the improvement of public education in the Middle East. \nFinally, the amendment notes that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is a grave and gathering threat to this country, and \nrequires the executive branch to develop a strategy to expand and \nstrengthen our nonproliferation programs.\n  This amendment is the next step in fulfilling the mandate of the \n9/11 Commission recommendations and ensuring that we orient our \ndiplomacy, foreign aid, and military programs toward combating \nterrorist threats, in both the short and long terms. The provisions in \nour amendment are not the only steps that are needed, and there are a \nnumber of other important actions that the executive branch should \nundertake in order to fully implement the Commission's recommendations. \nBut I believe that passing this amendment is a vital and necessary \nstep.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3771\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since the Manhattan project, national \nlaboratory scientists have performed an inherently unique governmental \nfunction of not only designing and producing nuclear weapons, but \nanalyzing intelligence on foreign nuclear weapons and nuclear \ntechnology.\n  In performing this governmental function, the national laboratory \nscientists have staffed the Joint Atomic Intelligence Committee, which \nproduces strategic assessments on foreign nuclear weapons programs, \nhelped produce technical assessments of foreign nuclear weapons, and \nprovided critical technical support in disabling improvised nuclear \ndevices, which in today's post-9/11 environment is one of our greatest \nfears. In many cases these functions are performed through rotational \nassignments to the intelligence community staff.\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\n  The amendment I have offered today, and cosponsored by my colleague \nSenator Domenici, preserves this rotational capability in the \nintelligence reforms proposed by Senators Collins and Lieberman.\n  Typically, national laboratory personnel can be detailed to the \nintelligence community, or any Federal agency, through the \nIntergovernmental Personnel Act. This act permits employees of \nfederally funded research and development centers, FFRDCs, to act for \nset periods of time, as staff of a Government agency.\n  This amendment does not alter the authorities under the act. What \nthis amendment does is reinforce the congressional intent, that in \naddition to the authorities granted to the National Intelligence \nAuthority to staff its centers with personnel from other branches of \nthe Government, that it continue to be able to utilize the unique \ncapabilities of Department of Energy staff and other FFRDCs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10050-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate this evening to pay \ntribute to a fellow Ohioan, a brave soldier who lost his life while \nmaking our own safer. Army PFC Kevin Ott disappeared north of Baghdad, \nIraq, on June 25th, 2003. Three days later, on June 28th, everyone's \nworst fears were realized. The military personnel found Kevin's body \nfollowing a very exhaustive search. Kevin Ott was only 27 years of age.\n  When I think about the loss of young soldiers, I am reminded of \nsomething that President John F. Kennedy said to the 1st Armored \nDivision in Fort Stewart, GA, as they were prepared to deploy to Cuba. \nIn 1962 this is what President Kennedy said:\n\n       Many years ago, according to a story there was found in a \n     sentry box in Gibraltar, a poem which said:\n\n     God and the soldier all men adore\n     In time of danger and not before\n     When the danger is past and all things righted\n     God is forgotten and the soldier slighted.\n\n  President Kennedy continued:\n\n       This country does not forget God or the soldier.\n       Upon both we depend.\n\n  President Kennedy said it so well. We depend on our service men and \nwomen. We depended on Kevin Ott. We will not forget him. We will never \nforget him.\n  I rise this evening to remember Kevin, to remember him as he was and \nwill forever remain, a devoted son, supportive brother, and patriotic \nsoldier. Kevin Ott grew up in Orient, OH, son of loving parents Alma \nand Charles Ott. He and his sisters and brothers were close and would \nremain so throughout their lives. Kevin went to Westfall High School. \nHe was on the basketball team and enjoyed spending time with friends. \nHe graduated in 1993 and then attended Bluffton College where he was a \nsports lover and played defensive end on the football team.\n  While Kevin's love of sports certainly ran deep, his passion also was \nfor motorcycles. He certainly loved that bike. His sister Pam remembers \nhow Kevin took her for a ride one afternoon. She said:\n\n       I was afraid because I knew he loved to go really fast. \n     But, to my surprise, he went slowly because he knew I was \n     scared.\n\n  Kevin was a good brother, son, and friend. He was deeply devoted to \nhis family, and with their love and guidance he became devoted to his \nchurch and his faith. Throughout his entire life Kevin was a strongly \nspiritual person. He was active in his church from the time he was 4 \nyears old. His parents fondly remember how his faith guided their son's \ndecisions and how it directed his life.\n  At the Southwest Community Church of the Nazarene, Kevin worked with \nthe youth group, sang in the choir, and went on a mission trip to \nMexico where he helped build houses.\n  These experiences taught him to see the hand of God in all things. It \nincreased his faith, the faith that would see him through the difficult \ntimes in his life.\n  The tragic events of September 11 changed the course of Kevin's life \nas it changed the course of so many people's lives. It was then that he \ndecided he wanted to join the military. He wanted to prevent such a \ntragedy ever happening again.\n  Kevin left his job as a machinist with J.W. Groves and Sons to enlist \nin the Army in January 2002. He immediately excelled. His comrades \nremembered him as a capable soldier, someone they could always count \non.\n  Kevin's brother-in-law Jim Pack recalled that Kevin loved the \nmilitary. He said that he had found his calling in life. Kevin was \nassigned to Battery B, 3rd Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Regiment, \nbased out of Fort Sill, OK. While in Iraq, Kevin was in charge of \nguarding an ammunitions depot. He wrote home often, and his parents \ncould tell their son was proud of his service. They saved Kevin's \npostcards and looked forward to any contact they had with him. They \nrecognized that their son loved Army life and knew that he believed in \nwhat he was doing.\n  Though the news of Kevin's death was, of course, devastating to the \nOtt family, Charles said his son was at peace with his faith and was \nnot afraid to die. His faith saw him through and took him to his final \nresting place.\n  When we lost Kevin Ott, our Nation mourned. Charles and Alma lost \ntheir loving son. Pam, Julie, Joyce, Diane, and Doug lost their loyal \nbrother. They miss his joking nature, his love of sports and \nmotorcycles. They miss him coaching his nephew's Little League team. \nBut most of all they just miss spending time with him.\n  So, as President Kennedy said, over 40 years ago: ``This country does \nnot forget . . . the soldier.'' This country will not forget Kevin Ott.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10050-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10050-S10051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             OHIO FLOODING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are all well aware of the horrible \ndevastation that has been caused by the four hurricanes that have hit \nthe United States and have hit other countries so far this season: \nCharley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. We have seen pictures of the \ndamaged homes. We have seen the victims interviewed on TV. We have seen \nthe floodwaters that have drowned many towns and villages.\n  My home State of Ohio has also suffered damage from these storms, \ndamage that has warranted the classification of 30 of our counties as \nFederal disaster areas. These counties include: Athens, Belmont, \nCarroll, Columbiana, Gallia, Guernsey, Harrison, Jefferson, Mahoning, \nMeigs, Monroe, Morgan, Muskingum, Noble, Perry, Stark, Trumbull, \nTuscarawas, Vinton, and Washington.\n  Last Friday, when I was home, it was my privilege to tour some of the \nflooded areas in Ohio and to talk to some of the people who are \nvictims. I must say, while I have seen floods before, been along the \nOhio Valley before, and seen what floods can do, I was, again, \noverwhelmed at what I saw. Some areas looked like a war zone.\n  The power of water never ceases to amaze me, whether it is the Ohio \nRiver when it comes up, or in creeks and streams a long way from the \nOhio River when flash floods come up and do unbelievable damage and \nhomes are literally ripped apart and trailers are ripped apart. I saw \nthis when I was home.\n  At its highest, the floodwaters in Marietta, along the Ohio River, \ncovered the first floor of many buildings. From this picture, a photo \ntaken by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Marietta, you can \nget some idea of what Marietta looked like when the river came up--\nabsolutely unbelievable. People used boats to get around as they \nsurveyed what they lost and what they could possibly save.\n  In other areas, trucks were washed away, mobile homes stood on their \nsides, and debris was everywhere. There was garbage strewn clear up \ninto the trees.\n  Many businesses were, of course, forced to close, as owners went out \nto salvage what was left. As you can see from this picture, it did not \nlook like this Wendy's restaurant--after this picture was taken--would \nbe serving Wendy's hamburgers very soon.\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\n  But we do know that people are resilient. When I got there, it had \nbeen 5 or 6 days since the peak of the water, which you are seeing in \nthese pictures. People were already getting back into business. \nBusinesses were opening. People are unbelievably resilient.\n  This picture of Wendy's is absolutely unbelievable at the height of \nthe flood.\n  Belmont County and the village of Neffs, which I visited, experienced \nsevere flash flooding--a different kind of water damage, a different \ntype of flooding, but unbelievably devastating as well. I toured Neffs, \nand water was freely flowing in and out of houses as the long cleanup \nprocess began--again, another picture of what this looked like, not \nwhen I was there, but during the height of the storm.\n  Twenty Ohio counties are like this--20. Already, nearly 4,000 \nindividuals in the disaster-declared counties have called to apply for \nassistance.\n  Part of the tragedy of the floods is that so many residents simply \ndid not have the warning that they needed.\n\n  Senator Voinovich and I and Congressman Strickland and Congressman \nNey and others are asking the National Weather Service to give us an \nexplanation for what happened because when I was in Marietta a number \nof people told us that night they received a flood warning, but then \nthe National Weather Service took that warning off. People went to bed. \nYet during the night the flood warning was put back on. Many \nbusinesspeople and homeowners, for example, whom I talked to simply \nwere not prepared. The floodwater came up during the night and did \ntremendous damage. People were not prepared for that.\n  So our question to the Weather Service is, why was that mistake made? \nWhy was the flood warning on, then off, and then back on again? It was \nvery misleading to people, and we want to know exactly what the \nexplanation is. We have written to the Weather Service and we want a \nfull explanation about that.\n  One of the most heartening things, though--you see this, and I have \nseen it before in Ohio; I know we have seen it across the country--is \nthe number of people who help neighbors, who come out and do \nunbelievable work. They come out of nowhere and volunteer. I saw \namazing displays of human kindness, generosity of the human spirit, \nneighbors helping each other get their lives back together. As they \nhave done so many times before, Ohioans have pulled together as part of \na community effort to reclaim their houses and businesses from the \nfloodwaters.\n  I met a woman, for example, who is originally from Neffs, the town I \nwas talking about, but now lives in Columbus and works at Ohio State. \nShe asked for 4 days of vacation time--it was granted--so she could go \nback home, back to Neffs and help with the cleanup. She joined several \nother volunteers to help serve meals in the basement of one of the \nlocal churches, a place I had the occasion to visit.\n  It is that kind of spirit we see. This is one of the countless acts \nof generosity exhibited by people that I saw.\n  I saw a business, for example, in Marietta. The woman who was \ncleaning up--it was horrible; all her inventory had mud all over it; it \nwas a mess--she said: Senator, come in the back. I want to show you \nsomething. I went back with her, and clear in the back through her \nbusiness, back in the back alley. And she said: Look. There were people \nthere who came in to volunteer, and they had an assembly line, and they \nwere washing the inventory she had, these little toys, these little \ndifferent things.\n  It was an amazing thing to see. These were all volunteers, all people \nwho came in. They had some adults and some younger kids who were in \nthere who were volunteering and helping her.\n  I saw another man in Marietta. He was cleaning up his business. He \ntook me back and showed me where there was a piano. He said: You will \nnot believe this story. He said: The flood kept coming up and coming up \nand coming up. We were up in the second story of our house. He said: I \nkept taking pictures and posting them on the Internet. All of a sudden \nmy phone rang. I couldn't figure out who was calling me.\n  He said the person who called on the phone said: Are you--and the \nperson said his name. He answered: Yes, this is such-and-such business.\n  He said: We are outside.\n  He said: You can't be outside. There is nothing but water outside.\n  He said: Well, look outside.\n  So he went to his window on the second story and there were a couple \nguys in a row boat. And they said: We are here to help you. And they \nhad come in from the countryside, rode their boat into Marietta, and \nthey had some cement blocks they had brought because they had heard \nthat his piano was getting soaked and he couldn't do anything about it. \nIt was getting ruined. So they brought that boat in, landed the boat in \nhis place of business, tied the boat up, unloaded the cement blocks, \nlifted the piano up, put the cement blocks under the piano so the piano \nwould not get wet.\n  He said: I had never seen those guys before. They left and I still \ndon't know who they are. But I had tears coming out of my eyes when \nthey left because I couldn't believe it, that someone would do that for \nme.\n  That is the type of thing you see, in spite of all the horror, \nreplicated not only in Ohio but across this country.\n  I must also say, I was so impressed by the work of the men and women \nof the Ohio National Guard--they always do a great job--the Ohio \nEmergency Management Agency, the great professionals who are always \nthere; FEMA; the county directors, their staffs, countless other \nvolunteers who have worked tirelessly to help bring food, clean water \nto the area. They have already distributed almost $5 million in \ndisaster assistance and continue to work as we speak tonight. We \nappreciate their efforts and thank them.\n  It is going to take months before these flood-ravaged communities \nreturn to normal. We must make sure to employ every resource available \nto make sure Ohioans can get back in their homes and back to their \njobs, the day-to-day business, as soon as possible. It has been rough \ngoing for so many different people in Ohio.\n  I, again, thank all those who have volunteered and assisted in the \ncleanup and rebuilding. I know what I saw in Ohio with our flood damage \nhas been replicated in so many other States, not just in this country \nbut in other countries. There are many other people hurting.\n  I came to the floor tonight to share with my colleagues what I saw as \nI traveled around my State last week. It is so heartening to see how \npeople fight back. I know this Congress will continue to be of \nassistance and of help to them as we reach out to all the victims of \nthe hurricanes and we give them a hand up and help them through this \ncrisis.\n  My experience has been that in the immediate days after the \nhurricanes and flooding, it is always tough. But the weeks and months \neven beyond that are tough as well. We are not going to forget them. I \nknow my colleagues in the Senate will not forget them, and the Federal \nGovernment will not forget them. We need to let them know we are still \ngoing to be there with them through the Federal agencies and be of \nassistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10051-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10051-S10054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have had the honor for almost 50 years \nnow of being active in aviation. I have had occasion to fly almost \nevery kind of airplane that is up there, and it is an experience that \nnot many people get a chance to have in their normal lives. Something \nis on the horizon right now that is an opportunity for people to do, \nthings that they never dreamed possible; that is, to feel and to \nexperience the thrill of flight into space.\n  Yesterday marked a very significant day in history. Today, the \nSpaceShipOne, designed by Burt Rutan, who happens to be a friend of \nmine, and piloted by Mike Melvill, who is a 62-year-old pilot, made the \nfirst flight of the two required flights to claim the $10 million \nAnsari X-Prize for carrying three people, or an equivalent weight, to \nspace twice within 2 weeks.\n  The brilliant concept of the Ansari X Prize exemplifies the \nexcellence that can be achieved through an incentivized approach rather \nthan a governmental mandate of punitive approach. To incentivize and \nsafely get government out of the way is the philosophy of the \nCommercial Space\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\nLaunch Amendments Act of 2004, H.R. 3752. Tempt not only the pocketbook \nbut also the vision of anyone who has the creativity and imagination to \npursue it.\n  Space programs originally sprang to life in the face of international \ncompetition. The realities of the cold war stimulated creativity, and \ninnovation in a dramatic new way. This government and NASA responded \nwith successes that dazzled even the most optimistic dreamer.\n  Since then, space advances have gone through the same channels with \nthe same motivation, but without the urgency and vision of ``The Space \nRace.''\n  The Ansari X Prize is a refreshing new appeal to anyone who has the \nfaith and vision to respond. It is an appeal that looks for the likes \nof Charles Lindberg--people who will think within the restraints of \npracticality but without the restraints of a rutted concept of how it \nis supposed to be done.\n  I am grateful that this competition is doing what it was designed to \ndo: spur a budding industry in commercial human space flight. Today's \nflight paves the way for making space flight available to the public, a \nlong-time dream of many. Just imagine, ordinary people will be able to \nexperience the thrill of flying in space. But despite the existing \ntechnology to make this dream possible, there are some obstacles.\n  One such barrier stems from this body. The text of my bill, S. 2772, \nthe Space CHASE Act, should pass the Senate right now as an amendment \nto H.R. 3752. H.R. 3752 readily passed the House of Representatives in \nMarch by a vote of 402 to 1. The House of Representatives and the \nFederal Aviation Administration have agreed to the improvements \nembodied in my Space CHASE Act, so it is better than the bill that \npassed the House by 402 to 1. However, some Democrats are blocking this \nlegislation that is vital to the fledgling commercial space industry.\n  The legislation would define FAA licensing rules for suborbital \nflights, as well as require passengers to sign waivers of legal \nliability. Without such a waiver, the investors fear excessive lawsuits \nby trial lawyers. Without investors, many of these fledgling \nentrepreneurial space companies will not be able to get off the ground, \nboth literally and figuratively.\n  Unfortunately, some Democrats want to cater to the trial lawyers who \nwant the ability to file frivolous lawsuits and collect millions of \ndollars should something go wrong on a flight. Perhaps even more \nfrustrating is that they will not explain exactly why they are \nobjecting.\n  Aviation Week is a magazine I have subscribed to for many years. It \nis a publication I have grown to respect. I have read it with frequency \nover the years. It has an excellent article in its September 27, 2004, \nedition. It states:\n\n       One or more Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee are \n     holding up this bill, and, maddeningly, no one will say \n     publicly what they object to.\n\n  They are holding it up, and they won't say why they are holding it \nup.\n\n       If they do not pass it, part of their legacy may be that of \n     having strangled an infant industry in the crib.\n\n  I compliment the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain. He has \nbeen very helpful. But there are some Democrats we can't identify, as \nthe Aviation Week publication states.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these four pages of Aviation Week be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also want to call to the attention of \nthe Senate a letter from nine discrete enterprises that are on the \ncutting edge of this burgeoning industry. They all endorse the text of \nmy Space CHASE Act and call for the immediate passage of my legislation \nas a substitute language for a thus-perfected H.R. 3752.\n  I commend these entrepreneurs by name: Jeff Greason, XCOR Aerospace; \nJohn Carmack, Armadilla Aerospace; Elon Musk, Space X; George French, \nRocketplane, Ltd.; Eric Anderson, Space Adventures; Honorable Andrea \nSeastrand, California Space Authority; Bill Khourie, Oklahoma Space \nIndustry Development Authority; Brian Chase, Space Foundation; Greg \nAllison, Chairman, Executive Committee, National Space Society.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letter also be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is a shame when we pander to trial \nlawyers and allow them to kill an industry before it is able to get off \nthe ground.\n  I urge these Democrats to stop the obstruction and pass this \nimportant legislation that will let the American people have the \nfreedom to experience space, the final frontier.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        [From Aviation Week & Space Technology, September, 2004]\n\n                  Commercial Space--At a Tipping Point\n\n       ``I have such faith in the private sector that I've dreamed \n     of the day that government monopoly would be replaced by \n     commercialization or at least some form of partnership.'' \n     Those words, on the prospects of private manned spacecraft \n     and industrial space stations, were penned by President \n     Ronald Reagan in a letter to Aviation Week & Space \n     Technology's publisher in March 1985.\n       It has taken two decades, but now there are tangible \n     indications that such a dream could indeed become a reality. \n     Many of them are detailed in this week's cover story (see p. \n     54) and in the lead article of our World News and Analysis \n     section (see p. 26) But one of the most visible indications \n     is yet to come.\n       This week, Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne is set to make \n     the first of the two required flights to claim the $10 \n     million Ansari X-Prize far hauling three people (or an \n     equivalent mass) to the edge of space twice within two weeks. \n     The prize could be won as early as next week. Designer Burt \n     Rutan and/or the team's backer, Microsoft billionaire Paul \n     Allen, may even climb in for the ride.\n       Should Rutan's crew stumble, there are others fast on their \n     heels. A half-dozen or more serious competitors have spent \n     many times the prize money in developing their vehicles. That \n     is exactly what Peter Diamandis had in mind when he organized \n     the X-Prize Foundation a decade ago to seed a private human \n     spaceflight industry, and our hat is off to him.\n       Dating even further back, there were entrepreneurs saying \n     that making human spaceflight both reliable and affordable \n     was possible with existing technology. The problems, they \n     said, were not technical but financial and political, even \n     psychological.\n       Unintentionally, NASA made it hard for these pioneers to \n     attract capital. First, the agency was a competitor because \n     it operated its own expensive vehicle, the space shuttle. \n     Then, when NASA tried to develop a new, cheaper-to-operate \n     reusable vehicle, it opted to include challenging cutting-\n     edge technologies, making program execution difficult and \n     expensive. As one might expect, when entrepreneurs went \n     looking on Wall Street for money for their simpler projects, \n     they were rebuffed by potential investors who believed human \n     spaceflight was inherently costly, dangerous and prone to \n     failure.\n       On top of that was a chicken-and-egg problem of economics. \n     To drastically lower the costs of spaceflight, a vehicle \n     needs to fly frequently. But to find enough customers to fly \n     frequently, one needs to have low prices, and that requires \n     low costs. The solution seemed to lie in new markets, and the \n     one many believed could jump-start the private sector was \n     ``space tourism.''\n       When the Russians began selling spare seats on Soyuz \n     spacecraft to dot.com zillionaires and rock stars, it became \n     harder to posit the economic impossibility of space tourism. \n     But it was the first suborbital flight of SpaceShipOne to 100 \n     km. altitude, back in June, that removed the giggle factor \n     from discussions of space tourism. Pictures of pilot Mike \n     Melvill sitting atop his privately financed craft and waving \n     victoriously made the front pages of newspapers aroung the \n     world.\n       Meanwhile, things had changed in the government. Many in \n     Congress ``got religion'' on commercial space (more about \n     that later). NASA began working seriously with startups such \n     as Bigelow Aerospace on manned spacecraft. And Adminstrator \n     Sean O'Keefe bought into the prize paradigm, seeing to it \n     that the agency itself would sponsor some of these fledgling \n     enterprises.\n       This week, Robert T. Bigelow will make some news on that \n     front. He plans to announce a $50-million ``America's Space \n     Prize,'' an orbital analog to the X-Prize. To be sure, taking \n     humans into orbit and bringing them back safely is orders of \n     magnitude more difficult than taking them on a suborbital \n     ride, but don't dismiss the salutary effects of $50 million.\n       Prizes have an important and glorious place in the history \n     of flight, dating to the days of the Wrights, Curtiss and \n     Santos-Dumont. The revolution in public understanding of the \n     practicality and possibilities of aviation that Charles A. \n     Lindbergh wrought in laying claim to the $25,000 Orteig Prize \n     in 1927 is widely seen as having been a necessary ingredient \n     for the growth of an airline industry.\n       We night now be poised at a tipping point in public \n     understanding of the commercial possibilities of human \n     spaceflight. But if the X -Prize is to be remembered as \n     something more than a stunt, there must be a legal\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\n     framework in place for market-based spaceflight to grow.\n       There is a measure pending in Congress that would go a long \n     way to providing that framework--the Commercial Space Launch \n     Amendments Act of 2004 (H.R. 3752)--but it has been stalled \n     in the Senate for months. It would spell but FAA licensing \n     rules for suborbital flights. Most critically, the bill would \n     make it clear that paying passengers are ``spaceflight \n     participants'' who understand the risks. And it would require \n     them to sign waivers of legal liability. Without this \n     provision, the prospect of relatives of passengers suing and \n     collecting millions in damages following an accident would \n     likely scare off investors. And without outside investors, \n     many of today's space entrepreneurs will go out of business \n     in the not-too-distant future.\n       This bill is not some wild-eyed libertarian scheme. It \n     passed the House in March by a vote of 402-1. Science \n     Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert of New York, perhaps the \n     ``greenest'' Republican in the House, even went along with a \n     provision that would exempt these launchers from some \n     environmental regulations. Admitting he first thought the \n     legislation ``flighty,'' Boehlert says he came to see it as \n     essential: ``This is about a lot more than `joy rides' in \n     space, although there's nothing wrong with such an \n     enterprise. This is about the future of the U.S. aerospace \n     industry.''\n       One or more Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee are \n     holding up this bill, and, maddeningly, no one will say \n     publicly what they object to. Democrats say they want the job \n     growth the Bush administration has failed to deliver. If they \n     do, they ought to pass this bill. If they do not pass it, \n     part of their legacy may be that of having strangled an \n     infant industry in the crib.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Show Time\n\n                           (By Craig Covault)\n\n       The Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne suborbital vehicle that \n     will attempt this week and next to twice rocket above 100 km. \n     to claim the $10-million Ansari X-Prize highlights a major \n     new wave of commercial space activity taking stride into \n     early October.\n       The initiatives include the planned announcement this week \n     of a new, much larger $50-million ``America's Space Prize'' \n     to spur private development of an orbital space transport \n     that by 2010 could carry 5-7 astronauts to an orbiting \n     station.\n       The new America's Space Prize is being initiated by \n     millionaire developer Robert T. Bigelow who wants a low-cost \n     manned transport to take crews to Bigelow Aerospace \n     inflatable space modules under development in North Las \n     Vegas, Nev. (see cover and p. 54).\n       Until recently, individual commercial space ``wannabes'' \n     struggled for technical competence and respectability.\n       But a more business-like approach by commercial space \n     company managers coupled with their innovative use of \n     technology is enabling them to capture bigger government \n     contracts, such as the $42 million just awarded by the \n     Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) for quick \n     reaction launch developments.\n       The new commercial companies are also increasingly \n     ``breaking down the hidebound bureaucracies'' of NASA and the \n     larger aerospace companies, says Courtney Stadd, NASA's \n     former chief of staff. He says commercial space is beginning \n     to do this with a more diverse, and increasingly capable base \n     of dynamic new companies, staffed with younger engineers more \n     representative of the future than the past.\n       They are forming in effect ``a new national incubator for \n     technology and talent'' that aerospace industry can draw upon \n     for major innovation, says Stadd, who has long been \n     affiliated with commercial space start-ups.\n       Private/commercial ventures like SpaceShipOne carry an \n     inherent high-risk of failure, including the risk of a fatal \n     accident, But the new commercial space industry is far more \n     steeled to accept and recover from failure than it was \n     earlier, Stadd said.\n       Several new commercial space milestones have just occurred \n     or will occur by early October. They include:\n       SpaceShipOne X-Prize flights. The flights to capture the X-\n     Prize are set for Sept. 29 and Oct. 4. at Mojave, Calif. \n     Propulsion subcontractor SpaceDev of Poway, Calif., itself a \n     small commercial space company, has delivered to the Burt \n     Rutan team three new SpaceShipOne systems carrying more \n     synthetic rubber fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer than used \n     during the demonstration flight June 21 (AWST June 28, p. \n     28).\n       This is to provide more performance earlier in the profile \n     when the vehicle is in the lower, more dense, atmospheric \n     phase of flight. More performance at lower altitude is \n     necessary so the engine can more assuredly propel the \n     slightly heavier X-Prize configured vehicle higher than 62 \n     mi. altitude.\n       Canadian Da Vinci X-Prize attempt. The Canadian Da Vinci \n     Project plans to make its first try for the X-Prize with \n     launch of a manned rocket from a balloon 80,000 ft. over \n     Kindersley, Saskatchewan, as early as Oct. 2.

In a major new \n     development, SpaceDev has just signed an agreement with \n     the NASA Ames Research Center for technology collaboration \n     in the design of what initially would be a new higher-\n     performance commercial manned suborbital vehicle capable \n     of carrying 3-5 people to about 100 mi. altitude. This \n     compares with about 62 mi. for the 1-3-person \n     SpaceShipOne.\n       The new vehicle will be designed using the basic \n     aerodynamic shape of the Orbital Sciences/U.S Air Force X-34 \n     demonstrator that never flew before cancellation. The X-34 \n     concept, but not the original hardware, will be redesigned \n     for manned vertical launch on suborbital flights as early as \n     2008, depending upon the flow of commercial or government \n     funding for the program, said Jim Benson, SpaceDev chairman \n     and CEO. SpaceDev and Ames will work on potential utilization \n     of the vehicle by NASA, USAF or the private sector. Benson's \n     ultimate objective is to scale the Dream Chaser design to an \n     orbital vehicle.\n       SpaceX Falcon 1 to Vandenberg. The first privately \n     developed low-cost Falcon 1 unmanned orbital launch vehicle \n     has been completed by SpaceX at its El Segundo plant and is \n     to be taken late this week or early next to its launch pad at \n     Vandenberg AFB, Calif. This major milestone could lead to the \n     first launch by late November, if a static firing on the pad \n     can be completed before the Western Range closes for upgrades \n     throughout December, says Elon Musk, CEO of Space Exploration \n     Technologies (SpaceX).\n       Musk told Aviation Week & Space Technology he now has four \n     firm contracts with deposits for Falcon missions, including \n     one just signed with the Malaysian Space Agency. Two others \n     are from the U.S. government and one from Bigelow Aerospace \n     for launch of a Genesis one-third scale inflatable module.\n       Commercial Zero-G flights. Amerijet International of Fort \n     Lauderdale, Fla., has just become the first commercial \n     airline ever to receive FAA certification for commercial \n     parabolic weightless flight operations. The flights are to \n     begin Oct. 9, at about $3,000 per person. The project will \n     use a Boeing 727-200 to conduct parabolic tourist flights out \n     of the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood, Fla., International Airport \n     in connection with the Zero-6 Corp.\n       NASA Commercial Transportation Call. NASA has just issued a \n     comprehensive ``request for information'' sounding out the \n     aerospace industry for new concepts in commercial space \n     transportation services related to the agency's new \n     exploration initiative. It is the single most comprehensive \n     call for commercial space transportation concepts ever made \n     by the agency. Responses, on which new contracting can be \n     based, are due back next September.\n       Darpa/USAF Rapid Launch Awards. Nearly $42 million in \n     development contracts are just being awarded to four \n     companies, mostly commercial space start-ups, as Phase II in \n     the Darpa/USAF Falcon Small Launch Vehicle (SLV) program. The \n     effort is designed to lead to a much more rapid launch \n     capability for 1,000-lb. critical U.S. military satellites \n     for less than $5 million per mission.\n       Except for Lockheed Martin, which received $11.6 million, \n     all of the winners are small start-up companies. Lockheed's \n     concept builds on its Michoud, La., development of a hybrid \n     powered system burning nontoxic fuel and liquid oxygen (AWST \n     Feb. 3, 2003, p. 54).\n       There is a range of innovative launch concepts among the \n     commercial start-up companies that won, but only AirLaunch \n     would deploy its two-stage ``QuickReach'' liquid propellant \n     booster from a C-17 that could be staged from literally any \n     friendly airfield around the world.\n       It won $11.3 million to explore the concept that could \n     provide great launch flexibility. Several small commercial \n     space companies including Space Vector Inc. of Chatsworth, \n     Calif., and Universal Space Lines of Newport Beach, Calif., \n     are part of the AirLaunch team.\n       Another winner was Microcosm of El Segundo, Calif., that is \n     developing the simple liquid oxygen/kerosene pressure-fed \n     ``Scorpius'' engine system. Microcosm won $10.4 million to \n     further develop its 52-ft.-long Sprite launcher using a six-\n     barrel cluster of the engines to provide 120,000 lb. of \n     liftoff thrust.\n       SpaceX, also based in El Segundo, won $8 million for its \n     Falcon launcher. The project, by coincidence, has the same \n     name as the overall Air Force/Darpa program.\n       All of the selected companies are to conduct 10-month \n     preliminary design studies toward a downselect to one or more \n     competitors that will perform an actual launch in 2007.\n       But since SpaceX is more advanced in hardware fabrication \n     than the other competitors, Darpa and USAF have asked it to \n     perform an ``Early Responsive Launch Test'' with a Falcon 1 \n     launch about July 2005. Musk said the objective will be to \n     cut the Falcon's launch pad time by 50%--to just one week.\n       This Aviation Week & Space Technology editor recently saw \n     the first Falcon flight vehicle in final assembly at the \n     SpaceX plant in El Segundo.\n       It is being readied this week for the trip to Vandenberg \n     AFB and mounting on its launch pad.\n       The flight engines have completed their final pre-\n     integration qualification tests at SpaceX test facilities \n     near McGregor, Tex., and development engines and components \n     continue to be tested at the site. Earlier turbopump problems \n     have been solved. But some other engine components, earlier \n     made of aluminum, have been switched to Inconel because of a \n     hairline crack found in one several weeks ago.\n       The Falcon 1 first stage will likely end up weighing less \n     than its specification weight--a highly positive factor. This \n     is because earlier delays allowed the program enough time to \n     switch a composite interstage for a heavier aluminum \n     structure, saving about 150 lb.\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\n     Also switching the overall thrust frame from steel to \n     titanium has saved another 100 lb. These improvements will be \n     especially helpful when the vehicle eventually begins to \n     launch heavier payloads, Musk said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                               September 21, 2004.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Chair, Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation, 241 \n         Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Sam Brownback,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Science Technology, & Space, 303 Hart \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Ernest Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science, & \n         Transportation, 125 Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator John Breaux,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Science Technology, & Space, 503 Hart \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sirs, we are writing to respectfully urge that the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation \n     quickly report out and secure Senate passage of a perfected \n     H.R. 3752, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of \n     2004.\n       As you know, the U.S. commercial expendable launch vehicle \n     industry is challenged by a highly competitive international \n     market, and NASA's recent orbital reusable launch vehicle \n     development programs have not been successful. Fortunately, \n     the recent emergence of a suborbital reusable launch vehicle \n     industry demonstrates that American entrepreneurs are \n     bringing new private resources and ideas to bear on the vital \n     goal of advancing U.S. space transportation capabilities and \n     competitiveness, largely to pursue new commercial human \n     spaceflight markets.\n       The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 (CSLA) as amended \n     (49 U.S.C. 70101 et seq.) gives the Secretary of \n     Transportation sole regulatory authority over commercial \n     space transportation, which has been delegated to the FAA's \n     Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space \n     Transportation (ASST). That jurisdiction includes launches of \n     a `suborbital rocket' on a `suborbital trajectory,' but \n     unfortunately those terms were never defined in law. \n     Furthermore, the CSLA is silent on the issue of whether such \n     vehicles might carry persons. Therefore, confusion has \n     developed as to whether some of these suborbital RLVs might \n     be regulated as a rocket or an airplane, or worse still, as \n     both. Last summer a joint hearing of the Senate Science, \n     Technology, and Space Subcommittee and the House Space & \n     Aeronautics Subcommittee heard strong and unanimous testimony \n     that this regulatory uncertainty was a real and unnecessary \n     barrier to private investment in, and therefore the success \n     of, this new suborbital RLV industry, and that Congress \n     needed to fill in the ``legislative gap'' in the CSLA.\n       To address this issue, the House Science Committee crafted \n     H.R. 3752 after holding an additional public hearing, a \n     private forum, and extensive individual consultations with a \n     broad range of interested and disinterested parties. The \n     legislation not only creates the regulatory clarity needed by \n     industry, but strikes an important balance among competing \n     public policy objectives.\n       For example, the legislation continues the CSLA's priority \n     of protecting the safety of the uninvolved public, and also \n     affirms FAA/AST's authority to set safety-related \n     requirements for crew in these new vehicles. H.R. 3752 and \n     its committee report also directs FAA to promulgate \n     regulations requiring the full disclosure of the safety \n     records of human spaceflight vehicles and their operating \n     companies to all prospective customers, giving them informed \n     consent. (This is very different from the laissez faire \n     approach which existed during the barnstorming days of \n     aviation.)\n       The bill also creates a new, streamlined experimental \n     permit regime that allows for expedited review of non-revenue \n     flight test of vehicles so that companies can demonstrate \n     safe operating records before proceeding to revenue flight. \n     It should be noted that flights under experimental permits \n     would not be eligible to receive federal indemnification \n     against third party claims, and even during revenue flight \n     the spaceflight participants would not be eligible to receive \n     indemnification.\n       For all of these reasons, H.R. 3752 was sponsored by the \n     committee's bipartisan leadership, and passed the House of \n     Representatives by the overwhelming vote of 402 to 1 in March \n     of this year.\n       In recent months, Congressional staff, the FAA, and various \n     industry participants have developed compromise language that \n     would provide greater clarity over regulatory jurisdiction of \n     so-called hybrid suborbital rockets. With these changes, \n     which are attached to this letter, H.R. 3752 is ready for \n     final consideration in and passage by the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the full \n     Senate.\n       We, the undersigned leaders of this industry and supporting \n     public policy organizations, therefore respectfully urge you \n     to support this consensus amendment and send a perfected H.R. \n     3752 to the Senate floor this month for passage by unanimous \n     consent so it can be reconsidered by the House and enacted \n     into law before the November election.\n           Truly yours,\n         Jeff Greason, XCOR Aerospace; Elon Musk, Space X; Eric \n           Anderson, Space Adventures; Bill Khourie, Oklahoma \n           Space Industry Development Authority; Greg Allison, \n           Chairman, Executive Committee National Space Society; \n           John Carmack, Armadillo Aerospace; George French, \n           Rocketplane, Ltd; Hon.

HERBERT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in our closing tonight, we are going to \nadvance a number of military officers who have been reported out of the \nArmed Services Committee today.\n  It was with a special pleasure today that I spoke to Senator Levin \nand he told me that COL Robert T. Herbert had been reported out of the \nArmed Services Committee. Robert T. Herbert runs my Las Vegas office. \nSeventy-two percent of the people in the State of Nevada live in the \nMetropolitan Las Vegas area. He has an extremely important, responsible \njob for the people of the State of Nevada to make sure that what goes \non in Nevada--especially on a Federal level--is something that he is \naware of and I am aware of. He does a wonderful job. He is such a good \nperson. Tonight, he will be no longer a Lieutenant Colonel but will \nbecome a full Colonel in the Nevada Army National Guard.\n  My friend, Bob Herbert, grew up as the son of a military man, retired \nMaster Sergeant Robert W. Herbert. Bob, my employee, decided at an \nearly age that he wanted to become a military pilot. So even before he \ngraduated from high school, he joined the Army. Of course, he is well \neducated. He did graduate from high school. He now has a master's \ndegree from George Washington University. He worked very hard to get \nthat. He graduated from high school in Slinger, WI, and went to basic \ntraining, and then on to flight school. He was immediately thereafter \nassigned to Germany where he flew patrols along the borders between \nEast and West Germany. This, as we all know, were the front lines of \nthe Cold War.\n\n  After he was reassigned from Germany, Colonel Herbert completed his \nundergraduate work at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He then \nwent to test pilot school and became an Army test pilot.\n  As a test pilot, he flew helicopters which, as we all know, are so \nimportant not only in modern military missions but also for important \njobs at home, such as fighting fires and the emergency transport of \naccident victims.\n  I just finished a telephone conversation with my friend Don \nPhillips--my friend of longstanding who lives in Lincoln County, NV, in \nCaliente actually, 145 miles from Las Vegas--and a helicopter took his \nwife Dorothy to a hospital in Las Vegas where she is very ill. \nHelicopters are important for all kinds of uses.\n  All these years, Bob has been moving around from place to place, and \nhe wanted someplace to settle down. One of his fellow test pilots was a \nman named Randy Sayre who was from Fallon, NV. He told Colonel Herbert \nwhat hundreds of thousands of other people have discovered--that Nevada \nis a great place to live.\n  So when Bob got out of the Army, he moved to Reno and joined the \nNevada Army National Guard. About that time, as a member of the \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee, I learned that Bob Herbert was \nreally good. He is someone whom I met. He had connections in the \nmilitary circles in Nevada. I had heard about Bob, that he was not only \ngood with military matters but also good with numbers.\n  At my request, he arranged to come to Washington and work in \nWashington as a fellow with the Brookings Institution. He was assigned \nto me. During that time, I had the privilege of pinning Bob with his \nLieutenant Colonel insignia when he made that rank.\n  I also grew to depend on his judgment and advice, not just about \nmilitary matters but about many other\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nissues. He was able to make decisions and had a lot of common sense.\n  When his fellowship was finished, he joined my staff here in \nWashington. He worked on military and veterans affairs, and \ntransportation and technology issues. He came to work here in my \nWashington office while continuing to serve his Guard unit in Nevada.\n  As I mentioned earlier, he also earned a master's degree in public \nadministration from George Washington University, my alma mater, \nworking full time when he was doing this.\n  He worked for me 4 years back here, and I asked him if he would \nreturn to Nevada. He is not from Las Vegas. He is from northern Nevada, \nReno, but being the good soldier he is, he agreed to do this.\n  He has done a tremendous job in this very demanding position, and \nduring all this, he continues to fulfill all his duties in the Army \nNational Guard.\n  Colonel Herbert now has 29 years of service, which you would never \nbelieve if you met him because he looks so young. He is the State Army \nAviation Officer, meaning he is in charge of all the Army aviation \nguard in Nevada.\n  He has more than 7,000 hours as a pilot, and that time is split about \nhalf with helicopters and half with airplanes.\n  In the Nevada Army National Guard, they mostly fly helicopters. They \nhave the OH-58, which is used in counterdrug trafficking and the \nBlackhawk, which is an air ambulance unit, and the Chinook, which is \nused for heavy lifting and is especially useful for fighting fires. \nThey also have a KingAir airplane.\n  We all trust people who work for us. We trust their judgment, and we \nrely on their experience and skill, but I literally trust Bob Herbert \nwith my life, as he has flown me to various places around the State of \nNevada.\n  I am very proud of this man, the way he represents me, the State of \nNevada, and the Senate. I know all Nevadans are proud not only of \nColonel Herbert but all the brave men and women who are serving our \nState and our Nation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMOVAL OF COSPONSORSHIP\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, tomorrow marks the beginning of October, \ncelebrated nationally as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. \nEarlier this week, this body unanimously passed a resolution that \ncommemorates National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and renews the \nSenate's commitment to raise awareness about domestic violence and its \ndevastating impact on families. While the Violence Against Women Act \nhas been law for 10 years, none of us can afford to stop talking about \ndomestic violence and encouraging victims to come forward and seek \nhelp.\n  Throughout the month, cities, organizations, businesses, religious \ninstitutions, and many others are organizing events to commemorate \nNational Domestic Violence Awareness Month. For instance, Marie Claire \nmagazine and Liz Claiborne Inc. have joined forces to create ``Its Time \nto Talk'' Day on October 14 to encourage greater public dialogue about \ndomestic violence. Around the country, media personalities, \ngovernmental officials, domestic violence advocates, businesses and the \npublic-at-large will be taking a moment--or more--to talk openly about \nthis ``dirty little secret'' that affects nearly one in three women in \nthis country.\n  The health care community has designated October 13 as Health Care \nCares About Domestic Violence Day to raise awareness, and encourage \ndoctors and nurses to screen for domestic violence while delivering \nroutine and emergency care. On October 7, Marshall's will donate a \npercentage of that day's sales from all of its stores to organizations \nfighting domestic violence. Many communities, from Morrisville, VT to \nLake Charles, LA, are holding candlelight vigils to remember and honor \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  I cannot overestimate the importance of these local and national \nevents that spotlight domestic violence and enlist the whole community \nto get involved. While much progress has been made at the local, State \nand Federal level to hold batterers accountable with serious \nconsequences and treat victims with dignity, the scourge of domestic \nviolence is far from over. Progress is not mission accomplished.\n  Tragic statistics reveal the stark truth that we cannot turn our \nattention away from fighting domestic violence. On average, each day \nmore than three women are murdered by this husbands or boyfriends. \nNearly one in three women experience at least one physical assault by a \npartner during her lifetime. In a recent poll, nine in ten women said \nthat ending domestic violence was their number one priority. One in \nfive adolescent girls becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, or \nboth, in a dating relationship. In addition to the incalculable human \ncosts of domestic violence, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention recently found that violence against women costs our \ncountry in excess of $5.8 billion each year.\n\n  As resolute police chiefs retire, State task forces reorganize or \ncommitted district attorneys are replaced by newly elected leaders, we \nmust ensure that the messages, protocols, policies, and dialogues \nfostered by the Violence Against Women Act become institutionalized \nacross the country. We need to usher the Act into the 21st century and \nimplement it with the next generation--recent police academy graduates \nwho want to be trained on handling family violence, newly elected state \nlegislators who want to update State laws on stalking, and the next \ngeneration of children who must be taught that abuse will not be \ntolerated.\n  Next year the Senate will have the opportunity to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act which may make improvements to core \nprograms, tighten criminal penalties and create new solutions to \nchallenges facing battered women. Some of the initiatives suggested \ninclude school-based programs to treat the millions of children who \nwitness domestic violence, home visitation programs to prevent family \nviolence, targeted training and education about domestic violence for \nhealth professionals, and greater transitional housing resources. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to craft a comprehensive and \nbalanced Violence Against Women Act of 2005.\n  In the meantime, I thank the countless men and women working \ntirelessly in their hometowns to end domestic violence. As I have said \nbefore, these advocates, lawyers, service providers, judges, police, \nnurses, shelter directors and many more, are saving lives, one woman at \na time. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we have a \nchance to acknowledge their hard work, talk loud and clear about \ndomestic violence and support the courageous women escaping violent \nhomes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10055-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

He has \nsince served as ambassador in numerous posts, most recently as \nambassador to the Russian Federation. Prior to this assignment, he \nserved as non-resident ambassador to Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and \nEstonia; ambassador to France and non-resident ambassador to Greece; \nambassador to Egypt; and ambassador to Spain. While serving in Cairo, \nAmbassador Al-Dafa was his country's permanent representative to the \nArab League. Prior to serving as ambassador to the United States, \nAmbassador Al-Dafa served as the director of European and American \naffairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Doha.\n  As ambassador to the United States, Bader Omar Al-Dafa's solid \nunderstanding of America and over 25 years of diplomatic experience \nstrengthens the warm relationship between our two countries. His \nefforts to build relationships and foster understanding between \nAmerica, Qatar and the Arab world through his work and his support for \ninitiatives in the Arab-American community have earned him the respect \nand admiration of my colleagues in Congress and the citizens of \nMichigan.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Ambassador Al-Dafa for \nhis distinguished service and the prestigious honor that Western \nMichigan University will confer on him. I extend to him my hopes for \ncontinued success and for an enduring relationship between our two \ncountries. I also extend my best wishes to Ambassador Al-Dafa's wife, \nAwatef Mohamed Al-Dafa, and their three children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10056-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             A REAL THREAT TO SATELLITE TELEVISION SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1998 and 1999 over 2 million families \nwere faced with the prospect of losing the ability to receive one or \nmore of their satellite television network stations. Back then, \nCongress acted and not only protected access to those stations but also \nexpanded consumer opportunities to receive more programming options.\n  This time around the story may not have such a happy ending. As we \nnear the end of the session, I grow more concerned that Congress will \nnot have time to pass a reauthorization of the Satellite Home Viewer \nAct. This is especially disappointing because many members of the other \nbody and many Senators have worked diligently to craft legislative \nlanguage that would be a boon to public television, the satellite \nindustry, the movie, music and television industries, and to satellite \ndish owners throughout America.\n  Indeed, families who own satellite dishes may end up being the big \nlosers if provisions of that act are not extended. Many midwestern and \nRocky Mountain States have vast areas where satellite dish owners \nreceive imported network stations such as ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox. \nThousands of these families do not have any other choices. They do not \nhave access to TV stations over-the-air because of mountain terrain or \ndistance from the broadcast towers. They do not have access to cable \nbecause of the rough terrain or the lack of population density which \nmakes it economically impossible for cable companies to invest. Without \naccess to network stations via satellite, over-the-air, or cable those \nfamilies will no longer be able to receive national news programming or \nother network TV programming.\n  If Congress does not reauthorize provisions of current law by \nDecember 31, 2004, hundreds of thousands of households will lose \nsatellite access to network TV stations. Since information about \nsubscribers is proprietary it is difficult for me to tell you exactly \nhow many families will be affected by this, but I assure you it is not \na small number.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee got its job done in June. We reported \na great bill out of Committee without a single amendment and without a \nsingle nay vote. That bill does far more than just protect satellite \ndish owners from losing signals. At the time I pointed out that the new \nsatellite bill ``protects subscribers in every State, expands viewing \nchoices for most dish owners, promotes access to local programming, and \nincreases direct, head-to-head, competition between cable and satellite \nproviders.''\n  I continued by saying that, ``easily, this bill will benefit 21 \nmillion satellite television dish owners throughout the nation, and I \nam happy to note that over 85,000 of those subscribers are in \nVermont.''\n  The Senate and House Judiciary Committee-reported bills go far beyond \nprotecting what current subscribers receive. The bills allow additional \nprogramming via satellite through adoption of the so-call \n``significantly viewed'' test now used for cable, but not satellite \nsubscribers. That test means that, in general, if a person in a cable \nservice area that historically received over-the-air TV reception from \n``nearby'' stations outside that area, those cable operators could \noffer those station signals in that person's cable service area. In \nother words, if you were in an area in which most families in the past \nhad received TV signals using a regular roof-top antenna then you could \nbe offered that same signal TV via cable. By having similar rules, \nsatellite carriers will be able to directly compete with cable \nproviders who already operate under the significantly viewed test. This \ngives home dish owners more choices of programming.\n  In the past, Congress got the job done. Congress worked well together \nin 1998 and 1999 when we developed a major satellite law that \ntransformed the industry by allowing local television stations to be \ncarried by satellite and beamed back down to the local communities \nserved by those stations. This marked the first time that thousands of \nTV owners were able to get the full complement of local network \nstations. In 1997 we found a way to avoid cutoffs of satellite TV \nservice to millions of homes and to protect the local affiliate \nbroadcast system. The following year we forged an alliance behind a \nstrong satellite bill to permit local stations to be offered by \nsatellite, thus increasing competition between cable and satellite \nproviders.\n  We also worked with the Public Broadcasting System so they could \noffer a national feed as they transitioned to having their local \nprogramming beamed up to satellites and then beamed back down to much \nlarger audiences.\n  Because of those efforts, in Vermont and most other States, dish \nowners are able to watch their local stations instead of getting \nsignals from distant stations. Such a service allows television \nwatchers to be more easily connected to their communities as well as \nproviding access to necessary emergency signals, news and broadcasts.\n  I hope we are able to work together to finish this important \nsatellite television bill in the few remaining days of this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10056-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10056-S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A SOLEMN ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this fall marks a solemn 2nd anniversary of \nthe sniper attacks which terrorized the Washington, DC area and the \ncountry for 3 weeks in 2002. In October of that year, John Allen \nMohammad, who was sentenced to death, and John Lee Malvo who was \nsentenced to life imprisonment, indiscriminately shot 13 innocent \npeople, killing ten.\n  In a settlement that marked victory for the 2002 sniper shooting \nvictims, Bushmaster Firearms, manufacturer of the XM-15 assault rifle \nused in the attacks, agreed to pay $550,000 in damages for negligence \nleading to criminal\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\nviolence in connection with the shooting spree.\n  According to reports, Bushmaster continued to sell firearms, \nincluding the XM-15 assault rifle used in the sniper shootings, to \nBull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA, even after several ATF audits \ndocumented the dealer's inability to responsibly account for its \ninventory of weapons. Reports indicate that 238 guns had gone missing \nfrom Bull's Eye's inventory and over 50 had been traced to criminal \nacts since 1997. As part of the settlement with victims, Bull's Eye has \nagreed to pay $2 million for its negligence in failing to account for \nthe assault rifle that ended up in the hands of the snipers.\n  Earlier this year, I voted with 89 of my colleagues to defeat S. \n1805, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. That bill would \nhave weakened the legal rights of gun violence victims by terminating a \nwide range of pending and prospective civil cases against members of \nthe gun industry. The victims of the sniper shootings would have lost \ntheir ability to sue Bushmaster Firearms and Bull's Eye Shooter Supply \nhad S. 1805 become law.\n  For the families and victims impacted by the 2002 sniper attacks, no \namount of money will replace their loss and suffering. However, we \nshould continue to pursue sensible gun safety legislation, including \nreinstating the expired assault weapons ban, to help prevent future gun \ncrimes and improve the security of communities across our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10057-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STUDENT LOAN ABUSE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Student \nLoan Abuse Prevention Act. I am pleased to join Senator Murray as a \ncosponsor of the measure. This bill would amend the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 to end the siphoning of taxpayer dollars to pay exorbitant \ninterest rates on student loans.\n  A special class of student loans, financed by tax-exempt bonds issued \nbefore October 1993, has become a goldmine for the companies that hold \nthem. In the 1980s, Congress created the Guaranteed Student Loan \nProgram, now known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program, or \nFFELP, to keep college loans accessible and affordable for students. \nFacing high interest rates, the program guaranteed lenders an interest \nrate of 9.5 percent to entice them to join the program.\n  Congress intended to end the special treatment of tax-exempt bonds \nwith the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. But the way in \nwhich the grandfather clause for pre-existing bonds was drafted has had \nthe opposite effect. Two loopholes have allowed student loan companies \nto profit widely as they recycle old tax exempt bonds to produce new \nsubsidies. The first loophole has extended the life of these bonds. If \nthe lender refinances an old bond, it is still treated as an old bond \nbut with a longer life. The second loophole allows for the volume of \nloans receiving this excessive subsidy to grow. Even if a tax-exempt \nbond finances a loan only temporarily, that loan is permanently treated \nas if it was financed by a tax-exempt bond.\n  The serial refinancing of loans is an accounting trick that ratchets \nup the subsidies the Government must pay. In fiscal year 2001, the 9.5 \npercent guarantee cost American taxpayers approximately $200 million. \nNow GAO and others have estimated that the cost is nearly five times \ngreater this year. That is a billion dollars in unnecessary subsidies. \nThis windfall has a secondary effect. U.S. News & World Report credits \nthis ``obscure loophole in federal law'' with giving private lenders \nthe financial latitude to lure colleges and universities away from the \ndirect loan process.\n  Old loans are very much alive and multiplying in plain sight of \nFederal regulators. Lenders use the 9.5 percent bond funds to finance a \nset of loans for as little as one day and that new loan earns a 9.5-\npercent guaranteed return for life. Nelnet, the Nebraska based National \nEducation Loan Network, is the lender that has exploited 9.5 percent \nloans more aggressively than any other, increasing its 9.5 percent \nholdings nearly tenfold in the last 18 months.\n  These subsidies have already consumed a disproportionate share of the \nNation's financial dollars. Although loans carrying the 9.5 percent \nsubsidy rate account for no more than 8 percent of the FFEL Program, \nthey have soaked up 78 percent of all subsidies paid to lenders under \nthe program in the current fiscal year. We need to halt and reverse the \nexplosive growth of 9.5-percent loans. Each day of delay allows more \nloans to be converted to 9.5-percent loans, enriching lenders and \nundermining the direct loan program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill to end this outdated \nsubsidy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10057-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BUTLER UNIVERSITY POLICE OFFICER JAMES L. DAVIS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and honor the \nlife of James Davis, a Butler University Police Officer who was killed \nin the line of duty on September 24, 2004. Officer Davis was shot down \nby a gunman while investigating reports of a suspicious person inside \nHinkle Fieldhouse, the campus arena.\n  On Friday morning, Officer Davis left his patrol car to seek out a \nman who had refused to exit Hinkle Fieldhouse where students were \npracticing basketball. A member of Butler's police force since January \n2003, Officer Davis, a 31-year-old husband and father of three had his \nentire life before him when he confronted the suspect, a selfless act \nthat would cost him his life.\n  Officer Davis graduated from Indiana University in 1995 with a double \nmajor in criminal justice and Afro-American studies before entering his \ncareer of service. After retiring from the Army as a military \npoliceman, Officer Davis spent a year supervising juvenile offenders as \na youth service officer for the Indiana Department of Transportation. \nHe also worked as a drill instructor for troubled youth in a program \ncalled Project Impact.\n  Above all, Officer Davis was a devoted family man who relished his \ntime with loved ones. He dedicated his life to the noblest of causes; \nhis family, his job and keeping others safe. Officer Davis leaves \nbehind his wife, Veleeda and his three young children, Josiah, 8, \nJarren, 3, and Jaedyn, who will be two in December. May his children \ngrow up knowing that their father was a brave, hard-working and loving \nman.\n  In the wake of his death, friends, neighbors and fellow officers came \ntogether to remember and celebrate the life of Officer Davis. Butler \nPolice Chief David Selby described Officer Davis to the Indianapolis \nStar as ``an outstanding officer . . . and a very good friend to all of \nus,'' adding that he would be missed by many. Those who knew him well \nrecall Officer Davis' dedication to his job and his efforts to help \ntroubled teens. A friend remembered Officer Davis' strong belief that \nthere were ``no bad children, just children who made bad decisions or \ncame from a bad environment.''\n  Throughout his career, Officer Davis distinguished himself as a \npoliceman who genuinely cared about the students he was working to \nprotect. Students recall him as someone who could be counted on for a \nsafe ride home from class if he spotted them walking alone in the dark \nand by fellow officers as a devoted member of their team. His brave and \ncaring actions leave behind an unforgettable impression of the kind of \nman he was.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of James L. Davis into the United \nStates Congressional Record. As Officer Davis rests with God in eternal \npeace, let us never forget the courage and sacrifice he displayed when \nhe laid down his life on September 24, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10057-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10057-S10058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, earlier this week the John D. \nand Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation selected an outstanding Alaskan, \nKatherine Gottlieb, as one of 23 distinguished Americans who have been \ndesignated MacArthur Foundation Fellows for 2004. The MacArthur \nFellowship is better known as the ``Genius Award'' and that term aptly \ndescribes my friend, Katherine Gottlieb.\n  Katherine, who is of Aleut and Filipino descent, is the Chief \nExecutive Officer of Southcentral Foundation, which provides primary \nhealth care services to some 40,000 Alaska Natives in Anchorage and \nSouthcentral Alaska. Southcentral Foundation is also a partner in the \nmanagement and operation of the cutting edge Alaska Native Medical \nCenter.\n  Notwithstanding her lofty title, Katherine is no ``corner office'' \nexecutive. Her first job at Southcentral Foundation's headquarters in \nAnchorage was receptionist. She took the job while undertaking \nundergraduate work at Alaska Pacific University. She worked her way up \nthe ranks at Southcentral Foundation and went on to earn an MBA at \nAlaska Pacific University.\n  But Katherine didn't go to school in Anchorage to prepare for a \ncareer in healthcare. By the time she arrived in Anchorage, she had \nalready demonstrated her commitment to the wellbeing of her Native \npeople. Katherine began her healthcare career as a community health \naide in her hometown of Seldovia, AK, a community of about 306 people \nwhich is not connected by road to the rest of Alaska, much less the \ncontinental United States.\n  In the roadless villages of rural Alaska, community health aides \nprovide the link between the patient and medical resources available in \nthe larger communities. Alaska's Community Health Aides are the front \nline health providers in our last frontier.\n  Perhaps it was this formative experience that led Katherine to \nchampion the implementation of a patient centered healthcare delivery \nmodel at Southcentral Foundation. The MacArthur Foundation does not \nofficially explain which qualities led them to select a particular \nnominee as a fellow. They explain that the fellowship is an investment \nin a person's originality, insight and potential.\n  But their announcement offers some clues about what led the \nfoundation to select Katherine. The announcement observes that \nKatherine, by championing this patient centered delivery model, has \ntransformed health care and related health programs in her Alaska \nNative community.\n  On February 10, 2003, Dr. Douglas Eby, Southcentral Foundation's Vice \nPresident for Medical Services, accepted the Indian Health Service \nPhysician Leader of the Year Award. In his acceptance address he \ndescribed the genesis of the patient centered delivery system as \nfollows:\n\n       The Native community and Southcentral Foundation asked for \n     a primary care system that was truly centered on the needs \n     and wants of the patient and family, that was built on the \n     foundational strengths and values already present in the \n     Native community, that fully partnered with the patient and \n     family, providing them with the information and tools they \n     needed in their journey toward wellness, that provided \n     optimal quality and access to every single Alaska Native and \n     American Indian eligible for services . . . What we did was \n     to take the best pieces of programs we could find nationally \n     and internationally that supported the vision of the \n     Anchorage Native community and Southcentral Foundation \n     leadership and created our own system of care.\n       This system allows over 40,000 individuals and families to \n     choose their primary care provider, enter into a long-term \n     trusting relationship with them, have same day access for any \n     reason, and fully partner in their journey toward wellness. \n     It has resulted in these primary care patients decreasing \n     their daytime use of the Urgent Care Center and Emergency \n     Room by about 50%, use of specialty clinics by over 30% and \n     total primary care visits by about 20%. Quality of care \n     measures such as immunization rates, cancer screening rates, \n     depression screening/treatment, chronic pain screening/\n     treatment, etc. have all maintained or significantly \n     improved. Patient satisfaction measures have been very \n     positive. Support systems such as health education, \n     nutrition, and social services have been fully integrated \n     into the system.\n\n  Dr. Eby pointed out in that acceptance address that the patient \ncentered health care model would not have been implemented without the \nvisionary leadership of Katherine Gottlieb. In Dr. Eby's words, ``This \njourney was going to happen. Katherine Gottlieb would accept nothing \nless.''\n  The patient centered health care initiative is one of Katherine's \nmany contributions. The MacArthur Foundation also took note of \nKatherine's creation of the Family Wellness Warriors Initiative, which \nseeks to revitalize the traditional role of Alaska Native men as \nprotectors and providers, making them less inclined to fall into a \npattern of domestic abuse.\n  They acknowledged Katherine's leadership with respect to the Dena A \nCoy Residential Treatment Center, which is the first residential \nfacility for pregnant women in the United States focusing on prevention \nof fetal alcohol disorders and Pathway Home, a transitional living \ncenter which addresses the challenges of substance abuse, violence and \nsuicide among Native teenagers.\n  These are just a few of the 75 medical, behavioral health and \ncommunity services that moved the MacArthur Foundation to conclude, \n``Under Katherine Gottlieb's leadership, the Southcentral Foundation \nnetwork has demonstrated that high-quality health care and effective \npreventive services are possible, even in communities facing obstacles \nof poverty and geographic isolation.''\n  Alaska has known for many years what a treasure we have in Katherine \nGottlieb. Now the Nation knows too. But Katherine is not one to rest on \nher laurels. An innovator and an entrepreneur, I have no doubt that \nthis recognition will spur Katherine to even greater heights. But one \nthing is for sure. Katherine Gottlieb will never forget where she came \nfrom. She is anchored by the strength of her faith and her values and \ngrounded by her Native heritage.\n  I join with all Alaskans in congratulating Katherine Gottlieb on this \nextraordinary accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10058-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10058-S10059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagree to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4520) \nentitled ``An Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to remove \nimpediments in such Code and make our manufacturing, service, and high \ntechnology businesses and workers more competitive and productive both \nat home and abroad'', and agree to the conference asked by the Senate \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and appoints the \nfollowing members of the conference on the part of the House:\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\n  From the Committee on Ways and Means, for consideration of the House \nbill and the Senate amendment, and modifications committed to \nconference: Messrs.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase \nthe amount of the military death gratuity from $12,000 to $50,000; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Military \nDeath Gratuity Improvement Act of 2004.'' This legislation would raise \nthe military death gratuity paid to the families of military personnel \nkilled while on active duty from $12,000 to $50,000. This increase \nwould also be applied retroactively to all service members on active \nduty who have died since September 11, 2001.\n  The military death gratuity is money provided within 72 hours to \nfamilies of service members who are killed while on active duty. These \nfunds assist next-of-kin with their immediate financial needs.\n  As we face the challenges of the 21st Century, servicemen and women \nsacrificing for their country in a time of war should be assured that \ntheir families will be taken care of. The loss of a loved one is a \ntremendous emotional hardship for families. Congress must do what it \ncan to ensure that it does not cause devastating financial hardship as \nwell.\n  This bill will help alleviate some of the financial hardships faced \nby the families of our brave servicemen and women who give their lives \nin service to our country.

A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to extend \ncertain consumer protections to international remittance transfers of \nfunds originating in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInternational Remittance Consumer Protection Act of 2004. This \nlegislation extends basic consumer protection rights to those who send \nremittances, and it creates new avenues and incentives for federally \ninsured financial institutions to provide remittance and basic banking \nservices to those who currently do not use such institutions to send \nremittances.\n  The practice of sending remittances is not new. Immigrants to the \nUnited States traditionally have used remittances to provide financial \nassistance to family members who remained in their country of origin, \nbut the practice has been largely overlooked; it has not been \nsystematically studied and its implications have not been fully \nunderstood. The 2000 census shows that 30 million people in this \ncountry are foreign-born--the largest number in our Nation's history \nand the vast majority of them--22 million--are citizens or legal \nresidents. More than 40 percent of our Nation's foreign-born population \nimmigrated to the United States in the 1990s, and some 15.4 million, or \nmore than half the immigrant community, have come from Latin American \ncountries. Immigrants make a vital contribution to the economic and \nsocial life of our Nation.\n  In a recent study, Sending Money Home: Remittances to Latin America \nfrom the US, 2004, the Inter-American\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nDevelopment Bank (IADB) found that nationwide over 60 percent of Latin \nAmerican immigrants send remittances. On average, each immigrant sends \n$240 at a time, 12 times per year. Although these individual \ntransactions are not large, they have constituted an aggregate amount \nof over $30 billion from America to our Latin American neighbors in \nthis year alone.\n  In my State of Maryland, we have 175,000 immigrants from Latin \nAmerica and the vast majority send remittances back home. According to \nthe IADB's study 80 percent of Maryland's immigrants from Latin America \nsend remittances. The typical sender remits an average of $245, 14 \ntimes per year--in other words, remittances are a monthly matter, with \nspecial gifts for Christmas and Mother's Day.\n  The subject of remittances has been a major interest of mine for some \ntime. As chairman of the Banking Committee, in February, 2002, during \nthe 107th Congress, I chaired what I understand was the first \ncongressional hearing devoted exclusively to the subject. Dr. Manuel \nOrozco, a leading researcher on remittances at the Inter-American \nDialogue, told the committee that remittances from the U.S. to Latin \nAmerica had grown substantially--at that point to an estimated $20 \nbillion in 2001--and that between 15 to 20 percent--$3-$4 billion--was \nbeing lost in fees and other transaction costs. Since Dr. Orozco \ntestified, remittances to Latin America have grown by $10 billion, 50 \npercent, in just 3 years, and continued growth is expected.\n  That an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of the money sent in \nremittances is diverted to fees and other transaction costs, often \nhidden from the remittance sender, is evidence of the abusive practices \nthat exist in the remittance market. There are two primary factors that \naccount for this abuse. First, studies have shown that people who send \nremittances tend to be relatively low-wage earners, with modest formal \neducation and relatively little experience in dealing with this \ncountry's complex system of financial institutions. As a result they \nare susceptible to unscrupulous actors who can take advantage of them \nby charging all sorts of exorbitant fees, which are often hidden or \nmisrepresented. The exchange rate conversion is often the mechanism for \nthis abusive practice.\n  Second, remittances are currently not subject to the requirements set \nby Federal consumer protection law, including the disclosure of fees. \nThere is no requirement that a remittance transfer provider disclose to \nthe consumer the exchange rate fee that will be applied in the \ntransaction. Without knowing the exchange rate fee that the company is \ncharging, a consumer has little ability to gauge accurately the full \ncost of sending a remittance. As Sergio Bendixen, a leading researcher \nof public opinion and behavior, with a specialty among Hispanic \nconsumers, testified before the Banking Committee: ``an overwhelming \nmajority of Hispanic immigrants are unaware that their families in \nLatin America receive less money than what they send from the United \nStates.'' Further, a remittance sender cannot effectively shop between \nremittance transfer providers. The lack of basic information limits the \namount of competition in this market.\n  The legislation I am introducing today extends basic consumer rights \nto those who send remittances. Further, by requiring clear and \nunderstandable disclosures to the remittance sender of the cost of the \nremittance, thus presenting to the consumer the full cost of sending \nmoney, the legislation will enhance competition, which in turn should \nlead to an overall decrease in the cost of sending remittances. As \nSergio Bendixen testified to the Banking Committee, ``Full disclosure \nshould unleash market forces that, hopefully, will result in a \nsignificant reduction in the cost of sending cash remittances.''\n\n  This legislation amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), \nwhich is the primary vehicle for providing basic protections to most \npersons who engage in electronic transactions, to cover remittances, \nand to provide the basic rights associated with EFTA to remittance \ntransactions. The two most important components of EFTA are the \nrequirement of full disclosure of fees and the establishment of a \nprocess for the resolution of transactional errors. These rights have \nbeen an integral part of the regulations that govern our banking \ninfrastructure since EFTA's enactment in 1978. The new legislation will \nbuild upon the success of EFTA by extending these basic rights to \nremittance senders.\n  The cornerstone of this legislation is the requirement that \nremittance transfer providers make three key disclosures to their \nconsumers: (1) The total cost of the remittance, represented in a \nsingle dollar amount; (2) the total amount of currency that will be \nsent to the designated recipient, and (3) the promised date of delivery \nfor the remittance. These disclosures follow the core recommendations \nof the InterAmerican Development Bank, which in its publication, \nRemittances to Latin America and the Caribbean: Goals and \nRecommendations, states: ``Remittance institutions should disclose in a \nfully transparent manner, complete information on total costs and \ntransfer conditions, including all commissions and fees, foreign \nexchange rates applied and execution time.''\n  The total cost disclosure will include the cost of the exchange rate \nconversion as well as all up-front fees. This single item will both \ngive consumers a more accurate representation of the cost of the \nremittance transaction and allow consumers to more effectively compare \ncosts between remittance transfer providers.\n  In order to calculate the cost of the exchange rate conversion, which \nis part of the total cost, the legislation requires that the Treasury \nDepartment post on its website, on a daily basis, the exchange rate for \nall currencies. At present the Treasury receives this information on a \ndaily basis, but posts it only on a quarterly basis on the Treasury \nwebsite. By posting the information daily, the Treasury could create a \nuniform and credible source for exchange rate information.\n  To calculate the cost to the consumer of the exchange rate \ndifferential, remittance transfer providers will use the difference \nbetween the previous business day's exchange rate, as posted on the \nTreasury website, and the exchange rate that the remittance transfer \nprovider offers. Using the exchange rate posted by the Treasury will \nensure that the exchange rate cost is calculated on a uniform basis. \nWhen the exchange rate cost is disclosed to the consumer as part of the \ntotal cost of the remittance transfer, the consumer will be better able \nto understand the full cost of the transaction and to shop between \ndifferent remittance transfer providers.\n  In addition to fee disclosure requirements, this legislation \nestablishes an error resolution mechanism so that consumers whose \nremittance transactions experience an error have a fair, open, and \nexpedient process through which they may resolve those errors with the \ninstitution that conducted the flawed transaction. This basic right is \nalready afforded to consumers who are protected by EFTA, and now this \nright will be extended to cover consumers who send remittances as well. \nFurther, the legislation establishes an error resolution mechanism for \nremittance transfer errors that is responsive to the different types of \nerrors that can occur in a remittance transaction and is reflective of \nthe unique characteristics of the remittance market and its \nparticipants.\n  Under this legislation, a consumer has 1 year from the date that the \nremittance transfer company promised to deliver the money to notify the \ncompany that an error has occurred. The company is then required to \nresolve the error within 90 days. To resolve the error, the company \nmust either (1) refund the full amount of the remittance that was not \nproperly transferred, (2) resend that amount at no additional cost to \nthe consumer or the designated recipient, or (3) demonstrate to the \nconsumer that there was no error. The Federal Reserve Board is also \ngranted the authority to establish additional remedies for specific \nsituations that cannot be addressed by the three specific remedies that \nare described in the legislation.\n  It is urgent that we continue to encourage efforts to bring those who \nsend remittances into the financial mainstream. In his testimony to the \nBanking Committee, Dr. Orozco pointed out that, ``About two-thirds of \nimmigrants cash their salary checks in check cashing stores that charge \nexorbitant fees.\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nMany of these same immigrants then use what remains of their income to \nsend remittances back home. In this common scenario, immigrants are \npenalized in both receiving and sending their earnings.'' In order to \nfurther bank those who are currently unbanked, the legislation that I \nam introducing today requires that the Federal banking agencies and the \nNational Credit Union Administration provide guidelines to financial \ninstitutions regarding the offering of low-cost remittance transfers \nand no-cost or low-cost basic consumer amounts. This legislation also \namends the Federal Credit Union Act to allow credit unions to offer \nremittances and to cash checks for persons who are in their field of \nmembership but are not credit union members. The guidelines set out in \nthe legislation will help educate the financial services industry about \nthe importance and potential profitability of providing these services.\n\n  The sending of remittances in a fair and scrupulous manner is likely \nto be profitable for the institution that provides the remittance \nservice, and indeed we have begun to see aggressive moves into the \nremittance market by many of the largest banking institutions. \nIndividuals who send remittances but are currently unbanked represent \nan expanded and profitable customer base for financial institutions.\n  By its very nature, remittances is an issue that involves both the \nUnited States and other nations. As Professor Susan Martin of \nGeorgetown University, who also testified at our hearing, told the \nBanking Committee: ``Until relatively recently, researchers and policy \nmakers tended to dismiss the importance of remittances or emphasize \nonly their negative aspects . . . but recent work on remittances show a \nfar more complex and promising picture. . . Experts now recognize that \nremittances have far greater positive impact on communities in \ndeveloping countries than previously acknowledged.'' In fact, the size \nof the remittance market is such that for six Central American and \nCaribbean nations--Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Guyana and \nJamaica--remittances constitute more than 10 percent of GDP; Haiti and \nJamaica receive more in remittances than in revenues from trade. The \nWorld Bank estimates that Mexico receives more in remittances than it \ndoes in foreign direct investment. Reducing the costs of remittances is \nin the interest of both the United States and the countries that \nreceive them.\n  Given the growing importance of annual remittance flows, we must work \nto increase their efficiency. One mechanism for accomplishing this \nobjective, and for increasing the ability of financial institutions to \noffer remittances is linking our banking infrastructure with the \nbanking infrastructures of other nations. The Federal Reserve operates \nan international automated clearing house system (ACHi) that is \ncurrently linked to seven countries, of which the vast majority are \nhighly developed trading partners that receive relatively low levels of \nremittances. The ACHi was recently connected to Mexico, however, which \nwill allow financial institutions throughout the United States, \nespecially those institutions of smaller size, to provide remittance \nservices more easily and cheaply to Mexico. This legislation directs \nthe Fed to take into account the importance of remittance flows to \nother countries as it continues to expand the ACHi system. Linking the \nACHi to countries that receive significant remittances has the \npotential to result in great benefits to consumers who send remittances \nfrom America as well as to those who receive the remittances around the \nworld.\n  Finally, I am acutely aware of the need for better and more broadly \navailable financial literacy and education for all Americans. I am \npleased to report that in the last Congress, as part of the \nreauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we established a \nPresidential Financial Literacy and Education Commission, which is \ncharged with developing a national strategy to promote financial \nliteracy and education. The Act addresses the issue of remittances by \nincluding in the commission's work a focus on increasing the \n``awareness of the particular financial needs and financial \ntransactions, such as the sending of remittances of consumers who are \ntargeted in multilingual financial literacy and education programs and \nimprove the development and distribution of multilingual financial \nliteracy and education materials.'' The legislation that I am \nintroducing today builds on that framework by instructing the bank and \ncredit union regulators to work with the commission to specifically \nincrease the financial education efforts that target those persons who \nsend remittances.\n  Millions of Americans send remittances to family members around the \nworld, for a total far exceeding the $30 billion that goes to Latin \nAmerica alone. Yet almost all of these transactions take place without \nthe basic consumer rights and protections that apply to other \nelectronic transfers. Consumers who send remittances are often \nimmigrants and workers who earn modest wages, who are not aware of the \nfull costs of each remittance, as a practical matter have no way of \nfinding out and, as a consequence, in the aggregate pay billions of \ndollars in costs and hidden fees. They do not have available to them an \nestablished procedure for resolving transactional errors. This \nlegislation rectifies this situation by extending to remittances the \nbasic consumer rights established in EFTA. The bill also contains \nprovisions that, when implemented, will allow more insured financial \ninstitutions to provide remittance services--and potentially at lower \ncosts to consumers. The bill contains important provisions to help \nbring the unbanked--men and women without an account at a bank or \ncredit union--into the financial mainstream. Taken together, these \nmeasures will increase transparency, competition and efficiency in the \nremittance market, while helping to bring more Americans into the \nfinancial mainstream.\n\n  A broad range of community, civil rights, and consumer groups have \nendorsed this legislation including the National Council of La Raza, \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, United Farm Workers of America, the Farmworker Justice Fund, \nthe NAACP, Casa de Maryland, the National Federation of Filipino \nAmerican Associations, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, \nNational Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, Consumers Union, \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Consumer Law Center, the \nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition, the Center for Responsible \nLending, U.S. PIRG, ACORN, Woodstock Institute, and the National \nAssociation of Consumer Advocates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Intemational Remittance \nConsumer Protection Act be printed in the Record, together with letters \nin support of the bill from the National Council of La Raza, the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, Casa de Maryland, and a letter from \nConsumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer Law \nCenter, and U.S. PIRG.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2868\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \n         and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National Council of \n     La Raza (NCLR), the largest national Hispanic constituency-\n     based organization, I write to express our support for your \n     proposed legislation, the International Remittance Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2004.\n       As you know very well, the cost of sending remittances to \n     Latin America can be very high--as much as 12 percent per \n     transaction. Lack of competition in the remittance business, \n     which is dominated by a small number of companies that charge \n     higher fees than financial institutions, has kept prices \n     high. In addition to fees, consumers are often subject to \n     poor monetary exchange rates that are not fully disclosed. \n     These exorbitant fees and hidden charges adversely affect \n     many Latinos who send money regularly to Latin America. Many \n     of these remitters are working poor, and nearly half (43 \n     percent) do not have basic banking accounts to conduct simple \n     transactions.\n       For these reasons, we appreciated the opportunity to meet \n     with your staff and provide input regarding several issues \n     that affect Latino remittance senders. Specifically, we \n     support provisions in your bill that require disclosing \n     upfront all fees and exchange rates to consumers, most of \n     whom are immigrant and/or English language learners (ELL), in \n     languages and formats accessible to them; allow credit unions \n     to offer remittance and check cashing services to nonmembers \n     in the field of membership, which will connect remitters to \n     low-cost financial services facilitating their entry into the \n     financial mainstream; and assist the Federal Financial \n     Literacy Commission in informing remitters of new consumer \n     rights relating to remittance transactions via wire \n     transfers.\n       Again, thank you for soliciting our feedback on the \n     International Remittance Consumer Protection Act and for your \n     continued support of Latino and immigrant communities. We \n     look forward to working with you to ensure that immigrants \n     have access to information and make fully-informed choices \n     when wiring money to family members abroad. In the end, we \n     hope such legislative measures will provide remitters greater \n     access to mainstream banking tools and services to improve \n     their long-term financial security. We hope to work with you \n     to achieve these goals. Please do not hesitate to contact me \n     if I can be of assistance to you.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            [Sept. 30, 2004]\n\n   MALDEF Applauds Sarbanes Bill to Regulate Remittances and Protect \n                        Latinos' Consumer Rights\n\n      (By MALDEF President and General Counsel Ann Marie Tallman)\n\n       MALDEF applauds Senator Paul Sarbanes' (D-MD) introduction \n     of the International Remittance Consumer Protection Act of \n     2004. We believe this bill is the first step in the right \n     direction to improve Latino immigrants' access to banks, and \n     to protect their rights as consumers. This bill is long \n     overdue. MALDEF urges Congress to pass it into law and \n     protect Latino consumer rights.\n       Senator Sarbanes' International Remittance Consumer \n     Protection Act would bring remittance transfers under the \n     umbrella of protection of U.S. financial services laws. It \n     would make remittance transfers subject to the same set of \n     laws to which any other money transaction in the U.S. is \n     subject. Senator Sarbanes' bill would provide for basic \n     consumer protections for the millions of Latinos and the \n     billions of dollars they send through remittances, by \n     requiring full disclosure of all transfer fees, and a receipt \n     with such full disclosure in the language used by the \n     consumer. It would also provide for error resolutions and \n     reimbursements when family members overseas do not receive \n     the full amount of funds sent. The bill would also: (1) \n     permit credit unions to offer remittance and check cashing \n     services; (2) direct the Federal Reserve Board to provide \n     guidelines to encourage U.S. financial institutions to offer \n     low-cost remittance services and tap into this market; (3) \n     assist the Federal Financial Literacy Commission in improving \n     ``financial literacy'' of consumers who send remittances; and \n     (4) direct the General Accounting Office to study the \n     remittance market and report to Congress with its findings.\n       Latino immigrants' remittances represent the most important \n     source of ``development aid'' to most Latin American \n     countries. Hard-working Latino immigrants are making \n     essential contributions to the U.S. economy, and U.S. \n     financial institutions have benefited greatly from Latino \n     immigrants' money transfers or ``remittances.'' In keeping \n     with the tradition of American immigrants, more than 60 \n     percent of Latin American born adults generously send money \n     to their extended families in Latin America on a regular \n     basis. The volume is staggering--the International Monetary \n     Fund reported that over $30 billion in remittances are \n     expected to be sent from the United States to Latin America \n     in 2004. The Hispanic Association of Corporate Responsibility \n     reported that Mexico is the second-largest recipient, just \n     behind India, and that nearly 12 percent of remittances \n     worldwide go to Mexico. This market is unregulated, leaving \n     Latinos vulnerable to excessive processing fees imposed by \n     some remittance transfer agencies. As the PEW Hispanic Center \n     has reported, the fees have been inappropriately high, \n     reaching up to 20 percent. Even worse, some Latinos have had \n     their hard-earned money never reach their intended \n     recipients, or portions of their transfers have been skimmed \n     by unscrupulous agents.\n       For all these reasons, MALDEF thanks Senator Sarbanes for \n     the introduction of the International Remittance Consumer \n     Protection Act, and urges the Congress to enact this \n     essential piece of legislation as soon as possible, in order \n     to protect Latino consumer rights.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Leadership Conference on\n\n\n                                                 Civil Rights,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, Sept. 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, \n     largest and most diverse civil and human rights coalition, we \n     write to express our strong support for the ``International \n     Remittance Consumer Protection Act of 2004.'' LCCR greatly \n     appreciates your efforts to strengthen the rights of \n     consumers who send money overseas.\n       This important legislation will, for the first time, bring \n     remittances under the framework of federal consumer \n     protection law, and will encourage transparency and \n     competition in the remittance market. There are three key \n     components to the bill:\n       First, it establishes clear disclosure requirements for \n     remittance transfer companies, including the requirement that \n     the cost of the exchange rate conversion be included in the \n     total cost of the transfer. This cost is, at present, a \n     hidden fee through which consumers are unwittingly charged \n     excessive and abusive additional costs. The bill also takes \n     an innovate approach to calculating the exchange rate fee, so \n     consumers will be able to shop among different remittance \n     companies with the full knowledge of each company's prices.\n       Second, it creates an open and fair error resolution \n     process for remittance transfer errors. Currently, consumers \n     who send remittances do not have any guaranteed recourse to \n     recover money if a remittance transfer company fails to \n     deliver on its promises. The bill establishes an error \n     resolution mechanism for remittance transfer errors that is \n     responsive to the different types of errors that can occur in \n     a remittance transaction, and is reflective of the unique \n     characteristics of the remittance market and its \n     participants.\n       Finally, it requires Federal bank and credit union \n     regulators to encourage federally-insured financial \n     institutions to offer low-cost remittance services and no-\n     cost or low-\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\n     cost basic consumer bank accounts. It is estimated that half \n     of all remittance senders do not have a bank account, and \n     only one in ten consumers use banks to send remittances. This \n     requirement on the Federal regulators will further encourage \n     competition in the market and will assist in the critical \n     effort to bank the unbanked.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue, and we \n     look forward to working with you to enact the International \n     Remittance Consumer Protection Act of 2004.

This bill will \n     provide essential information and consumer protections to \n     hardworking people who send money to family members in other \n     countries, very significantly improving the operation of the \n     money transmission marketplace for consumers.\n       Consumers in the U.S. send a significant dollar volume of \n     international remittances using both financial institutions \n     and non-financial institutions. Money sent to family members \n     outside the U.S. represents hard-earned family income. As the \n     Inter-American Development Bank has said: ``The dramatic \n     growth of international remittances is testimony to the hard \n     work and commitment of migrant workers seeking better lives \n     for themselves and their families.'' Money transmission \n     costs, disclosures, and consumer rights are not an issue that \n     extends beyond recent immigrants. Consumers who are U.S. \n     citizens or longstanding residents also send money to family \n     members outside of the U.S.\n       U.S consumers sent $13.2 billion to Mexico in 2003, usually \n     in amounts of about $500 per transmission, according to a \n     report by the Pew Hispanic Center. According to the Inter-\n     American Development Bank, U.S. consumers send $38 billion a \n     year to Latin America and the Caribbean, often in amounts of \n     $200 to $300 per transmission. U.S. workers also send money \n     to India, the Philippines, and other countries.\n       Consumers who transmit funds internationally need the \n     protections that would be provided by the International \n     Remittance Consumer Protection Act of 2004. These protections \n     include plain disclosures before sending the money such as \n     the amount of foreign currency that will actually be sent to \n     the recipient in another country and the total cost of the \n     money transmission. The bill will require that this \n     information to be given before the transaction starts, which \n     is the time that pricing information is most useful to the \n     consumer. Consumers who are informed about the true amount of \n     funds that will be sent, and about the full cost of the money \n     transmission transaction, can shop around much more \n     effectively for the best rates and fees.\n       The bill will also require that the consumer be given a \n     receipt with this important pricing information and with the \n     date when the money is to be delivered. In addition, the bill \n     will protect persons in the U.S. who send money out of the \n     country if that money is not received in the other country, \n     or if the wrong amount is received. These error resolution \n     provisions are designed specifically for money transmission, \n     but are based on the same principles as existing protections \n     that consumers enjoy when they make payments domestically \n     using an electronic fund transfer from a bank account. Money \n     that is sent to family members outside the country often is \n     essential to the economic survival of those family members. \n     It is important that the funds arrive as promised. This bill \n     would require money transmitters to tell the sender when the \n     money should arrive and would also create a mechanism for a \n     refund if there is a problem with the sending of the funds.\n       Finally, the bill would encourage more federally insured \n     financial institutions to offer low cost remittance services. \n     Since some consumers who send remittances do not have bank \n     accounts, this could be a way for federally insured financial \n     institutions to serve new markets. According to an extensive \n     study by the Pew Hispanic Center, financial institutions \n     current have only about 3% of the international remittance \n     market.\n       For these reasons, we are pleased to express our very \n     strong support for the International Remittance Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2004.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Gail Hillebrand,\n                                     Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.\n                                                     Jean Ann Fox,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n                                                  Margot Saunders,\n                                     National Consumer Law Center.\n                                                   Ed Mierzwinsky,\n                                                        U.S. PIRG.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2871. A bill to provide for enhanced criminal penalties for crimes \nrelated to slavery and alien smuggling; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, as we all know, people \nfrom all over the world want to come to America to pursue a better life \nfor themselves and their families.\n  Unfortunately, however, some people entrust their lives to some very \ndangerous people in their effort to gain our shores. And, tragically, \nsome people are brought here against their will and kept as human \nchattel, enslaved in horrible conditions, in the midst of our freedom.\n  After hearing of the horrible deaths of aliens smuggled into the \ncountry and inhumanely abandoned along a Texas highway last year, I \nwanted to examine whether we are doing all we can to combat these \nhorrible crimes.\n  In talking with various law enforcement officials and victims, I \nheard of alien smugglers and traffickers who, through unabashed acts of \nprofiteering, endanger the lives of countless aliens while compromising \nthe integrity of our immigration laws at the same time. Make no \nmistake, the incentives for human smugglers are enormous. According to \nthe Department of State, human smuggling around the globe generates an \nestimated $9.5 billion a year.\n  The commodities involved in this illicit trade are men, women, and \nchildren who, for the smuggler, represent substantial profits. The \nState Department estimates that more than a million women and children \nare trafficked around the world each year, generally for the purpose of \ndomestic servitude, sweatshop labor, or sexual exploitation. At any \ngiven time, the Department estimates that thousands of people are in \nthe smuggling pipeline, with the United States being the primary\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\ntarget. Smugglers deliver some 50,000 aliens here each year. Alien \nsmuggling is a global problem which requires a systematic and \ncoordinated response. We should do all we can within our criminal laws \nto combat this terrible problem.\n  Given the risks associated with these crimes every time they are \ncarried out, the punishment should be appropriate to deter future \nsmuggling or trafficking, and to sufficiently sanction those who are \ncaught. Currently, Title 8 smuggling provisions provide that a person \nfound guilty of alien smuggling where death results is subject to the \nfull range of punishments, including the death penalty. However, if \ndeath results from a Title 18 trafficking offense, where the victims \nare arguably more vulnerable, the defendant is not subjected to the \ndeath penalty.\n  In my opinion, an important component of criminal justice \nprosecutions is to serve as a deterrent to others who may be disposed \nto commit a crime. We should ensure that the punishments for smuggling \nand trafficking crimes are such that the risks of apprehension, \nprosecution and punishment far outweigh the payday at their delivery \npoint. And, we need to be diligent in making certain that notice of \nthese penalties is conveyed to those who are engaged in this \nenterprise, up and down the smuggling and trafficking organizational \nchain. Obviously, in my opinion, the best way to do that is the \nvigorous prosecution and harsh punishment of those we do catch.\n  I also want to say a word about the goal of this legislation. \nClearly, the smuggling and trafficking problem impacts a host of \nimmigration issues. While we are engaged in the nationwide debate \nsurrounding immigration, we must also ensure that the crimes related to \nsmuggling and trafficking are punished appropriately. We should not \nwait for the conclusion of debate on the overall issue.\n  Whatever your feelings are regarding immigration policy, I think \neveryone can agree that we must not allow otherwise innocent men, \nwomen, and children to be abused and killed by those who seek to profit \nfrom the desperation of others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2872. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit to certain agriculture-related businesses for the cost of \nprotecting certain chemicals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAgricultural Business Security Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004. I am \npleased to join with my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson, In \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  Security at our agricultural facilities has regrettably become a \nnational concern in the last decade. While we saw agricultural products \nused for destruction in Oklahoma City in 1995, our concerns have only \nbeen compounded by the tragedies of September 11 and the threat of \nterrorism. The Senate recognized this growing concern when we \nconsidered agricultural products in the Federal hazardous materials \nlists in the USA Patriot Act of 2001.\n  The American agricultural industry has already recognized some of the \ndangers on its own and has made significant strides in improving \nsecurity. Shops throughout the country have started to invest in \nsecurity measures to keep their chemicals and fertilizers from being \nused illegally. In 2003, the Agricultural Retailers Association \npublished a web-based, security-vulnerability assessment tool and has \ncooperated with the USDA to secure farmers and ranchers.\n  But vulnerability assessments often require as much as $50,000 to \n$100,000 in capital investment. Meeting these pressing security needs \nis not feasible for many of the more than 9,000 retail facilities with \nfertilizer and chemicals stocks in the United States.\n  That is why it is important we enact this tax credit. The credit \nwould equal 50 percent of the cost of eligible security upgrades at \nagricultural retail businesses and is capped at $50,000 during any 5 \nyear period. This money can be used for many different security \nprograms, such as employee background checks, locking equipment and \neven the latest chemical additives that can render fertilizer unfit for \nillegal purposes.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, fertilizer theft has become a serious \nproblem and is contributing to a dangerous rise in the illegal drug \ntrade. One common fertilizer, anhydrous ammonia, is stolen in large \nquantities and is a fundamental part of the production of some forms of \nmethamphetamine. This problem is especially bad in rural areas where \npolice officers in Kentucky are try to curb the problem by distributing \nlocks to farmers and training them to identify the signs of a \nmethamphetamine label.\n  But these efforts are not enough. This legislation is an important \nstep to ensure that America's agricultural facilities are secure. \nWithout our action, many of the facilities throughout our country would \nsimply be unable to fund security improvements. We cannot risk \nfertilizers and chemicals falling into the wrong hands and facilitating \nillegal drug manufacturing or terrorist bomb makers. I hope my \ncolleagues will join Senator Nelson and me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2873. A bill to extend the authority of the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of Iowa to hold court in Rock Island, \nIllinois; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2873\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for international \nbroadcasting operations and capital improvements, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nsignificantly expand our international broadcasting to the Muslim \nworld.\n  The United States currently broadcasts news and information in over \n60 languages to nations in every region of the world. Through both \nradio and TV, we tell America's story to the world--with news and \ninformation programming about not only U.S. Government policy, but life \nand culture in the United States. We also bring the world to overseas \naudiences, providing them local, regional and world news that they \noften may not receive, especially in closed societies. Such broadcasts \nhave been an important foreign policy tool for six decades, since Voice \nof America broadcasts were initiated during the Second World War. \nDuring the Cold War, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty broadcasts \nbehind the Iron Curtain were a literal information lifeline for \nmillions trapped under Soviet misrule.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, the Federal agency responsible for these broadcasts, has \nsignificantly expanded our outreach to the Muslim world. At the \ndirection of Congress, it reestablished Radio Free Afghanistan \nbroadcasts, which had been curtailed in the 1990s. It initiated a new \nArabic-language service to the Middle East--Radio Sawa--featuring a new \nformat of both music and news and information programming designed to \nreach younger audiences. It started a new Persian service, Radio Farda, \nbroadcast to Iran. And it launched a satellite television station, \nAlhurra, which is transmitted across the Arab world in an effort to \ncompete with other pan-Arab television outlets like Al Jazeera and Al \nArabiya.\n  We have seen dramatic results. In several cities in the Middle East, \nRadio Sawa is now the leading international broadcaster, and is \ncompetitive with local stations. A survey conducted in Morocco earlier \nthis year shows that, in Casablanca and Rabat, Radio Sawa is the No. 1 \nstation among all listeners over age 15. Some 88 percent of people in \nthose cities under the age of 30 listen weekly, and 64 percent of those\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\nover age 30 do so. The listener audience is not as high in other \ncountries--ranging from a low of 2 percent in Lebanon to 7 percent in \nEgypt to 42 percent in the UAE to 45 percent in Kuwait. But these data \nare phenomenal for international broadcasting, where you are doing well \nif you are attracting five percent of the audience weekly.\n  Although Alhurra television programming has only been on the air for \n7 months, it is already attracting an important audience share. Recent \ndata indicate that some 33 percent watch it weekly in Kuwait, 20 \npercent watch it weekly in Saudi Arabia, and 19 percent watch it weekly \nin Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. That's not as high as Al \nJazeera and Al Arabiya, other pan-Arab satellite networks that are more \ndominant, but after 7 months, we are in the game.\n  We can and should build on these successes, by expanding our \nbroadcasting efforts to other nations with large Muslim populations--\nfrom Southeast Asia to Central and South Asia to the African continent. \nThe bill that I introduce today authorizes such an expansion, and would \nprovide for new or expanded services, in both radio and television, to \nall of these regions. This would not involve a one-sized-fits-all \napproach, but a targeted effort based on analysis of each individual \nmarket.\n  I do not want to imply that this will provide an immediate impact. It \nwill be a significant challenge. It will require additional resources \nand personnel. It will require diplomatic efforts--to obtain permission \nfor construction relay stations and to procure local broadcast \nlicenses. But we cannot afford not to try.\n  Around the globe, there are some 1.2 billion Muslims. Polling data \nindicate that favorable attitudes toward the United States and U.S. \npolicy have declined considerably in the last few years. One report, \nprepared by the Pew organization in June 2003, stated that ``the bottom \nhas fallen out of support for America in most of the Muslim world. \nNegative views of the U.S. among Muslims, which had been largely \nlimited to countries in the Middle East, have spread to Muslim \npopulations in Indonesia and Nigeria.'' The negative image of America \nis perhaps the natural result of our status as a global superpower. It \nalso stems from disagreements in foreign nations with U.S. policy. But \nit is also the result of a failure to explain U.S. policy, and a \nfailure to engage in a dialogue with foreign audiences.\n  The negative opinion in the world about the United States and U.S. \npolicy is a national security challenge of the fist order. We must deal \nwith this simple fact: most foreign governments, even non-democratic \nones, are constrained in their ability to support American policy if \ntheir own people oppose the United States and its policies. We must, \ntherefore, greatly expand our efforts to engage foreign audiences, not \nin a one-way monologue, but in a dialogue. International broadcasting \nis just one means of conducting that dialogue. We have to explain who \nwe are, what we stand for, and what our motives are. If we don't, we \nwill have ceded the field to people who will misrepresent our policies \nor our motives.\n  International broadcasting is one of several public diplomacy \nprograms--such as international exchanges and information programs--\nthat have been underfunded and understaffed for too long. This \nlegislation I introduce today only addresses international \nbroadcasting. We should make similar investments in our other public \ndiplomacy programs, and I will continue to work to ensure that we do \nso.\n  The 9/11 Commission recognized the lack of adequate funding for these \nprograms, and called on Congress and the administration to invest in \nthem. Among other things, the Commission specifically recommended that \nwe increase funding for international broadcasting:\n\n       Recognizing that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on \n     satellite television and radio, the government has begun some \n     promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to \n     the Arab world, Iran, and Afghanistan. These efforts are \n     beginning to reach large audiences. The Broadcasting Board of \n     Governors has asked for much larger resources. It should get \n     them.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission did not recommend a specific budget amount, or \nprovide a detailed plan. This proposal does both. It is based on a \nthoroughly-researched plan. It provides significant resources--$222 \nmillion in one-time costs, and annual costs of $345 million. This \nrepresents about a 60 percent increase over the current annual budget \nof $570 million for such broadcasting. Relative to other national \nsecurity programs, I believe it is a bargain--and an investment that is \nwell worth the price.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Initiative 911 Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Open communication of information and ideas among \n     peoples of the world contributes to international peace and \n     stability, and that the promotion of such communication is \n     important to the national security of the United States.\n       (2) The United States needs to improve its communication of \n     information and ideas to people in foreign countries, \n     particularly in countries with significant Muslim \n     populations.\n       (3) A significant expansion of United States international \n     broadcasting would provide a cost-effective means of \n     improving communication with countries with significant \n     Muslim populations by providing news, information, and \n     analysis, as well as cultural programming, through both radio \n     and television broadcasts.\n       (4) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States stated that, ``Recognizing \n     that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite television \n     and radio, the government has begun some promising \n     initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Arab \n     world, Iran, and Afghanistan. These efforts are beginning to \n     reach large audiences. The Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     has asked for much larger resources. It should get them.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. SPECIAL AUTHORITY FOR SURGE CAPACITY.\n\n       The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 \n     (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 316.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate reductions in payments to hospitals for the indirect costs of \nmedical education; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to restore Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. I introduce the \nAmerican Hospital Preservation Act with my colleague, Senator Bayh, to \nrestore reimbursement for indirect medical education (IME) payments to \nteaching hospitals. IME payments give teaching hospitals an additional \nMedicare reimbursement due to their higher costs of inpatient care. The \nMedicare Modernization Act restored the reimbursement rate to 6 percent \nfor fiscal year 2004. However this payment update expires today. Over \nthe next 3 years, reimbursements to teaching hospitals will decrease, \nmaking it more difficult to care for our sick and to train our future \nhealth care providers. The American Hospital Preservation Act would fix \nthe reimbursement rate at 6.0 and will ensure our hospitals are \ncompensated for the invaluable care they provide to our patients.\n  Hospital admissions have risen from 31 million patients in 1990 to 33 \nmillion in 2000, and the number of days in the hospital is rising as \nwell. Increased admissions, rising liability premiums, and the cost of \nadvanced technology have forced hospitals to cut back on services. The \ncost of a pint of blood increased 31 percent in 2001, an additional \n$920 million burden to hospitals. Such costs are continuing to rise, \nyet Medicare reimbursements to hospitals are not keeping pace with \ninflation and their margins are slowly shrinking. Fifty-eight percent \nof hospitals are losing money on the Medicare patients they treat.\n  Teaching hospitals have higher costs due to their critical role in \neducating tomorrow's physicians. They run more tests, utilize newer \ntechnology and require more staff because they are training our future \nhealth professionals. Preserving this reimbursement rate is vital to \ncontinuing this training. Although only 23 percent of all hospitals are \nteaching hospitals, they deliver over two-thirds of charity care. Many \npatients rely on these hospitals for their health, which make-up 78 \npercent of all trauma centers and 80 percent of all burn beds. Further, \na disproportionate percentage of the most seriously ill and injured \npatients are treated and convalesce in teaching hospitals. Emergency \nrooms are increasingly used as a primary care clinic because patients \ncannot find a physician who accepts Medicare, and they treat more \nindividuals who are uninsured. In 2000, hospitals provided $21.6 \nbillion in uncompensated care.\n  Lower reimbursement rates coupled with bioterrorism risks and a \nworkforce shortage make our hospitals a time bomb waiting to go off. It \nis our responsibility to ensure they have adequate resources.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the American \nHospital Preservation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Graham of South \n        Carolina):\n  S. 2877. A bill to reduce the special allowance for loans from the \nproceeds of tax exempt issues, and to provide additional loan \nforgiveness for teachers who teach mathematics, science, or special \neducation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in recent days, much ink has been spilled \nand much rhetoric bandied about on the subject of the 8.5 percent \ninterest rate on student loans the Federal Government guarantees to a \nhandful of lenders. We all agree that this loophole, which results in \nwindfall profits to some lenders and banks, should be ended.\n  Only recently have my colleagues on the other side of the aisle even \nacknowledged that this was a problem. It should be noted, that \nDemocrats not only created and protected this flawed policy during the \nClinton administration they failed to correct the problem when they \nwere in the majority.\n  Republicans have repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to ending the \nexploitation of the 9.5 percent interest rate guarantee. The President \nsubmitted a budget in February that closed the loophole. House \nRepublicans introduced a higher education bill in May that also would \nclose the loophole. But Democrats showed no interest in moving either \nof those pieces of legislation. Instead, they have recently offered a \nseries of misguided, ineffectual attempts to close the loophole. The \nKildee amendment that passed the House did not close the loophole--a \nfact even Senate Democrats acknowledge. That amendment prohibited \ndiscretionary funds from being used to administer the 9.5 percent \npayments or for the payments themselves. The fact that such payments \nare made with mandatory funds under the Higher Education Act renders \nthe amendment powerless.\n  Similarly, Senator Murray's amendment that was rejected at the Labor-\nHHS-Education markup failed to close the loophole for several reasons. \nHer amendment would have allowed lenders to transfer loans within their \nportfolio to continue to receive the 9.5 percent guarantee, a practice \nexplicitly criticized in the GAO report on this issue. Worse, her \namendment would have spent more money than it generated by converting \nsavings that accrue over 10 years into discretionary expenditures to be \nspent in a single year, 2005.\n  Senator Murray's amendment would also have jeopardized student \nbenefits nationwide by preventing nonprofit lenders, which are required \nto pour any extra Federal funds they receive back into the student loan \nprogram, from legitimately receiving the guarantee. In other words, her \namendment would have led to increased interest rates and origination \nfees for student borrowers, and the elimination of loan forgiveness \nprograms for nurses, teachers, and public safety officers.\n  The potential damage did not end there. Because Senator Murray's \namendment would have disrupted contractual obligations between the \nFederal Government and lenders and note holders, it could have exposed \nthe Department of Education to costly litigation and risk a court order \nrequiring the payments to be restored.\n  Clearly, efforts to end the loophole have been unproductive or worse \nthus far. Today, I hope to transform the debate by introducing the \nTaxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Bond and Graham, and Representative Boehner in the House. This \nlegislation will close the loophole for one year and direct the \nresulting savings toward the expansion of teacher loan forgiveness \nprograms for math, science and special education teachers in schools \nwith large numbers of disadvantaged students, without cutting student \nbenefits enjoyed by borrowers who receive loans from nonprofit lenders.\n  Specifically, the bill would protect taxpayers by shutting down the \nloophole in 2005 in a way that immediately halts the high subsidies for \nrefunding, transfers of loans from tax-exempt to taxable bonds and \nother related transactions. It puts lenders and note holders on notice \nthat Congress will permanently and quickly phase out all other aspects \nof the 9.5 percent guarantee without putting the federal government in \njeopardy of costly litigation. The bill protects student benefits \nprovided by non-profit lenders, including 0 percent interest rate \nstudent loans for on-time completion, lower interest rates for certain \nstudents and loan forgiveness for teachers, nurses and public safety \npersonnel.\n  The bill invests the related savings to more than triple teacher loan \nforgiveness to $17,500 for teachers of math, science, and special \neducation--disciplines where there are widespread shortages, \nparticularly in the inner city and rural communities--who teach in \nhigh-need schools districts for five years, and who meet the No Child \nLeft Behind definition of a highly qualified\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\nteacher. Such loan forgiveness provides an important recruiting tool \nfor local districts to fill teacher shortages, and rewards teachers who \nteach disadvantaged children and children with disabilities, while \npreparing the students in the areas of math and science that are so \ncritical to our security and prosperity as a nation.\n  The President recently sent us a letter reiterating his desire that \nCongress act quickly to enact legislation to close the loophole. I urge \nmy colleagues who are serious about ending this loophole to join me in \nsupporting the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004, so that we can \nsend it to the President's desk without delay, and send our dollars \nwhere they belong--benefiting students.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore recognition to the Winnemem Wintu Indian \nTribe of California; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce ``The \nWinnemem Wintu Tribe Clarification and Restoration Act,'' a bill that \nwould clarify the status of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe of northern \nCalifornia. I am introducing this bill, at the request of the tribe, \nprimarily to initiate a discussion of the tribe's status among all the \ninterested parties, including the tribe, local communities, and the \ntribe's congressional delegation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Winnemem Wintu Tribe \n     Clarification and Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Winnemem Wintu Indian Tribe was entitled to have \n     been included in the 1979 acknowledgement process that \n     created a list of federally recognized California tribes;\n       (2) in addition to its continuous historic relationship \n     with the Federal Government, the trust status of the Tribe \n     was reaffirmed by the provisions of the Act of July 30, 1941 \n     (55 Stat. 612, chapter 334), which granted to the United \n     States all tribal and allotted Indian land within the area \n     embraced by the Central Valley Project;\n       (3) under that Act, the Secretary, acting through the \n     Commissioner of Reclamation, on January 5, 1942, created the \n     Shasta Reservoir Indian Cemetery, which contains Winnemem \n     Wintu remains, markers, and other appurtenances held in trust \n     by the United States;\n       (4) Winnemem Wintu remains were removed to that cemetery \n     from the traditional cemetery of the Tribe in the McCloud \n     River valley that was flooded by the Shasta Reservoir;\n       (5) the Bureau of Reclamation informed the Area Director of \n     the Indian Service in writing on December 22, 1942, of the \n     new cemetery and its status as Federal trust land;\n       (6) the Secretary, through an administrative oversight or \n     inaction of the Indian Service, overlooked the trust status \n     of the Tribe, which was reaffirmed by the making of partial \n     restitution by the Secretary for the taking of tribal land \n     and the 1941 relocation of the remains of tribal members, \n     which remain interred in the Shasta Reservoir Indian \n     Cemetery;\n       (7) the ongoing trust relationship of the Tribe with the \n     Federal Government should have been recognized by the \n     Secretary, and the Tribe should have been included in the \n     1979 listing of federally recognized California tribes; and\n       (8) the Tribe, as a matter of sovereign choice, has \n     determined that the conduct of gaming by the Tribe would be \n     detrimental to the maintenance of its traditional tribal \n     culture.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) Service area.--The term ``service area'' means the \n     counties of Shasta and Siskiyou, California.\n       (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Indians of the \n     Winnemem Wintu Tribe of northern California.\n\n     SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF FEDERAL STATUS AND RESTORATION OF \n                   FEDERAL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.\n\n       (a) Federal Status.--Federal status is restored to the \n     Tribe.\n       (b) Applicable Law.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     Act, all laws (including regulations) of general \n     applicability to Indians and nations, tribes, or bands of \n     Indians that are not inconsistent with any provision of this \n     Act shall be applicable to the Tribe and members of the \n     Tribe.\n       (c) Restorations of Rights and Privileges.--Except as \n     provided in subsection (d), all rights and privileges of the \n     Tribe and members of the Tribe under any Federal treaty, \n     Executive order, agreement, or statute, or under any other \n     authority that were diminished or lost under Public Law 85-\n     671 (72 Stat. 619) are restored, and that Act shall be \n     inapplicable to the Tribe or members of the Tribe after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Federal Services and Benefits.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--\n       (A) In general.--Without regard to the existence of a \n     reservation, the Tribe and its members shall be eligible, on \n     and after the date of enactment of this Act, for all Federal \n     services and benefits furnished to federally recognized \n     Indian tribes or their members.\n       (B) Residing on a reservation.--For the purposes of Federal \n     services and benefits available to members of federally \n     recognized Indian tribes residing on a reservation, members \n     of the Tribe residing in the service area shall be deemed to \n     be residing on a reservation.\n       (2) Relation to other laws.--The eligibility for or receipt \n     of services and benefits under paragraph (1) by the Tribe or \n     a member of the Tribe shall not be considered as income, \n     resources, or otherwise when determining the eligibility for \n     or computation of any payment or other benefit to the Tribe \n     or member under--\n       (A) any financial aid program of the United States, \n     (including grants and contracts under the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et \n     seq.); or\n       (B) any other benefit to which the Tribe or member would \n     otherwise be entitled under any Federal or federally assisted \n     program.\n       (e) Hunting, Fishing, Trapping, Gathering, and Water \n     Rights.--Nothing in this Act expands, reduces, or otherwise \n     affects in any manner any hunting, fishing, trapping, \n     gathering, or water rights of the Tribe and members of the \n     Tribe.\n       (f) Certain Rights Not Altered.--Except as specifically \n     provided in this Act, nothing in this Act alters any property \n     right or obligation, any contractual right or obligation, or \n     any obligation for taxes levied.\n\n     SEC. 5. RESERVATION OF THE TRIBE.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall take the 42.5-acre site presently \n     occupied by the Tribe into trust for the benefit of the \n     Tribe, and that land shall be the reservation of the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 6. GAMING.\n\n       The Tribe shall not have the right to conduct gaming \n     (within the meaning of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)).\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10075-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 139--DIRECTING THE ARCHITECT OF THE \nCAPITOL TO ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT IN THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL \n TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES WHO \nHAVE LOST THIR LIVES IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND OPERATION ENDURING \n                                FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution that allows for a temporary display in the Capitol Rotunda \nmemorializing the soldiers lost in Iraq and Afghanistan. I can think of \nno greater tribute to the families of those who died for our country \nthan to honor their memories right here in the Capitol Building.\n  This temporary memorial would provide pictures and biographical \ninformation for each serviceman and servicewoman who has died in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Also, it would \ninclude space for people visiting the Capitol to write notes and \ntributes to be shared with the families so they know that their loved \nones will always be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  To date, the United States has lost 1,409 soldiers in Iraq, and 138 \nin Afghanistan. There are currently 150,500 active duty and reserve \nforces in Iraq and Afghanistan combined--135,000 in Iraq and 15,500 in \nAfghanistan--including 3,709 from New Jersey.\n  The Capitol Rotunda is the symbolic heart of the United States \nCapitol and our Nation's democracy, and it is visited by thousands of \npeople each day. The Rotunda has long been considered an ideal setting \nfor important ceremonial events, including state funerals for \npresidents from Abraham Lincoln to Lyndon Johnson, distinguished \nMembers of Congress, military heroes, and eminent citizens. The Rotunda \nis filled with portraits and sculptures reminding Americans of past \nbattles and more modern achievements. Eight framed niches hold large \nhistorical paintings--four revolutionary period scenes and four scenes \nof early exploration.\n  There is precedence for a memorial to fallen heroes in the Capitol \nRotunda. Beginning in 1921, the Capitol Rotunda was used to honor the \nUnknown Soldier who lost his life serving in World War I. Memorials to \nthe Unknown Soldier from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam \nWar followed. In addition, in 1989, an official POW/MIA flag was \ninstalled in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, where it remains today, as a \nresult of legislation passed overwhelmingly during the 100th Congress.\n  This memorial builds upon congressional action of the past and \npresents an opportunity for the United States Congress to thank our \nfallen soldiers and their families. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthis endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/30/senate-section/article/S10075-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10075-S10077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3794.

Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Leiberman) proposed an \namendment to the bill S. 2845, to reform the intelligence community and \nthe intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United \nStates Government, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     TITLE __--TERRORIST TRAVEL AND EFFECTIVE SCREENING\n\n     SEC. __01. COUNTERTERRORIST TRAVEL INTELLIGENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Travel documents are as important to terrorists as \n     weapons since terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, \n     train, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack sites.\n       (2) International travel is dangerous for terrorists \n     because they must surface to pass through regulated channels, \n     present themselves to border security officials, or attempt \n     to circumvent inspection points.\n       (3) Terrorists use evasive, but detectable, methods to \n     travel, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, \n     specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt \n     government officials, human smuggling networks, supportive \n     travel agencies, and immigration and identity fraud.\n       (4) Before September 11, 2001, no Federal agency \n     systematically analyzed terrorist travel strategies. If an \n     agency had done so, the agency could have discovered the ways \n     in which the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been \n     systematically, but detectably, exploiting weaknesses in our \n     border security since the early 1990s.\n       (5) Many of the hijackers were potentially vulnerable to \n     interception by border authorities. Analyzing their \n     characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could \n     have allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers \n     and a more effective use of information available in \n     Government databases could have identified some of the \n     hijackers.\n       (6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the \n     aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting \n     against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and \n     opportunities.\n       (7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since \n     September 11, 2001, have not been adequately integrated into \n     the front lines of border security.\n       (8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence \n     collection and analysis program currently in place has \n     produced useful results and should be expanded.\n       (b) Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to Congress unclassified and classified versions \n     of a strategy for combining terrorist travel intelligence, \n     operations, and law enforcement into a cohesive effort to \n     intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and \n     constrain terrorist mobility domestically and \n     internationally. The report to Congress should include a \n     description of the actions taken to implement the strategy.\n       (2) Accountability.--The strategy submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall--\n       (A) describe a program for collecting, analyzing, \n     disseminating, and utilizing information and intelligence \n     regarding terrorist travel tactics and methods; and\n       (B) outline which Federal intelligence, diplomatic, and law \n     enforcement agencies will be held accountable for \n     implementing each element of the strategy.\n       (3) Coordination.--The strategy shall be developed in \n     coordination with all relevant Federal agencies, including--\n       (A) the National Counterterrorism Center;\n       (B) the Department of Transportation;\n       (C) the Department of State;\n       (D) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (E) the Department of Justice;\n       (F) the Department of Defense;\n       (G) the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       (H) the Drug Enforcement Agency; and\n       (I) the agencies that comprise the intelligence community.\n       (4) Contents.--The strategy shall address--\n       (A) the intelligence and law enforcement collection, \n     analysis, operations, and reporting required to identify and \n     disrupt terrorist travel practices and trends, and the \n     terrorist travel facilitators, document forgers, human \n     smugglers, travel agencies, and corrupt border and \n     transportation officials who assist terrorists;\n       (B) the initial and ongoing training and training materials \n     required by consular, border, and immigration officials to \n     effectively detect and disrupt terrorist travel described \n     under subsection (c)(3);\n       (C) the new procedures required and actions to be taken to \n     integrate existing counterterrorist travel and mobility \n     intelligence into border security processes, including \n     consular, port of entry, border patrol, maritime, immigration \n     benefits, and related law enforcement activities;\n       (D) the actions required to integrate current terrorist \n     mobility intelligence into military force protection \n     measures;\n       (E) the additional assistance to be given to the \n     interagency Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center for \n     purposes of combatting terrorist travel, including further \n     developing and expanding enforcement and operational \n     capabilities that address terrorist travel;\n       (F) the additional resources to be given to the Department \n     of Homeland Security to aid in the sharing of information \n     between the frontline border agencies of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, the Department of State, and classified \n     and unclassified sources of counterterrorist travel \n     intelligence and information elsewhere in the Federal \n     Government, including the Human Smuggling and Trafficking \n     Center;\n       (G) the development and implementation of procedures to \n     enable the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to timely \n     receive terrorist travel intelligence and documentation \n     obtained at consulates and ports of entry, and by law \n     enforcement officers and military personnel;\n       (H) the use of foreign and technical assistance to advance \n     border security measures and law enforcement operations \n     against terrorist travel facilitators;\n       (I) the development of a program to provide each consular, \n     port of entry, and immigration benefits office with a \n     counterterrorist travel expert trained and authorized to use \n     the relevant authentication technologies and cleared to \n     access all appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and \n     intelligence databases;\n       (J) the feasibility of digitally transmitting passport \n     information to a central cadre of specialists until such time \n     as experts described under subparagraph (I) are available\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n     at consular, port of entry, and immigration benefits offices; \n     and\n       (K) granting consular officers and immigration \n     adjudicators, as appropriate, the security clearances \n     necessary to access law enforcement sensitive and \n     intelligence databases.\n       (c) Frontline Counterterrorist Travel Technology and \n     Training.--\n       (1) Technology acquisition and dissemination plan.--Not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the \n     Secretary of State, shall submit to Congress a plan \n     describing how the Department of Homeland Security and the \n     Department of State can acquire and deploy, to all \n     consulates, ports of entry, and immigration benefits offices, \n     technologies that facilitate document authentication and the \n     detection of potential terrorist indicators on travel \n     documents.\n       (2) Contents of plan.--The plan submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall--\n       (A) outline the timetable needed to acquire and deploy the \n     authentication technologies;\n       (B) identify the resources required to--\n       (i) fully disseminate these technologies; and\n       (ii) train personnel on use of these technologies; and\n       (C) address the feasibility of using these technologies to \n     screen every passport or other documentation described in \n     section __04(b) submitted for identification purposes to a \n     United States consular, border, or immigration official.\n       (3) Training program.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security and the \n     Secretary of State shall develop and implement initial and \n     ongoing annual training programs for consular, border, and \n     immigration officials who encounter or work with travel or \n     immigration documents as part of their duties to teach such \n     officials how to effectively detect and disrupt terrorist \n     travel.\n       (B) Terrorist travel intelligence.--The Secretary may \n     assist State, local, and tribal governments, and private \n     industry, in establishing training programs related to \n     terrorist travel intelligence.\n       (C) Training topics.--The training developed under this \n     paragraph shall include training in--\n       (i) methods for identifying fraudulent documents;\n       (ii) detecting terrorist indicators on travel documents;\n       (iii) recognizing travel patterns, tactics, and behaviors \n     exhibited by terrorists;\n       (iv) the use of information contained in available \n     databases and data systems and procedures to maintain the \n     accuracy and integrity of such systems;

Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Ensign) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 2845, to reform \nthe intelligence community and the intelligence and intelligence-\nrelated activities of the United States Government, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BIOMETRIC STANDARDS FOR PASSPORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 9/11 Commission Report made clear that the \n     incapacity to establish the authenticity of United States \n     passports through a biometric identifier is a major gap in \n     homeland security when it stated, ``Americans should not be \n     exempt from carrying biometric passports or otherwise \n     enabling their identities to be securely verified when they \n     enter the United States; nor should Canadians or Mexicans''.\n       (2) The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act \n     of 2002 requires Visa Waiver Program countries to conform to \n     a biometric standard negotiated through the International \n     Civil Aviation Organization, rather than requiring a specific \n     type of biometric identifier. The standard agreed upon by the \n     international community is facial recognition, consisting of \n     a picture with a computer chip embedded in the passport to \n     verify the picture.\n       (3) Facial recognition biometric technology remains \n     inferior to fingerprint biometric technology for the purpose \n     of one-to-many matches and is not consistent with the \n     biometric information that the United States collects from \n     visa applicants through its visa issuance process. \n     Consequently, individuals from Visa Waiver Program countries \n     who do not go through visa applications and interviews at the \n     point of origin are admitted into the United States with only \n     a facial biometric identifier contained in their passport.\n       (4) In order to be eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, \n     Visa Waiver Program countries should issue visas and \n     passports that conform with the same biometric standard as \n     travel documents issued by the United States.\n       (5) Because the United Sates must set an example in the \n     establishment of an international travel document biometric \n     identification standard, and must ensure that United States \n     issued passports are not used by non-United States citizens \n     to fraudulently gain entrance into the United States, the \n     United States should not only comply with the standards set \n     by the International Civil Aviation Organization, but should \n     include fingerprints as a second additional biometric \n     identifier on the passports it issues to its citizens.\n       (b) Fingerprints on United States Passports.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of State shall ensure that \n     each passport issued by the United States after the effective \n     date of this subsection--\n       (A) contains the index fingerprints of the person to whom \n     such passport was issued; and\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\n       (B) complies with the additional biometric standard \n     established by the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--\n       (A) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated a \n     total of $1,000,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 to \n     carry out the provisions of paragraph (1).\n       (B) Availability.--Any amounts appropriated pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A) shall remain available until expended.\n       (3) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n     the date which is 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Biometric Standard for Passports Issued by Visa Waiver \n     Program Countries.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 217 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187) is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)(3)(A), by striking ``satisfies the \n     internationally accepted standard for machine readability.'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(i) satisfies the internationally accepted standard for \n     machine readability; and\n       ``(ii) contains fingerprint biometric identifiers of the \n     alien.''; and\n       (B) in subsection (c)(2)(B)(i), by striking ``satisfy the \n     internationally accepted standard for machine readability.'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(i) satisfy the internationally accepted standard for \n     machine readability; and\n       ``(ii) contain fingerprint biometric identifiers of such \n     citizens.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect on the date which is 1 year after the date \n     on which the Secretary of State begins to issue passports in \n     accordance with subsection (b)(1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3873.

COMMISSION ON THE UNITED STATES-SAUDI ARABIA \n                   RELATIONSHIP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite improvements in counterterrorism cooperation \n     between the Governments of the United States and Saudi Arabia \n     following the terrorist attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on \n     May 12, 2003, the relationship between the United States and \n     Saudi Arabia continues to be problematic in regard to \n     combating Islamic extremism.\n       (2) The Government of Saudi Arabia has not always responded \n     promptly and fully to\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\n     United States requests for assistance in the global war on \n     Islamist terrorism. Examples of this lack of cooperation have \n     included an unwillingness to provide the United States \n     Government with access to individuals wanted for questioning \n     in relation to terrorist acts and to assist in investigations \n     of terrorist activities.\n       (3) The state religion of Saudi Arabia, a militant and \n     exclusionary form of Islam known as Wahhabism, preaches \n     violence against nonbelievers or infidels and serves as the \n     religious basis for Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. Through \n     support for madrassas, mosques, cultural centers, and other \n     entities Saudi Arabia has actively supported the spread of \n     this religious sect.\n       (4) The Secretary of State designated Saudi Arabia a \n     country of particular concern under section 402(b)(1)(A) of \n     the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. \n     6442(b)(1)(A)) because the Government of Saudi Arabia has \n     engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, and egregious \n     violations of religious freedom.\n       (5) The Department of State's International Religious \n     Freedom Report for 2004 concluded that religious freedom does \n     not exist in Saudi Arabia.\n       (6) The Ambassador-at-large for International Religious \n     Freedom expressed concern about Saudi Arabia's export of \n     religious extremism and intolerance to other countries where \n     religious freedom for Muslims is respected.\n       (7) Historically, the Government of Saudi Arabia has \n     allowed financiers of terrorism to operate within its \n     borders.\n       (8) The Government of Saudi Arabia stated in February 2004 \n     that it would establish a national commission to combat \n     terrorist financing within Saudi Arabia, however, it has not \n     fulfilled that promise.\n       (9) There have been no reports of the Government of Saudi \n     Arabia pursuing the arrest, trial, or punishment of \n     individuals who have provided financial support for terrorist \n     activities. The laws of Saudi Arabia to combat terrorist \n     financing have not been fully implemented.\n       (b) Commission on the United States-Saudi Arabia \n     Relationship.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established, within the \n     legislative branch, the National Commission on the United \n     States-Saudi Arabia Relationship (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the Commission are to \n     investigate, evaluate, and report on--\n       (A) the current status and activities of diplomatic \n     relations between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia;\n       (B) the degree of cooperation exhibited by the Government \n     of Saudi Arabia toward the Government of the United States in \n     relation to intelligence, security cooperation, and the fight \n     against Islamist terrorism;\n       (C) the status of the support provided by the Government of \n     Saudi Arabia to promote the dissemination of Wahabbism; and\n       (D) the efforts of the Government of Saudi Arabia to enact \n     domestic measures to curtail terrorist financing.\n       (3) Authority.--The Commission is authorized to carry out \n     purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (c) Composition of Commission.--The Commission shall be \n     composed of 10 members, as follows:\n       (1) Two members appointed by the President, one of whom the \n     President shall designate as the chairman of the Commission.\n       (2) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (3) Two members appointed by the minority leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (4) Two members appointed by the majority leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (5) Two members appointed by the minority leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) Report.--Not later that 270 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the \n     President and Congress a report on the relationship between \n     the United States and Saudi Arabia. The report shall include \n     the recommendations of the Commission to--\n       (1) increase the transparency of diplomatic relations \n     between the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia;\n       (2) improve cooperation between Government of the United \n     States and the Government of Saudi Arabia in efforts to share \n     intelligence information related to the war on terror;\n       (3) curtail the support and dissemination of Wahabbism by \n     the Government of Saudi Arabia;\n       (4) enhance the efforts of the Government of Saudi Arabia \n     to combat terrorist financing;\n       (5) create a foreign policy strategy for the United States \n     to improve cooperation with the Government of Saudi Arabia in \n     the war on terror, including any recommendations regarding \n     the use of sanctions or other diplomatic measures;\n       (6) curtail the support or toleration of violations of \n     religious freedom by the Government of Saudi Arabia; and\n       (7) encourage the Government of Saudi Arabia to improve the \n     human rights conditions in Saudi Arabia that have been \n     identified as poor by the Department of State.\n       (e) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding section 341 or any \n     other provision of this Act, this section shall take effect \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3890.

UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD DICTATORSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress finds that short-term gains enjoyed by the United \n     States through cooperation with repressive dictatorships have \n     often been outweighed by long-term setbacks for the stature \n     and interests of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States foreign policy should promote the value \n     of life and the importance of individual educational and \n     economic opportunity, encourage widespread political \n     participation, condemn indiscriminate violence, and promote \n     respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing \n     differences among people, and tolerance for opposing points \n     of view; and\n       (2) the United States Government must prevail upon the \n     governments of all predominantly Muslim countries, including \n     those that are friends and allies of the United States, to \n     condemn indiscriminate violence, promote the value of life, \n     respect and promote the principles of individual education \n     and economic opportunity, encourage widespread political \n     participation, and promote the rule of law, openness in \n     discussing differences among people, and tolerance for \n     opposing points of view.\n\n     SEC. __08.

INTERNATIONAL YOUTH OPPORTUNITY FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value \n     of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a \n     key element in any global strategy to eliminate Islamist \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Education in the Middle East about the world outside \n     that region is weak.\n       (3) The United Nations has rightly equated literacy with \n     freedom.\n       (4) The international community is moving toward setting a \n     concrete goal of reducing by half the illiteracy rate in the \n     Middle East by 2010, through the implementation of education \n     programs targeting women and girls and programs for adult \n     literacy, and by other means.\n       (5) To be effective, efforts to improve education in the \n     Middle East must also include--\n       (A) support for the provision of basic education tools, \n     such as textbooks that translate more of the world's \n     knowledge into local languages and local libraries to house \n     such materials; and\n       (B) more vocational education in trades and business \n     skills.\n       (6) The Middle East can benefit from some of the same \n     programs to bridge the digital divide that already have been \n     developed for other regions of the world.\n       (b) International Youth Opportunity Fund.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish an \n     International Youth Opportunity Fund to provide financial \n     assistance for the improvement of public education in the \n     Middle East.\n       (2) International participation.--The President shall seek \n     the cooperation of the international community in \n     establishing and generously supporting the Fund.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President for the establishment of \n     the International Youth Opportunity Fund, in addition to any \n     amounts otherwise available for such purpose, such sums as \n     may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009, unless otherwise authorized by Congress.\n\n     SEC. __11. THE USE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO COMBAT TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While terrorism is not caused by poverty, breeding \n     grounds for terrorism are created by backward economic \n     policies and repressive political regimes.\n       (2) Policies that support economic development and reform \n     also have political implications, as economic and political \n     liberties are often linked.\n       (3) The United States is working toward creating a Middle \n     East Free Trade Area by 2013 and implementing a free trade \n     agreement with Bahrain, and free trade agreements exist \n     between the United States and Israel and the United States \n     and Jordan.\n       (4) Existing and proposed free trade agreements between the \n     United States and Islamic countries are drawing interest from \n     other countries in the Middle East region, and Islamic \n     countries can become full participants in the rules-based \n     global trading system, as the United States considers \n     lowering its barriers to trade with the poorest Arab \n     countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a comprehensive United States strategy to counter \n     terrorism should include economic policies that encourage \n     development, open societies, and opportunities for people to \n     improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects \n     for their children's future;\n       (2) one element of such a strategy should encompass the \n     lowering of trade barriers with the poorest countries that \n     have a significant population of Arab or Muslim individuals;\n       (3) another element of such a strategy should encompass \n     United States efforts to promote economic reform in countries \n     that have a significant population of Arab or Muslim \n     individuals, including efforts to integrate such countries \n     into the global trading system; and\n       (4) given the importance of the rule of law in promoting \n     economic development and attracting investment, the United \n     States should devote an increased proportion of its \n     assistance to countries in the Middle East to the promotion \n     of the rule of law.\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\n     SEC. __12.

COMPREHENSIVE COALITION STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of \n     the United States relies on international cooperation.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of \n     United States Government contacts with foreign governments \n     concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but \n     such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a \n     comprehensive and unified approach.\n       (b) International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President--\n       (A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of \n     other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and \n     uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop \n     with those other governments a comprehensive coalition \n     strategy to fight Islamist terrorism; and\n       (B) to that end, should seek to establish an international \n     counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of \n     governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism \n     efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim \n     populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international \n     means for discussing and coordinating the development of \n     important counterterrorism policies by the participating \n     governments.\n       (2) Authority.--The President is authorized to establish an \n     international counterterrorism policy contact group with the \n     leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for \n     purposes as follows:\n       (A) To develop in common with such other countries \n     important policies and a strategy that address the various \n     components of international prosecution of the war on \n     terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address \n     military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, \n     and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to \n     interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-\n     related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating \n     to terrorist sanctuaries.\n       (B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President \n     and leaders of other participating governments determine \n     appropriate, such long-term issues as economic and political \n     reforms that can contribute to strengthening stability and \n     security in the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. __14. TREATMENT OF FOREIGN PRISONERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Carrying out the global war on terrorism requires the \n     development of policies with respect to the detention and \n     treatment of captured international terrorists that are \n     adhered to by all coalition forces.\n       (2) Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment \n     of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3316) was specifically designed for cases in which the usual \n     rules of war do not apply, and the minimum standards of \n     treatment pursuant to such Article are generally accepted \n     throughout the world as customary international law.\n       (b) Policy.--The policy of the United States is as follows:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to treat all \n     foreign persons captured, detained, interned or otherwise \n     held in the custody of the United States (hereinafter \n     ``prisoners'') humanely and in accordance with standards that \n     the United States would consider legal if perpetrated by the \n     enemy against an American prisoner.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that all \n     officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and \n     in peacetime by the legal prohibition against torture, cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment.\n       (3) If there is any doubt as to whether prisoners are \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, such prisoners shall enjoy the protections of \n     the Geneva Conventions until such time as their status can be \n     determined pursuant to the procedures authorized by Army \n     Regulation 190-8, Section 1-6.\n       (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously \n     prosecute cases of terrorism or other criminal acts alleged \n     to have been committed by prisoners in the custody of the \n     United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order \n     to avoid the indefinite detention of prisoners, which is \n     contrary to the legal principles and security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (c) Reporting.--The Department of Defense shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees:\n       (1) A quarterly report providing the number of prisoners \n     who were denied Prisoner of War (POW) status under the Geneva \n     Conventions and the basis for denying POW status to each such \n     prisoner.\n       (2) A report setting forth--\n       (A) the proposed schedule for military commissions to be \n     held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and\n       (B) the number of individuals currently held at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, the number of such individuals who are unlikely to \n     face a military commission in the next six months, and each \n     reason for not bringing such individuals before a military \n     commission.\n       (3) All International Committee of the Red Cross reports, \n     completed prior to the enactment of this Act, concerning the \n     treatment of prisoners in United States custody at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and other terror groups have tried to acquire \n     or make weapons of mass destruction since 1994 or earlier.\n       (2) The United States doubtless would be a prime target for \n     use of any such weapon by al Qaeda.\n       (3) Although the United States Government has supported the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance programs, \n     nonproliferation experts continue to express deep concern \n     about the adequacy of such efforts to secure weapons of mass \n     destruction and related materials that still exist in Russia \n     other countries of the former Soviet Union, and around the \n     world.\n       (4) The cost of increased investment in the prevention of \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     materials is greatly outweighed by the potentially \n     catastrophic cost to the United States of the use of such \n     weapons by terrorists.\n       (5) The Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs are the United States primary method of preventing \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     materials from Russia and the states of the former Soviet \n     Union, but require further expansion, improvement, and \n     resources.\n       (6) Better coordination is needed within the executive \n     branch of government for the budget development, oversight, \n     and implementation of the Cooperative Threat Reduction, \n     Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs, and critical elements \n     of such programs are operated by the Departments of Defense, \n     Energy, and State.\n       (7) The effective implementation of the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction, Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs in the countries of the \n     former Soviet Union is hampered by Russian behavior and \n     conditions on the provision of assistance under such programs \n     that are unrelated to bilateral cooperation on weapons \n     dismantlement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) maximum effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction and related materials, wherever such \n     proliferation may occur, is warranted;\n       (2) the Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs should be expanded, improved, accelerated, and \n     better funded to address the global dimensions of the \n     proliferation threat; and\n       (3) the Proliferation Security Initiative is an important \n     counterproliferation program that should be expanded to \n     include additional partners.\n       (c) Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance programs.--\n     In this section, the term ``Cooperative Threat Reduction, \n     Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs'' includes--\n       (1) the programs specified in section 1501(b) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     (Public Law 104-201; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note);\n       (2) the activities for which appropriations are authorized \n     by section 3101(a)(2) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136; 117 Stat. \n     1742);\n       (3) the Department of State program of assistance to \n     science centers;\n       (4) the Global Threat Reduction Initiative of the \n     Department of Energy; and\n       (5) a program of any agency of the Federal Government \n     having the purpose of assisting any foreign government in \n     preventing nuclear weapons, plutonium, highly enriched \n     uranium, or other materials capable of sustaining an \n     explosive nuclear chain reaction, or nuclear weapons \n     technology from becoming available to terrorist \n     organizations.\n       (d) Strategy and Plan.--\n       (1) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress--\n       (A) a comprehensive strategy for expanding and \n     strengthening the Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs; and\n       (B) an estimate of the funding necessary to execute such \n     strategy.\n       (2) Plan.--The strategy required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include a plan for securing the nuclear weapons and related \n     materials that are the most likely to be acquired or sought \n     by, and susceptible to becoming available to, terrorist \n     organizations, including--\n       (A) a prioritized list of the most dangerous and vulnerable \n     sites;\n       (B) measurable milestones for improving United States \n     nonproliferation assistance programs;\n       (C) a schedule for achieving such milestones; and\n       (D) initial estimates of the resources necessary to achieve \n     such milestones under such schedule.\n\n     SEC. __16. FINANCING OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While efforts to designate and freeze the assets of \n     terrorist financiers have been relatively unsuccessful, \n     efforts to target the relatively small number of al Qaeda \n     financial facilitators have been valuable and successful.\n       (2) The death or capture of several important financial \n     facilitators has decreased the amount of money available to \n     al Qaeda, and has made it more difficult for al Qaeda to \n     raise and move money.\n       (3) The capture of al Qaeda financial facilitators has \n     provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to \n     continue the cycle of disruption.\n       (4) The United States Government has rightly recognized \n     that information about terrorist money helps in understanding \n     terror networks, searching them out, and disrupting their \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical weapon in the effort to stop terrorist \n     financing should be the targeting of terrorist financial \n     facilitators by intelligence and law enforcement agencies; \n     and\n       (2) efforts to track terrorist financing must be paramount \n     in United States counter-terrorism efforts.\n       (c) Report on Terrorist Financing.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report evaluating the effectiveness of United \n     States efforts to curtail the international financing of \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     evaluate and make recommendations on--\n       (A) the effectiveness of efforts and methods to the \n     identification and tracking of terrorist financing;\n       (B) ways to improve multinational and international \n     governmental cooperation in this effort;\n       (C) ways to improve the effectiveness of financial \n     institutions in this effort;\n       (D) the adequacy of agency coordination, nationally and \n     internationally, including international treaties and \n     compacts, in this effort and ways to improve that \n     coordination; and\n       (E) recommendations for changes in law and additional \n     resources required to improve this effort.\n\n     SEC. __17.

\n     the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States (``9-11 Commission'') contained in the ``9-11 \n     Commission Report'' issued on July 22, 2004, and makes \n     further findings as follows:\n       (1) Prior to September 11, 2001, there were warnings of \n     whistleblowers at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and \n     other national security professionals about security \n     breakdowns in air security, border control and emergency \n     planning.\n       (2) Whistleblowers throughout the Executive branch who \n     lawfully exercised the freedom to warn were subjected to \n     retaliation without effective legal defense.\n       (3) Safe communications channels that effectively protect \n     the freedom to warn serve Congress' right to know and are the \n     lifeline for the Commission's ``most difficult and \n     important'' goal of ``strengthening congressional oversight \n     to improve quality and accountability''.\n       (4) Effectively protecting whistleblowers' freedom to warn \n     is the necessary foundation to implement and enforce 9-11 \n     Commission reforms over entrenched institutional resistance, \n     so that the pattern of announced reforms not effecting the \n     necessary institutional and cultural changes does not happen \n     again.\n       (5) Whistleblowers lawfully exercising the freedom to warn \n     personify the 9-11 Commission's conclusion that the ``choice \n     between security and liberty is a false choice'' because they \n     use freedom to strengthen America's security.\n       (6) Whistleblowers exercising the freedom to warn are \n     indispensable for ``an enhanced system of checks and balances \n     to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way \n     of life'' by acting as sentinels who defend the principle \n     that ``if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values \n     that we are struggling to defend''.\n       (7) Effective whistleblower protection is a cornerstone \n     principle necessary for the Commission's institutional goal \n     that ``[g]ood people'' should not have to ``overcome bad \n     structures''.\n       (8) Effectively protecting the individual employee's \n     freedom to warn is a prerequisite to strengthen national \n     security by replacing the ``need to know'' culture of \n     excessive agency compartmentalization with a ``need to \n     share'' culture promoting a ``duty to the information'' and \n     the American taxpayers.\n       (9) Creating a safe channel to effectively exercise the \n     freedom to warn implements the 9-11 Commission's goal for \n     policies ``that simultaneously empower and constrain \n     officials, telling them clearly what is and what is not \n     permitted''.\n       (10) Creating a safe channel to effectively exercise the \n     freedom to warn of breaches in professional security \n     standards serves the 9-11 Commission's premise that \n     professional expertise should have priority over \n     institutional concerns.\n       (c) Jurisdiction.--This section shall apply to any Federal \n     employee, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, \n     the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National \n     Security

States Code, and to any employee or agent of an entity \n     subject to liability under sections 3729 et. seq. of title 5, \n     United States Code, the False Claims Act.\n       (d) Prohibited Discrimination.--No person covered by \n     subsection (c) may be discharged, demoted, suspended, \n     threatened, harassed, investigated other than any ministerial \n     or nondiscretionary fact

relating to a security \n     clearance or any other access determination because the \n     person--\n       (1) is about to or provides information, causes information \n     to be provided, or otherwise communicates with any Member of \n     Congress or any committee of Congress as provided by section \n     7211 of title 5, United States Code, the Lloyd LaFollette Act \n     of 1912,

authority to investigate, discover, or terminate misconduct); \n     or\n       (B) if communication of otherwise-covered information is \n     specifically prohibited by law and if such information is \n     required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest \n     of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs, it may \n     be communicated to Congress pursuant to paragraph (1), the \n     Special Counsel, the Inspector General of an agency, or \n     another employee designated by the head of the agency to \n     receive such disclosures;\n       (3) is about to or files, causes to be filed, testify, \n     participate in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding or action \n     filed or about to be filed relating to a violation of any \n     law, rule, or regulation, or take any other lawful action to \n     assist in carrying out the purposes of the law, rule, or \n     regulation;\n       (4) is about to or refuses to violate or assist in the \n

otherwise communicated, notwithstanding any \n     nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement, if such policy, \n     form, or agreement does not contain the following statement, \n     with an additional reference to this Act: ``These provisions \n     are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or \n     otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or \n     liabilities

Mr. KYL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 2845, to reform the intelligence community and the \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States \nGovernment, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new title:\n\n                      TITLE IV--VISA REQUIREMENTS\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 214 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1184) governs the admission of nonimmigrants to the \n     United States and sets forth the process for that admission.\n       (2) Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     places the burden of proof on a visa applicant to establish \n     ``to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of \n     the application for a visa . . . that he is entitled to a \n     nonimmigrant status''.\n       (3) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States included a recommendation that \n     the United States ``combine terrorist travel intelligence, \n     operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to intercept \n     terrorists . . . and constrain terrorist mobility''.\n       (4) Fifteen of the 19 individuals who participated in the \n     aircraft hijackings on September 11, 2001, were nationals of \n     Saudi Arabia who legally entered the United States after \n     securing nonimmigrant visas despite the fact that they did \n     not adequately meet the burden of proof required by section \n     214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (5) Prior to September 11, 2001, the Department of State \n     allowed consular officers to approve nonimmigrant visa \n     applications that were incomplete, and without conducting \n     face-to-face interviews of many applicants.\n       (6) Each of the 15 individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, filed a visa application that contained inaccuracies \n     and omissions that should have prevented such individual from \n     obtaining a visa.\n       (7) Only one of the hijackers listed an actual address on \n     his visa application. The other hijackers simply wrote \n     answers such as ``California'', ``New York'', or ``Hotel'' \n     when asked to provide a destination inside the United States \n     on the visa application.\n       (8) Only 3 of the individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, provided any information in the section of the visa \n     application that requests the name and address of an employer \n     or school in the United States.\n       (9) The 2002 General Accounting Office report entitled \n     ``Border Security: Visa Process Should Be Strengthened as \n     Antiterrorism Tool'' outlined the written guidelines and \n     practices of the Department of State related to visa issuance \n     and stated that the Department of State allowed for \n     widespread discretion among consular officers in adhering to \n     the burden of proof requirements under section 214(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (10) The General Accounting Office report further stated \n     that the ``Consular Best Practices Handbook'' of the \n     Department of State gave consular managers and staff the \n     discretion to ``waive personal appearance and interviews for \n     certain nonimmigrant visa applicants''.\n       (11) Only 2 of the 15 individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, were interviewed by Department of State consular \n     officers.\n       (12) If the Department of State had required all consular \n     officers to implement section 214(b) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, conduct face-to-face interviews, and require \n     that visa applications be completely and accurately filled \n     out, those who participated in the aircraft hijackings on \n     September 11, 2001, may have been denied nonimmigrant visas \n     and the tragedy of September 11, 2001, could have been \n     prevented.\n\n     SEC. 402. IN PERSON INTERVIEWS OF VISA APPLICANTS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Interviews.--Section 222 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1202) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     Secretary of State shall require every alien applying for a \n     nonimmigrant visa--\n       ``(1) who is at least 12 years of age and not more than 65 \n     years of age to submit to an in person interview with a \n     consular officer unless the requirement for such interview is \n     waived--\n       ``(A) by a consular official and such alien is within that \n     class of nonimmigrants enumerated in section 101(a)(15)(A) or \n     101(a)(15)(G) or is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic \n     passport or on the equivalent thereof;\n       ``(B) by a consular official and such alien is applying for \n     a visa--\n       ``(i) not more than 12 months after the date on which the \n     alien's prior visa expired;\n       ``(ii) for the classification under section 101(a)(15) for \n     which such prior visa was issued;\n       ``(iii) from the consular post located in the country in \n     which the alien is a national; and\n       ``(iv) the consular officer has no indication that the \n     alien has not complied with the immigration laws and \n     regulations of the United States; or\n       ``(C) by the Secretary of State if the Secretary determines \n     that such waiver is--\n       ``(i) in the national interest of the United States; or\n       ``(ii) necessary as a result of unusual circumstances; and\n       ``(2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), to submit to an in \n     person interview with a consular officer if such alien--\n       ``(A) is not a national of the country in which the alien \n     is applying for a visa;\n       ``(B) was previously refused a visa, unless such refusal \n     was overcome or a waiver of ineligibility has been obtained;\n       ``(C) is listed in the Consular Lookout and Support System \n     (or successor system at the Department of State);\n       ``(D) may not obtain a visa until a security advisory \n     opinion or other Department of State clearance is issued \n     unless such alien is--\n       ``(i) within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in \n     section 101(a)(15)(A) or 101(a)(15)(G); and\n       ``(ii) not a national of a country that is officially \n     designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism; or\n       ``(E) is identified as a member of a group or sector that \n     the Secretary of State determines--\n       ``(i) poses a substantial risk of submitting inaccurate \n     information in order to obtain a visa;\n       ``(ii) has historically had visa applications denied at a \n     rate that is higher than the average rate of such denials; or\n       ``(iii) poses a security threat to the United States.''.\n       (b) Conduct During Interviews.--Section 222 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1202), as amended \n     by subsection (a), is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) A consular officer who is conducting an in person \n     interview with an alien applying for a visa or other \n     documentation shall--\n       ``(1) make every effort to conduct such interview fairly;\n       ``(2) employ high professional standards during such \n     interview;\n       ``(3) use best interviewing techniques to elicit pertinent \n     information to assess the alien's qualifications, including \n     techniques to identify any potential security concerns posed \n     by the alien;\n       ``(4) provide the alien with an adequate opportunity to \n     present evidence establishing the accuracy of the information \n     in the alien's application; and\n       ``(5) make a careful record of the interview to document \n     the basis for the final action on the alien's application, if \n     appropriate.''.\n\n     SEC. 403. VISA APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 222(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1202(c)) is amended by inserting ``The alien shall \n     provide complete and accurate information in response to any \n     request for information contained in the application.'' after \n     the second sentence.\n\n     SEC. 404. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 341 or any other provision of this \n     Act, this title shall take effect 90 days after date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3927.

UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD DICTATORSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress finds that short-term gains enjoyed by the United \n     States through cooperation with repressive dictatorships have \n     often been outweighed by long-term setbacks for the stature \n     and interests of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States foreign policy should promote the value \n     of life and the importance of individual educational and \n     economic opportunity, encourage widespread political \n     participation, condemn indiscriminate violence, and promote \n     respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing \n     differences among people, and tolerance for opposing points \n     of view; and\n       (2) the United States Government must prevail upon the \n     governments of all predominantly Muslim countries, including \n     those that are friends and allies of the United States, to \n     condemn indiscriminate violence, promote the value of life, \n     respect and promote the principles of individual education \n     and economic opportunity, encourage widespread political \n     participation, and promote the rule of law, openness in \n     discussing differences among people, and tolerance for \n     opposing points of view.\n\n     SEC. __08. PROMOTION OF UNITED STATES VALUES THROUGH \n                   BROADCAST MEDIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States has demonstrated and \n     promoted its values in defending Muslims against tyrants and \n     criminals in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, \n     this message is not always clearly presented and understood \n     in the Islamic world.\n       (2) If the United States does not act to vigorously define \n     its message in the Islamic world, the image of the United \n     States will be defined by Islamic extremists who seek to \n     demonize the United States.\n       (3) Recognizing that many Arab and Muslim audiences rely on \n     satellite television and radio, the United States Government \n     has launched promising initiatives in television and radio \n     broadcasting to the Arab world, Iran, and Afghanistan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States must do more to defend and promote \n     its values and ideals to the broadest possible audience in \n     the Islamic world;\n       (2) United States efforts to defend and promote these \n     values and ideals are beginning to ensure that accurate \n     expressions of these values reach large audiences in the \n     Islamic world and should be robustly supported;\n       (3) the United States Government could and should do more \n     to engage the Muslim world in the struggle of ideas; and\n       (4) the United States Government should more intensively \n     employ existing broadcast media in the Islamic world as part \n     of this engagement.\n       (c) Authorizations of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President for each of the fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2009 such sums as may be necessary to \n     carry out United States Government broadcasting activities \n     under the United States Information and Educational Exchange \n     Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), the United States \n     International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et \n     seq.), and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \n     of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), and to carry out other \n     activities under this section consistent with the purposes of \n     such Acts, unless otherwise authorized by Congress.\n\n     SEC. __09.

INTERNATIONAL YOUTH OPPORTUNITY FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value \n     of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a \n     key element in any global strategy to eliminate Islamist \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Education in the Middle East about the world outside \n     that region is weak.\n       (3) The United Nations has rightly equated literacy with \n     freedom.\n       (4) The international community is moving toward setting a \n     concrete goal of reducing by half the illiteracy rate in the \n     Middle East by 2010, through the implementation of education \n     programs targeting women and girls and programs for adult \n     literacy, and by other means.\n       (5) To be effective, efforts to improve education in the \n     Middle East must also include--\n       (A) support for the provision of basic education tools, \n     such as textbooks that translate more of the world's \n     knowledge into local languages and local libraries to house \n     such materials; and\n       (B) more vocational education in trades and business \n     skills.\n       (6) The Middle East can benefit from some of the same \n     programs to bridge the digital\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\n     divide that already have been developed for other regions of \n     the world.\n       (b) International Youth Opportunity Fund.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish an \n     International Youth Opportunity Fund to provide financial \n     assistance for the improvement of public education in the \n     Middle East.\n       (2) International participation.--The President shall seek \n     the cooperation of the international community in \n     establishing and generously supporting the Fund.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President for the establishment of \n     the International Youth Opportunity Fund, in addition to any \n     amounts otherwise available for such purpose, such sums as \n     may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009, unless otherwise authorized by Congress.\n\n     SEC. __11. THE USE OF ECONOMIC POLICIES TO COMBAT TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While terrorism is not caused by poverty, breeding \n     grounds for terrorism are created by backward economic \n     policies and repressive political regimes.\n       (2) Policies that support economic development and reform \n     also have political implications, as economic and political \n     liberties are often linked.\n       (3) The United States is working toward creating a Middle \n     East Free Trade Area by 2013 and implementing a free trade \n     agreement with Bahrain, and free trade agreements exist \n     between the United States and Israel and the United States \n     and Jordan.\n       (4) Existing and proposed free trade agreements between the \n     United States and Islamic countries are drawing interest from \n     other countries in the Middle East region, and Islamic \n     countries can become full participants in the rules-based \n     global trading system, as the United States considers \n     lowering its barriers to trade with the poorest Arab \n     countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a comprehensive United States strategy to counter \n     terrorism should include economic policies that encourage \n     development, open societies, and opportunities for people to \n     improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects \n     for their children's future;\n       (2) one element of such a strategy should encompass the \n     lowering of trade barriers with the poorest countries that \n     have a significant population of Arab or Muslim individuals;\n       (3) another element of such a strategy should encompass \n     United States efforts to promote economic reform in countries \n     that have a significant population of Arab or Muslim \n     individuals, including efforts to integrate such countries \n     into the global trading system; and\n       (4) given the importance of the rule of law in promoting \n     economic development and attracting investment, the United \n     States should devote an increased proportion of its \n     assistance to countries in the Middle East to the promotion \n     of the rule of law.\n\n     SEC. __12. MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009 such sums as may be necessary for the Middle East \n     Partnership Initiative, unless otherwise authorized by \n     Congress.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     given the importance of the rule of law and economic reform \n     to development in the Middle East, a significant portion of \n     the funds authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) \n     should be made available to promote the rule of law in the \n     Middle East.\n\n     SEC. __13. COMPREHENSIVE COALITION STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost every aspect of the counterterrorism strategy of \n     the United States relies on international cooperation.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, the number and scope of \n     United States Government contacts with foreign governments \n     concerning counterterrorism have expanded significantly, but \n     such contacts have often been ad hoc and not integrated as a \n     comprehensive and unified approach.\n       (b) International Contact Group on Counterterrorism.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President--\n       (A) should seek to engage the leaders of the governments of \n     other countries in a process of advancing beyond separate and \n     uncoordinated national counterterrorism strategies to develop \n     with those other governments a comprehensive coalition \n     strategy to fight Islamist terrorism; and\n       (B) to that end, should seek to establish an international \n     counterterrorism policy contact group with the leaders of \n     governments providing leadership in global counterterrorism \n     efforts and governments of countries with sizable Muslim \n     populations, to be used as a ready and flexible international \n     means for discussing and coordinating the development of \n     important counterterrorism policies by the participating \n     governments.\n       (2) Authority.--The President is authorized to establish an \n     international counterterrorism policy contact group with the \n     leaders of governments referred to in paragraph (1) for \n     purposes as follows:\n       (A) To develop in common with such other countries \n     important policies and a strategy that address the various \n     components of international prosecution of the war on \n     terrorism, including policies and a strategy that address \n     military issues, law enforcement, the collection, analysis, \n     and dissemination of intelligence, issues relating to \n     interdiction of travel by terrorists, counterterrorism-\n     related customs issues, financial issues, and issues relating \n     to terrorist sanctuaries.\n       (B) To address, to the extent (if any) that the President \n     and leaders of other participating governments determine \n     appropriate, such long-term issues as economic and political \n     reforms that can contribute to strengthening stability and \n     security in the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. __14. TREATMENT OF FOREIGN PRISONERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Carrying out the global war on terrorism requires the \n     development of policies with respect to the detention and \n     treatment of captured international terrorists that are \n     adhered to by all coalition forces.\n       (2) Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment \n     of Prisoners of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3316) was specifically designed for cases in which the usual \n     rules of war do not apply, and the minimum standards of \n     treatment pursuant to such Article are generally accepted \n     throughout the world as customary international law.\n       (b) Policy.--The policy of the United States is as follows:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to treat all \n     foreign persons captured, detained, interned or otherwise \n     held in the custody of the United States (hereinafter \n     ``prisoners'') humanely and in accordance with standards that \n     the United States would consider legal if perpetrated by the \n     enemy against an American prisoner.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that all \n     officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and \n     in peacetime by the legal prohibition against torture, cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment.\n       (3) If there is any doubt as to whether prisoners are \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, such prisoners shall enjoy the protections of \n     the Geneva Conventions until such time as their status can be \n     determined pursuant to the procedures authorized by Army \n     Regulation 190-8, Section 1-6.\n       (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously \n     prosecute cases of terrorism or other criminal acts alleged \n     to have been committed by prisoners in the custody of the \n     United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order \n     to avoid the indefinite detention of prisoners, which is \n     contrary to the legal principles and security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (c) Reporting.--The Department of Defense shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees:\n       (1) A quarterly report providing the number of prisoners \n     who were denied Prisoner of War (POW) status under the Geneva \n     Conventions and the basis for denying POW status to each such \n     prisoner.\n       (2) A report setting forth--\n       (A) the proposed schedule for military commissions to be \n     held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and\n       (B) the number of individuals currently held at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, the number of such individuals who are unlikely to \n     face a military commission in the next six months, and each \n     reason for not bringing such individuals before a military \n     commission.\n       (3) All International Committee of the Red Cross reports, \n     completed prior to the enactment of this Act, concerning the \n     treatment of prisoners in United States custody at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Such ICRC reports should be \n     provided, in classified form, not later than 15 days after \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (4) A report setting forth all prisoner interrogation \n     techniques approved by officials of the United States.\n       (d) Annual Training Requirement.--The Department of Defense \n     shall certify that all Federal employees and civilian \n     contractors engaged in the handling or interrogating of \n     prisoners have fulfilled an annual training requirement on \n     the laws of war, the Geneva Conventions and the obligations \n     of the United States under international humanitarian law.\n       (e) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment.--\n       (1) In general.--No prisoner shall be subject to torture or \n     cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment that is \n     prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Relationship to geneva conventions.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the status of any person under the \n     Geneva Conventions or whether any person is entitled to the \n     protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n       (f) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act,\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\n     the Secretary and the Director shall prescribe the rules, \n     regulations, or guidelines necessary to ensure compliance \n     with the prohibition in subsection (e)(1) by all personnel of \n     the United States Government and by any person providing \n     services to the United States Government on a contract basis.\n       (2) Report to congress.--The Secretary and the Director \n     shall submit to Congress the rules, regulations, or \n     guidelines prescribed under paragraph (1), and any \n     modifications to such rules, regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications;

PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Al Qaeda and other terror groups have tried to acquire \n     or make weapons of mass destruction since 1994 or earlier.\n       (2) The United States doubtless would be a prime target for \n     use of any such weapon by al Qaeda.\n       (3) Although the United States Government has supported the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance programs, \n     nonproliferation experts continue to express deep concern \n     about the adequacy of such efforts to secure weapons of mass \n     destruction and related materials that still exist in Russia \n     other countries of the former Soviet Union, and around the \n     world.\n       (4) The cost of increased investment in the prevention of \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     materials is greatly outweighed by the potentially \n     catastrophic cost to the United States of the use of such \n     weapons by terrorists.\n       (5) The Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs are the United States primary method of preventing \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related \n     materials from Russia and the states of the former Soviet \n     Union, but require further expansion, improvement, and \n     resources.\n       (6) Better coordination is needed within the executive \n     branch of government for the budget development, oversight, \n     and implementation of the Cooperative Threat Reduction, \n     Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs, and critical elements \n     of such programs are operated by the Departments of Defense, \n     Energy, and State.\n       (7) The effective implementation of the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction, Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs in the countries of the \n     former Soviet Union is hampered by Russian behavior and \n     conditions on the provision of assistance under such programs \n     that are unrelated to bilateral cooperation on weapons \n     dismantlement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) maximum effort to prevent the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction and related materials, wherever such \n     proliferation may occur, is warranted;\n       (2) the Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs should be expanded, improved, accelerated, and \n     better funded to address the global dimensions of the \n     proliferation threat; and\n       (3) the Proliferation Security Initiative is an important \n     counterproliferation program that should be expanded to \n     include additional partners.\n       (c) Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative, and Other Nonproliferation Assistance Programs.--\n     In this section, the term ``Cooperative Threat Reduction, \n     Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and other \n     nonproliferation assistance programs'' includes--\n       (1) the programs specified in section 1501(b) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     (Public Law 104-201; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note);\n       (2) the activities for which appropriations are authorized \n     by section 3101(a)(2) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136; 117 Stat. \n     1742);\n       (3) the Department of State program of assistance to \n     science centers;\n       (4) the Global Threat Reduction Initiative of the \n     Department of Energy; and\n       (5) a program of any agency of the Federal Government \n     having the purpose of assisting any foreign government in \n     preventing nuclear weapons, plutonium, highly enriched \n     uranium, or other materials capable of sustaining an \n     explosive nuclear chain reaction, or nuclear weapons \n     technology from becoming available to terrorist \n     organizations.\n       (d) Strategy and Plan.--\n       (1) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress--\n       (A) a comprehensive strategy for expanding and \n     strengthening the Cooperative Threat Reduction, Global Threat \n     Reduction Initiative, and other nonproliferation assistance \n     programs; and\n       (B) an estimate of the funding necessary to execute such \n     strategy.\n       (2) Plan.--The strategy required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include a plan for securing the nuclear weapons and related \n     materials that are the most likely to be acquired or sought \n     by, and susceptible to becoming available to, terrorist \n     organizations, including--\n       (A) a prioritized list of the most dangerous and vulnerable \n     sites;\n       (B) measurable milestones for improving United States \n     nonproliferation assistance programs;\n       (C) a schedule for achieving such milestones; and\n       (D) initial estimates of the resources necessary to achieve \n     such milestones under such schedule.\n\n     SEC. __16. FINANCING OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While efforts to designate and freeze the assets of \n     terrorist financiers have been relatively unsuccessful, \n     efforts to target the relatively small number of al Qaeda \n     financial facilitators have been valuable and successful.\n       (2) The death or capture of several important financial \n     facilitators has decreased the amount of money available to \n     al Qaeda, and has made it more difficult for al Qaeda to \n     raise and move money.\n       (3) The capture of al Qaeda financial facilitators has \n     provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to \n     continue the cycle of disruption.\n       (4) The United States Government has rightly recognized \n     that information about terrorist money helps in understanding \n     terror networks, searching them out, and disrupting their \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical weapon in the effort to stop terrorist \n     financing should be the targeting of terrorist financial \n     facilitators by intelligence and law enforcement agencies; \n     and\n       (2) efforts to track terrorist financing must be paramount \n     in United States counter-terrorism efforts.\n       (c) Report on Terrorist Financing.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report evaluating the effectiveness of United \n     States efforts to curtail the international financing of \n     terrorism.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     evaluate and make recommendations on--\n       (A) the effectiveness of efforts and methods to the \n     identification and tracking of terrorist financing;\n       (B) ways to improve multinational and international \n     governmental cooperation in this effort;\n       (C) ways to improve the effectiveness of financial \n     institutions in this effort;\n       (D) the adequacy of agency coordination, nationally and \n     internationally, including\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\n     international treaties and compacts, in this effort and ways \n     to improve that coordination; and\n       (E) recommendations for changes in law and additional \n     resources required to improve this effort.\n\n     SEC. __17.

and\n       (D) a description of long-term goals and actions designed \n     to reduce the conditions that allow the formation of \n     terrorist sanctuaries, such as supporting and strengthening \n     host governments, reducing poverty, increasing economic \n     development, strengthening civil society, securing borders, \n     strengthening internal security forces, and disrupting \n     logistics and communications networks of terrorist groups.\n       (2) Support for pakistan.--A description of the efforts of \n     the United States Government to support Pakistan and \n     encourage moderation in that country, including--\n       (A) an examination of the desirability of establishing a \n     Pakistan Education Fund to direct resources toward improving \n     the quality of secondary schools in Pakistan, and an \n     examination of the efforts of the Government of Pakistan to \n     fund modern public education;\n       (B) recommendations on the funding necessary to provide \n     various levels of educational support;\n       (C) an examination of the current composition and levels of \n     United States military aid to Pakistan, together with any \n     recommendations for changes in such levels and composition \n     that the President considers appropriate;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Over 54,000,000 individuals in the United States have \n     disabilities, with almost half experiencing severe \n     disabilities that affect their ability to see, hear, \n     communicate, reason, walk, or perform other basic life \n     functions.\n       ``(2) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--\n       ``(A) live independently;\n       ``(B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;\n       ``(C) benefit from an education;\n       ``(D) pursue meaningful careers; and\n       ``(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, \n     political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of \n     society in the United States.\n       ``(3) Technology is one of the primary engines for economic \n     activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, and \n     throughout the world. The commitment of the United States to \n     the development and utilization of technology is one of the \n     main factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the \n     economy of the United States.\n       ``(4) As technology has come to play an increasingly \n     important role in the lives of all persons in the United \n     States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of \n     government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct \n     of commerce, and in the provision of education, its impact \n     upon the lives of individuals with disabilities in the United \n     States has been comparable to its impact upon the remainder \n     of the citizens of the United States. Any development in \n     mainstream technology will have profound implications for \n     individuals with disabilities in the United States.\n       ``(5) Substantial progress has been made in the development \n     of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to \n     existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living \n     that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of \n     all ages. These devices, including adaptations, increase \n     involvement in, and reduce expenditures associated with, \n     programs and activities that facilitate communication, ensure \n     independent functioning, enable early childhood development, \n     support educational achievement, provide and enhance \n     employment options, and enable full participation in \n     community living for individuals with disabilities. Access to \n     such devices can also reduce expenditures associated with \n     early childhood intervention, education, rehabilitation and \n     training, health care, employment, residential living, \n     independent living, recreation opportunities, and other \n     aspects of daily living.\n       ``(6) Over the last 15 years, the Federal Government has \n     invested in the development of comprehensive statewide \n     programs of technology-related assistance, which have proven \n     effective in assisting individuals with disabilities in \n     accessing assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services. This partnership between the Federal \n     Government and the States provided an important service to \n     individuals with disabilities by strengthening the capacity \n     of each State to assist individuals with disabilities of all \n     ages meet their assistive technology needs.\n       ``(7) Despite the success of the Federal-State partnership \n     in providing access to assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services, there is a continued need to \n     provide information about the availability of assistive \n     technology, advances in improving accessibility and \n     functionality of assistive technology, and appropriate \n     methods to secure and utilize assistive technology in order \n     to maximize the independence and participation of individuals \n     with disabilities in society.\n       ``(8) The combination of significant recent changes in \n     Federal policy (including changes to section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), accessibility \n     provisions of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. \n     15301 et seq.), and the amendments made to the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) by \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) and the rapid and \n     unending evolution of technology require a Federal-State \n     investment in State assistive technology systems to continue \n     to ensure that individuals with disabilities reap the \n     benefits of the technological revolution and participate \n     fully in life in their communities.\n       ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       ``(1) to support State efforts to improve the provision of \n     assistive technology to individuals with disabilities through \n     comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related \n     assistance, for individuals with disabilities of all ages, \n     that are designed to--\n       ``(A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, \n     provision of, and training about assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services;\n       ``(B) increase the ability of individuals with disabilities \n     of all ages to secure and maintain possession of assistive \n     technology devices as such individuals make the transition \n     between services offered by educational or human service \n     agencies or between settings of daily living (for example, \n     between home and work);\n       ``(C) increase the capacity of public agencies and private \n     entities to provide and pay for assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services on a statewide basis for \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages;\n       ``(D) increase the involvement of individuals with \n     disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, \n     guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in \n     decisions related to the provision of assistive technology \n     devices and assistive technology services;\n       ``(E) increase and promote coordination among State \n     agencies, between State and local agencies, among local \n     agencies, and between State and local agencies and private \n     entities (such as managed care providers), that are involved \n     or are eligible to be involved in carrying out activities \n     under this Act;\n       ``(F) increase the awareness and facilitate the change of \n     laws, regulations, policies, practices, procedures, and \n     organizational structures, that facilitate the availability \n     or provision of assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services; and\n       ``(G) increase awareness and knowledge of the benefits of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services among targeted individuals and entities and the \n     general population; and\n       ``(2) to provide States with financial assistance that \n     supports programs designed to maximize the ability of \n     individuals with disabilities and their family members, \n     guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives to \n     obtain assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services.\n\n     ``SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 5149, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5149) to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance \n     for Needy Families block grant program through March 31, \n     2005, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the state of children's health insurance \nprogram, or SCHIP, is one of the largest and most successful expansion \nof public health insurance for children since the creation of Medicaid. \nThis vitally important program was created through a bipartisan \ncommitment to expanding health coverage for children. Because today is \nthe last day of the fiscal year for the Federal Government, $1.1 \nbillion in unspent SCHIP funds are set to expire. These are funds that \nhave been reallocated and then subsequently have had their availability \nextended several times over the past few years. In addition \napproximately $660 million in unspent 2002 state allotments are \navailable to Secretary Thompson to redistribute to states that have \nspent their 2002 allotments.\n  I want to go on the record to say that I am absolutely committed to \nfinding a bipartisan solution that will keep the $1.1 billion in the \nSCHIP program. Congress can, and should, address this issue before \nrecessing in October, but if not, certainly before the close of the \nsession. I want to work together with my colleagues in both parties \ntoward a productive approach. The SCHIP program was created when people \nreached across the aisle and joined together to do the right thing to \nget kids health coverage. Today we need to move forward with this same \nspirit of cooperation and commitment.\n  We can also improve the SCHIP program to get more kids covered. In \n2003, SCHIP covered 5.8 million targeted low-income individuals. \nHowever, a substantial number of children who are eligible for health \ncoverage through SCHIP are not enrolled. This is a serious issue that \ndeserves our thoughtful attention. We can do better.\n  The Federal Government should commit itself to getting more of these \nkids enrolled. They are entitled to health coverage under this vitally \nimportant program, yet billions of SCHIP dollars lie unspent. These \nunspent dollars are not helping any children today. I would hope that \nwe can work out a plan to target a portion of the $1.1 billion in \nexpiring SCHIP funding towards a coordinated SCHIP outreach plan so \nthat as many eligible children as possible receive the coverage they \ndeserve.\n  Of course, I am aware that there are fiscal concerns from states that \ncan impede their ability to use State dollars to match Federal SCHIP \ndollars. Some are also concerned that increased enrollment will place a \nburden on states already struggling with the rising cost of health \ncare. I really believe, however, that we can find a way to get more \nkids covered and provide states incentives to do so.\n  The fact that these funds are expiring does not mean that the SCHIP \nprogram is in danger of imminent collapse. That is not the case. While \nI am informed by CMS that six States face potential SCHIP shortfalls in \nFY05, Secretary Thompson has indicated that, unless Congress passes \nlegislation to address these shortfalls, he will redistribute the \napproximately $660 million in 2002 allotments, which is more than \nenough to make up for these shortfalls in 2005.\n  Working together, Congress can reallocate the expiring $1.1 billion \nafter tomorrow with no impact on the SCHIP program. In fact, in the \npast, Congress has acted months later to reallocate expired SCHIP funds \nback into the program. So it is not the case that September 30th is the \n``drop dead date'' for action. In fact, when the FY1998 and FY1999 \nreallocations expired at the close of FY2002, Congress acted in 2003 to \n``reinstate'' these funds through\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nSeptember 30, 2004. So, even if Congress acts in November to reallocate \nthese funds, this is how Congress has dealt with the issue in the past \nand it can be done again.\n  We can work together to get the job done. I am committed to working \nwith members on both sides of the aisle to reach a bipartisan agreement \nso that we can keep the $1.1 billion in the SCHIP program, address the \nprojected 6-state shortfall and get as many kids as possible the health \ncare coverage for which they are entitled. I believe we can do it if we \nall commit ourselves to putting kids first and moving ahead together.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as one of the original authors of the CHIP \nprogram, I rise to share my strong support for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, CHIP. Many are very worried about unspent CHIP \ndollars for fiscal year 2002 going back to the Treasury after today. I \nshare those concerns. I want that $1.1 billion to remain available so \nit can be used to pay for health coverage for children. So does the \nPresident. So do my colleagues in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. There is no disagreement on that issue. Let me assure \nyou that this will be resolved.\n  Regardless of what happens on October 1, every State will receive its \nnew CHIP money for fiscal year 2005. Simply put, all States will be \ngiven the funds to cover their CHIP expenses while Congress continues \nto work on ways to use the unspent CHIP money from fiscal year 2002. It \nis important to remember that Congress has the power to restore these \nunspent CHIP funds to states once the new fiscal year has begun. In \nfact, just last year, Congress acted to restore unspent CHIP funds from \nfiscal years 1998 and 1999 to states several months after these funds \nwent back to the Treasury. And, let me emphasize, once again, the \nfiscal year 2002 CHIP funds are not needed by any State for its 2005 \nCHIP program. No child is in danger of losing his or her CHIP coverage.\n  CHIP has been, for the most part, a great success. Today, there are \n5.8 million children enrolled in the CHIP program. We have made good \nprogress in providing health insurance to uninsured children. We have \nhad great successes with the CHIP program since 1997, when it was first \ncreated.\n  However, important issues concerning the program still must be \naddressed. I believe that the No. 1 issue is reaching out to CHIP-\neligible children who currently are not covered by the program. While \nmany States have been successful with their outreach efforts, that is \nnot the case in all States. I am particularly troubled by the \ndifficulties faced by Native American children. Outreach must be \naddressed by Congress--my primary goal when we were drafting the \noriginal CHIP legislation in 1997 was to ensure that CHIP was available \nfor all eligible children.\n  My biggest concern with one approach for spending the unspent fiscal \nyear 2002 funds is contained in S. 2759, authored by Senators \nRockefeller, Chafee, Kennedy and Snowe, is that it does not directly \nhelp enroll the millions of uninsured children who are eligible for \nCHIP program. I have reviewed the Rockefeller-Kennedy bill and I am not \nconvinced that it does anything to increase CHIP enrollment. Providing \nhealth insurance coverage under CHIP to uninsured children should be \nour top priority, not redistributing CHIP funding to states. Congress \nhas redistributed leftover CHIP funds to states more than once and I am \nsure that the legislation has made a significant difference in \nincreasing CHIP enrollment of uninsured, CHIP-eligible children.\n  That is why I am advocating a different approach and placing a higher \npriority on outreach to these uninsured children. I strongly support \nthe President's goal to have a broad outreach effort through community-\nbased entities such as hospitals, schools, Indian Health Service \nhospitals and clinics, tribes and tribal organizations, non-profit \ncommunity organizations, and Federally-qualified health centers. I also \nsupport performance-based grants for states that are successful in \nenrolling and covering children. These states should be rewarded for \ntheir successes in covering more children, instead of facing higher \nstate costs.\n  While today marks the end of the fiscal year, it does not mark the \nend of the CHIP program. It does not mean that the CHIP program is \ngoing to lose money. It does not mean that states are going to run out \nof CHIP funds tomorrow. We all agree that these funds should remain in \nthe CHIP program--we just have different ideas on how that money should \nbe spent. Regardless, I am convinced that we will be able to work \ntogether on a solution regarding this important issue. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to work to ensure that all eligible children are covered \nunder the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \ndismay that the administration and the Congress have failed to prevent \nalmost $1.1 billion in money that has been previous allocated to the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, from expiring. \nFamilies USA points out that the loss of these funds approximate the \nannual cost of providing health coverage to almost 750,000 children. \nThat failure is unacceptable for a nation such as ours.\n  However, I am pleased to report that both Finance Committee Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus are moving quickly to pull together a \nbipartisan group together to resolve this problem as soon as possible. \nConsidering that the chairman is the author of important pieces of \nlegislation, such as the Family Opportunity Act, to improve the health \nof our Nation's children with special health care needs, it should come \nas no surprise that he is working to bridge the gap between legislation \nintroduced by Senators Rockefeller and Chafee that would preserve and \nreallocate the $1.1 billion in SCHIP funds and the administration's \nstated position to preserve the funding but take those dollars \ncurrently dedicated to health insurance coverage and use them instead \n``to enroll more children who remain uninsured despite being eligible \nfor coverage.''\n  In light of the chairman's dedication to the issue and commitment to \na bipartisan solution, I am hopeful that we will get this resolved, and \nI urge all parties to work toward a compromise as soon as possible.\n  What is at stake here? According to data from a Kaiser Commission on \nMedicaid and the Uninsured report that was released on Monday, there \nwere over 9.1 million children who were uninsured in our country in \n2003. There have been important strides made in reducing the number of \nuninsured children since the passage of SCHIP, as the number of \nuninsured has dropped from 9.4 million uninsured in 2000 to the 9.1 \nmillion in 2003. The uninsured rate would have increased dramatically \nif not for SCHIP. In fact, the uninsured rate for adults during this \nsame time-period increased from 30.2 million to 35.5 million.\n  Regardless of the improvement in children's health, the fact that \nover 9 million children remain uninsured is absolutely unacceptable for \na nation such as ours.\n  In fact, if every single child living in the 21 States of Alaska, \nArkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, \nMontana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nRhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and \nthe District of Columbia were uninsured, that would still be less than \n9 million children. In other words, the number of children without \nhealth insurance in our nation exceeds the number of all children \nliving in 21 states and the District of Columbia combined.\n  That is not something anybody in the administration or this chamber \nshould find acceptable. We should be doing everything in our power to, \nat the very least, preclude the loss of over $1 billion that could be \nused to reduce that uninsured rate.\n  In New Mexico, the loss of this money is coupled with the loss of an \nexpiring provision that is very important to our State and 10 others. \nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that New Mexico \nwill lose at least $20 million over the next few years in money for \nchildren's health if the administration and Congress fails to act.\n  Moreover, there was a very important provision that was included in \nthe last redistribution effort that allows the 11 States, including New \nMexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nWisconsin, to use up to 20 percent of allotted and retained funds by \nour States on children who are enrolled in Medicaid with income above \n150 percent of poverty. This provision was included to recognize that \nour 11 States had enacted health care expansions for children prior to \nthe enactment of SCHIP and were being effectively penalized financially \nfor having done the right thing for children prior to 1997. The reason \nis that children in the other 39 States are able to receive an enhanced \nmatching rate for children as low as 100 percent of poverty while \nchildren in states such as Washington cannot receive an enhanced \nmatching rate until a child lives in a family with income above 200 \npercent of poverty.\n  This important compromise, which significantly reduces the inequity \namong the States, was achieved in large part due to the hard and \ndedicated work of Senators Murray, Cantwell, Jeffords, Leahy, Chafee, \nReed of Rhode Island, Domenici, and Frist.\n  Unfortunately, that critically important provision will also \neffectively expire tonight. This will have a detrimental impact on the \nhealth and well-being of the children in these States, as this has been \nfunding that our states have counted on for the delivery of children's \nhealth services in both Medicaid and SCHIP for fiscal year 2005.\n  In Secretary Thompson's letter to Senator Grassley on Tuesday and the \nmajority Leader's letter to Senator Chafee on September 24, 2004, they \nboth failed to recognize this issue. It is for that reason I raise it \nhere again in the Senate to remind my colleagues and the administration \nthat it is an important issue to our 11 States, including that of the \nMajority Leader, and that, just as we must find a solution to restoring \nthe $1.1 billion in expiring funding for SCHIP, we must also get this \nother issue resolved as soon as possible.\n  I strongly urge the administration to reconsider its position that \nthe $1.1 billion should be completely diverted from health coverage to \noutreach and enrollment. If implemented as proposed, it would result in \nover 20 percent of SCHIP dollars in 2005 going to outreach and \nenrollment. While I am a strong supporter of outreach and enrollment in \nSCHIP, this proposal is both extreme and excessive. In fact, it should \nbe noted that beginning in fiscal year 2002 that expenditures of \nfederal SCHIP funds have begun to exceed federal SCHIP allotments. \nTherefore, keeping as much funding in actual health coverage is \ncritically important to continue to reduce the number of uninsured \nchildren in our nation.\n  On the other hand, as the sponsor of legislation with the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus that authorizes the use of $50 million of \nSCHIP funding for outreach and enrollment that was subsequently picked \nup by the majority leader in legislation he introduced, I firmly \nbelieve setting aside a limited portion of the $1.1 billion for \noutreach and enrollment is both necessary to reach a compromise and \nwould also result in better health coverage for children.\n  In fact, of the 9.1 million uninsured, according to data from the \nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 6.8 million live in \nhouseholds that have incomes below 200 percent of poverty, which is the \nlevel at which most States provide a combination of coverage for \nchildren through either their Medicaid or State Children's Health \nInsurance Programs. While some of these children would not be eligible \nfor either Medicaid or SCHIP due to their immigration status, it is \nclear from a variety of studies that somewhere between 60 to 85 percent \nof uninsured children are eligible for but not enrolled in either \nMedicaid or SCHIP.\n  Princeton University's publication entitled The Future of Children \ndedicated much of one issue to looking at successful efforts to improve \noutreach and enrollment. As one of its articles notes, ``Most important \nto reducing the uninsurance problem facing children is raising \nparticipation in Medicaid and SCHIP, as 76 percent of uninsured \nchildren are already eligible for coverage under SCHIP and Medicaid, \nbut are not enrolled. A continued focus on simple and convenient \nenrollment and renewal systems, as well as proactive outreach and \neducational efforts, will be key to reaching these children. Special \nefforts will be needed to enroll Latino and other minority children, \nchildren in immigrant families (families in which at least one member \nis an immigrant), and adolescents. Children in these groups are all \nover-represented in the ranks of the eligible, but uninsured.''\n  In New Mexico, we have our own special program along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder that has been funded by the Bureau of Primary Health Care called \nBorder VISION Fornteriza. The program funds the recruitment and \ntraining of community health workers or promotoras that have over the \nyears successfully assisted in the enrollment of thousands of children \ninto health coverage through Medicaid and SCHIP. The program was \nhonored as a model program by the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission and it \nis precisely this type of program that should be encouraged in whatever \nagreement is reached.\n  As a point of comparison, when Congress passed the Medicare \nprescription drug bill last year, hundreds of millions of dollars was \ndedicated to doing outreach and enrollment to senior citizens and \npeople with disabilities about the prescription drug cards and the \npending drug coverage. In contrast, while States can spend some of \ntheir administrative dollars in SCHIP on outreach and enrollment, there \nare no federal funds exclusively dedicated to conduct outreach and \nenrollment efforts in either Medicaid or SCHIP.\n  That should change, and I hope my colleagues will closely review the \nlanguage introduced by me as part of S. 1159 and in S. 2091 introduced \nby the majority leader on providing outreach and enrollment funding for \nchildren's health.\n  And finally, I am also hopeful that the Senate will consider \nlegislation by Senator Lugar and me that would streamline enrollment of \nchildren in either Medicaid or SCHIP. Just as we know that low-income \nsenior citizens and the disabled enrolled in Medicare Savings Programs \nare clearly income eligible for the new Medicare prescription drug card \nand its $600 annual subsidy, I had introduced legislation with Senator \nLincoln to auto-enroll those Medicare beneficiaries into the drug card \nto get the $600 subsidy.\n  Dr. Mark McClellan, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, worked hard and has agreed that those \nbeneficiaries should be presumed income-eligible and sent the card for \nthem to activate. Over 1 million low-income senior citizens and people \nwith disabilities will now be getting access to the drug card subsidy \nthat would not have otherwise received those funds.\n  The same type of mechanism should be applied to children' health. The \nChildren's Partnership and the Kaiser Family Foundation recently \nreleased a report on what they call ``Express Lane Eligibility.'' This \nconcept is encompassed in Senator Lugar's legislation by employing \n``two common-sense strategies to find and enroll these nearly seven \nmillion `eligible but uninsured' children in health insurance coverage. \n. . .''\n  Those common-sense strategies are: No. 1, it targets large numbers of \neligible children where they can be found: in other public benefit \nprograms like school lunch and food stamps. More than 70 percent of \nlow-income uninsured children are already receiving other public \nassistance benefits of some kind; and No. 2 it expedites children's \nenrollment in health coverage by using information already submitted by \nparents when they enrolled their children in other benefit programs.\n  Again, I urge the Congress to also closely look at this successful \nmodel to improve enrollment of children into health insurance coverage.\n  I am terribly disappointed that the expiring SCHIP funds were not \nretained in a timely manner, but am hopeful that under the leadership \nof both Senators Grassley and Baucus that we will quickly come to a \nresolution of this issue in which all the $1.1 billion in restored and \nretained for children's health. Furthermore, I am hopeful that a \nportion of that funding will be allocated to outreach and enrollment of \nchildren and for streamlining enrollment mechanisms into the program.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, as we approach the end of the fiscal year, \nthere are many important issues that require our attention. Not the \nleast among them is the extension of $1.1 billion in unspent S-CHIP \nfunding that will revert to the Treasury if Congress does\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nnot take action. This is a vitally important program to the State of \nOregon, and to America's children. We must take action to protect this \nfunding.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997, has \nalways had bi-partisan support. Shortly after being elected to the \nUnited States Senate in 1996, I strongly supported the creation of this \nprogram. I knew that Congress had an opportunity to reach out to \nmillions of low-income children and provide health care coverage. \nWorking with my colleagues and friends, including Senators Orrin Hatch \nand Edward Kennedy, in the development of the bipartisan proposal was a \npleasure.\n  Since 1997, we have all continued to work together, members from both \nsides of the aisle, to extend funding and make improvements to the \nprogram. This year should be no different. I know it is an election \nyear, a presidential election year in fact, and that often creates a \ndynamic where politics can overwhelm policy. However, I am hopeful that \nwe can once again triumph over partisanship and pass legislation that \nwill intervene and prevent the expiration of $1.1 billion in unspent S-\nCHIP funding. I am confident that if both sides are reasonable and \nwilling to work together we can accomplish this goal by the time \nCongress recesses on October 8.\n  As we prepare to take action on a bill, we need to consider that no \none member or group of members have all of the answers; that nobody has \na monopoly on protecting America's children. We all work every day to \nprotect our Nation's children and ensure that those who come from low-\nincome families receive the nutritional, housing, education and health \ncare assistance that they need. This time should be no different.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Hatch and Kennedy, the \ncreators of this remarkable program; President Bush, a strong advocate \nfor our nation's children; Leader Frist, Chairman Grassley and others \nto extend funding for this important program.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is a disappointing day in the history \nof Congress. Exactly one year ago, Congress missed the deadline for \npassing a full transportation reauthorization bill that would fund the \nFederal portion of highway, transit, and safety projects around the \ncountry for the next six-years. The fact that we missed this self-\nimposed, legislative deadline will come as no surprise to those who \nfollow progress on Capitol Hill, but it is deeply troubling.\n  Because of the unwillingness of several of my colleagues, Congress is \nonce again forced to use a temporary extension of last year's funding \nas an inadequate short-term fix to a very real problem. This is an \nunacceptable outcome and I hope my colleagues will agree we need to \npass a fully-funded 6-year bill immediately.\n  Just as national defense and judicial review are core functions \nperformed by the United States Government to ensure security and \nfairness for all citizens, transportation infrastructure funding is one \nof the primary responsibilities of the Federal Government. Adequate \ntransportation infrastructure that is safe and affordable helps \nfacilitate intrastate and interstate trade and provides the physical \nbackbone of our economy. This is certainly a burden that the Federal \nGovernment needs to bear on behalf of its citizens. While it was \nextremely disappointing that Congress allowed the September 30, 2003 \ndeadline to pass without a resolution to this problem, it is simply \ninexcusable for us to have not successfully addressed this critical \nneed for over a year. I ask my colleagues to commit to coming together \nbefore this year's end to pass a six-year reauthorization bill.\n  I am not naive, I understand that there are always reasons behind the \ninability for Congress to pass important legislation. And this case is \nno exception. Over the last year, I have heard the excuses from the \nlegislative and executive branches of government, both Republicans and \nDemocrats. Some argue the transportation funding proposals being \ndebated cost too much; others say they don't provide enough funding to \nStates; still others say the formulas being used to distribute the \nmoney are inherently flawed and do not return as much of the Highway \nTrust Fund proceeds as their State contributes. All of these excuses \nhave merit and need to be worked out to the satisfaction of lawmakers \nprior to enactment, but it is rational for a person to believe, as I \ndo, that given the high priority transportation funding plays in each \nand every State, Congress should have reached a compromise by now two \nyears after work on this reauthorization initially began.\n  As I travel throughout Utah, meeting with the good citizens of my \nhome State, the most frequently-requested issue I am asked to address \nis the issue of transportation. Every week, Utahns remind me of the \nconstant need we have to maintain our roadways, increase our transit \ncapacity, and provide alternative routes along main arteries in the \ncities. I certainly understand why this issue is so important to my \nconstituents. Over the last ten years, Utah has seen a dramatic \nincrease in the number of residents who call ``The Beehive State'' \nhome. In fact, there are only three states in the United States who \nhave had larger proportional increases in their populations over the \npast ten years and all of them border the State of Utah. There is \ntremendous population growth all over the West, underscoring the \ncritical need we have for a steady increase in transportation funding \nright now.\n  The State of Utah receives over $200 million per year in highway \nfunding which goes toward the planning and execution of highway \nexpansion projects. Under the Senate-proposed version of this bill, \nthat number would go to nearly $300 million per year. That increase \ngoes a long way, not all the way, but a long way toward making several \nimportant transportation projects a reality. Projects that otherwise \nmight not come to fruition without a federal commitment.\n  In stating the amount of funding Utah receives, I do not want to give \nthe impression that this Federal funding comes to States without them \nhaving to do their part. All of the Federal funds in this bill have a \nState matching component as well. States spend millions, even billions, \nof State dollars on transportation every year. Demand for more and \nbetter transportation alternatives in the State of Utah have become so \nsevere that State lawmakers are now seriously considering raising the \nState fuel tax in order to pay for their portion of these projects. \nAlthough I hate to see any tax increases, I applaud the efforts of \nlocal lawmakers to deal with our transportation\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nproblems with real solutions and adequate funding.\n  The Utah Department of Transportation--UDOT--has several aggressive \nhighway projects around the State which have been planned for years, \nbudgeted in the State's annual budgeting process, and now only require \na federal commitment to help them proceed. I refer to projects like the \nongoing reconstruction of I-15 which connects some of the most populous \nportions of the State from North to South. New I-15 interchanges in \nOgden, Layton, and Provo are desperately needed to catch up with the \nlarge growth these cities are experiencing. Also, highway projects in \nEmery County on US-6, a railroad replacement bridge on US-89 in \nPleasant Grove, widening of State road 92 in Lehi, and the building of \nthe Northern Corridor in St. George are all projects which suffer \nterrible setbacks each time Congress cannot come together and pass a \ntransportation reauthorization bill. And there are many, many more \nprojects throughout the State I don't have time to name here, but that \nare equally as important.\n  On the transit side, with the recent addition of light rail and rapid \nbus service to several sections of downtown Salt Lake City, the \ncitizens of Utah have grown to rely heavily on transit as a primary \nmeans of transportation. The Utah Transit Authority--UTA--has \naggressive plans for projects in the pipeline that will greatly benefit \nthe entire population of Utah. The recent announcement of the Utah \nRegional Commuter Rail project, which would bring rapid commuter rail \nservice from as far away as Ogden all the way down to Provo, is \nencouraging and has many residents excited for the future of transit \nservice around the state. As well, the expansions of the light rail \nlines from downtown Salt Lake to the airport and South Jordan are \nhighly supported by commuters.\n  UTA receives $70 million to $80 million per year from Federal transit \nfunding projects which not only provide financing for large portions of \nthe light rail and commuter rail projects, but also provide statewide \nbus service and improvements to a majority of the State's population. \nIntermodal hubs, intelligent transportation systems, and other advances \nhave forever improved the ease and convenience of commuting in the \nState of Utah and these programs depend heavily on the transportation \nreauthorization bill stalled in Congress. Extensions of current law, \nwhich have been going on for over a year now, get us nowhere closer to \nfunding these important projects. The size and scope of these projects \nare so large that they require a long term commitment from the Federal \nTransit Administration--FTA--in order to get started. However, in the \nabsence of congressional approval of a full six-year bill, the FTA is \nunable to make the long-term commitments required for local transit \nauthorities to go out and secure their funding. This leaves transit \nprojects in an eternal holding pattern, waiting for someone to commit \nto their future. This is unacceptable and a terrible way to address the \never growing commuting needs of citizens.\n  One aspect of this bill that is extremely important to citizens \naround the State of Utah is the fact that much of the funding for \ntransportation safety and bike path projects comes from Federal \nsources. The State of Utah combines several million dollars a year with \nthe Federal money provided by this bill to build safer crosswalks, \nwalking bridges, bike paths, and railroad crossings throughout the \nState. These projects save lives and make enjoying the outdoors a safer \nactivity. Without a Federal commitment to safety and outdoor \nrecreation, these projects would certainly be lost in the difficult \nbudgetary times States are facing.\n  This past February, when the Senate Finance Committee was considering \nthe ``pay for'' sections of this bill, we faced a daunting task. How do \nyou provide a substantial increase in transportation funding in the \nface of shrinking fuel tax revenues, without raising taxes or \nincreasing the deficit? This is a difficult question and one the \nmembers of the Finance Committee had to deal with in very short order. \nHowever, to Senator Grassley's credit, we found a way to provide the \nsubstantial increase. It was not easy. There were a lot of tough \ndecisions we had to make. Many ingenious methods were used to increase \nrevenues coming into the Highway Trust Fund, like cracking down on \nfraud and covering the cost of fuel tax credits currently in the tax \ncode. But when all was said and done, we did it. We provided a 20 \npercent increase to transportation funding and we didn't raise fuel \ntaxes or create a large deficit that future generations will have to \npay off. Was it a sustainable fix that we will be able to deploy every \nsix-years to keep the highway trust fund afloat? No, only a fuel tax \nincrease or a large upswing in the demand for fuel will do that. But, \nwas it a good six-year fix for a difficult problem that was already \nmonths overdue? Yes, I believe it was a good short-term fix. In short, \nthe bill was paid for.\n  As I stated before, the work to reauthorize Federal transportation \nfunding began some two-years ago when aides met to discuss the general \nstructure of a bill. I cannot believe that the State of Utah is the \nonly State which depends heavily on Federal transportation funding to \nkeep up with the demands of maintaining an adequate infrastructure.\n  Therefore, it simply puzzles me as to why we have not been able to \nnegotiate an acceptable bill in a two-year period. As a conferee \nappointed to negotiate a final bill, I can tell you first hand, that \nsome Congressional leaders have tried very hard to come to agreement on \nthe specifics of a bill. The efforts of Chairman Inhofe have been \nextraordinary. He has worked tirelessly to find compromise with leaders \nwho appear unyielding in their particular criticisms of the bill. He \nhas shown his willingness to compromise on his own bill and work with \nothers. I know he does not want to pass a bill with lower funding \namounts than the Senate bill, but despite that belief, I applaud him \nfor his willingness to compromise and work toward a productive \nsolution.\n  As Chairman Inhofe, I have indicated my willingness to compromise on \nmany points in order to get a bill moving. I have made calls to \ncolleagues, I have asked those who have indicated their unwillingness \nto move to please join the effort and move a bill forward. I have done \nmy part for the citizens of Utah and will continue to do all I can.\n  More contentious bills than this get negotiated and passed by both \nhouses every year. I know money is tight right now. I know we would all \nlike to see the funding formulas be more favorable for our home States. \nI know each of us would like to have more funding for our home States \nthan we currently do. But I call on each of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to please put down your arguments and get back to the \nnegotiating table and finish the transportation reauthorization bill \nbefore year's end. Time is short and I realize we must pass a temporary \nextension bill in order to keep some Federal highway funds flowing. \nHowever, I encourage my colleagues to take advantage of the remaining \ndays left in the 108th Congress and come together to pass one of the \nmost important bills before Congress this year. Successful passage of \nthe transportation reauthorization bill will have positive, long-\nlasting effects on each and every State and I implore my colleagues not \nto let this opportunity pass.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed that we have failed to produce a six-year \ntransportation reauthorization bill which fully funds the highway, \ntransit, and safety programs for our States. As I mentioned earlier, \nthe temporary extensions we have been using do not adequately address \nthe transportation needs or our citizens. Temporary extensions \nfrustrate the planning of these large projects, significantly delay the \ndelivery, and make it impossible for States to raise the money \nnecessary to fund their portions of the projects. Capital markets turn \na deaf ear to project specific financing when there is no long-term \nFederal commitment. Only we can rectify this problem and I know we will \nfind the solution. Let's do it sooner rather than later. Let's not wait \nfor this problem to get even more out of hand. Let's do the right thing \nand come together with an adequately funded compromise. I pledge my \nefforts in this cause and hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, which authorized the Federal highway, transit, and safety \nprograms,\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nexpired 1 year ago today. Although both the Senate and the House have \npassed comprehensive, multiyear legislation to reauthorize those \nprograms, a conference agreement still has not been worked out. As a \nresult, today the Senate is passing an 8-month extension, the sixth \nshort-term extension since TEA-21 expired. The inherent uncertainty of \nshort-term extensions has made it difficult for State and local \ngovernments and transit agencies to make decisions regarding \nconstruction, maintenance, and operations.\n  I want to speak for a moment about the transit program, which falls \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee. In the Banking \nCommittee's reauthorization hearings, we heard extensive testimony on \nthe critical role of transit in reducing congestion, strengthening our \nnational economy, and improving our quality of life. Transit ridership \nis at record levels, a testament to Americans' growing need for safe, \nreliable transportation choices. The same can be said for the other \nmodes as well: demand is increasing along our entire transportation \nnetwork.\n  Increased investment is essential if we are to keep up with this \ndemand. The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated that an \naverage of $127 billion per year is needed over the next two decades to \nmaintain and improve the condition of our highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems. Other estimates show an even greater need. I believe \nthat failure to make the needed investment will result in the continued \ndeterioration of our existing infrastructure, threatening our future \nmobility and economic strength. Such investment would also have a \npositive impact in the near term: according to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, each $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure \ncreates 47,500 jobs.\n  In an effort to begin addressing these needs, the Banking Committee \npassed a reauthorization of the Federal transit program in February of \nthis year. That bill authorized $56.5 billion over 6 years for transit, \na substantial increase over TEA-21. As a result of Banking Committee \nChairman Shelby's leadership in developing that piece of legislation, \nthe Federal Public Transportation Act of 2004 was reported out of the \nBanking Committee unanimously. The Banking Committee bill was \nincorporated into S. 1072, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act, a 6-year multimodal \nreauthorization bill, which passed through the Senate with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  Notwithstanding the passage in both the Senate and the House of \nreauthorization bills calling for substantially increased investment, \nthe administration has not been willing to support the kind of \ninvestment needed to meet our pressing transit and highway needs. \nWithout a serious commitment from the administration to make such \ninvestments, it has been impossible to move forward in the conference \nprocess.\n  Until that process is completed, it is essential that our States and \nlocal communities be able to continue to operate and maintain our \nNation's roads, bridges, and transit systems. The legislation \nconsidered by the Senate today would allow Federal assistance to \ncontinue through May 31, 2005, and provides that once a multiyear \nreauthorization bill is completed, the budgetary firewalls protecting \nhighway and transit spending will be extended around the total amounts \nauthorized for fiscal year 2005 in that multiyear bill. I hope that in \nthe next 8 months the Administration will work cooperatively with the \nCongress to produce a comprehensive reauthorization bill that will \nprovide the needed resources to address the Nation's urgent \ntransportation needs.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4278) to amend the Assistive Technology Act of \n     1998 to support programs of grants to States to address the \n     assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Harkins, and other Members, in seeking final passage of \nthe Assistive Technology Act of 2004.\n  Senator Harkin and I were determined to make the reauthorization of \nthis piece of legislation a bipartisan process from the beginning. We \nhave worked closely with the House of Representatives, Departments of \nEducation, Labor, and Commerce, and the Small Business Administration \nas well as the, business, and research and development communities, the \nAssistive Technology Act Projects, the Alternative Financing Programs, \nand the disability community. Together we have successfully crafted a \nbipartisan and bicameral bill that we are all proud of. This bill \nfollows the administration's lead, and the goals that President Bush \nset forth in the New Freedom Initiative. We are confident that the bill \nwill be overwhelmingly supported by the President and increase access \nto assistive technologies for thousands of individuals with \ndisabilities. I am also submitting several letters of support for the \nbill, from various groups, for the Record.\n  On February 1, 2001, President Bush announced the New Freedom \nInitiative--a comprehensive program to promote the full participation \nof people with disabilities in all areas of society by expanding \neducation and employment opportunities, promoting increased access into \ndaily community life, and increasing access to assistive and \nuniversally designed technologies. By the Senate finally naming \nconferees for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act earlier \nthis month, and by seeking passage of the Assistive Technology Act of \n2004 today, we are helping the President fulfill America's promise of \n``tearing down the barriers to equality that face many of the 54 \nmillion Americans with disabilities.''\n  One quarter of the President's New Freedom Initiative focuses on \ntechnology, and the technology objective is comprised of two key \ncomponents.\n  The first is to expand Federal investment in assistive technology \nresearch and development by increasing the budgets of the \nRehabilitative Engineering Research Centers' for assistive \ntechnologies, creating a new fund to help bring assistive technologies \nto market, and better coordinate the Federal effort in prioritizing \nimmediate assistive and universally designed technology needs in the \ndisability community.\n  The second is to enhance access to assistive technology by reducing \ncosts associated with purchasing assistive technology and funding for \nlow-interest loan programs to purchase assistive technologies.\n  The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 before us today is designed to \nstrengthen and build upon these two components. Our efforts focus on \nenhancing access to technology, reducing the costs associated with \npurchasing such devices, and increasing technical assistance to \nentities that serve students with disabilities that receive transition \nservices, adults with disabilities maintaining or transitioning to \ncommunity living and to employers. Specifically, we accomplish these \ngoals by: reducing bureaucracy; fostering private/public sector \nrelationships; and coordinating Federal initiatives.\n\n  Current law focuses on system change activities, and providing \ninformation and referral services to people with disabilities and their \nfamilies. Systems change efforts and information and referral services \nare important, as people are being born with or acquiring disabilities \ndaily. However, according to several Federal agencies, an individual \nwith a disability may be considered eligible for, and could benefit \nfrom, more than 20 Federal programs that directly or indirectly provide \nassistive technology. Additionally, there are over 25 Federal laws on \nthe financing of assistive technology, all of which impacts local \naccess to such technology.\n  Considering the number of Federal and State laws that a person has to \nnavigate in order to access services, how long will it take for systems \nchange efforts to remove barriers for accessing assistive technologies \nfor a person with a disability living in Lincoln, NH? Systems change \nefforts, while worthwhile, do not immediately impact and help a person \nwith a disability obtain assistive technology that he or she may need \ntoday. Therefore, this bill modifies the current list of authorized \nactivities by expanding the authority of the State Assistive Technology \nAct projects to increase the ability of persons with disabilities to \nexperience or obtain assistive technology. Our bill provides the State \nprojects with a tangible set of activities, yet at the same time \nprovides State flexibility to address emerging State needs.\n  Under this bill, States will provide citizens with access to device \nloan, reutilization, and financing programs, and equipment \ndemonstration centers by developing such programs, or collaborating \nwith other entities in the State currently operating such programs. In \npublic forums that were held with the disability community, we \nconsistently heard about the abandonment of equipment by persons with \ndisabilities simply because the purchaser did not have an opportunity \nto try it out or see it demonstrated prior to purchasing the devise. \nThe purpose of device loan and reutilization programs, and equipment \ndemonstration centers is to provide individuals with disabilities the \nopportunity to receive proper assessments and evaluations for assistive \ntechnology, test and obtain information about various devices, and \nborrow devices and equipment before it is purchased. The financing \nprograms provide access to low interest loans allowing an individual to \npurchase the device for him or herself or a family member, without \nhaving to wait for, rely on, or navigate through the red tape created \nby our bureaucratic Government systems. Each of these new requirements \nwill help make the most of limited public resources in an environment \nthat emphasizes consumer choice in and control of assistive technology \nservices and funding.\n  Another major theme of this reauthorization is the reduction of costs \nassociated with assistive technologies and to enhance research and \ndevelopment opportunities in this area. In December of 2003, we began \nmeeting with individuals within the disability community, the State \nAssistive Technology Act projects, large and small\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\ntechnology companies, trade associations, and research, development and \nmarketing entities to learn about costs associated with developing \nassistive technology, and what could be done within this \nreauthorization to assist with this issue. We learned that many \ncompanies, most of which are small businesses, that produce assistive \ntechnologies develop products that benefit people that have a specific \ndisability, or a low incidence disability, such as a visual impairment, \na hearing loss, or a significant cognitive impairment. Because of the \nlimited number of people that can benefit from these valuable and life-\naltering devices, the cost of the product remains high. Furthermore, \nthe costs associated with creating a device are high. On the other \nside, prices for such devices are so expensive that people that need \nthem cannot afford to buy them, and often go without, therefore \ncreating a vicious cycle.\n\n  We also learned that numerous companies have product ideas that are \n``on the drawing board,'' but the company does not have the funds \nnecessary to develop products and send them to market in a timely \nfashion. Additionally, we learned that industry has not created their \nown standards to which assistive technology should be designed. As an \nexample, companies create products that have their own operating \nsystems and/or ports. This is a benefit for the proprietor, as no one \nelse knows exactly what is in the operating system code, no one else \ncan modify it, and people have to purchase the proprietors cord or \nother item to go with the device. The downside is that an individual \nwith multiple pieces of technology cannot be assured that the various \nproducts he or she has can or will work together. Using a Braille \nNotetaker, for example, the notetaker does not use standard software, \nand therefore cannot be connected to a computer using an ordinary, \nover-the-counter cable. Instead, the user must buy the cord separately \nor purchase additional software, often leaving people unable to work \nusing versions of software that their colleagues use; all of which \nincreases the number of dollars the consumer must spend in order to \nfunction in today's society.\n  To address these concerns, the bill strengthens relationships between \nfederally funded programs, the disability community, private-sector \nemployers, and assistive technology vendors and researchers. It \nencourages market-based solutions and approaches to developing \nstandards and increasing the number of products and the speed in which \nproducts go to market. This will, in-turn, make assistive technologies \nmore affordable. The bill authorizes the Office of Special Education \nand Rehabilitation Services at the Department of Education to make \ngrants available to for-profit and nonprofit entities resulting in two \nspecific results. The first grant promotes the development of new or \nimproved commercially available assistive technologies that are quick \nto reach the consumer market and easier for individuals with \ndisabilities to learn to use, customize, fix or update. The second is \nto encourage the development of innovative and efficient technical \npractices and strategies for assistive technology products so that they \nwill more reliably interact with the latest and future mainstream \ninformation technology, telecommunications products, and other \nassistive technology such as computer software and hardware.\n  The final major theme of this reauthorization is providing technical \nassistance to entities that serve students with disabilities that \nreceive transition services, adults with disabilities maintaining or \ntransitioning to community living, and to employers. We do not want, \nnor expect States to duplicate programs by creating additional \nfinancial loan, equipment loan, reutilization programs and \ndemonstration centers for these populations. That would be a foolish \nuse of federal dollars and would be in violation of a duplication \nclause in the bill. Our intent is for the State assistive technology \nprojects to inform these specific groups about the beneficial aspects \nof assistive technology.\n\n  The bill accomplishes this task by strengthening relationships \nbetween federally funded programs, such as the Assistive Technology Act \nprojects, and private-sector employers by directing the Office of \nSpecial Education and Rehabilitation Services at the Department of \nEducation to make a grant available to for-profit and nonprofit \nentities to enhance public/private partnerships. This grant opportunity \nsupports the development of public service announcements, which can be \nmodified for regional use, to reach out to small businesses, the aging \npopulation, and people with disabilities about the benefits of \nassistive technology.\n  On July 23 of this year, the U.S. Access Board issued its first \ncomprehensive revision of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nAccessibility Guidelines, ADAAG, since publishing the original ADAAG in \n1991. Among other things, the new ADAAG contains changes to the \nrequirements for employee work areas that will affect many employers \nonce these requirements are issued as regulations by the Department of \nJustice. Many employers are not aware of the extent to which the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act may require them to make their \nworkplaces accessible. The newly issued ADA Accessibility Guidelines \nhave toughened these requirements, making it more important than ever \nfor employers to know what their obligations are, and to plan \naccordingly. This bill aggressively engages businesses, especially \nsmall businesses, by providing them with greater access to technical \nassistance and technology so that they can accommodate employees with \ndisabilities and adhere to ADAAG. Additionally, we place an emphasis on \nthe State projects to provide technical assistance that meets the needs \nof aging workers that are acquiring disabilities and who may need \nassistive technology to maintain their current level of productivity.\n  In developing this bill, we have learned from the progressive \nthinking of the President and the resourcefulness of our Federal \nagencies and have taken measures to complement their actions. During \nthe Bush administration, funding for special education has increased by \nmore than $3.7 billion for the Part B State Grants program. In fiscal \nyear 2004, nearly $10.1 billion is available for this program, which \nrepresents an increase of 59 percent since 2001. Additionally, the \nSenate version of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \npromotes the involvement of the State vocational rehabilitation system \nwith students with disabilities while still in secondary school. Title \nIV of the Workforce Investment Act, the ``Rehabilitation Act,'' which \npassed the Senate in November of last year contains similar conforming \nlanguage.\n  In 1999, the Supreme Court handed down the Olmstead decision, which \naffirmed the right of individuals with disabilities to live in the \ncommunity, rather than in institutions. However, it was not until \nPresident Bush was sworn into office that that decision was implemented \non the Federal level. President Bush realized that making the promise \nof full integration a reality for people with disabilities does not \nonly mean changing existing practices that favor institutionalization \nover community-based treatment. It also means providing the affordable \nhousing, transportation, and access to assistive technology and State \nand local government programs and activities that make community life \npossible. On July 18, 2001, President Bush issued Executive Order \n13217, requiring coordination among numerous Federal agencies that \nadminister programs affecting access to the community for people with \ndisabilities of all ages.\n\n  The Executive Order has prompted various branches of the Federal \nGovernment to make disability issues a priority. In the fiscal year \n2001 Department of Labor appropriation, Congress approved an Office of \nDisability Employment Policy, ODEP, to be headed by an Assistant \nSecretary. ODEP's mission is to provide leadership to increase \nemployment opportunities for adults and youth with disabilities. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services created the Office of Disability \nin October 2002. The Director of the Office reports to the Secretary \nand serves as an advisor on HHS activities relating to disabilities. \nThe Office on Disability oversees the implementation and coordination \nof disability programs, policies and special initiatives for 54 million \npersons with disabilities. In July of 2003, the Department of Commerce \nunveiled an initiative to support the development of assistive \ntechnologies and to promote the U.S. assistive technology industry.\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\n  Moreover, in December of 2003, leaders from the Department of Labor, \nDOL, and the Small Business Administration, SBA, signed a Strategic \nAlliance Memo. This document formalized an agreement between the two \nentities to implement a coordinated, interagency initiative to improve \nopportunities for people with disabilities to be employed by small \nbusinesses, for people acquiring disabilities due to the aging process \nand wanting to maintain employment, or for people with disabilities to \nbecome small business owners. Finally, a little over 6 weeks ago, the \nRehabilitation Services Administration at the Department of Education \nhosted a National Employment Conference. The conference focused on \nState vocational rehabilitation staff creating and maintaining employer \ndevelopment, business relations, large-scale job placement, and \ndeveloping of vocational rehabilitation's national network that \nprovides qualified job candidates and employment services to business.\n  Individuals with disabilities were not a priority in a Presidential \nadministration's domestic policy goals and objects since 1993. This \nchanged when President Bush became President of the United States in \n2001, and he signed the Olmstead Executive Order and announced the New \nFreedom Initiative. The current administration recognizes and believes \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of \nsociety. This belief has been put into action in numerous ways that I \nhave previously explained. Through this bill, Congress is continuing \nand enhancing the administration's efforts by increasing access to \nassistive and universally designed technologies, expanding educational \nand employment opportunities, promoting increased access into daily \ncommunity life, and helping members of this misunderstood and \nunderutilized group of citizens achieve and succeed.\n  Although this reauthorization focuses on three major objectives, the \nbill takes an important step forward by establishing a grant to the \nAmerican Indian Consortium for a Protection and Advocacy for Assistive \nTechnology program, PAAT. The Native American Protection & Advocacy \nProject was established in 1994 to carry out protection and advocacy \nsystem programs. The Consortium encompasses 25,351 square miles in \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah and it provides legal representation to \nNative Americans with disabilities and serves the Navajo Nation, the \nHopi Nation and five smaller tribes. We were pleased to make some \nmodifications to the PAAT program as it is a major force in ensuring \nthat children and adults with disabilities can get access to critically \nneeded assistive technology in a variety of settings--school, home, and \nat work.\n\n  Additionally, we stabilized funding for the State programs by \nsupporting State efforts to improve the provision of assistive \ntechnology for individuals with disabilities. To ensure that the \nFederal commitment to independent living and the full participation of \nindividuals with disabilities in society guaranteed through the \nPresident's New Freedom Initiative is upheld, the bill removes the \nsunset provision in the 1998 Act, therefore creating a typical \nreauthorization cycle. The bill also sets a minimum State allotment of \n$410,000 per year in order to offset the costs for the additional \nrequirements placed on States to maintain the comprehensive Statewide \nprograms of technology-related assistance for individuals with \ndisabilities of all ages. However, Congress expects States to take \nownership of and expand upon the comprehensive Statewide programs of \ntechnology-related assistance.\n  I thank Senator Harkin, and his staff, particularly Mary Giliberti, \nfor their hard work and dedication in putting together a bipartisan \nbill that will assist thousands of individuals with disabilities access \nservices and devices that they so desperately need. Next, I would also \nlike to thank my staff, Denzel McGuire and Aaron Bishop, for their hard \nwork in helping put together a bipartisan and bicameral bill. I also \nthank Senators Roberts, DeWine, Warner, Ensign, Enzi, Kennedy, Reed, \nMcCain, and Specter, and their staff members, Jennifer Swenson, Mary \nBeth Luna, John Robinson, Lindsay Lovlien, Scott Fleming, Michelle \nDirst, Connie Garner, Kent Mitchell, Elyse Wasch, Seth Gerson, Ken \nLasala, Mark Laisch, and Jennifer Castagna for their tireless effort \nthrough this bipartisan process. Next, I would like to thank \nCongressmen Boehner, and Kildee, and their respective staff, David \nCleary and Alex Nock for their willingness ability to negotiate a \nbipartisan and bicameral bill that will affect the lives of thousands \nof individuals with disabilities.\n  Additionally, I thank the various entities that provided Senate staff \nwith invaluable technical assistance. This includes: Liz King, \nassistant council for the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel for \nworking with our staff and drafting this legislation, and the research \nof Sidath Panangala, policy analyst for Congressional Record Service. I \nalso thank members of various Federal Departments that were \ninstrumental in providing us technical assistance while putting this \nbill together. From the Department of Education: Dr. Troy Justesen, the \nAssistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and \nRehabilitative Services, OSERS, at the Department of Education, and \nCarol Cichoswski, and Wava Gregory staff of the Budget Office, and Eric \nShulz in Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs. From the \nDepartment of Commerce: Phillip J. Bond, Under Secretary of Commerce \nfor Technology, Ben Wu, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for \nTechnology, and Angela Ewell-Madison, Director of the Office of \nCongressional Affairs. From the Department of Labor: W. Roy Grizzard, \nJr., Ed.D., Assistant Secretary of the Office for Disability Employment \nPolicy at the Department of Labor, his chief of staff, J. Kim Cook, \nBrian Parsons, supervisory policy advisor, and Blake Hanlon, Office of \nCongressional and Intergovernmental Affairs. Finally, I thank the fine \nteam at the Small Business Administration: Porter Montgomery, associate \nadministrator for policy and planning, Geoff Green, senior analyst, and \nMichael Berkholtz, assistant administrator for congressional affairs.\n  Finally, I thank the State Assistive Technology Act projects, and \nespecially the New Hampshire Technology Partnership Project, for \nproviding us with information as we developed this bill. Additionally, \nI thank the research and development industry, businesses and \nemployers, service providers, and the various and multiple members of \nthe disability community that worked tirelessly, helping us develop an \nexcellent piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the final passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters of support for the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg: On behalf of Microsoft Corporation, I \n     am writing in strong support of legislation at the desk, H.R. \n     4278, which would reauthorize the Assistive Technology (AT) \n     Act of 1998. The bill would provide critical federal funding \n     for state grant programs that increase access to assistive \n     and accessible technology and related services. The AT Act \n     expires today and without enactment of the reauthorization \n     bill, access to assistive technology for Americans with \n     disabilities could be severely compromised.\n       Attached is an op-ed piece that appeared in The Hill on \n     July 6, 2004 that discusses the importance of the \n     reauthorization legislation. We urge Congress to act today.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Laura Ruby,\n\n                                    Regulatory & Industry Affairs,\n                           Microsoft--Accessible Technology Group.\n       Attachment.\n\n            Give America's Disabled the Technology They Need\n\n                            (By Laura Ruby)\n\n       Will America keep its promise to provide equal access to \n     information, education and employment to millions of people \n     with disabilities? If so, then Congress must act quickly to \n     reauthorize the Assistive Technology (AT) Act, which provides \n     federal funding for state grant programs that increase access \n     to assistive and accessible technology and related services.\n       Ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities is not \n     just a matter of curb cuts, ramps and elevators to eliminate \n     architectural barriers to public buildings and places of \n     employment. Today, it is just as important to provide \n     technology that enables people with disabilities to use \n     personal computers and the Internet, such as devices that \n     read computer text aloud to people who are blind or enable \n     people who can't move their\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\n     arms to type and issue computer commands using only their \n     breath or eye movements.\n       Assistive and accessible technology (AT) can help people of \n     all abilities realize their full potential, but for people \n     with disabilities there is no middle ground. According to the \n     National Council on Disability, ``For Americans without \n     disabilities, technology makes things easier. For Americans \n     with disabilities, technology makes things possible.'' The \n     goal of the AT Act is to ensure that people have access to \n     the technology they need.\n       On June 23, the Senate, led by Sens. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) \n     and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), introduced its bill S. 2595 to \n     reauthorize the AT Act. Earlier this year, Reps. Howard \n     McKeon (R-Calif.), John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Dale Kildee (D-\n     Mich.) shepherded the House bill for AT Act reauthorization \n     (H.R. 4278) through floor passage. The Senate and House must \n     now work together to ensure reauthorization of the act before \n     the end of the current session.\n       Both bills would strengthen state AT programs. These \n     programs and services are critical, because they ensure \n     technology will be available where people need it--in \n     schools, on the job and in their communities. The AT Act also \n     funds research and development projects, information-system \n     improvements, loan and reutilization programs, and \n     demonstrations that teach people what kind of AT devices are \n     available and how to use them.\n       Critics may argue that after 15 years of federal investment \n     in this program, people who need assistive technology \n     products and services--along with service providers, school \n     personnel, and employers should already be aware of them. The \n     population that needs AT is not static, however, and it is \n     growing.\n       A 2003 research study commissioned by Microsoft and \n     conducted by Forrester Data found that 57 percent of working-\n     age computer users could benefit from accessible technology. \n     As the U.S. work force continues to age, the need for AT as a \n     mainstream business resource will increase even more. By \n     2010, more than half the U.S. population will be 45 or older, \n     age-related impairments will affect more people, and \n     employers will need resources to help workers maintain peak \n     performance.\n       As the need for AT increases, it will be vital to establish \n     a seamless network of resources and training that can meet \n     people's evolving needs at every stage of life and ensure \n     that all Americans have the help they need with education, \n     employment and independent living. The AT Act helps to do \n     just that by aligning its priorities and provisions with \n     those set forth in other federal legislation, including the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Workforce \n     Investment Act and the Americans with Disabilities \n     integration mandate in Olmstead.\n       The AT Act will expire on Sept. 30. Without enactment of a \n     reauthorization bill, access to assistive technology for \n     Americans with disabilities could be severely compromised.\n       Congress now has a chance to remedy this situation, so that \n     Americans with disabilities will know that the services they \n     need will continue to support them in their efforts to work, \n     learn and participate in their communities.\n       The Senate and House should quickly negotiate a compromise \n     bill and send it to the president for signature. As we \n     approach the 14th anniversary of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act--signed into law by the first President \n     Bush--Americans need to know our representatives in Congress \n     will not turn their backs on citizens with disabilities. By \n     putting this issue above politics, and re-authorizing the AT \n     Act this year, Congress can deliver on America's promise.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       Society for\n\n\n                                    Human Resource Management,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions Committee, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg: On behalf of the more than 190,000 \n     human resource professionals of the Society for Human \n     Resource Management (SHRM), I am writing to express our \n     support and enthusiastic endorsement of H.R. 4278, the \n     Improving Access to Assistive Technology (AT) for Individuals \n     with Disabilities Act of 2004. SHRM implores the U.S. Senate \n     to swiftly pass this legislation which will re-authorize this \n     vitally important program.\n       The human resource professional is the architect of fair \n     policies and practices ensuring a fair and equitable \n     employment process and workplace. Human resource \n     professionals also play a critical role in responding to \n     requests for workplace accommodations for employees with \n     disabilities. If enacted, H.R. 4278 will help human resource \n     professionals and their organizations seek sound solutions in \n     accommodating prospective and current employees with \n     assistive technology devices. Programs such as these support \n     the creation and promotion of workplace diversity and \n     represent a win-win situation for employers and employees \n     alike. SHRM values diversity as an investment in business \n     excellence. We believe that the workplace environment \n     promotes the inclusion of individual similarities and \n     differences that enhance efficiency and success.\n       Employment rates of persons with disabilities have always \n     been lower than those of individuals without disabilities. \n     H.R. 4278 authorizes federal funds to provide states, and \n     their respective AT programs, with federal block grants that \n     support activities that provide assistive technology devices \n     to employees with disabilities. SHRM believes that \n     reauthorization of the AT programs represents an important \n     continued commitment to ensure that people with disabilities \n     have access to technology that assists them in seeking and \n     gaining full employment, participation, and accommodation in \n     the workplace.\n       In addition, H.R. 4278 makes several program improvements \n     that build upon current state activities. For example, the \n     legislation would create a competitive grant for development \n     of a national public awareness toolkit. The goal of the \n     national toolkit is to provide a resource for each state \n     project to expand public awareness of the AT program to \n     targeted individuals and entities such as local media \n     representatives, employer groups, and employee organizations. \n     SHRM believes this provision of H.R. 4278 is of vital \n     importance because it will serve as a tool to reach across \n     broader communities to provide information and resources on \n     how to access the state programs and their various benefits.\n       H.R. 4278 also establishes grants for research, development \n     and evaluation, as well as alternative financing systems. The \n     first program provides federal and state governments the \n     opportunity to gain access to cutting edge research that \n     analyzes the effectiveness of assistive technology devices \n     and the state projects that administer related AT programs. \n     The development of alternative financing systems would give \n     states flexibility in offering competitive device loan \n     programs, such as: revolving loan funds; loan guarantees or \n     insurance programs; purchase, lease, or acquisition programs; \n     and low interest loan funds. This allows the state AT \n     projects to offer different avenues to gain access to AT \n     devices, which affords the disability community choices in \n     determining which AT device is most effective for their \n     needs. These programs are crucial tools for human resource \n     professionals in meeting the needs of employees with \n     disabilities in the workforce.\n       HR professionals will continue to play a critical role in \n     the development and execution of workplace policies and \n     procedures in our nation's workplaces. It is vitally \n     important that the federal government enact legislative \n     proposals such as H.R. 4278 that contribute to and promote \n     the successful employment of people with disabilities. Once \n     again, I would like to underscore our strong support for H.R. \n     4278 and urge quick action by this body on this important \n     measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kathron Compton,\n     Chief External Affairs Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 The Arc of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Senate HELP Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate HELP Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Kennedy: The Arc of the \n     United States, the nation's largest national organization \n     representing children and adults with cognitive and other \n     developmental disabilities, would like to thank you for your \n     remarkable bi-partisan work on HR 4278, the reauthorization \n     of the Assistive Technology Act. The bill before you today \n     makes important strides forward for the AT Act and, \n     ultimately, for the people with cognitive and other \n     disabilities who will be able to go to work, to school and \n     out into their communities. Their increased access to \n     assistive technologies will make it possible for them to \n     participate more fully in every aspect of daily life.\n       The Arc appreciates the hard work that has gone into every \n     phase of the process of developing and negotiating this vital \n     legislation. We are especially pleased that the bill clearly \n     delineates the authorization of appropriations so that state \n     grants will have defined and equitable minimum allotment \n     levels. We also appreciate the fact that the bill provides \n     flexibility to states to design locally responsive programs \n     while still assuring a focus on activities that will get \n     assistive technology into the hands of the people that need \n     it. We are pleased, as well, that the bill establishes a \n     grant to the American Indian Consortium for a Protection and \n     Advocacy for Assistive Technology (PAAT) program and has \n     enhanced provisions for Research and Development efforts.\n       We urge you to pass HR 4278 now, and we look forward to \n     working with you as you continue to work to ensure that the \n     future holds nothing but enhancements of the programs and \n     services authorized by this legislation.\n       Thank you for your support of people with disabilities and \n     their families who will now see increased benefits from the \n     vast technological advances the 21st century will bring. \n     Thank you again for your bipartisan work and your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Eidelman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Easter Seals,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: On behalf of Easter Seals, I am writing \n     to express our support\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n     for passage of the Assistive Technology Act of 2004. We are \n     pleased that we have reached this bipartisan solution to \n     supporting the assistive technology needs of individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       In order for this bill to reach its main objective, truly \n     increasing access to assistive technology for people with \n     disabilities, we will be working to make sure that adequate \n     funding is provided to support all aspects of the bill, the \n     state projects, existing strong alternative financing \n     programs, protection and advocacy services, projects of \n     national significance on research and development. We look \n     forward to working with you to achieve this goal.\n       Thank you for your efforts to support assistive technology.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jennifer Dexter,\n                           Senior Government Relations Specialist.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nsupport of final passage of this important bill. The Assistive \nTechnology Act of 2004 will continue and expand the Nation's effort to \nimprove access to assistive technology for all who need it.\n  Technology is one of the great equalizing forces in our society. A \ncomputer can provide a child with insight and access to a world of \ninformation they would otherwise never have, and make the ideal of the \nAmerican dream a reality for many more.\n  For people with disabilities of all ages, technology is especially \nimportant. It can mean the difference between being immobile in the \nhome and becoming a mobile and contributing member of their community. \nIt can mean the difference between being paralyzed by an inability to \ncommunicate and communicating at a level previously thought impossible. \nTechnology breaks down barriers to education, employment, health care, \ncommunity living, civic participation and countless other activities of \ndaily life that we so often take for granted. It allows people with \ndisabilities to reach their full potential.\n  Since 1988, the Assistive Technology Act has funded projects in every \nState and territory to raise awareness about the enormous potential of \nsuch technology, give individuals an opportunity to test products, and \noffer low-cost options for purchasing them. Each project has a \ndifferent focus, but all are providing these core services, and \nproviding them well.\n  In Massachusetts, the Assistive Technology Project trains individuals \nwith disabilities to be self-advocates. They monitor implementation of \nState and Federal laws, and operate an Equipment Exchange Trading Post \nfor individuals to exchange or sell assistive technology products. They \ndeserve great credit, and so do the other projects across the Nation.\n  The Assistive Technology Act of 2004 makes a commitment to continue \nthese projects, in recognition of all the effective work they have done \nso far. It also asks them to refocus their efforts on the core \nobjective of getting technology into the hands of people with \ndisabilities. It asks them to perform device demonstrations, equipment \nloans, and device refurbishment, and to provide financing systems such \nas low-cost loan programs.\n  In addition to these important activities, it asks State projects to \ncontinue their work of educating people with disabilities, agencies \nthat serve them, and employers, about the doors of opportunity that \ntechnology can open. It asks them to train personnel who work with \npeople with disabilities to assess whether technology is needed and \nthen how to obtain it. It asks them to integrate technology into \neducation, employment and other service plans, and it improves \ncoordination between agencies that serve people with disabilities.\n  In particular, it asks State projects to focus on a population that \nneeds technology, but often does not get it--students under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act in transition from school \nto work or continuing education. For these students, assistive \ntechnology is vitally important. It can mean the difference between \nliving independent and productive lives when they leave school, and \nbeing left out of their community and unable to contribute. The \nlegislation asks State projects to better facilitate access to \ntechnology for this population. It's a big task, but one I know the \nprojects are able to handle, and it will make a world of difference for \nthousands of students who make the transition every year from the \nschoolhouse to home, college, or the workplace.\n  In addition to focusing the projects on new activities, we take steps \nto provide resources to make it happen. The act sets a minimum \nallotment of $410,000 for each State project. This higher minimum will \ngive many smaller States the resources they need to expand and create \nquality programs. For larger States, any resources above this level \nwill be largely dedicated to helping them meet the increased need they \nface. We in Congress must do everything we can to see that this \nlegislation receives the funding we know is necessary to implement \nquality and effective programs State-wide.\n  This legislation also shifts the authority for administering, \nmonitoring and reporting on the program to the Republican Services \nAdministration. The projects focus on people with disabilities of all \nages and on their school, work and basic health and living needs. The \nRSA is well-equipped to provide the kind of leadership that will allow \nus to effectively assess their accomplishments, and is required to \npartner with the Office of Special Education Programs, the National \nInstitute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation and other Federal \nagencies. I am confident the projects will receive the attention and \nfocus they deserve.\n  In this legislation, we also continue and expand the work of the \nprotection and advocacy systems that have done so much over the years \nto make good on the promise of assistive technology.\n  I commend Senators Judd Gregg and Tom Harkin and Representatives John \nBoehner, George Miller and Buck McKeon for their excellent bipartisan \nwork on this legislation. I also commend Senator Jack Reed, Senator \nJohn Warner, Senator Pat Roberts and all of my colleagues on the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for their excellent \nwork. Senator Reed deserves special credit for his focus on improving \ntraining of local personnel and expanding research and development on \nnew technologies.\n  Several staff members deserve particular thanks--Aaron Bishop with \nSenator Gregg, Mary Giliberti with Senator Harkin, Elyse Wasch and \nErica Swanson with Senator Reed, David Cleary with Representative \nBoehner and Alex Nock with Representative Miller. Without their hard \nwork and the hard work of the disability advocates and project \ndirectors and staffs in the states, this legislation would not have \nbeen possible.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass legislation \nthat is critically important to individuals with disabilities and \nelderly Americans: the Assistive Technology Act of 2004.\n  I am delighted that we are completing this bill, which will also \nshortly be passed in the House. I want to thank Senators Gregg, \nKennedy, Roberts, Reed, and DeWine, and Representatives Boehner and \nMiller, among others, for their excellent bipartisan work to get this \naccomplished.\n  Assistive technology is absolutely critical to the lives of people \nwith disabilities. According to an NOD/Harris poll earlier this year, \n35 percent of individuals with disabilities say that they would not be \nable to live independently or take care of themselves at home without \nassistive technology.\n  Assistive technology also opens up opportunities in education, \nemployment and civic participation that would not otherwise be \navailable to many individuals with disabilities.\n  As the National Council on Disability puts it: ``For Americans \nwithout disabilities, technology makes things easier. For Americans \nwith disabilities, technology makes things possible.''\n  The bill that we are reauthorizing today builds on the successes of \nthe Assistive Technology Act dating back to 1988. The State Assistive \nTechnology programs have been highly effective in providing \ninformation, training, and technical assistance to a wide array of \nindividuals, including people with disabilities, their families, \neducators, health care professionals and others.\n  Let me give you an example from my own State of Iowa. Ben Moore, \nowner of Moore Construction in Iowa City, learned about universal \ndesign--the practice of building homes so that people with and without \ndisabilities can get around in them--because of the work of the Iowa \nProgram for Assistive Technology. He went on to build a universally \ndesigned home for two Iowans with disabilities. Now he is encouraging \nother contractors to use universal design to build beautiful homes\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nthat Iowans can remain in as they grow old. Given Iowa's aging \npopulation, this is very important work.\n  Joy Crimmins from Dubuque, IA, has benefited from the advocacy \nservices funded through the act. She has a newly accessible bedroom and \nbathroom in her home because the assistive technology program provided \nlegal advocacy to her family to get their home modified.\n  This wonderful work is not happening just in Iowa. The most recent \ndata available, for Fiscal Year 2002, indicates that these programs are \nmaking a substantial difference nationally. In 2002, 92,000 equipment \ndemonstrations were provided; 38,000 AT devices were loaned to \nindividuals with disabilities; and more than 6,000 devices were \nexchanged or recycled. Also, more than 6 million dollars was loaned to \nindividuals with disabilities so they could purchase assistive \ntechnology, ranging from a hearing device to an accessible van. The AT \nprograms also provided timely information to Americans, answering \n151,000 requests for assistance, and training more than 172,000 people.\n  Despite all of these successes, we recognize that there is much more \nto be done. The NOD/Harris poll indicates that 17 percent of \nindividuals with disabilities still do not have the assistive \ntechnology device or equipment that they need. And the biggest barrier \nis cost. In this reauthorization, we emphasize programs that will \nimprove access to assistive technology devices by providing loans, \nleases or other financing programs as well as recycled equipment.\n  While there are many important initiatives in this bill, I will \nhighlight a few of the most significant.\n  First, the bill for the first time authorizes a $410,000 State \nminimum for each of the State projects to ensure that each state has \nthe funds necessary to carry out the requirements of the act.\n  The bill also provides that the majority of the Federal funds will be \nspent on activities designed to provide direct access to assistive \ntechnology, including equipment loan, device reutilization, device \ndemonstration, and financing systems.\n  States will continue their successful public awareness and \ncoordination activities. States will also continue to provide technical \nassistance, with a new focus on individuals with disabilities who are \ngoing through transition periods and need assistive technology to be \nsuccessful. This is particularly important for students with \ndisabilities who are receiving IDEA services and transitioning to \nhigher education, employment and independent living. It is also \ncritical to adults with disabilities and older Americans who need help \nmaintaining independent living or transitioning from a nursing home or \ninstitution to the community.\n  The Senate recently passed the Individuals with Disabilities Act, and \nwe continue to be concerned about implementation of the ADA and the \nOlmstead decision. This effort aligns the Assistive Technology Act with \nthese other initiatives.\n  Because individuals with disabilities still are afforded \nsignificantly fewer employment opportunities than individuals without \ndisabilities, the bill places an emphasis on educating employers and \nemployees. One of the projects of national significance authorized in \nthe bill includes development of public service announcements and other \nmeans of reaching out to employers, giving them information regarding \nassistive technology.\n  The other project of national significance promotes research and \ndevelopment so we can have come up with assistive technologies that can \nopen up more doors for individuals with disabilities.\n  This reauthorization recognizes the ongoing contribution of \nprotection and advocacy services in making assistive technology \navailable to individuals with disabilities. And it adds the Native \nAmerican Protection and Advocacy System to those receiving funds under \nthe act. Iowa's successful advocacy program will also be continued \nunder this bill.\n  These are just a few of the many significant issues addressed in this \nbill. It is a very comprehensive effort, made possible by the hard work \nof the many stakeholders that participated.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Gregg, and his staff, \nparticularly Aaron Bishop and Denzel McGuire, for their excellent work \non this bipartisan initiative. I also want to recognize the work of \nSenators Kennedy, Roberts, Reed and DeWine and their staff members, \nKent Mitchell, Connie Garner, Jennifer Swenson, Elyse Wasch, Erica \nSwanson, and MaryBeth Luna. And I'd like to recognize Congressman \nBoehner and Miller and their staff members, David Cleary and Alex Nock, \nfor working on this bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  As part of this reauthorization process, committee staff have had \nextensive bipartisan briefings and met with a very wide array of \nstakeholders. Stakeholders also participated in work groups designed to \nforge consensus on many of the issues addressed in this bill. As a \nresult, I believe we are passing a very strong bill. I want to thank \nthe many individuals with disabilities, family members, assistive \ntechnology programs, vendors, members of the information technology \nindustry, the financial and business community, service providers, \nadvocates, educators and others who gave generously of their time and \nworked so hard on this bill.\n  This bill continues the tradition of bipartisan cooperation that has \nmarked every significant disability bill that has been passed by \nCongress. Just as the ADA, IDEA and other bills have been bipartisan, \nso is this Assistive Technology Act of 2004, We can all be proud to see \nit enacted into law.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support final passage of H.R. \n4278, the Assistive Technology Reauthorization Act of 2004.\n  This important legislation, the product of bipartisan and bicameral \nnegotiations, reauthorizes the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 and \nprovides individuals with disabilities increased access to critical \nassistive technology devices and services, focusing on where they are \nneeded most--in schools, on the job, and in the community. These \ndevices and services afford individuals with disabilities a greater \nopportunity to participate in educational programs, employment \nprospects, and community activities and thereby, assist them in leading \nmore full, productive, and independent lives.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, I am \npleased that some of its provisions on training and research and \ndevelopment which I authored have been included in the final version of \nthe bill before us today. The bill requires states to carry out \ntraining activities to enhance the knowledge, skills, and competencies \nof individuals in local settings statewide, including educators, early \nintervention, adult service, and health care providers, and others who \nwork with individuals with disabilities. These provisions ensure that \nlocal communities will have trained personnel available to meet the \nspecific assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities.\n  The bill also establishes a new authority for competitive grants for \nresearch and development of new assistive technology devices and for \nthe adaptation, maintenance, servicing and improvement of those \nassistive technology devices already in existence, an issue of great \ninterest to colleges in my State. As such, among the eligible \nrecipients for this research and development funding are institutions \nof higher education, including the nationally recognized University \nCenters for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, \nResearch, and Service and the engineering programs of such \ninstitutions. Regrettably, the compromise restricts the potential \nfunding of this program to a small level that is not sufficient to \nsolve the large and growing need for assistive technology devices, \nparticularly as our population ages. This is a good start, but we must \ndo more to help individuals with disabilities forge ahead and reach \ntheir ultimate potential, and so I hope we can grow this funding in the \nfuture.\n  There are other highlights as well. The bill increases the minimum \nallotment for each State assistive technology program to $410,000 which \ncould mean an increase of nearly $110,000 in funding for Rhode Island \nas appropriations rise, and it repeals the sunset provision included in \nthe Assistive Technology Act of 1998 so that States can continue to be \neligible for funding. The bill also shifts emphasis toward getting \nassistive technology directly into the hands of individuals with \ndisabilities through programs to provide\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\ndevice demonstration, equipment loan, device reutilization/recycling \nand financing systems such as low-interest loans for the purchase or \nlease of assistive technology equipment.\n  I thank my colleagues, in particular, Chairman Gregg, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Harkin, and their staffs, for their hard work in \nproducing a bipartisan piece of legislation and moving it toward final \npassage.\n  A special thanks is also due to Regina Connor, the Project Director \nof the Rhode Island Assistive Technology Access Partnership, ATAP, \nwhich is Rhode Island's Assistive Technology Act Project, and Tony \nAntosh, Director of the Paul V. Sherlock Center on Disabilities, for \ntheir input and recommendations throughout the legislative process and \nensuring that the act contained provisions important to Rhode Island \nassistive technology users, providers, and advocates.\n  This is significant legislation for people in Rhode Island and across \nthe Nation, and I am pleased to support it. I look forward to the \nPresident quickly signing this bill into law which will hopefully \nsignal a turnaround in his support for assistive technology funding to \nprovide individuals with disabilities the increased support they need \nand deserve.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will take up the \nLeahy-Hatch amendment to reauthorize the highly successful Department \nof Justice Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. I thank the \nChairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for joining \nme on this amendment.\n  This amendment contains the same legislative language as the \nCampbell-Leahy-Hatch Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003, S. \n764. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent on July 15, 2003, and has been awaiting consideration \nby the House of Representatives since then.\n  This measure marks the third time that I have had the privilege of \nteaming with my friend and colleague Senator Campbell to work on the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program. We authored the Bulletproof \nVest Grant Partnership Act of 1998, which responded to the tragic Carl \nDrega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which \ntwo state troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were killed. The \nFederal officers who responded to the scenes of the shooting spree were \nequipped with life-saving body armor, but the state and local law \nenforcement officers lacked protective vests because of the cost.\n  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and I hope we will go 3-for-3 this time \naround. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable experience in \nthis area and during his time in the Senate he has been a leader in the \narea of law enforcement. As a former deputy sheriff, he knows the \ndangers law enforcement officers face when out on patrol. I am pleased \nthat we have been joined in this effort by 12 other Senate cosponsors, \nincluding Senator Hatch.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will save the lives of law enforcement \nofficers across the country by providing more help to State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since its inception in \n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided \nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions Nationwide with nearly \n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 60 municipalities have been \nfortunate to receive to receive funding for the purchase of 1,905 \nvests.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the \nsuccess of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by re-\nauthorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation would \ncontinue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 million \nper year for matching grants to State and local law enforcement \nagencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body \narmor.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof vest gets one.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the Leahy-Hatch amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third \ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
