In Your perfect timing and wisdom, You raise up leaders and You \nbring them down.

In light of this, we are conscious of the awesome responsibility \nthat You have entrusted to our Nation at this time in the history of \nYour world.\n  Therefore, we pray for all who lead and hold high office in this \nland, especially for the Members of this Senate, that You would give \nthem Your ``Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might, \nof knowledge and the fear of the Lord,'' that their deliberations and \ndecisions would be godly, righteous and pure.\n  As the eyes of many are on this Nation, may its leaders govern in \nsuch a manner that results in peace with justice, and that provides a \nmodel for a watching world.

Mr. President, first, I wish to say how pleased I am to \nrecognize our guest Chaplain for the day, who is now preaching the \ngospel in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and with roots to Great \nBritain, a nation which has been our ally for over 200 years after we \nsettled a mild difference in 1776. But I must say that his message was \nmost appropriate for the day. The magnificent way in which he delivered \nthat message, I felt as if it reverberated through the rafters because \nof the resonance of that powerful voice. We welcome him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6891-7", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last evening, owing to the great help of \nmany persons, not the least of whom is the distinguished Democratic \nwhip who is here on the floor with me this morning, the bill of the \nArmed Services Committee made remarkable progress. Through the night, \nthe staff on both sides prepared another significant collection of \namendments which will soon be brought to the Senate for clearance.\n  When the Senate resumes consideration of the bill today, the Murray \namendment will be laid aside, and Senator Daschle, or his designee, \nwill be recognized to call up amendment No. 791 regarding the \nDepartment of the Air Force.\n  For the information of all Senators, amendments are expected \nthroughout the day, and therefore rollcall votes will occur as \ndesignated by the leadership. It is the managers' hope--and, indeed, I \nmay say from the Chaplain's prayer--that this bill will be concluded, \nhopefully, by midday today.\n  I know of several amendments on both sides which I believe we can \nwork our way through. Some of them require the attention of the Senate, \nof course, with a rollcall vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6891-8", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6891-S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we spoke last night as we were leaving, \nit seemed to me the only hurdle left was what we were going to do about \nthe amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Washington. She \nhas offered this amendment 7 years in a row. We have had a straight up-\nor-down vote on this amendment 7 years in a row. It seems to me that \nwould be the way to handle this matter, which, of course, is \ncontroversial, as are many other amendments on this very bill. Once we \nget through that--if, in fact, we do get through it, and it could hold\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\nup the bill for an indefinite period of time--we have very few matters \nleft on this side.\n  I have not been able to determine from the managers if they have been \nable to clear the Landrieu amendment. We were concerned about the Biden \namendment and the Dodd amendment.\n  I think that is about all we have other than the Boxer amendment, \nwhich is going to be debated sometime today.\n  She has agreed to take a short time on that.\n  The end is in sight. But knowing the Senate as I do, the simple fact \nthat the end is in sight doesn't mean that we will ever get there.\n  I hope we can resolve the Boxer matter and the Murray matter rapidly. \nHaving done that, I think we will proceed through this bill quite \nquickly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask the distinguished leader \nand ranking member, we are prepared to accept the offer made last night \nwith regard to time on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We would still be willing to do that. The Senator from \nCalifornia has indicated, if the Chair will allow me to speak to the \nSenator from Virginia, that she is agreeable to take an hour evenly \ndivided on her amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington waited for hours \nlast night during the parliamentary wrangle that we had. I think we are \nwilling to enter into that time agreement. I think we first have to \ndispose of the Murray amendment before we agree to that. Under the \norder, we have to work on the Daschle amendment. As soon as we complete \nthat, I think we should dispose of the Murray amendment before we go to \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator enter into an agreement \nwith the chairman for a one-hour time agreement on the Boxer amendment \nwhich does not preclude an amendment in the second degree?\n  Mr. REID. Not at this time, we would not. I think we need to dispose \nof the Murray amendment one way or the other. Once we do, I think we \ncan work something out on the Boxer amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6892-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside an amount for reconstituting the B-1B bomber \n                    aircraft fleet of the Air Force)\n\n       On page 21, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 132.

Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \ndistinguished leader and ranking member, my understanding is that \namendment requires a further amendment, and then it is in an acceptable \nform. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could ask the Senator to yield, it is my \nunderstanding that the amendment has been agreed to but the paperwork \nhas not yet been completed to accomplish the agreement.\n  Mr. REID. If the Chair would allow me, Senator Daschle agreed to the \nmodification of the amendment. That could be handled either later today \nor in the managers' package.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. Perhaps \nin the course of the debate this morning we can reach that agreement \nquickly.\n  Mr. REID.

B-1B BOMBER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Amount for Aircraft.--(1) Of the amount authorized to \n     be appropriated under section 103(1), $20,300,000 may be \n     available to reconstitute the fleet of B-1B bomber aircraft \n     through modifications of 23 B-1B bomber aircraft otherwise \n     scheduled to be retired in fiscal year 2003 that extend the \n     service life of such aircraft and maintain or, as necessary, \n     improve the capabilities of such aircraft for mission \n     performance.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report that specifies the \n     amounts necessary to be included in the future-years defense \n     program to reconstitute the B-1B bomber aircraft fleet of the \n     Air Force.\n       (b) Adjustment.--(1) The total amount authorized to be \n     appropriated under section 103(1) is hereby increased by \n     $20,300,000.\n       (2) The total amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     section 104 is hereby reduced by $20,300,000, with the amount \n     of the reduction to be allocated to SOF operational \n     enhancements.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate will soon adopt a new national \nDefense authorization bill. I commend Senators Warner and Levin, the \ndistinguished managers of this bill, for their excellent work. They \nhave worked well together on an important piece of legislation.\n  This crucial legislation, the fiscal year 2004 National Defense \nauthorization bill, provides funds for our troops, their training, and \ntheir equipment.\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\nComing as it does on the heels of the end of the fighting in Iraq, it \nalso provides the Senate with its first opportunity to act on some of \nthe lessons we have learned in that conflict.\n  Although the hostilities ended a short time ago and much more needs \nto be done in Iraq, I do not believe it is premature to begin drawing \nsome conclusions about which forces and equipment performed well. Based \non the Pentagon's assessments as well as media reports, it appears the \nB-1B aircraft and their crews performed magnificently.\n  Just as in Afghanistan, we had few air bases in adjacent countries. \nFortunately the B-1's long operating range overcame that problem. Just \nas in Afghanistan, our air tankers were straining to keep up the demand \nfor midair refueling--but B-1s were part of the solution, with their \nability to cover long distances and strike 24 targets on a single \nmission. Just as in Afghanistan, we needed the ability to carry out \nstrikes around the clock, on a moment's notice, regardless of weather \nconditions and B-1s did the job, day after day, until the Iraqi \nmilitary was routed and its leadership was no more.\n  All of this served to reinforce what many have believed to be true \nfor quite some time now; namely, that the Pentagon acted too hastily a \nfew years ago when it decided to retire one-third of our B-1B bomber \nfleet.\n  The plan to retire one-third of the B-1 fleet was developed before \nthe September 11th attacks, before the war on terrorism, before the \nfighting in Afghanistan, and before Iraq. Given the proven record of \nperformance of the B-1, the age of our current heavy bomber fleet, the \nlack of a next-generation bomber, and the fact that it took 20 years \nbefore our Nation's last bomber-development program could field \nplanes--it seems incredible that we are consigning 23 of our most \ncapable aircraft, a plane referred to by those who know it best as the \n``backbone of the bomber fleet,'' to the Arizona desert.\n  My amendment would begin the process of rolling back the decision to \nretire those 23 planes. It would rebuild our bomber fleet toward the \nlevel recommended in our last comprehensive review of bomber needs, the \nU.S. Air Force White Paper on Long Range Bombers. That report \ndetermined that 93 B-1s were needed to protect U.S. national security \ninterests until a replacement capability is available. My amendment \nwould put us on the path to 83 B-1s--the most we can muster, given \ndecommissioning work that is already well underway on some aircraft.\n  Senator Johnson and I have consulted with the Air Force about the \ntiming and funding requirements to regenerate 23 planes and have \ndetermined that an appropriate first-year effort would be $20.3 \nmillion. This is also the level of effort being recommended by the \nHouse Armed Service Committee in the bill being taken up this morning \non the House floor. This fiscal year 2004 funding would launch a \nmultiyear program to provide these 23 planes the same capabilities as \nthe rest of the B-1 fleet.\n  To begin with, these planes would require the Block E upgrade to B-1 \noffensive systems that almost all of our B-1 fleet has already \nreceived. Additional assorted upgrades will also be required, and my \namendment would begin that work--configuration to accommodate towed \ndecoys, installation of new datalink capabilities, and modifications to \nimprove the dependability and capability of the plane's electronic \ncountermeasure system and its central integrated test system.\n  Finally, my amendment would require the Air Force to report back to \ncongressional defense committees on additional funding requirements \nneeded in the Future Years Defense Plan, (FYDP) to fully restore these \naircraft to operational levels.\n  This is our last chance to halt the retirement of B-1s, since many \nare scheduled to be sent to Arizona by the end of this fiscal year. In \nlight of what we know now about the hasty manner in which the B-1 \nretirement decision was made, the B-1's proven combat effectiveness, \nand our Nation's anticipated security requirements, it is time to begin \nbringing back these 23 planes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I support the Daschle-Johnson amendment \nto the fiscal year 2004 Defense Authorization bill. This amendment will \nprovide the funding necessary to maintain a strong and reliable B-1 \nbomber fleet.\n  Over the past week, the B-1 bombers, crews, and support staff of the \n28th Bomb Wing have begun to return to Ellsworth Air Force Base from \ntheir service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. As they did in Kosovo and \nAfghanistan, the B-1 bombers performed superbly in the war in Iraq. \nThey have once again demonstrated that they are the backbone of \nAmerica's bomber fleet. The B-1's unique ability to linger over the \nbattlefield and provide responsive firepower at the time and place \nrequired by military commanders was an integral part of our victory in \nIraq.\n  Although B-1s flew fewer than 2 percent of the combat sorties in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, they dropped more than half the satellite \nguided Air Force Joint Direct Attack Munitions, (JDAMs). The B-1s were \ntasked against the full spectrum of potential targets in Iraq, \nincluding command and control facilities, bunkers, tanks, armored \npersonnel carriers, and surface-to-air missile sites. They also \nprovided close air support for U.S. forces engaged in the field. The \nbombers and crews accomplished all of this while maintaining over an 80 \npercent mission capable rate. This record of success proves B-1 is a \nvital, versatile, and potent component of our military force structure.\n  The Daschle-Johnson amendment would provide the funding needed to \nstart regenerating, modernizing, and returning 23 B-1s to our bomber \nfleet. The Department of Defense is in the process of implementing its \nplan to retire all but 60 B-1s, this is despite a U.S. Air Force White \nPaper on Long Range Bombers that determined it was in our national \nsecurity interests to maintain the full B-1 fleet. Furthermore, since \nthe Pentagon announced its decision to consolidate the fleet, the B-1s \nhave been instrumental in the military success of both Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Given the demonstration of its unique capabilities in both these \ncampaigns, it makes little sense to continue forward with the \nretirement of one-third of the B-1 fleet. With the funding provided in \nthe Daschle-Johnson amendment, and planned increases in the Air Force's \nbudget in future years, additional modernized B-1s could enter service \nin fiscal year 2005. The B-1's ability to carry a large payload of \nsatellite guided weapons and to strike from long distances will make it \nan important part of our Nation's defense for many years.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support the long-term \nviability of the B-1 fleet by voting in favor of the Daschle-Johnson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 821\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I can think of few better uses of \nFederal dollars than the benefits derived from our commitment to the \nNational Guard's Youth Challenge Program. Every year, over 500,000 boys \nand girls drop out of school. High-school dropouts face a much more \ndifficult life after leaving school than their peers who continue their \neducations to finish high school. Drug use and run-ins with the law \noften plague high school dropouts for a life-time.\n  The Youth Challenge Program has reclaimed the lives of over 45,000 \nchildren through the instillment of discipline, self-respect, \ncommitment to citizenry, and the renewed pursuit of a diploma. It costs \nover $40,000 a year for a child to be detained in a juvenile detention \ncenter. On the other hand, Youth Challenge can reclaim a child from a \nlife of wrong-turns for $14,000 a child.\n  I am pleased the President and the Senate have committed $65.2 \nmillion to the Youth Challenge Program. Youth Challenge is funded on a \nformula basis, whereby the Federal Government contributes 60 percent of \nthe funds and States contribute 40 percent. Regrettably, many States \nare facing steep budget shortfalls, and they are having difficulty \nmeeting the 40 percent match. Already, New York and Missouri have \nclosed their Youth Challenge programs.\n  This amendment authorizes the Department to increase the Federal \nmatch, temporarily, until the States get their financial houses in \norder. For fiscal year 2004, the Federal match would increase to 65 \npercent. For fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 the Federal match \nwould increase to 70 percent. However, it is expected the States will \nhave recovered from budgetary difficulties by fiscal year 2007; \ntherefore, the Federal match would fall back to 65 percent in all \nsubsequent years.\n  There is no more effective program to make high school dropouts \ncontributors, rather than anchors, to society. I hope you will join me \nin supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, without losing \nhis right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Tremendous progress has been made in the last few hours, as \nwe have seen by these amendments. We are very close to being able to \nissue a consent we hope will be agreed upon to finalize the bill, but \nwe need just a minute to do that. There is a call in the cloakroom we \nhave to resolve before we do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I suggest we put in a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Virginia do that, please.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia suggests the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow resume consideration of the Murray amendment, No. 691, and there \nthen be 60 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, prior \nto a vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in order to \nthe amendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may interrupt, I failed to mention this \nto my friend a second ago. Our leader has asked that the vote occur at \n2:15, rather than an hour from the time it begins. We would still only \nhave an hour of debate. There are other things we can do during that \nperiod of time. So I ask for that modification.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, that is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \namendments, that only amendments in order are relevant under the \noriginal agreement and subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have a package of amendments. There are additional \namendments, all of which must be in conformity with the unanimous \nconsent, pending relevancy at the desk. All have to be checked through \nthat system. They are: First, Durbin; second, Domenici; third, \nLandrieu; fourth, Kerry. Further, Senator Grassley has an amendment. \nAll of these have to be passed through the parliamentary unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. REID. These are subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished colleague, there is a Boxer \namendment regarding contracting, subject to a relevant second degree.\n  Mr. REID. We just got a call from Senator Byrd. We are going to have \nto wait.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 691\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again I proceed to a unanimous consent \nrequest as follows: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume \nconsideration of the Murray amendment No. 691, and there then be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with no amendments in order prior to the \nvote; I ask consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments in order and be relevant as under the original agreement and \nsubject to relevant second degrees: A package of amendments that have \nbeen cleared and are being cleared by both managers; the Boxer \namendment regarding contracting and subject to relevant second degree; \nDomenici amendment on border security, to be resolved; Kerry, air \ntravel; Landrieu, subject to being relevant; Grassley, ground systems, \nsubject to relevancy.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Domenici, Kerry, Landrieu, \nGrassley also have the same language, that they be subject to relevant \nsecond-degree amendments. We have stated that twice. I want to make \nsure that is clear.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the \nabove amendment, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 1104, \nintroduced by Senator Brownback, relating to parental notification, \nprovided that immediately upon the reporting of the bill, the majority \nleader or his designee be recognized in order to file a cloture motion \non the bill. I further ask consent that there then be 60 minutes for \ndebate only, equally divided between Senators Brownback and Murray, and \nthat following that debate time, notwithstanding the provisions of rule \nXXII, the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the underlying bill, without intervening action or debate; \nprovided further that if cloture is not invoked, the bill be placed on \nthe calendar. If cloture is invoked, I would ask consent that it be in \norder to file first-degree amendments up to the cloture vote, and \nsecond-degree amendments up to 3 hours after the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this took just a \nfew minutes to read. It took hours to accomplish.\n  We are now going to a situation where Senator Murray and Senator \nBrownback will debate for 1 hour. Following that, there will be a vote \non or in relation to the Murray amendment. Following that, we will work \nour way through these other amendments that have been declared to be in \norder on this bill. Some of them, I hope, will be resolved.\n  I personally extend my appreciation to the two managers of this bill \nfor their patience, their understanding, and also Senator Murray and \nSenator Brownback. The issue about which we are going to debate for an \nhour is very sensitive to everyone, those two Senators especially. They \nhave also been courteous to each of us and each other. I think this is \na fair way to proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Democratic leader. He has been \ntoo modest to say he, together with the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky on this side, has been an integral part of enabling this \nagreement to be formulated.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 691\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now there are 60 minutes evenly divided on the \nMurray amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, is the Murray amendment called up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is pending.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to add cosponsors \nas follows: Senators Snowe, Boxer, Cantwell, Collins, Schumer, \nJeffords, Durbin, Lautenberg, Corzine, and Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate now has before it a very \nimportant amendment. I think all of us know that women have played a \ncritical role in all of our country's recent military actions.\n  In Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in missions throughout the world, women \nhave demonstrated their skill, their sacrifice, and their courage. We \ncan all be very proud of the women who have served in our military. \nThey are our mothers, our daughters, they are our sisters, and they are \nour neighbors. They put themselves in harm's way to protect our \nfreedom. They live and work in hostile combat zones under very \ndangerous conditions. They make sacrifices every day to defend our \nNation.\n  But today, military women are forced to sacrifice their own \nconstitutional rights, as they risk their lives to protect our freedom. \nNo woman----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend just a moment, \nplease. Could we have order so the Senator from Washington can be \nheard?\n  Thank you very much. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, no woman should be forced to surrender her \nconstitutional rights when she puts on a military uniform and \nvolunteers to serve our country overseas. But that is exactly what \nhappens today, and it must stop. The women of our military risk their \nlives to protect our rights, but if they serve abroad they are being \ndenied access to safe, legal, constitutionally protected health care.\n  Today I am on the floor of the Senate to offer an amendment to ensure \nthat our military women when they serve overseas have access to the \nsame health care as they get here at home. I again thank all my \ncosponsors, Senators Snowe, Boxer, Cantwell, Collins, Schumer, \nJeffords, Durbin, Lautenberg, Corzine, and Bingaman.\n  Before I go into detail, I want to clarify what this is about and \nwhat it is not about. There are four very important aspects to \nunderstand.\n  First of all, this amendment does not require any direct Federal \nfunding of abortion-related services. My amendment simply requires \nthese women to pay for any costs associated with an abortion in a \nmilitary facility. So no direct Federal funding is involved.\n  Second, my amendment does not compel a medical provider to perform \nabortions. All branches of the military allow medical personnel who \nhave moral or religious or ethical objections to abortion not to \nparticipate. So this amendment does not change or alter conscience \nclauses for military medical personnel.\n  Third, this will not create any significant burden on the military. \nIt will not hinder the military's ability to carry out its missions or \nto provide medical services.\n\n  Finally, do not believe anyone who tells you that our military, the \nfinest military in the world, is not capable of providing these health \nservices or that our military is unable to determine the cost. The \ntruth is that today the Defense Department allows for privately funded \nabortions in the case of rape or incest. The ultimate proof that this \nis something our military can do is that, prior to 1988, the Department \nof Defense did allow privately funded abortions at overseas military \nfacilities.\n  So, clearly, this can be done. So let's make sure we are all straight \non those four points. There is no direct Federal funding. No medical \nprovider would be required to do anything they oppose. No significant \nburden would be placed on the military. And there is no doubt that our \nmilitary can do this because it has done it before, prior to 1988, and \ndoes it today in cases of rape or incest.\n  Anyone who comes to the Senate floor and makes any of those claims I \nhave just rebutted is raising red herrings as a distraction from the \nreal issue. The real issue is the health of women who serve our country \nand respect for their rights and freedom.\n  The current policy on the books today is an insult to women. It is a \nrejection of their rights and it is a threat to their health. Under \ncurrent restrictions, women who have volunteered to serve their \ncountry, and female military dependents, are not allowed to exercise \ntheir legally guaranteed right to choose, simply because they are \nserving overseas. These women are committed to protecting our rights as \nfree citizens. Yet they are denied one of the most basic rights \nafforded all women in this country. This is an important women's health \namendment.\n  Women should be able to depend on their base hospital and military \nhealth care providers to meet all of their health care needs. To single \nout abortion-related services could jeopardize a woman's health. The \ncurrent policy does not ensure the access women need for four reasons.\n  First of all, a woman today must seek the approval of her commanding \nofficer for transport back to the United States. That could be very \nhumiliating and can be a deterrent to a woman to getting the care that \nshe needs. We know, from a GAO report that was issued in May of 2002, \nthat many commanding officers--and I quote:\n\n       . . . have not been adequately trained about the importance \n     of women's basic health care. Department of Defense officials \n     said that lacking this understanding, some commanders may be \n     reluctant to allow active duty Members, both men and women, \n     time away from their duty station to obtain health care \n     services.\n\n  So women have to face the humiliation of asking a superior officer \nfor permission over something that the GAO found many commanders do not \nunderstand or appreciate.\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n  Second, the current policy jeopardizes a woman's right to privacy \nbecause she must disclose her medical condition to her superiors with \nno guarantee that her medical concerns will be kept confidential. That \nis a very important point. She would have to disclose her medical \ncondition to her superiors in the Air Force or the Army, in the \nservice, with no guarantee that her medical concerns will be kept \nconfidential.\n  Third, the woman is not afforded medical leave, so she is further \npenalized under the current policy.\n\n  And fourth, because of these unfair restrictions, many women are \nforced to seek care off the base, in a foreign country. That country \nmay have different cultural and religious norms and different standards \nof health care. Many women have little or no understanding of the laws \nor restrictions in a host country, and there may also be significant \nlanguage and cultural barriers as well. So let's be honest. Some of the \ncountries our military operates in are not very progressive when it \ncomes to women's issues, and that could threaten our service women.\n  In addition, these countries may not have adequate safety and medical \nstandards. Here in the United States, we take for granted the safety of \nour health care service. When we seek care in our doctors' offices or \nin a clinic, we assume all safety and health standards are adhered to. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case in many countries.\n  Under current conditions, we are subjecting women to standards in a \nforeign country where they may not be safe, where they may not be \nhealth standards where we can assure that their basic health care is \ntaken care of.\n  Finally, because of all these barriers, women may delay getting the \ncare they urgently need. Many women are forced to delay the procedure \nfor several weeks until they can travel to a location where safe, \nadequate care is available. Each week that an abortion is delayed there \nare greater risks to a woman's health.\n  So the current policy is humiliating. It is a threat to women's \nprivacy. It is punitive. It is a threat to women's safety, and it is a \nthreat to women's health. Those are not the types of burdens we should \nbe putting on women who volunteer to serve our country and defend our \nfreedoms.\n  The current policy is unfair to women. It denies them their \nconstitutional rights. My amendment before the Senate today will \ncorrect that.\n  This amendment is supported by the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists. It is supported by the American Medical Women's \nAssociation. It is supported by Physicians for Reproductive Choice in \nHealth. And it is supported by the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies.\n  The Senate agreed to this amendment. The Department of Defense has \nfollowed this policy before. And, finally, let me just say, after the \ninspiring and courageous work our military women have done in Iraq and \nin Afghanistan, we owe them nothing less than the same rights they are \nfighting to protect for all of us.\n  This is a test for every Senator. Every Senator is going to have to \nanswer to the women who serve our country overseas. Will you stand up \nfor the rights of women who, today, are standing up to ensure your \nfreedom? Either you respect the women who serve our country overseas \nand you agree that they deserve the same rights and freedoms as women \nhere at home or you do not. That is the choice. Either you respect the \nwomen who serve our country overseas and you agree that they deserve \nthe same rights and freedoms as women here at home or you do not. That \nis the case.\n\n  If you vote against the Murray-Snowe amendment, you are simply \ntelling American servicewomen that when they serve overseas protecting \nour country and risking their lives that they can't be trusted with the \nconstitutional right to health care that women here at home in the \nUnited States have. They deserve more respect than that.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to, first, thank the Senator \nfrom Washington for bringing up this issue. I think there was a \nrelevancy issue associated with it. There was a big debate about this \nlast night. It was eventually deemed relevant.\n  I then proposed a second-degree amendment that would require parental \nnotification of the type which is involved with 43 of our States. \nForty-three States have parental notification--that a minor on a \nmilitary base, a dependent, could not get an abortion until either \nparent was notified--just notified, not consent, just notified--within \n48 hours before the abortion or that there be a judicial oversight. So \nthat if either parent were not available or accessible, or the child \ndidn't want to notify the parent, they could get the court to rule that \nthe abortion go ahead and the parent not be notified or, if it were a \ncatastrophic situation and the life of the minor was in jeopardy, the \ndoctor could go forward and provide the abortion without a notification \nperiod.\n  That was the second degree that was being proposed. We had a spirited \ndiscussion here privately about this.\n  I thank the managers of the bill. I thank particularly the two whips \non either side for pushing this forward to get us to resolve the issue; \nthat what we are going to do today is take up the Murray amendment and \ntake up the parental notification issue at a later date--I hope a week \nor two after we get back from the break. I think it is an important \nissue as well.\n  The parents in 43 States are notified if their minor child is seeking \nto have an abortion. We would extend this right to parents of military \npersonnel as well. That is what is considered in the second degree.\n\n  I appreciate the Senator from Washington working that out with us so \nwe are able to take up both of these difficult issues.\n  I also thank the Senator from Washington for her passion and caring \nfor women in the armed services. She stands up strongly for women's \nrights, particularly for women's rights in the military. I appreciate \nthat. I have no qualms about her passion or her heart at all. I \nrecognize and applaud both.\n  But we have a narrow specific issue here that goes to the very core \nof what we are about as a society today. It goes to the very core issue \nof culture of life and culture of death that is being broadly discussed \nin the culture today. And that is being played out here on the issue of \nmilitary bases. It goes to the issue of the legal status of the child \nin utero.\n  I certainly recognize the passion of the Senator from Washington for \nwomen's rights. I applaud that. But there is also another person \ninvolved here and there are other issues involved here.\n  On February 10, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996 was signed into law by then-President Clinton with a \nprovision to prevent Department of Defense medical treatment facilities \nfrom being used to perform abortions except for when the life of the \nmother is in danger or in the case of rape or incest.\n  That is the current status for the use of military base health \nfacilities to provide for abortion. They can be provided at military \nbases in the cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother or \nmilitary personnel is endangered. This would be obviously women in the \nmilitary or a female dependent in the military.\n  This provision--10 United States Code 1093(b)--reversed a Clinton \nadministration policy instituted on January 22, 1996, permitting \nabortions to be performed at military facilities, period.\n  In other words, all abortions on demand could be provided according \nto the Clinton administration policy that was put into place \nimmediately after President Clinton became President.\n  Previously--from 1988 to 1993--the performance of an abortion was not \npermitted at military hospitals except when the life of the mother was \nendangered.\n  I think you can start to see the progression here that was taking \nplace.\n  Under President Reagan, there was a provision that you could provide \nan abortion on a military base if the life of the mother was in danger. \nThat continued through President Reagan and President Bush 1. Then \nPresident Clinton came into office and immediately opened up all \nmilitary facilities for all abortions and said they could be performed.\n  In February 1996, that was limited. Abortions could be provided in \ncases of\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nrape and incest and when the life of the mother was endangered, but it \nwas an expansion from where it was in the Reagan administration.\n  That is the law of the land as it is today.\n  The Murray amendment, which would repeal this pro-life provision, \nattempts to turn these taxpayer-funded DOD medical treatment facilities \ninto facilities that provide abortion on demand for military personnel \nand their dependents. The Senate should reject this amendment. This is \nwhat the issue is about.\n  When a similar amendment passed last year, Secretary of Defense \nDonald Rumsfeld warned that the President's senior advisers would \nrecommend the President veto the Defense authorization bill on this \nissue. So you are talking about an abortion issue of providing \nabortions in medical military facilities, a narrow, overall issue \nbringing down the entire Defense authorization bill--on this issue \nwhere abortions are provided for rape, incest, life of the mothers, but \nnot on demand for all abortions. That could bring down the whole bill.\n  Using the coercive power of Government to force American taxpayers to \nfund health care facilities where abortions are performed would be a \nterrible precedent that would put many Americans in a difficult \nposition of saying: They are using my taxpayer money to fund something \nthat I don't agree with--abortion on demand. Yes, I can understand it \nin cases of life of the mother, certainly, and of rape and incest, but \nnot on demand.\n  When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was \nfirst promulgated, military physicians, as well as many nurses and \nsupporting personnel, refused--refused--to perform or assist in \nelective abortions. In response, the administration sought to hire \ncivilians to do abortions. That should tell us something about what is \ntaking place here. The military personnel themselves--the physicians--\ndo not want to do these elective abortions.\n  Therefore, if the Murray amendment were adopted, not only would \ntaxpayer-funded facilities be used to support abortion on demand, but \nresources would be used to search for, hire, and transport new \npersonnel simply so that the abortions could be performed outside of \nthis narrow scope of rape, incest, life of the mother that would be on \nall other abortions.\n  In fact, according to CRS, a 1994 memorandum from the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Health Affairs--this would be under the \nClinton administration--``direct[ed] the Military Health Services \nSystem to provide other means of access if providing pre-paid abortion \nservices at a facility was not feasible''--how outside individuals \nperformed abortions on military bases.\n  One argument used by supporters of abortions in military hospitals is \nthat women in countries where abortion is not permitted will have \nnowhere else to turn to obtain an abortion. However, DOD policy \nrequires military doctors to obey the abortion laws of the countries \nwhere they are providing services, so they still could not perform \nabortions at those locations.\n  Military treatment centers, which are dedicated to healing and \nnurturing life, should not be forced to facilitate the taking of the \nmost innocent human life: the child in utero--and this as an elective, \non demand, not in cases of rape, incest, life of the mother, which are \ncurrently provided under the law concerning the Department of Defense.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down this Murray amendment and free \nAmerica's military and the Department of Defense authorization bill \nfrom abortion politics. American taxpayers should not be forced to fund \nfacilities that destroy innocent human life. I urge my colleagues to \nreject that amendment.\n\n  I would also urge my colleagues, when we bring up the parental \nnotification bill, that they would support such a provision. The \nparental notification bill would--and that is one parent, not both--one \nparent is simply notified 48 hours in advance of an abortion being \nprovided to their minor child if that is going to take place on a \nmilitary base. And if either parent cannot be reached, or if the child \nbelieves this would endanger, somehow, him or herself, there is a \njudicial override or the doctor could go ahead and even perform and \nnote in the record as to why, for health reasons, he did not notify. \nThis isn't consent, it is notifying the parent.\n  It is not the issue up, but thanks to the Senator from Washington, to \nhelp get this agreed to, to work this out, we will be considering that \nparental notification provision.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  We do have other speakers to present. If it would be appropriate for \nthe Senator from Washington, we could bounce back and forth. I do have \na speaker who is here.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes, 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my \ncolleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Murray \namendment.\n  We worked hard on this bill. I serve on the Armed Services Committee. \nWe are still in a state of conflict in Iraq. We have hostilities and \ndangers around the world. We made a commitment, as a Senate, to move \nforward, to move this Defense bill early this year, not wait until the \nlast minute, to do our work properly.\n  This bill is endangered now by a highly controversial amendment, \nwhich I oppose, and which I think a majority in this body will oppose. \nIt could affect adversely our ability to conduct a harmonious \nconference with the House of Representatives. It could even result in a \nveto by the President of the United States.\n  I know there is a strong abortion agenda still out here, even though \nthe polling numbers continue to show erosion for that position.\n  This side of the aisle--Senator Brownback and others who care about \nthe issue--has not injected abortion into the Defense debate, but it \nhas been raised by the pro-abortion agenda groups. I think that is not \nhealthy. I wish it had not happened. I know there has been a debate \nover whether or not it is even relevant, but the Parliamentarian had \nruled that it is, so we will have this vote today.\n  I will just note, as an example of the reality of the problem, we had \na bankruptcy bill that I worked on in the Judiciary Committee--and \nothers did--for several years. We voted on it on the floor of this body \nand got 87 votes for it. Yet it died in committee because a pro-\nabortion amendment had been placed on it. The conference committee \ncould not break the deal, and eventually the entire bill failed.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. On your time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARPER. I just want 1 minute, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama controls the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield for 1 minute, if he would use Senator Murray's \ntime.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, on the issue the Senator raises in \nrelation to the bankruptcy legislation, I make a point of \nclarification. This is an issue I care about as much as the Senator \nfrom Alabama. The language that died, after having been reported out to \nthe conference committee, was language that said when a person commits \na violent act for which they are convicted and fined, they cannot \ndischarge that fine in a court of bankruptcy.\n  It does not say anything about abortion. It does not say anything \nabout abortion clinics. It says if you have been convicted of a violent \nact, you cannot go to a court of bankruptcy and discharge that claim \nfor which you have been convicted and fined. That is what it said.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question? Does the Senator \nyield?\n  Mr. CARPER. I just wanted to make that clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not think the Senator, who is a great colleague, \nwould dispute the fact that language resulted in the failure of that \nbill.\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\n  People care about this issue. It is a big deal to people. It is a \npersonal and emotional issue that I don't think needs to be pressed at \nthis point.\n  Our military physicians and nurses are not happy with it. It would \nrequire us to utilize military hospitals as facilities to carry out \nabortions. It would make our hospitals a part of the abortion process. \nIt would utilize Federal property and resources to that degree. It \ncovers not just foreign hospitals but every hospital in America.\n  Yes, it is legal--clearly legal--that a woman can have an abortion \nand can use her own money to that effect, but we have sort of reached \nan understanding and compromise in the Congress that it is legal but \nbecause of respect for people with differing views, we just will not \nuse taxpayers' money to fund it. There is just sort of a truce, in a \nway, that has been reached. I think it is probably something we just \nhave to live with at the present time.\n  I don't see any need to pressure or embarrass doctors and nurses who \ndo not feel comfortable doing this. We know this. There was a survey \ndone of the Army, Navy, and Air Force obstetricians; 44 of them were \nsurveyed. All but one said they adamantly opposed doing abortions. One \nlater said that physician was opposed to abortions. Some of these were \nwomen physicians. Nurses are not comfortable with it. I don't believe \nwe ought to be requiring military hospitals to go out and hire other \nphysicians to come in on Government taxpayer funded property to conduct \nthese procedures. It is just not necessary.\n  President Bush has made clear he opposes using taxpayers' money to \nfund abortions. Passage of this amendment would threaten that.\n  I believe women are playing an increasingly valuable role in our \nmilitary. I spent over 10 years as a reservist and served with many \nfine women officers. The unit I was a part of in Mobile, AL, is now in \nKuwait commanded by a woman officer. I can't tell you how proud I am of \nthem. I am not hearing from the women I know in the military that this \nis something they are demanding, frankly. I don't think the American \npeople are.\n  I will just point out some numbers that deal with this subject. If \nanybody cares, a January 2003 poll of ABC News/Washington Post--not \nconservative groups--showed that only 23 percent were for abortion to \nbe legal in all cases. That is less than a fourth. The same poll found, \nwhen asked this question, should we make abortion harder to get, 42 \npercent said yes; easier to get an abortion, 15 percent said yes. So 42 \npercent thought it ought to be harder to get an abortion and 15 percent \nthought it should be easier.\n  In January of 2003, a CBS News/New York Times poll asked this \nquestion: should abortion be generally available, 39 percent; stricter \nlimits, 38 percent; not permitted, 22 percent. Sixty percent favored \neither stricter limits or not permitted. A CNN Gallup poll in 2003 \nasked, should parental consent be required for an abortion? Yes, 73 \npercent.\n  Regardless of how we personally feel about this issue, it ought not \nto be on this bill. It is not what we need to be debating now. We need \nto be focused on our men and women in harm's way, providing them with \nthe necessary funding and resources and equipment needed to do their \njob. We don't need to jeopardize this bill in conference or subject it \nto a possible Presidential veto as a result of this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Brownback for his leadership and yield back such time \nas I may have.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Murray has 18 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. I listened to a \ndescription of her amendment by the Senator from Alabama. It did not \nsound like the amendment she described. I want to ask a few questions \nso it is clear.\n  Does this amendment in any respect require the Federal Government to \npay for an abortion?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This amendment does not require the Federal Government \nto pay for an abortion. In fact, it will allow the woman herself to pay \nout of her own personal private funds for an abortion in a military \nhospital overseas.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So under this amendment, women in the U.S. military who \nseek, through their constitutional right, an abortion service would \nhave to pay for it out of their own pocket?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Secondly, there has been a suggestion made that if your \namendment passes, it will require doctors, for example, in medical \nfacilities connected with the armed services, to perform an abortion if \nthey object to performing that procedure under their own conscience; is \nthat correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is not correct. The amendment, as I have offered, \nhas a conscience clause for all doctors overseas.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So if a doctor at a military hospital says, even though \nthis young woman who is in the armed services comes to me for an \nabortion procedure and I object to it on religious and moral grounds--\nthat doctor is not going to be compelled to perform an abortion under \nthis amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is absolutely correct. This amendment does not \ncompel any medical provider to perform an abortion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There has also been a suggestion that in U.S. military \nhospitals around the world, there is no provision for abortion \nservices; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Senator restate the question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that under certain circumstances, \nsuch as rape or incest, at military hospitals around the world today, \nabortions are being performed; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. In all military facilities, \nwomen who are victims of rape or incest do have the opportunity to \nreceive abortions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. That clarifies some \nof the things that have been said. The Federal Government will not be \npaying for the abortion. The woman in the military who seeks it must \npay out of her own pocket. The doctors involved in this procedure will \nnot be compelled to do so if it violates their own morality or their \nown conscience by the Murray amendment. And military hospitals serving \nU.S. personnel around the world today already provide abortions in \nemergency circumstances involving rape or incest.\n  We have to be honest about what the amendment does and does not do. \nThis is what it does. It says to women who have volunteered--and we are \nnow dealing with an All-Volunteer Force--to join the U.S. military and \nto lay their lives on the line, to risk their lives and their future \nfor their country, that they will not be compromised. They will not be \nsurrendering their constitutional right to make a choice to control \ntheir own reproductive freedom.\n  There are some on the other side who say, no, they may have that \nconstitutional right in the United States, but once they have taken the \noath to serve the U.S. Army or Navy, in that situation they have given \nup their constitutional right. Is that what we want to say?\n\n  After going through the Iraqi war where women in uniform were \ncaptured as prisoners of war, put their lives on the line, are we \nsaying to those women and thousands like them that if you join the U.S. \nmilitary you give up your constitutional right? Is that what we are \nsaying to those who we are trying to recruit to join the military? I \nhope not.\n  I hope we are saying that we recognize the reality of service, \nparticularly overseas. A woman finds herself in a difficult \ncircumstance, where she wants to seek, under her constitutional right \nguaranteed by the Supreme Court, the right to terminate a pregnancy in \nthe first, second, and third month. Now in the military she has to go \nask permission of the commanding officer and may be forced into a \nsituation where she has to find a way back to the United States in \norder to protect her own health and make her own decision.\n  This comes down to a fundamental question: Are women serving in the \nU.S. military to be treated as second-class citizens? Those who oppose \nthe Murray amendment say, yes, once you\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nhave said, as a woman, that you will serve in the military, you have \ngiven up your constitutional right to control your own body and your \nown reproductive freedom.\n  That is a terrible thing to say. Frankly, it says that we denigrate \nthe contribution and the heroism of the women who joined the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  What Senator Murray is asking for is perfectly reasonable. A woman in \nthe military at her own expense can go to a military hospital which \nalready provides abortion services as a normal course for victims of \nrape and incest, can go to a doctor who has willingly and voluntarily \nagreed to be part of this counseling and part of this procedure, and \npay out of her own pocket for the procedure to take place. That is not \na special privilege. In fact, it says to that woman, you are just as \nmuch an American citizen as your sister back home.\n  If we go the opposite course, frankly, it sends a very sobering \nmessage to recruiters around America that you have to be honest with \nthe women you are seeking to recruit and tell them that once they take \nthat oath to the United States to serve in the military, they have \ngiven up a constitutional right protected by the laws of the land.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington for her leadership, and I \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes fifty-six seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could engage and ask the Senator from Washington, \nto make sure I am on the same amendment--I have her amendment here. \nWhat I read here is that the amendment does two things: It says:\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``Restriction on Use of \n     Funds.''\n\n  So it strikes those on two words. That is the only thing I have of an \namendment. Am I correct? Is that the actual text of the amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. By striking subsection (b), that section reads: \nRestriction on use of facilities: No medical treatment facility or \nother facility of the Department of Defense may be used to perform an \nabortion except for--the life of the mother will be in danger if the \nfetus was carried to term or in the case in which the pregnancy is the \nresult of an act of rape or incest.\n  That provision will be stricken.\n  That is what I have got of what the amendment is. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will hold a second, I will check and then \nrespond.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will make my full point. We are talking about \noverseas facilities. In actuality, the striking says ``no medical \ntreatment facility or other facility of the Department of Defense. . . \n.'' So you are talking about overseas facilities and domestic \nfacilities. These would be facilities overseas and in the U.S. that \ncould both be used to provide abortion on demand. This is removing this \nrestriction that it would just be in the case of the life of the \nmother, rape, and incest, is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct only in that it would strike the \nlanguage in the bill which would put us back to the previous language \nthat is in the statute today, which I am happy to provide him, which I \naccurately described in my statement.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Maybe the Senator can answer this. This would open up \nboth domestic and overseas facilities because the language as stricken \nsays that no medical treatment facility or other facility of the \nDepartment of Defense may be used--it has no limitation saying this is \njust overseas facilities. It is any DOD facility.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. I remind the Senator that \ndomestically in the service, a woman has the right to receive health \ncare services at a hospital. So where this affects a woman is when they \nare serving overseas and they don't have the same access.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Still, she would have access to DOD facilities in the \nU.S.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, and she would have to pay for it out of her own \nmoney.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I also note the Senator from Illinois talked about \nconscience clause protection, where somebody would not have to provide \nthis. That is not in your amendment. You are talking about the base \nportion of any Department of Defense medical doctor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Under current law, all medical providers in the \nDepartment of Defense have a conscience clause.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you. Your amendment does not have conscience \nclause protection. That is already part of the base if you are a \nmilitary physician, to be able to provide that.\n  I want to hone in on what the amendment is about. It is about opening \nup DOD medical facilities, domestically and internationally--the \nSenator argues there won't be that much demand domestically, but it \nopens it up both ways to provide abortion on demand in the United \nStates to U.S. military personnel and their dependents. So you are \ntalking about a broad array of taxpayer-funded facilities you are \nopening up to provide abortions in Kentucky, Washington, Kansas, or \nwherever.\n  I want to agree with the Senator from Washington that we are talking \nabout the use of the facilities here--taxpayer-funded facilities--that \nprovide abortions and not necessarily the doctor. The doctor may be \nrecruited from outside and paid for privately, but you are using \ntaxpayer-funded facilities to provide abortions. So you can see a \nsituation in this country where you would have a military facility in \nKentucky or in the State of Washington being protested by people who \nare pro-life because their taxpayer-funded facility is being used to \nprovide abortions on demand--not just for the life of the mother, rape, \nand incest.\n\n  Again, I recognize the strong support Senator Murray puts forward for \nthe rights of women, and I applaud that. But we are talking about a \nvery sensitive issue for a number of people when you talk about the use \nof taxpayer dollars to do something they really don't agree with. I \ndon't think it is wise to do that, one. Two, I don't think we should be \ntying up the DOD authorization bill on probably the central most \ndifficult issue of our day for people to really wrestle with. That is \nwhat this amendment would do.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to look at the actual text of \nthe amendment and oppose the Murray amendment.\n  I yield the floor and retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will make a couple of points. Under \ncurrent law, in the case of rape or incest, at a military facility an \nabortion can be performed. No one is protesting that today. I again \nadvise my colleague that a woman who is in this country has this right, \nanyway. Where we are concerned, rightfully, is for women who are \nserving overseas. They don't have a constitutional right today to have \nan abortion.\n  Let me tell you what happens to a woman if she finds herself in \ndifficult circumstances and is serving overseas. She has to go to her \ncommanding officer. Believe me, that is very difficult for a woman to \ndo, go to a commanding officer and describe the circumstances she finds \nherself in, and ask for permission to fly home to have an abortion \nperformed, where it is legal.\n  Mr. President, that is humiliating, but it is also difficult. She \nthen has to wait for a C-17 to be available. Think about this. We have \njust seen the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have to make a \nC-17 available for a woman to fly home. That is ridiculous. They have \nthe medical facilities there already, and the facilities are available. \nSo we are putting the services at risk when we have to fly them home. \nThis is humiliating and she has to ask her commanding officer. A woman \nserving in the country doesn't have to do that. It is difficult and \ncumbersome.\n  This also really jeopardizes a woman's right to privacy because in \norder to go to her commanding officer, she has to disclose her medical \ncondition. We all would think the officer would respect her rights, but \nthat is not always the case. She has to put that question in her head \nwhen she goes to ask them. I don't think it is fair to the\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nwomen overseas when they disclose their medical condition with no \nguarantees that they will be kept confidential. Think of the potential \nof using that against a woman in the service. I think that is something \nnone of us want to place a young woman in the position of having to do.\n  We need to remember a woman is not given any medical relief and she \nis penalized under this policy. She has to wait for a C-17 to be \navailable, fly home, take the time to have the procedure done, and then \nreturn to military service. We are taking her out of service when we \nneed her, and we are causing her a tremendous amount of distress, too.\n  Remember, we are talking about a service that is protected \nconstitutionally for any woman who is here in this country. But these \nare women who have volunteered to serve us overseas in the military.\n\n  Finally, let us not forget what we have done to women today who are \nserving us in the military and fighting for our freedom. We have put \nthem--if they don't want to ask their commanding officer, wait for a C-\n17, and all of the other conditions we put on them--today, they can go \nto a hospital in a foreign country. Well, think of the difficulties of \nthat, where they don't have the same culture, don't speak the same \nlanguage, if a woman has a health care procedure done and the doctor \ncannot tell her what she needs to do in the following 24 hours or weeks \nto make sure she is taking care of herself correctly, and she cannot \nunderstand him because she doesn't understand the language.\n  Why would we do that to a woman serving us overseas? I think we ought \nto go back and put in place a provision in the law that has worked \nbefore that simply gives women who serve us the same constitutional \nright women in this country have today. That is what this amendment is \nabout. That is what this vote is about. I hope our colleagues will vote \nwith us in a few minutes when the vote is called.\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes on the time of the Senator \nfrom Kansas and 8 minutes on the time of the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple comments in \nregard to what Senator Murray has just put forward. She said we are \ntalking about international facilities, but the amendment covers \ninternational and domestic facilities, which we have established here, \nso it would be domestic facilities. It is going to be abortion of all \ntypes. It could be abortion on demand at domestic facilities.\n  If the Murray amendment is adopted, it would be for not just military \npersonnel but also for minors, dependents who would be able to use \nthese same facilities for abortion on demand. The reason I wanted to \nput forward a parental notification amendment is we will have a \nsituation, if the Murray amendment is adopted and the amendment I would \nput forward is not accepted, we will have a situation at military bases \nthroughout the United States of minors of military personnel seeking \nabortions and not notifying their parents and not having to notify \ntheir parents, even though State laws require a different situation.\n  I want to check that point to make sure we would be able to do things \ndifferently on a military base than in State law.\n  The point being we are talking about a massive expansion of the use \nof medical facilities on a very troubling area of the law. There is the \nissue the Senator from Washington raised about how this would actually \nwork. I submit this is working fairly well right now. We are not \nreceiving a huge level of complaints from women in the military saying: \nI want to be able to receive an abortion in any medical facility the \nmilitary has anywhere in the world in cases outside of rape, incest, \nand life of the mother, which are currently provided. This is quite an \nexpansive position on a very tense subject, and it is one that \nthreatens to bring down the whole Department of Defense bill. I urge my \ncolleagues, this is not the time and place for us to do this. It would \nbe inappropriate to do so.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes and 13 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I have 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I also thank the \nSenator from Washington. I think she is doing a great service to the \nwomen of our country in pointing out what the problem is here.\n  I was sitting in my office doing work, and I heard the statement that \nthis is abortion on demand. I thought it might be useful for me to read \ninto the Record one letter I received last year from a woman on this \nvery subject that indicates the difficulty of the circumstances women \ncan find themselves in while living overseas.\n  I am about to read the story of Holly Webb. Holly is the wife of a \nstaff sergeant in the Air Force stationed in Misawa, Japan. I would \nlike you to hear her story:\n\n       My husband was stationed in Misawa, Japan, and I moved over \n     in September 2001 to join him. I was pregnant for the first \n     time. Prior to my arrival in Japan, I felt like something was \n     wrong with my pregnancy, and at 6 weeks I went to the \n     emergency room at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida where \n     we had been stationed.\n       My doctor there told me that everything seemed OK from what \n     they could tell. At 16 weeks, I was in Japan with my husband, \n     and I started bleeding. I would bleed weekly for 5 days and \n     then the bleeding would subside. I went to the military \n     hospital at Misawa and they told me I had a placenta previa \n     and that this was a normal side effect and they sent me home.\n\n  Just so everybody knows, placenta previa is a serious problem some \nwomen confront which can impact their pregnancy. It can cause severe \nproblems for the woman including hemorrhaging both during delivery and \npost-partum.\n  Continuing the letter:\n\n       At 20 weeks, I started bleeding heavily, and I went back to \n     the hospital. I thought that my water had broken but the \n     hospital told me it was not an emergency and kept me \n     overnight. My OB/GYN did not visit me until the next morning. \n     They told me that the results of my triple screen blood test \n     showed possible spina bifida which necessitated an \n     ultrasound. When they did the ultrasound, they discovered, as \n     I had thought, that there was no amniotic fluid surrounding \n     the fetus. They were unable to detect whether or not the \n     fetus had spina bifida.\n       For the next day, I was administered IV fluids, and my \n     doctor mentioned that I might be dehydrated. My cervix \n     remained closed, however, and they told me there was still a \n     fetal heartbeat. I was told I might deliver spontaneously \n     within weeks or months, but if the baby survived, it would \n     have serious health complications due to the fact I was at \n     risk for infection as well and because there was no amniotic \n     fluid surrounding the baby.\n       When I asked the hospital what my options were, they told \n     me they could not induce labor or dilate my cervix to deliver \n     because it would be considered an abortion, but that I was at \n     risk for infection. My doctor told me that in order to have \n     an abortion, they would have to have my situation reviewed by \n     a medical board and that she didn't know how long this would \n     take. She told me that during her 7 or 8 years of practice in \n     a military hospital, no matter what the situation was, a \n     woman's request for an abortion was always denied.\n       My doctor told me the only way I could receive additional \n     medical treatment was if I became ill. I was told to go home \n     and monitor my temperature and to return when I had a \n     fever or was in pain. I asked if there was any other \n     option because I was worried about dying.\n       At that point, I felt like my choices were either to go \n     home and wait for a life-threatening infection so that my \n     labor could be induced or go to an outside hospital where I \n     didn't speak the language and could not be sure that the \n     treatment would be safe.\n       When I got to the private Japanese hospital, the doctor \n     told me there was a serious risk for infection and that he \n     needed to put me on antibiotics immediately. If I didn't get \n     antibiotics through IV immediately, I would die. I contacted \n     my grandmother in the United States who wired me $2,000 to \n     pay for the hospital visit.\n       I checked into the hospital about 4 hours later. They \n     dilated my cervix over a period of 2\\1/2\\ days and induced \n     labor. I delivered a stillborn baby. The military hospital \n     told me that this was an elected abortion and not a stillborn \n     birth.\n       I am now 17 weeks pregnant again, and my only option is to \n     use the military hospital\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\n     for my OB/GYN treatment. I have begged them to let me off the \n     base to go to a private doctor because of my experience last \n     year. I believe that my pregnancy puts my health at risk. I \n     would again be prevented from making decisions I need to \n     about my pregnancy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Let me just make a point.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the Senator such time as she needs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is just one example of what a \nwomen living abroad might go through. We can think of all kinds of \nother situations in foreign countries that might necessitate the \ntermination of a pregnancy. Many of these women are living in countries \nthat don't have good health care systems in place, skilled providers, \nor access to safe or clean hospitals.\n  This ban is a huge mistake. It is in fact a double standard. I do not \nknow of a health situation a man could encounter that would be dealt \nwith at a military hospital in quite the same manner. Nor do I know of \na health situation a man could encounter that a military hospital would \nnot treat.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her amendment and for her \nleadership on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support the Murray-Snowe amendment. I \ncomment Senator Murray for her strong and unflagging leadership on this \nissue, and am pleased to once again join with her on the critical \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization. I am pleased to \njoin my colleague in support of this amendment to repeal the ban on \nabortions at overseas military hospitals, an amendment whose time has \nlong since come.\n  Year after year, time after time, debate after debate, we revisit the \nissue of women's reproductive freedoms by seeking to restrict, limit, \nand eliminate a woman's right to choose. While at times we are able to \ntake one step forward we end up taking two steps back. Last year we \nwere able to garner a majority of the Senate only to have this language \nremoved in conference. I believe that ultimately, we will prevail, that \nmy colleagues on both sides of the Capitol will realize that this is a \npolicy change that makes sense, and I hope that will occur on this \nreauthorization.\n  When we last considered this amendment, almost 11 months ago to the \nday, we had more than 378,000 troops stationed overseas, today we have \nover 10,000 more. Of those more than 35,000 of these troops were women \nas of April 2002 and women make up almost 36,500 of the troops today. \nWe recognize the impact that the failure to repeal this ban has on so \nmany of these women.\n  Since last year's reauthorization debate, the Commander-in-Chief has \ncalled our Nation's military into action on another front. As we \nwatched the 24 hour news stations' broadcasting reports from their \nembedded reporters, we saw more female faces amongst the troops than \never before. We are considering this Defense authorization during a \ntime of war when Americans, both civilian and military, are fighting \nterrorism and tyranny all across the globe, both men and women. These \nwomen, these soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines, deserve access to \nthe same health services that women here in the States have.\n  As I think about this last conflict, it occurs to me how ironic it is \nthat the very people who are fighting to preserve our freedoms, those \nwho are on the front lines defending this war on terrorism or other \nparts of the globe, are supporting those who are fighting, are \ncurrently the least protected in terms of the right to make choices \nabout their own personal health and reproductive decisions.\n  ``That is why I stand to join my colleague, Senator Murray, once \nagain in overturning this ban on privately funded abortion services in \noverseas military hospitals, for military women and dependents based \noverseas, which was reinstated in the fiscal year 1996 authorization \nbill, as we all know. It is a ban without merit or reason that put the \nreproductive health of these women at risk.\n  Specifically, as we know, the ban denies the right to choose for \nfemale military personnel and dependents. It effectively denies those \nwomen who have voluntarily decided to serve our country in the armed \nservices safe and legal medical care simply because they were assigned \nduty in another country. It makes me wonder why Congress would, year \nafter year, continue to leave these women who so bravely serve our \ncountry overseas with no choice by denying them the rights that are \nguaranteed to all Americans under the Constitution?\n  Our task in this debate is to make sure that all of America's women, \nincluding those who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces and military \ndependents, are guaranteed the fundamental right to choose. Our task is \nnot to pay for abortions with Federal funding--contrary to what our \nopponents may claim, after all, since 1979 the Federal law has \nprohibited the use of Federal funds to perform abortions at military \nhospitals. This amendment would not change that. However, what it would \ndo is reinstate the policy that was in place from 1979 to 1988, when \nwomen could use their own personal funds to pay for the medical care \nthey need.\n\n  In 1988, the Reagan administration announced a new policy prohibiting \nthe performance of any abortions at military hospitals even if it was \npaid for out of a woman's private funds--a policy which truly defies \nlogic.\n  President Clinton lifted the ban in January 1993, by Executive order, \nrestoring a woman's right to pay for abortion services with private, \nnon-Defense Department funds. Just when we had thought that logic would \nprevail, in 1995, through the very bill we authorize today, the House \nInternational Security Committee reinstated this ban which was then \nretained in the conference. And here we are 8 years later trying to \nundo this unnecessary threat to our female servicewomen.\n  Let me take a moment to reiterate a very important point. President \nClinton's Executive order did not change existing law prohibiting the \nuse of Federal funds for abortion, and it did not require medical \nproviders to perform those abortions. In fact, all three branches of \nthe military have conscience clauses which permit medical personnel \nwith moral, religious, or ethical objections to abortion not to \nparticipate in the procedure. I believe that is a reasonable measure \nand one I do not take issue with.\n  Opponents of this amendment argue that changing current law means \nthat military personnel and military facilities are charged with \nperforming abortions, and that this, in turn, means that American \ntaxpayer funds will be used to subsidize abortions. This is a wholly \nand fundamentally incorrect. Every person who has ever been in a \nhospital for any type of procedure knows full well that the hospital \nand the physician is able to account for every charge, the cost of \nevery minute, every physician, every nurse, each aspirin, the supplies, \nthe materials, the overheads, the insurance, anything that is part of \nthe procedure. Under this amendment, every expense is included in the \ncost that is paid by private funds. Public funds are not used for the \nperformance of abortions in this instance. That is an important \ndistinction to reinforce today. I know it is easy to confuse the \ndebate, to obfuscate the issues. What we are talking about here is \nrestricting how a woman using her own private insurance or money in \nsupport of that procedure. We are not talking about using Federal \nfunds.\n  This amendment we are fighting for is to lift the ban on privately \nfunded abortions paid for with a woman's private funds. That is what \nthis issue is all about. Proponents of this amendment believe that a \nwoman would have the ability to have access to a constitutional right \nwhen it comes to her reproductive freedom to use her own funds, her own \nhealth insurance, for access to this procedure.\n  Congress works hard at times of war, and at times of peace, to \nsupport our American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, as well as \ntheir dependents, our armed services and our armed forces have no \nbetter friend and ally than the Congress. I would argue that is the \ncase in most situations, but obviously there is a different standard \nwhen it comes to the health of a woman and her reproductive decisions.\n  This is especially confounding when we all completely agree that our \nmilitary members and their families have\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\nsacrificed a lot, including their lives, for the sake of our Nation and \nwhat we believe. For those women overseas we are asking them to \npotentially, and unnecessarily, sacrifice their health under this ban. \nMaking this type of decision is perhaps the most fundamental, personal, \nand difficult decision a woman can face. It is a very personal \ndecision. It is a decision that should be made between a woman, her \ndoctor, her family. It is a constitutional right. It is a \nconstitutional right that should extend to women in the military \noverseas, not just within the boundaries of the United States.\n\n  I think it is regrettable that somehow we have demeaned women, in \nterms of this very difficult decision that they have to make. There has \nbeen example upon example given to us, to my colleague Senator Murray, \nabout the trying circumstances that this prohibition has placed on \nwomen who serve in the military abroad. I do not think for one moment \nanybody should minimize or underestimate the emotional, physical \nhardship that this ban has imposed, a ban that prohibits a woman from \nusing her own private health insurance, her own private funds to make \nher own constitutional decision when she happens to be in the military \nserving abroad.\n  The ban on abortions in military hospitals coerce the women who serve \nour country into making decisions and choices they would not otherwise \nmake. As one doctor, a physician from Oregon, recalls his days as a \nNavy doctor stationed in the Philippines, he describes the experiences \nand hardships that result unnecessarily from this policy. Women have to \ntravel long distances in order to obtain a legal abortion--not \nnecessarily a safe abortion, but a legal one. Travel arrangements that \nare difficult and expensive. Not to mention the fact that in order to \ntake leave, they had to justify taking emergency leave to their \ncommanding officer. Imagine that circumstance. Forcing women to make a \nvery personal decision so well known.\n  However, for those women who choose to find an alternative, their \nonly option is to turn to local, illegal abortions. In other \ncircumstances, their dignity was offended and often their health was \nplaced at risk, which was certainly reinforced by the letter that was \nsent to both Senator Murray and from now retired, Lt. Gen. Kennedy, the \nhighest ranking woman in the military. She speaks with great \nperspective about the humiliation and the demeaning circumstances in \nwhich many women were placed, not to mention putting their health at \nrisk.\n  I hope we can overturn this prohibition in law and grant women in the \nmilitary the same constitutional right that is afforded women who live \nwithin the boundaries of the United States of America. No one should \nleave their constitutional rights at the proverbial door, but that is \nwhat this ban has done. Our constitutional rights are not territorial \nand women who serve their country should be afforded the same rights \nthat women here in America have. I think this ban is not consistent \nwith the principles which our Armed Forces are fighting to protect, and \nwhich the American people so overwhelmingly support. I hope we move \nforward, and I hope we would understand that women in the military and \ntheir dependents overseas deserve the same rights that women have here \nin this country. They have and should have the protections of the \nConstitution, no matter where they live.\n  I hope the Senate will overturn that ban and will support the \namendment offered by Senator Murray and myself.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Snowe to the Department of \nDefense reauthorization bill to repeal the ban on privately funded \nabortions sought by U.S. servicewomen, spouses, and dependents in \nmilitary hospitals overseas.\n  The Supreme Court acknowledges a woman's right to choose as a \nconstitutionally protected freedom. That right is not suspended simply \nbecause a woman serves in the U.S. military or is married to a U.S. \nservice member and living overseas.\n  Women based in the United States and using a U.S.-based military \nfacility are not prohibited from using their own funds to pay for an \nabortion. Having a prohibition on the use of U.S. military facilities \noverseas creates a double standard, and discriminates against women \nservice members stationed overseas.\n  Banning privately funded abortions on military bases endangers a \nwoman's health. Service members and their dependents rely on their \nmilitary base hospitals for medical care. Private facilities may not be \nreadily available in other countries.\n  For example, abortion is illegal in the Philippines. A woman \nstationed in that country or the spouse of a service member would need \nto fly to the U.S. or to another country--at her own expense--to obtain \nan abortion. We don't pay our service members enough to assume they can \nsimply jet off to Switzerland for medical treatment.\n  If women do not have access to military facilities or to private \nfacilities in the country they are stationed, they could endanger their \nown health by the delay involved in getting to a facility or by being \nforced to seek an abortion by someone other than a licensed physician.\n  We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion \nis illegal, desperate women are often forced into unsafe and life-\nthreatening situations. If it were your wife, or your daughter, would \nyou want her in the hands of an untrained abortionist on the back \nstreets of Manila or Argentina? Or would you prefer that she have \naccess to medical treatment by a trained physician in a U.S. military \nfacility?\n  Not only would these women be risking their health and lives under \nnormal conditions, but what if these women are facing complicated or \nlife-threatening pregnancies and are unaware of the seriousness of \ntheir condition?\n  The ban on privately funded abortions on military bases overseas \naffects more than 100,000 active service members, spouses, and \ndependents of military personnel.\n  One such woman this ban impacts is Holly Webb.\n  Holly Webb is the wife of a staff sergeant in the Air Force stationed \nin Misawa, Japan. She tells the following story of her struggle to find \nadequate reproductive health care overseas:\n\n       My husband was stationed in Misawa Japan, and I moved over \n     in September 2001 to join him. I was pregnant for the first \n     time. Prior to my arrival in Japan, I felt like something was \n     wrong with my pregnancy and at 6 weeks I went to the \n     emergency room at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida where \n     we had been stationed.\n       My doctor there told me that everything seemed OK from what \n     they could tell. At 16 weeks I was in Japan with my \n     husband and I started bleeding. I would bleed weekly for 5 \n     days and then the bleeding would subside. I went to the \n     military hospital at Misawa and they told me I had \n     placenta previa and that this was a normal side effect and \n     they sent me home.\n       At 20 weeks, I started bleeding heavily and went back to \n     the hospital. I thought that my water had broken but the \n     hospital told me that it was not an emergency and kept me \n     overnight. My ob/gyn did not visit me until the next morning. \n     They told me that the results of my triple screen blood test \n     showed possible spina bifida which necessitated an \n     ultrasound. When they did the ultrasound they discovered, as \n     I had thought, that there was no amniotic fluid surrounding \n     the fetus.\n       They were unable to detect whether or not the fetus had \n     spina bifida. For the next day I was administered IV fluids \n     and my doctor mentioned that I might be dehydrated. My cervix \n     remained closed, however, and they told me that there was \n     still a fetal heartbeat. I was told that I might deliver \n     spontaneously within weeks or months, but that if the baby \n     survived, it would have serious health complications due to \n     the fact that I was at risk for infection as well as because \n     there was no amniotic fluid surrounding the baby.\n       When I asked the hospital what my options were they told me \n     that they could not induce labor or dilate my cervix to \n     deliver because it would be considered an abortion but that I \n     was at risk for infection. My doctor told me that in order to \n     have an abortion, they would have to have my situation \n     reviewed by a medical board and that she didn't know how long \n     this would take.\n       She told me that during her 7 or 8 years of practice in a \n     military hospital, no matter what the situation was, a \n     woman's request for an abortion was always denied.\n       My doctor told me that the only way I could receive \n     additional medical treatment was if I became ill. I was told \n     to go home and monitor my temperature and to return when I \n     had a fever or was in pain. I asked if there was any other \n     option because I was worried about dying.\n       At that point, I felt like my choices were either to go \n     home and wait for a life-threatening infection so that my \n     labor could be induced, or to go to an outside hospital, \n     where I didn't speak the language and could not be sure that \n     the treatment would be safe.\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\n       When I got to the private Japanese hospital, the doctor \n     told me that there was serious risk for infection, and that \n     he needed to put me on antibiotics immediately and that if I \n     did not get antibiotics through IV immediately I would very \n     likely die. I contacted my grandmother in the U.S. who wired \n     me $2,000 to pay for the hospital visit.\n       I checked into the hospital about 4 hours later. They \n     dilated my cervix over a period of 2\\1/2\\ days, then induced \n     labor. I delivered a stillborn baby. The military hospital \n     told me that this was an elected abortion and not a stillborn \n     birth.\n       I am now 17 weeks pregnant again and my only option is to \n     use the military hospital for my ob/gyn treatment. I have \n     begged them to let me off the base to go to a private doctor \n     because of my experience last year. I believe that if my \n     pregnancy puts my health at risk, I would again be prevented \n     from making the decisions I need to about my pregnancy.\n\n  I hope that we have learned something from Mrs. Webb's story. No \nwoman should have to go through the obstacles Mrs. Webb faced. If Mrs. \nWebb had been living in the U.S. she would have had a choice. She could \nhave gotten an abortion and avoided the emotional trauma associated \nwith giving birth to a stillborn, and not had to put her own life at \nrisk.\n  Current law does not force any military physician to perform an \nabortion against his or her will. All branches have a conscience clause \nthat permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the procedure. \nA doctor can simply say, ``I won't perform such a procedure.'' And then \nthat woman must just find another doctor.\n  What we are talking about today is providing equal access to military \nmedical facilities, wherever they are located, for a legal procedure \npaid for with one's own money.\n  Abortion is legal for American women. These women would pay for the \nservice with their own funds. This amendment does not involve the use \nof federal funding.\n  We ask these service members to risk their lives in the service of \ntheir country but we are not willing to grant them access to the same \nservices they would receive if they were stationed in the U.S. This is \nespecially troubling since September 11 since more Americans have \ndecided to serve their country.\n  Service members and their dependents must have access to safe, legal, \nand comprehensive reproductive health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask unanimous \nconsent that my statement appear in the Record.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her effort \nto repeal the unfair ban on privately-funded abortions at overseas U.S. \nmilitary facilities. This amendment rights a serious wrong in our \npolicy, and guarantees that women serving overseas in the armed forces \nare able to exercise their constitutional right to choose.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness for the many women who make \ndaily sacrifices to serve our Nation. It is wrong to deny them the same \nmedical care available in the United States. Women serving overseas \nshould be able to depend on military base hospitals for their medical \nneeds. They should not be forced to choose between lower quality care \nin a foreign country, or returning to the United States for the care \nthey need. Congress has a responsibility to provide the best possible \nmedical care for those serving our country at home and abroad.\n  Such care is essential. Our dedicated servicewomen should not be \nunfairly exposed to risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even \ndeath, when appropriate care can easily be made available to them. \nServicewomen overseas deserve the same access to all medical services \nas their counterparts at home.\n  This amendment will also ease the heavy financial burden on \nservicewomen who make the difficult decision to have an abortion. The \ncost of returning to the United States from far-off bases in other \nparts of the world often imposes significant financial hardship on \nwomen. Those serving in the United States do not have the same burden, \nsince nonmilitary hospital facilities are readily available. It is \nunfair to ask women serving abroad to suffer this financial penalty.\n  If the cost of a separate trip to return to the United States is too \nhigh, servicewomen may face significant delay before military \ntransportation is available. Each week, the health risks faced by these \nwomen become increasingly serious. Long delays in obtaining a military \nflight can force women to rely on questionable medical facilities \noverseas. As a practical matter, they are being denied their \nconstitutionally-protected right to choose.\n  A woman's decision to have an abortion is very difficult and \nextremely personal. It is wrong to impose this heavy additional burden \non women who serve our country overseas.\n  Every woman in the United States has a constitutionally-guaranteed \nright to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. It is long \npast time for Congress to stop denying this right to women serving \nabroad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I think perhaps we are ready to proceed \nwith a vote on the bill. I do not know if the Senator from Washington \nis ready to yield back her remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back her remaining \ntime?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 1 minute 38 \nseconds, and the Senator from Kansas has 3 minutes 9 seconds and \ncounting.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am prepared to yield back my time. The issue has \nbeen well debated. People know the issue. It has been voted on before. \nI hope we can proceed with the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from California has given a \nvery clear reason to vote for this amendment. We have heard no \ndisagreement that this current policy toward women service members is \nnot humiliating. We have heard no disagreement that it is not a threat \nto privacy, and it is punitive. What this issue is about is whether \nwomen in the service overseas have the same constitutional rights, \nprotections, and safety in their health care as those women who are in \nthis country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington yields back time.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 691.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: At this point the \nbill is open to further amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Presiding Officer advise the Senate with regard \nto the order that currently controls the next amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a limited list of amendments offered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Presiding Officer recite those amendments in \ntheir standing order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A package of amendments has been cleared by \nboth managers: A Boxer amendment on contracting subject to a relevant \nsecond degree, a Domenici amendment on border security, a Kerry \namendment on air travel, a Landrieu amendment, and a Grassley amendment \non the industrial enterprise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, therefore, it would be in order at this \ntime for any of those amendments to be taken up by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished managers of \nthe bill to allow a very brief colloquy and a unanimous consent request \nby the Senators from Massachusetts and New York, and maybe a couple of \nothers, we would take no more than 2 minutes for the Senator from \nMassachusetts and 3 minutes for the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 923\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent to \nprovide help for 3.2 million Americans who are out of work and need \nCongress to extend unemployment insurance. Soon the checks will no \nlonger be in the mail for millions of Americans and New Yorkers who \ndepend on unemployment benefits to provide for their families at this \ntime.\n  In New York alone, over 100,000 people have exhausted their \nunemployment insurance benefits and are still without a job. Starting \non May 31, unless we act, more than 80,000 Americans will begin \nexhausting their unemployment every single week.\n  These Americans and New Yorkers need and deserve our action. We knew \nwe had to take steps at the beginning of this year to extend \nunemployment compensation. We need to do it again.\n  I hope none of us will turn our back on these hard-working, \nstruggling Americans--people who have mortgages to pay, people who have \ncar payments to make, people who have children to raise.\n  In April 2000, there were 176,000 long-term unemployed parents. Last \nmonth, there were 607,000 long-term unemployed parents, an increase of \n245 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 923, a bill to provide a 6-month extension \nof unemployment compensation, including 13 weeks of benefits for the \nlong-term unemployed--exhaustees--and that the Senate then proceed with \nits immediate consideration; that an amendment at the desk to remove \nthe ``Temporary Enhanced Regular Unemployment Compensation'' provisions \nbe considered and agreed to; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1079, Senator Murkowski's bill to extend the \nTemporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, provided that \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration, the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does this \ninclude the workers who have contributed into the fund and whose \nbenefits have expired? It has been standard and it has been used in the \nSenate and supported by the Senate five different times during the \n1990s. Does this include those workers?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call upon the proponent of the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, if we can't get an answer \nto that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are about to get an answer, I advise the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am sorry.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts to \nrepeat the question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does this include the more than 1 million workers whose \nunemployment benefits have expired and who otherwise would be eligible \nto receive unemployment compensation under the proposals that have been \noffered here by the Senator from New York and our own proposal, and \nthat were also included in the proposal that was passed in a bipartisan \nway on five different occasions during the 1990s? Does this amendment \ninclude those individuals?\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may respond, my bill is a clean 6-\nmonth extension of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act \nof 2002.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, further holding the right to object, does \nit include any ability to give flexibility to the States so that they \ncan take care of part-time workers as included in the Democratic \nproposal? Does it include those provisions as well?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I repeat that this is a clean 6-month extension of the \nTemporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a very clear reason the request \nof the Senator from New York and the request I will make should be \nrespected on the floor of the Senate. We are facing a crisis with 8 to \n9 million Americans unemployed. More than 1.5 million of those have \nseen their unemployment compensation expire. Starting next week, 80,000 \nworkers are going to lose their unemployment compensation.\n  This is an issue about fairness. On the one hand, we have an \nopportunity to return to these workers what they have paid over a \nlifetime of work, in many instances, into a trust fund that is in \nexcess of $20 billion, and the reason it is in surplus is that these \nworkers have paid into it. Now they are entitled to get that money out.\n  We have had objection to the request of the Senator from New York.\n  I am going to give the Senate one more opportunity to see whether \nthey are going to be responsive, whether this body is going to \nunderstand the issue of fairness. Tomorrow we are going to pass \nbillions of dollars for the wealthiest individuals in this country. We \nare trying to look out after hard-working Americans.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by \nthe majority leader, following consultation with the Democratic leader, \nthe Senate consider S. 1079, extension of the unemployment \ncompensation, considered under the following limitations: General \ndebate of an hour equally divided, with only one amendment in order, \nthe amendment by Senator Kennedy, on which there be an hour of debate \nequally divided, and no other amendments be in order, and any points of \norder be considered waived by this agreement; that upon the disposition \nof the amendment and the use and yielding back of all time, the Senate \nvote on passage of the bill, without further intervening action or \ndebate, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object.\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n  Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Alaska for trying to \npass a clean, simple extension. This is the same language Senator \nClinton and I passed last January. It is the same language Senator \nFitzgerald passed with us, I believe January 7 or 8. It is the same \nlanguage we passed a couple of times for a clean extension. It is not a \ndoubling of the program. It is not taking a 13-week Federal program and \nturning it into a 26-week program. It is not expanding the definition \nof uninsured or unemployed to include part-time workers, or to include \na whole variety of people who, frankly, the States don't now cover.\n  I will tell my colleagues that we are not going to double the \nprogram. We are not going to triple the program. The Senator from \nAlaska offered to extend the current program which we have been using \nfor the last 2 or so years. That is the proposal she will make today \nand, I would expect, the proposal she will make tomorrow. That is the \nonly proposal, in my opinion, that will pass.\n  People want to try to make political statements. We had a vote on it \nin the budget.\n  I will not yield.\n  We had a vote on it in the budget. It didn't pass. We had a vote on \nit last week on the tax bill. It didn't pass. Some people want to \ndouble or triple this program. It is not going to work.\n  The Senator from Alaska says she is trying to extend the program so \npeople won't lose their benefits beginning next month. A clean \nextension of the Federal program of 13 weeks can pass, or rather may \npass. But colleagues who want to continue to double or triple the \nprogram jeopardize helping the very people they say they want to help.\n  I compliment my colleague from Alaska. I hope our colleagues will \ngive fair consideration and ultimately agree to a simple extension of \nthe program for 6 months, as proposed by our colleague from Alaska.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Republican leader: Why don't we \nthen just have the two different alternatives placed before the Senate \nand let the Senate express itself on whether it favors our proposal or \nfavors the Republican proposal?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these proposals \nbe laid before the Senate and, at a time suitable to the majority and \nminority leaders, we have a 10-minute, evenly divided, discussion, and \nwe let the Senate vote on whether it prefers the proposal of the \nSenator from Alaska or the proposal of the Senators from New York and \nMassachusetts.\n  I think that is a fair way to proceed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will not yield.\n  We talk about fairness. Our proposal is basically a similar proposal \nto what was passed five times, and which the Senator from Oklahoma \nsupported in the 1990s. Why don't we give the Senate a chance to vote \non either one of them? That would be fairest to the workers in this \ncountry.\n  If you are able, then, to persuade Members to vote for yours, so be \nit; we will accept it. And if they vote for ours, we would hope you \nwould accept it. That is what I think is fair.\n  I ask whether the Senator from New York would think that is fair?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes. I think the Senator from Massachusetts--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TALENT). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nmaking a unanimous consent request.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts retains the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think this is a pretty clear indication \nabout where our Republican friends are on this issue. They are denying \nus--or denying the Senate--in the final hours prior to the expiration \nof coverage for workers--denying us an opportunity to get a vote in the \nSenate.\n  Basically, they say: Either take ours or leave it--take ours or leave \nit--and that is being unfair to workers, particularly at a time when \nthe Republican Party is about to recommend tax breaks of billions of \ndollars for the wealthiest individuals in this country, and they refuse \nto give fairness to workers in this country.\n  That is what is going on here. Workers in this country understand \nwhat is happening here in the Senate. It is a clear indication of the \npriorities: Just open up the Federal Treasury. Give the wealthiest the \nhighest amount of tax breaks and give short shrift to hard-working \nAmericans.\n  The Republican leader refuses to permit the Senate of the United \nStates, in a time set by our leaders, to make a judgment on which they \nwould prefer. The workers in the United States are clearly getting \nshort-shrifted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, to make sure we make the record straight, my very good \nfriend from the great State of Massachusetts has mentioned: Let people \nhave a vote.\n  Well, we have not had one vote--we have had three votes this year. We \nhad a vote on the appropriations bill earlier this year. We had a vote \non the budget. We had a vote on the tax bill.\n  They did not win. They tried to double the program two or three \ntimes, unsuccessfully, and so they are now trying again.\n  Frankly, we have a DOD authorization bill, we have a tax/economic \ngrowth package, we have a debt limit extension, and we need to pass UI. \nWe have a lot of work to do in the next few hours.\n\n  Some of us--let me rephrase that--this Senator is going to do what I \ncan to make sure we are not going to double or triple this program. We \nhave already had three votes on the proposal to double it. We are not \ngoing to do that. I don't know how many votes people think they need. \nThey may think they are winning on the votes, but they are not winning \non the issue. I think we may have consent to pass a clean extension. It \ntakes unanimous consent. I tell my colleagues on the other side, who \nare playing this game, this will not work legislatively. And it may \njeopardize a clean extension.\n  So I would be very cautious, especially when you get late in the \ngame, and close before a break, and people want to go home, I would not \ntake for granted that you can pass a clean extension--but I compliment \nmy colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, for trying to do so. I \nbelieve we can do so.\n  We have had three votes already, and it did not win. It will not win \non the fourth vote. So I urge my colleagues: The way to do this is \nlet's pass a clean extension, the same extension that my colleague from \nNew York and I passed one or two times on the floor of the Senate. \nLet's do that again, and let's help the people who need the help.\n  If people play other games, they jeopardize even a clean extension. I \nthink people should be on notice of that not everybody might want a \nclean extension. So the effort to double the program may mean that some \npeople will get zero. Instead of getting 13 weeks, they might get zero \nbecause of this effort to double the program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wanted to ask my friend from Oklahoma \nto yield to me, but he yielded the floor.\n  The dilemma, of course, is one that is very difficult for us to \nconfront. I appreciate greatly the wonderful cooperation that I \nreceived in working out the extension of unemployment compensation for \nthose who needed to complete their 13 weeks who were unemployed, and \nfor those who were going onto unemployment for the first time.\n  Our problem is--and this is where I think the nub of our difference \nis--we have this growing number of literally millions of people who \nhave exhausted their benefits and are looking for work and cannot find \nit.\n  I understand and I respect the argument from the other side, although \nI disagree that the tax package that is about to be passed today or \ntomorrow is going to generate jobs and economic growth. I do not think \nit will. I think it will, in fact, make our economic situation worse \nand continue to put people out of work. But we will get a chance to \nfind out who is right about that.\n  But, unfortunately, there are a lot of innocent people caught in the \nmiddle\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nof this debate, people who are not sitting here on the floor of the \nSenate, people who are not going to get a big tax break, people who are \nout of work and cannot find a job in this economy.\n  At some point we have to take responsibility for these people. I \nappreciate the author on the other side. And I appreciate the good work \nof the Senator from Alaska to have a straight extension, but we did not \nhave a vote on that specifically. We had votes attached to other \nitems--appropriations, tax cuts, et cetera. At some point, we are going \nto have to face the reality that this economy is losing private sector \njobs at the fastest rate in our history. At some point, we have to take \nresponsibility for these people.\n  We reformed welfare, which I supported. We said to people, go out and \nget a job; support yourself and your children because we expected that \nwe would have a good economy, because we would have good, sensible, \nresponsible, fiscally sound policies at the Federal level that would, \nhand in hand, help the private sector create those jobs. That is not \nhappening, for a lot of reasons. The economy continues to get worse. We \nhave lost half a million jobs in the last 3 months alone.\n  So I simply ask my friends, my colleagues on the other side: If not \nnow, when? When do we take responsibility, as previous \nadministrations--Republican and Democrat--previous Congresses--\nRepublican and Democrat--did in previous recessions? At some point, we \ncannot any longer pretend that the economy is going to generate the \njobs that all of those unemployed people who have no means of support \nare desperate to have.\n  So I hope we will get to that point sooner than later because I have \nthousands and thousands of these people--some of whom have been out of \nwork since 9/11, 2001--and I believe we should help them. And it is \ngood for the economy. We ought to take that action as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRAPO). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be recognized in order to \noffer her amendment regarding contracting. I further ask that \nimmediately following the reporting by the clerk, the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment \nregarding the same subject; provided further that there be 30 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Boxer and 15 minutes under the control of \nSenator Warner. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndebate time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Warner \namendment, to be immediately followed by a vote in relation to the \nBoxer amendment, with no amendments in order to either amendment prior \nto the votes.\n  Before the Chair rules, I think we can make the second vote a 10-\nminute vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have no \nobjection. I think that would be appropriate. I also ask that there be \nrecorded votes on both the Boxer and Warner amendments; further, that \nbetween the two votes, there be 5 minutes equally divided under the \ncontrol of Senator Boxer and Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays on the two votes, both the \nWarner amendment and the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order at this time \nto simply order the yeas and nays on the two amendments, which will be \ndone if there is no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair repeat that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order at this time \nto request the yeas and nays on the amendments despite the fact neither \nhas been offered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I request the yeas and nays on the Warner amendment and \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 825\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid and Senator Warner \nfor working out this arrangement whereby we can have a definite vote on \ntwo alternatives that deal with, in my opinion, competitive bidding--\nthat is what we are talking about--in the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  I send my amendment to the desk, and I ask that the amendment be \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 825:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) On March 8, 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded a \n     sole-source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract \n     for the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry.\n       (2) The Department of Defense has characterized this \n     contract as a short-term ``bridge'' contract that will be \n     used for an interim period until a contract can be awarded on \n     a competitive basis.\n       (3) However, the estimated date of completion for this \n     contract is March 2005 and the value is estimated by the \n     Department of Defense to be $57 billion.\n       (4) The Department of Defense has established a goal of \n     completing the follow-on competition and having a fully \n     competitive contract in place by August 31, 2003. This goal \n     was stated in a letter dated May 2, 2003.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The taxpayers deserve fairness.\n       (2) Businesses deserve fairness.\n       (3) The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 establishes \n     a preference for the award of competitive contracts.\n       (4) The Department of Defense should meet its goal of \n     having a fully competitive contract in place by August 31, \n     2003 and performing work needed for the reconstruction of the \n     Iraqi oil industry after such date under that competitive \n     contract.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--If the Department of Defense fails \n     to meet its own stated goal of having a fully competitive \n     contract in place by August 31, 2003, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit a report to Congress by September 30, \n     2003, detailing the reasons for allowing this sole source \n     contract to continue.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at this time, does my friend want to bring \nhis second-degree amendment to the desk or, rather, his substitute?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 826\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment which is \nin the first degree to protect the Senator from California, unless she \nwould like to have it as a second-degree amendment. We can do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I prefer to have it as a first-degree amendment. It will \nbe much better, and I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 826.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPETITIVE AWARD OF \n                   CONTRACTS FOR IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Department of \n     Defense should fully comply with the Competition in \n     Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. 2304 et seq.) for any contract \n     awarded for reconstruction activities in Iraq and should \n     conduct a full and open competition for performing work \n     needed for the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry as \n     soon as practicable.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will later advise the Senate with regard \nto the content of this amendment. For the moment, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the spirit of my amendment is very clear. \nI am very resolute about it. I appreciate the fact we are going to have \na vote on the Warner first-degree amendment and the Boxer amendment.\n  All the years I was in the House of Representatives, part of the time \nI\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nserved on the Armed Services Committee. I am pleased to see my friend \nfrom Illinois here because together during the years I served on the \nArmed Services Committee, we took on the issue of procurement reform. I \nam very pleased to say that as a result of the work that many of us \ndid, we were able to--and it was Berkley Bedell, if my colleague \nremembers; there were a number of us--we were able to make sure there \nwas competition at the Pentagon.\n  Competition is the name of the game. It is supposed to be the name of \nthe game in America. When I see any agency turning away from \ncompetitive bidding, unless there is a good reason to do so--and I \nmight say, if it is an emergency, this is a good reason, but beyond \nthat, there is no reason to award a contract without going to bid, \nwithout considering competitive bids.\n  What happens--and I feel really deeply about this--when the taxpayers \nof this country and the businesses of this country that are playing by \nthe rules see such a contract given to one special company, it is very \nbad, in my opinion, for our country. It is very bad for our fighting \nmen and women who risk their life and limb.\n  Let me tell you what I mean. As a result of a sole-source contract \nthat was given to a subsidiary of Halliburton, these are some of the \nheadlines that appeared across the country. I will let my colleagues \njudge, and I will let the people judge whether these kinds of headlines \nare good for our country and good for the morale of our troops.\n  Here is one from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\n       Secret Halliburton deal endangers U.S. credibility.\n\nThat is May 8, 2003, in a southern paper.\n  Here is one from the Montreal Gazette:\n\n       Halliburton contract bigger than reported; Linked to \n     Cheney; Role has grown beyond fighting Iraq oil fires.\n\n  This one was in the Houston Chronicle on May 8, 2003:\n\n       Halliburton contract stokes new controversy.\n\n  Here is one from the L.A. Times, May 8:\n\n       Shadow over the oilfields; The administration's no-bid \n     contract with Halliburton subsidiary gives the impression of \n     a grab at Iraqi resources for American business.\n\n  Another headline in the L.A. Times on April 11:\n\n       More flack on Halliburton deal; The revelation that the \n     Pentagon contract is worth up to $7 billion is more fuel for \n     critics who say it should have been open to bidding.\n\n  And USA Today, April 11:\n\n       Halliburton oilfield deal raises questions.\n\n  The point is, we should do everything we can for the taxpayers of \nthis country to make them feel comfortable that when there is work at \nhome or abroad, every business in this country gets a chance to compete \nfor the work. Why? Because we all know if there is no competition, the \nprice could soar.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to my amendment Senator \nLieberman, Senator Clinton, Senator Bob Graham, Senator Lautenberg, and \nSenator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am proud to have their support. There can be no \nstronger advocate of the strongest possible military than Senators \nLieberman and Graham. We know that. We have seen them here. They are \nsupporters because they understand, as I do, that it weakens our \ncountry when we do these kinds of deals.\n  The amendment that my friend has offered is fine; there is nothing \nwrong with it, but it does not get to the heart of this particular \ncontract. It is general, whereas the amendment I have offered--and, by \nthe way, it is just a sense of the Senate. It is nice. But what I have \noffered says that if the Secretary of Defense finds that the Army Corps \nhas not, in fact, put the rest of this contract out for bid by the date \nof September 30--and they have promised to do so by August 31--then \nthey have to tell us why they did not bid out this contract.\n  I am going to put up a chart that shows a copy of the congressional \nnotification of this contract. It looks scary when one sees it because \nthere is lots in it, but I have highlighted in yellow the things my \ncolleagues ought to know, because maybe they do not know this.\n  I want to compliment the minority ranking member of the Committee on \nGovernment Reform in the House, Henry Waxman, for doing so much of the \nresearch.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet called the Bush \nAdministration's Contracts with Halliburton, put out by the minority \nstaff of the Committee on Government Reform, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Fact Sheet: The Bush Administration's Contracts With Halliburton\n\n       The Bush Administration has awarded several extremely large \n     contracts and task orders to Halliburton. Of particular \n     concern are the contracts awarded to a Halliburton \n     subsidiary, Kellogg Brown & Root. GAO reports and other \n     investigations have documented a history of Brown & Root \n     overcharging the taxpayer. Yet despite this history, the \n     Administration has awarded Brown & Root lucrative government \n     contracts--including a recent contract for oil-related work \n     in Iraq that is worth up to $7 billion and that was awarded \n     secretly and without any competition. The Administration has \n     also awarded contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars \n     for work in Iraq to a select group of U.S. companies, with \n     only limited competition.\n       Halliburton has a unique relationship to this \n     Administration. When Dick Cheney left his position as \n     Halliburton's CEO in 2000 to run for Vice President, he \n     reportedly received company stock worth over $33 million.\\1\\ \n     He continues to receive deferred compensation payments of \n     over $160,000 a year from Halliburton.\\2\\\n\n\n                    history of brown & root problems\n\n       GAO has found serious problems with contract work that \n     Brown & Root did for the Army in the Balkans. In 1997, it \n     found that the Army ``was unable to ensure that the \n     contractor adequately controlled costs.'' \\3\\ For example, \n     Brown & Root was charging the Army $86 to fly in $14 sheets \n     of plywood from the United States. The Army official in \n     charge was ``shocked'' when he found that out.\\4\\\n       In 2000, GAO found more evidence that Brown & Root was \n     inflating the government's costs--and its profits--by, for \n     example, overstaffing work crews and providing more goods and \n     services than necessary.\\5\\\n       Brown & Root was the subject of a criminal investigation \n     for overbilling the government on another contract. According \n     to a former employee, the company routinely and \n     systematically inflated contract prices it submitted to the \n     government for work at the former Fort Ord military base in \n     California.\\6\\ Brown & Root paid $2 million to settle that \n     case in 2002.\\7\\\n       Brown & Root's parent company, Halliburton, has its own \n     problems. The SEC is investigating accounting practices of \n     the company dating back to the Vice President's tenure at its \n     CEO.\\8\\ The company recently restated its earnings for the \n     4th quarter of 2002.\\9\\ And Halliburton has admitted paying \n     $2.4 million in bribes to a Nigerian official in an attempt \n     to gain favorable tax treatment in the country.\\10\\\n\n\n             defense department contracts with brown & root\n\n       Despite this troubled history, the Administration has \n     awarded Brown & Root three very lucrative Defense contracts. \n     In 2001, Brown & Root won a $300-million contract to provide \n     support services to the Navy--despite a bid protest by a \n     rival bidder that GAO upheld.\\11\\ Later that year, it won a \n     ten-year contract with no cost ceiling to provide support \n     services to the Army.\\12\\ Under these contracts, Brown & Root \n     has been asked to do work in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan and \n     to build prison cells for terrorist suspects in Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba--even though much of this work could be done more \n     cheaply using Army and navy personnel.\\13\\\n       In March 2003, the Administration awarded Brown & Root a \n     contract to repair and operate Iraq's oil infrastructure. \n     Normally, federal contracting rules require public notice and \n     full and open competition. But the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers awarded the contract secretly and without any \n     competition.\n       The Administration has been reluctant to provide complete, \n     or even basic, information about the contract. While the \n     contract was signed March 8, it was not disclosed publicly \n     until March 24. Moreover, the Corps did not reveal until \n     April 8, in response to a letter from Rep. Waxman, that the \n     contract had a potential value of up to $7 billion.\\14\\ And \n     it was not until May 2, in response to another request from \n     Rep. Waxman, that the Corps disclosed that the scope of the \n     contract was significantly broader than previously provided \n     information had suggested.\\15\\\n       Based on what the Corps has revealed to date, the contract \n     is worth up to $7 billion, with the potential profit for \n     Brown & Root worth up to $490 million. The Corps has said the \n     actual value of the contract may end up being less than that \n     (according to the Corps, it may be ``only'' around $600 \n     million). Nonetheless, the fact that the Corps would issue \n     such a large contract without competition is highly unusual.\n       Moreover, the contract is far broader than had been \n     initially suggested. Information provided by the Corps and \n     Halliburton had indicated that the contract was for work \n     putting out oil well fires and repairing damage. Halliburton \n     issued a press release on\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\n     March 24 entitled ``KBR Implements Plan for Extinguishing Oil \n     Well Fires in Iraq,'' which described the contract work as \n     ``assessing and extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq and \n     evaluating and repairing, as directed by the U.S. government, \n     the country's petroleum infrastructure.'' \\16\\ The Corps also \n     released information stating that it was in charge of \n     ``implementation of plans to extinguish oil well fires and to \n     assess oil facility damage in Iraq'' and that it would be \n     contracting with Brown & Root to perform these functions.\\17\\\n       On May 2, however, the Corps revealed that the contract \n     also includes ``operation of facilities'' and ``distribution \n     of products.'' It thus appears that Brown & Root may be asked \n     to operate Iraqi oil facilities and distribute oil products. \n     This raises significant questions about the Administration's \n     intentions regarding Iraqi oil. The Administration has \n     previously drawn a bright line on Iraqi oil: according to \n     White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, ``[t]he oil fields \n     belong to the people of Iraq, the government of Iraq, all of \n     Iraq.''\\18\\ Those sentiments were echoed by Secretary of \n     State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \n     among others.\\19\\ It now appears that Halliburton or another \n     similar company--and not the Iraqi people--may be making \n     fundamental decisions about how much oil should be produced \n     and who should produce it.\n       The Corps has also claimed that the contract is only for \n     short-term emergency work. But the Corps revealed in their \n     April 8 letter that the contract has a two-year term. The \n     Corps also indicated that they are planning to replace the \n     contract with a new, competitively bid contract. In their May \n     2 letter, however, the Corps disclosed that the Halliburton \n     contract will be in place until at least late August 2003, \n     and possibility until January 2004.\n       According to the May 2 letter from the Corps, the new, \n     longer-term contract the Corps is planning to issue will \n     again involve operating facilities and distributing oil. This \n     raises further questions about how much say the Iraqi people \n     will have in making decisions about the country's natural \n     resources.\n       The Corps contract is ``cost plus.'' This means that the \n     contractor receives its costs plus an additional percentage \n     of those costs as its profit. These kinds of contracts are \n     particularly susceptible to abuse as they give the contractor \n     an incentive to pad its profits by increasing its costs. As \n     noted above, Brown & Root has a record of overcharging the \n     taxpayer on cost-plus contracts.\n\n\n                          other iraq contracts\n\n       Halliburton is not the only company to benefit from secret, \n     noncompetitive contracts. The U.S. agency for International \n     Development hand-picked U.S. companies to bid secretly on \n     contracts for work in Iraq. Like the Army Corps contract, the \n     AID contracts for Iraqi reconstruction have been handled with \n     unusual secrecy. AID secretly hand-picked a select few \n     domestic companies to bid on nine contracts for services \n     including airport administration, education, public health, \n     and personnel support. The eight contracts that have been \n     awarded are together worth up to $1 billion. And they may be \n     worth much more, depending on whether and how they are \n     renewed.\n       Halliburton was one of five companies asked by AID to bid \n     on a $680 million contract to rebuild Iraq. Like Halliburton, \n     the other companies bidding--including Parsons, Fluor, and \n     the eventual winner, Bechtel--are heavy Republican \n     contributors. Between them, these companies reportedly \n     contributed $3.6 million over the past two election cycles, \n     two-thirds of which went to Republicans.\\20\\ After the \n     controversy over the Army Corps contract, Halliburton \n     announced that it would not bid on the AID contract. It has \n     indicated it may instead opt for a still lucrative but lower-\n     profile subcontracting role.\n       AID has not identified all of the companies that were \n     selected to bid on its contracts and it has given shifting \n     and at times contradictory explanations of why it did not use \n     full and open competition.\n       For example, AID has said that it limited the eligible \n     companies to those with a security clearance. But it turns \n     out that some of the companies that were asked to bid did not \n     actually have security clearances. In fact, in one case, AID \n     found out after choosing a contractor that the contractor did \n     not have a clearance.\\21\\ AID awarded the contract to the \n     contractor anyway.\\22\\\n       AID has also said that it is required by federal law to use \n     U.S. companies. However, AID can waive this requirement. In \n     fact, it did so with respect to subcontractors on the Iraq \n     contracts. But AID declined to invite any non-U.S. firms to \n     bid on the actual contracts.\n\n       More information about the Administration's contracts with \n     Halliburton and other companies can be found at \n     www.reform.house.gov/min/inves_admin/admin_contracts.htm.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Cheney Gets $33 Million Exit Package from Dallas-Based \n     Energy Services Firm, Dallas Morning News (Aug. 17, 2000).\n     \\2\\ White House, Vice President Dick Cheney and Mrs. Cheney \n     Release 2002 Income Tax Return (Apr. 11, 2003).\n     \\3\\ General Accounting Office, Contingency Operations: \n     Opportunities to Improve the Logistics Civil Augmentation \n     Program (Feb. 1997) (GAO/NSIAD-97-63).\n     \\4\\ Id.\n     \\5\\ General Accounting Office, Contingency Operations: Army \n     Should Do more to Control Contract Cost in the Balkans (Sept. \n     2000) (GAO/NSIAD-00-225).\n     \\6\\ Complaint for Damages under False Claims Act and Demand \n     for Grand Jury at 7, U.S. ex rel.

When we look at this congressional notification, which \nwas very late in getting there because there were already five task \norders under this Halliburton contract, finally they gave this \ninformation over: They have obligated first $17 million, then $6.7 \nmillion, $22 million, $5 million, and $24 million, with no competitive \nbidding.\n  Originally it was, oh, they have to put out the oil fires. Okay. We \nunderstand that. But what about the rest? The estimated face value of \nthis contract is $7 billion. What do we spend on all of our afterschool \nprograms, I say to my colleagues, in 1 year? A billion dollars. How \nmany kids are waiting in line to get into that program? Millions.\n  We cannot afford it, but we can afford to give a sole-source $7 \nbillion to one company named Halliburton. We all know the power of that \ncompany.\n  I want my colleagues to see I am not making this up when I say this \nwas a sole-source contract. Estimated face value, $7 billion. Bids \nsolicited, sole-source procurement; bids received, one. What a happy \nday for Halliburton that was.\n  The subsidiary of Halliburton is Brown & Root. That is the \ncorporation that is the subsidiary of Halliburton that received this \ncontract. One might say, well, maybe this is such a great company, \nmaybe there is a reason why we would go sole source with this company.\n  Well, GAO has found serious problems with contract work that Brown & \nRoot did for the Army in the Balkans. In 1997, GAO found that the Army \nwas unable to ensure that the contractor adequately controlled costs. \nFor example, Brown & Root was charging the Army $86 to fly in $14 \nsheets of plywood from the United States of America. The Army official \nin charge was shocked when he found out.\n  In 2000, GAO found more evidence that Brown & Root was inflating the \nGovernment's costs and its products by, for example, overstaffing work \ncrews and providing more goods and services than necessary. And how \nabout this: Brown & Root was the subject of a criminal investigation \nfor overbilling the Government on another contract. According to a \nformer employee, the company routinely and systematically inflated \ncontract prices it submitted to the Government for work it performed on \na military base in California, and Brown & Root paid $2 million to \nsettle that case.\n  Brown & Root's parent company Halliburton has its own problems. The \nSEC is investigating accounting practices of the company. The company \nrecently restated its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2002 and \nHalliburton has admitted paying $2.4 million in bribes to a Nigerian \nofficial in an attempt to gain favorable tax treatment in the country.\n  So I say to my colleagues, why on Earth would the Army Corps give \nthis company this incredible sole-source contract to the tune of $7 \nbillion?\n  We have had a series of answers to that question. At first we were \ntold this was just for emergencies. Remember those newspaper articles, \njust for\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nemergencies? Now we are finding out it goes well beyond emergencies.\n  In March 2003, the administration awarded Brown & Root a contract to \nrepair and operate Iraq's oil infrastructure. The administration has \nbeen reluctant to provide complete or even basic information about the \ncontract. Remember, the contract was awarded March 8 but it was not \npublicly disclosed until March 24. The Corps did not reveal until April \n8, in response to a letter from Representative Waxman, that the \ncontract had a potential value of up to $7 billion.\n  It was not until May 2, in response to another request from \nRepresentative Waxman, the Corps disclosed the scope of the contract \nwas significantly broader than previously provided information had \nsuggested.\n  We have a chance to end this embarrassment today. If we have a strong \nvote on the Boxer-Lieberman-Lautenberg-Durbin-Graham of Florida-Clinton \namendment--and I hope many other colleagues will join. I hope many on \nthe other side will join--what are we saying? We are saying if they do \nnot correct the problem as they have stated they would do--and they \nhave stated they would in fact end this sole-source contract and they \nwould go out for bid by the end of August--all we are saying is send us \na report, tell us the reason why you are carrying on.\n  Under Senator Warner's amendment, which I have no objection to at \nall, and I am going to vote for it, let's hear what it says. It says it \nis the sense of the Senate--which, by the way, has no force of law--\nthat the DOD should fully comply with the Competition in Contracting \nAct for any contract awarded for reconstruction activities in Iraq and \nshould conduct a full and open competition for performing work needed \nfor the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry as soon as \npracticable.\n  I am not a lawyer, but I can tell my colleagues when we see the words \n``as soon as practicable,'' get nervous.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be so happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am a lawyer, and those are known as weasel words \nbecause if that phrase can be included, it has no meaning. The question \nis whether we are going to hold the Department of Defense accountable. \nI ask the Senator from California this question: The sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which she offers not only raises a question of \nwhether this is evidence of profiteering, evidence of a sweetheart \narrangement, evidence of the kind of sole-source agreement that frankly \nis not in the best interest of either American taxpayers or America's \nnational defense, is she specific in the accountability she is holding \nthe Department of Defense to in terms of when they will report as \nopposed to as soon as practicable?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. My particular amendment that will be voted on \nis more than a sense of the Senate. It is a sense of the Senate plus it \nis a requirement that if the Department of Defense does not meet its \nown stated goal of having a fully competitive contract in place by \nAugust 31, 2003, to replace this boondoggle, the Secretary of Defense \nshall submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2003, detailing the \nreasons for allowing this sole-source contract to continue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Chair if the Senator would yield for this \nquestion. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In this situation, has the Department of Defense made any \nstatements that they are planning on making some sort of a revision to \nthis $7 billion Halliburton contract?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct, they have. In a letter to Representative \nWaxman, who has kind of uncovered this entire matter--if it was not for \nhim, this thing might be buried somewhere in somebody's drawer--they \nsaid, we are now completing--this is the Department of the Army: We are \nnow completing the competitive acquisition strategy and plan, preparing \nthe statement of work, and preparing the solicitation that will request \nproposals to perform work. The solicitation will be advertised on the \nFederal Business Opportunities Web site by late spring or early summer \nand the estimate for the award of the contract is approximately the end \nof August.\n  So they have given a date by which they say they will be able to take \nthe rest of this contract and bid it out.\n  By the way, there is nothing to say that the Halliburton subsidiary, \nBrown & Root, can't compete on the rest of the contract when it goes \nout. It ought to be open.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, what \nthe Senator from California is asking the Senate to do, is hold the \nDepartment of Defense to their own promise to the Congress that they \nwill put an end to this $7 billion Halliburton sole-source contract and \nactually open this up to bidding. The Senator is only asking Congress \nto hold the Department of Defense accountable for written promises they \nhave already made to Congress.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is all I am doing.\n  I say to my friend, I can tell from the sound of his voice, he is a \nlittle incredulous that this has not been accepted by the other side. \nThis is such a simple, straightforward commonsense kind of approach.\n  We are saying that this was not right. The Army Corps has said they \nwill fix it. They have given us a date; they will fix it. All we are \nsaying is, if you do not, we want to hold you accountable. We want a \nreport.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, in most \ninstances, when you are considering this kind of arrangement--here we \nhave a major company, sole-source contract for $7 billion, without \nanyone else competing with them. The question it raises is whether it \nis improper or has an appearance of impropriety.\n  I say on its face there is an appearance of impropriety, that one \ncompany, without competitive bidding, would end up with a $7 billion \ncontract. Is the Senator from California saying that if Halliburton is \nthat good, that this is the only company in America that can possibly \nbid on it, Halliburton will have its chance?\n  The Department of Defense is going to say to all the companies in \nAmerica that might provide the services, you have your chance to \ncompete with Halliburton. If it is that good, Halliburton can win this \ncontract fair and square on the up and up and eliminate any appearance \nof impropriety. Is that what the Senator from California is trying to \nachieve?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am trying to say what you stated. If Halliburton or \nsubsidiaries wish to do more work in Iraq, let them stand shoulder to \nshoulder, toe to toe with every other company in this country.\n  I have heard from so many businesspeople who are outraged at this. \nThat is why the amendment I have offered on behalf of Senator \nLautenberg and you and others is a probusiness amendment; it is a \nprotaxpayer amendment and a proconsumer amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question? This could be \ndescribed as ``business unusual.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think my friend, a very successful businessman, has put \nhis finger on it: It is business unusual.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. Often we say business as usual; this is business \nas unusual.\n  Does the Senator, in the resolution proposed, talk about terms or \nperformance? Is it not worth noting if this contract were done, if not \nin the dark of night, certainly at dusk--we do not know the terms--that \nnot only means price could be many times over, there are no performance \nstandards, either, which is pretty darn unusual?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, it is very unusual. When we ask them, \nthey say: We are just going to use this contract to put out the fires.\n\n  Then it turned out, thank God, there were not that many fires; and we \nthought, OK, fine, it was a sole source.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It turned out to be a fire sale.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another excellent point.\n  I am happy my friend from New Jersey is back. I was losing my sense \nof humor. I am glad he is back.\n  This chart shows the congressional notification of this contract. The \nlight of day never came to this until way after it was issued. Now we \nfinally got it after the fifth task order. Estimated value, $7 billion.\n  They called it a bridge contract, by the way, when they started out, \nand they started to let out these task orders.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\n  Does it say the maximum amount the Government could spend?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The estimated face value.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So if $7 billion became $10 billion--is there any \nlimitation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Legally, as I look at it, it says estimated face value.\n  Here it says ``bids received: One.''\n  ``Bids solicited, sole source.''\n  This is stunning.\n  I ask the President how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from New Jersey and retain \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend and colleague from California. I \nsupport Senator Boxer's amendment regarding the questionable--and it is \nquestionable; friends here know I spent a lot of my time, most of my \nlife, in business, more than I have in the Senate. No-bid contracts are \npractically nonexistent when they have significant value to either the \ncompany, the government, or otherwise.\n  The contract given to Halliburton in early March regarding Iraq's oil \ninfrastructure, this no-bid contract, has raised serious concern. There \nis good cause. There is no accusation here. It is just a question of \nwhat is a good, sensible business practice.\n  I ask every Senator in this body to take a look and ask if they would \ngive out a contract to cut the lawn at their house or cut down trees or \npaint the house without getting some formal response as to what it \nmight cost. We have a strange happening: no-bid contract. It could be \nas much as $7 billion, with no ceiling on it. That is the interesting \naspect. For whatever reason, the administration has attempted to \nconceal the scope and the terms of the contract. This attempt to hide \ninformation has generated plenty of suspicion.\n  Initially, it was announced that the contract with Halliburton was \nfor the specific and limited purpose of extinguishing Iraqi oil fires. \nThat could be described as emergency and repairing equipment. The \ninitial value of the contract, the initial value, was $50 million. We \nare now talking about approximately $7 billion, give or take $2 billion \nor $3 billion--mostly take; I guarantee there is no give, in the hope \nthat no one would ask any questions.\n  This was a no-bid contract given to a company that has strong ties to \nthe administration. Then the details began to change. Six weeks after \nthe contract was originally disclosed, the Army admitted that the \ncontract was not only for putting out the fires and making some \nrepairs--repairs, $7 billion?--suddenly the Army Corps revealed that \nthe contract called for Halliburton to operate the oil wells and \ndistribute Iraqi oil. That is a huge difference.\n\n  There is the issue of the no-bid process. Perhaps we ought to have a \nSenate resolution to see how our friends would vote if we said let's go \nto all no-bid contracts for Government purchases. Sound like a good \nidea? I doubt it.\n  Asked why the Halliburton contract was awarded in a no-bid fashion, \nthe Army Corps asserted that there was no time for a competitive \nprocess and this contract would be of short duration. You can spend $7 \nbillion in a hurry, I guess.\n  We now learn the contract could be worth up to $7 billion. For the \npast 6 weeks, each time the Army Corps has been questioned about the \ncontract, we hear a different story.\n  I recently have written a letter to Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, the chairman and the ranking member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee of which I sit, asking them to hold a hearing to \ninvestigate this contract. I believe the hearing will allow us to \nfinally determine the true scope of this contract and why the \nadministration chose not to have a bidding process and why the \ninformation was withheld.\n  Something here is not right. Not only do we need to investigate the \nprocess under which this contract was awarded, but we also need to put \na competitive contracting process in place for this work in Iraq. We \nneed to ensure for the American people that the Government is not \nengaged in sweetheart deals for its corporate friends.\n\n  The amendment of Senator Boxer encourages that the current no-bid \nHalliburton contract be replaced shortly through a competitive process, \nand I congratulate the Senator from California for that thought. That \nis the way it ought to work.\n  The reconstruction of Iraq, particularly the rebuilding of the Iraqi \noil industry, is an extremely sensitive endeavor. I believe it is \nvitally important for the Pentagon to divulge information as to how it \nawards contracts in a public and systematic fashion. The Halliburton \ncontract and the cloak of secrecy around it must not set a precedent \nfor future contracts in the reconstruction process.\n  In this time of budget difficulties, with our inability to finance \nprograms that have been an important part of the structure of the \nUnited States--whether it is education, whether it is prescription \ndrugs or otherwise--for us to go ahead and spend $7 billion without \nknowing how, why, and when this work is going to be performed is an \noutrage. I don't think the American public ought to stand still for it.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will agree. Many of them are \ngood business-people who have been out there and understand what has \nbeen appropriate process in business.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. I will send the modification to the desk.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I don't know whether I \nwill object. I would like a chance to look at it. I just got a chance \nto look at it a minute ago. So if you could put the unanimous consent \noff for a couple of minutes so I can take a look at it?\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Let me just explain to the Senator what it is. The \nSenator, in the course of her comments, more or less criticized the \namendment by the Senator from Virginia as not having in it the full \nforce and effect of law. So, acting upon the suggestion of the good \nSenator from California, I have now provided that this amendment will \nhave the full force of law. Let me read it to you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator wants to give me 2 minutes, I am just \nlooking at it now. You can read it to me or I can get a copy and read \nit myself. Either way is fine. I do not have it in front of me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me read it.\n\n       The Department of Defense shall fully comply with the \n     Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. 2304 et seq) for \n     any contracts awarded for reconstruction activity in Iraq and \n     shall conduct a full and open competition for performing work \n     needed for the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry. . . \n     .''\n\n  It is straightforward.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

COMPETITIVE AWARD OF CONTRACTS FOR IRAQI \n                   RECONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Department of Defense shall fully \n     comply with the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. \n     2304 et seq) for any contract awarded for reconstruction \n     activities in Iraq and shall conduct a full and open \n     competition for performing work needed for the reconstruction \n     of the Iraqi oil industry.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--If the Department of Defense does \n     not have a fully competitive contract in place to replace the \n     March 8, 2003 contract for the reconstruction of the Iraqi \n     oil industry by August 31, 2003, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2003, \n     detailing the reasons for allowing this sole-source contract \n     to continue. A follow-up report shall be submitted to \n     Congress each 60 days thereafter until a competitive contract \n     is in place.\n\n                      Amendment No. 825 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I respectfully ask the Chair \nto withdraw the amendment by the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no objection to withdrawing my amendment because \nit has, in fact, been made a part of the Warner amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask that this amendment have the name \nof the Senator from California on it, also.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is to be known as the Warner-Boxer--and also for the \nSenator from New Jersey, my friend, Mr. Lautenberg. The two of us go \nback many years.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Further than we can remember.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, further back than we can remember.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment of the \nSenator from California is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the amendment of the Senator from Virginia is now \nknown as the Warner-Boxer-Lautenberg amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Briefly, to explain to the Senate, basically what we have \ndone is we have put into law the requirement that the Department of \nDefense shall fully comply with the Competition in Contracting Act for \nany contract awarded for reconstruction activities in Iraq and shall \nconduct a full and open competition for performing work needed for the \nreconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry.\n  Second, a report to Congress. If the Department of Defense does not \nhave a fully competitive contract in place to replace the March 8, 2003 \ncontract for the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry by August 31, \n2003, the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to Congress by \nSeptember 30, 2003, detailing the reasons for allowing the sole-source \ncontract to continue. A followup report shall be submitted to Congress \neach 60 days thereafter until a competitive contract is in place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague from Virginia.\n  I think when the Senate can work together, when we can cross over, \none side to the other, we do good work. What we did is literally take \none half of the amendment of the Senator from Virginia and one half of \nmine. What is important to me is, if the Senate will speak in one \nvoice, we will have a vote. I trust it will pass with a very wide \nmargin, if not unanimously. The Senate will go on record, if we pass \nthe Warner-Boxer amendment, as saying the following: We don't approve \nof this sole-source contract continuing, that we want to make sure the \nArmy Corps, which says it is going to end this contract, is held \naccountable; that they are going to have to let us know if by August 30 \nthey don't end the sole-source contract, and every 60 days thereafter \nthey are going to have to let us know why they are continuing a $7 \nbillion sole-source contract.\n  That is all I wanted when I stood up a couple hours ago. That is all \nI want now. I am grateful to my friend for being openminded. It was a \ngood debate.\n  I also say to my leader on the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nLevin, the ranking member, how helpful he has been to me. When I \nstarted, I had a proposal that might never have seen the light of day. \nHe worked with me to make it relevant, make it work. Again, to Senators \nGraham and Lieberman and Clinton and Durbin and Lautenberg, before we \nlooked like we had a winner here, they were with me. This is really \nvery nostalgic for me. In my time in the House, I worked on the Armed \nServices Committee on military procurement before. I had hoped I \nwouldn't have to be standing here worried about military procurement, \nbut it looks like it comes back like a bad dream.\n  I am hopeful the action we take this afternoon, just to let the Army \nCorps know we are all watching, Republicans and Democrats, will have a \nsalutary effect on the termination of the sole-source contract and fair \nand open bidding. The taxpayers deserve no less. The business community \ndeserves no less. Consumers deserve no less. Frankly, the people of \nIraq deserve no less because we are trying to rebuild their country in \nthe most efficient way we can.\n  I thank my friend again, Senator Warner. I urge a yea vote on the \nWarner-Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the manager yield a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Take such time as you need.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Just a minute, because I want to second what we just \nheard from the Senator from California about my friend and colleague \nfrom Virginia. We have our policy differences. But when there is \nsomething that strikes the right note, I know for the many years we \nhave served together, now about 20, including a 2-year lapse, we were \nable to agree on things here and there that meant a lot in terms of the \nprocess of our functioning.\n  I commend the Senator from Virginia for coming to a negotiated \nsettlement and consensus view that accomplishes what we all wanted. I \nthank him for his\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nwillingness to listen and for me to be able to participate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden and \nother colleagues in sponsoring this amendment on contracting in Iraq \nand in support of the Warner-Boxer amendment No. 826. One of our key \nobjectives for our work in Iraq is to convince the Iraqi people, other \nnations in the Mideast, and our allies that we are not occupying Iraq \nto get their oil and benefit big American corporations. We are there to \nprovide the Iraqi people with basic services and infrastructure, human \nrights, and a more representative government. Given the massive \nproblems we are having there, it is equally important to enable \noversight by--and provide information for--Congress and the American \npeople as well.\n  So it is unfortunate that we have started the reconstruction in Iraq \non exactly the wrong note. Contracts have been let in secrecy, without \nopen competition, to friends of the administration. The Army Corps of \nEngineers gave a contract that they thought was potentially worth $7 \nbillion to Halliburton with no competition at all. The contract is \nclassified, and I have been told the reason it is classified is \nclassified too. And information about it has only dribbled out. First \nwe were told it was just to put out oil well fires. Later is slipped \nout that production and distribution of oil were included as well. Was \nthis in the interest of the Iraqi people? Did they consider \ninvestigations suggesting excessive charges in previous Halliburton \ncontracts? how can we tell?\n  The Agency for International Development, under guidance from the \nPentagon, has also let contracts in secrecy with only limited \ncompetition between hand-picked companies. Bechtel, with its own ties \nto the administration, got the largest one. Again we don't know how \nthey chose these companies.\n  These practices must end if we are to obtain the trust of people at \nhome or abroad. And I have to say it is not clear that results so far \njustify this unusual way of doing things.\n  This modest amendment simply says that if the administration is going \nto let contracts for Iraqi reconstruction without full and open \ncompetition, it has to tell Congress and the American people what it is \ndoing. They have to give the amount of the contract, the scope, a \ndescription of who was allowed to compete and why, and documents on why \nthey did not allow full competition. Classified information could be \nredacted, but would still be given to appropriate Congressional \ncommittees.\n  Similarly, the Warner-Boxer amendment requires competitive \ncontracting for reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry. If the \nadministration does not cut off the Halliburton contract by August 31 \nand allow full competition for that work, as it has said it would, the \namendment requires report to Congress.\n  The amendments will not ensure open competition, but at least they \nwill bring daylight to shine on the administration's activities, and \nwill allow the American and Iraqi people to see what is being done with \nour money and their future.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand the yeas and nays are going to \nbe requested. I thank my good friend from California for her kind words \nand, as always, the Senator from Virginia for his willingness to work \nto try to advance the Senate's proceedings in a fair and thoughtful \nway. I thank him as always for his willingness to try to find some way \nto bring together diverse views.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, by way of concluding remarks, we have set \nforth a joint statement which hopefully will be enacted into law. I \ncommend my two colleagues for their work. I don't fully share some of \nthe allegations raised with regard to the suspicions connected with \nthis contract. It is for that reason the contract should see the full \nrays of sunlight and be explored. Committees of Congress will \neventually be exploring this same issue.\n  This document simply establishes a procedure by which this can be \ndone. It is my expectation we will recognize that those in authority in \nthe Department of Defense, recognizing the urgency of time following \nthe basic cessation, not the full cessation but basic cessation of \nhostilities, have to move with swiftness. That is the underlying \nreason. Eventually this contract can be substantiated as in compliance \nwith the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been previously \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 826, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n      environmental restoration of the former eaker air force base\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's \nattention to a matter important to Blytheville in Mississippi County, \nAR. Blytheville is the former home of Eaker Air Force Base. In 1992, \nEaker closed and ended a 50-year legacy between the U.S. Air Force and \nthe people of Blytheville. During Eaker's 50 years, the Air Force \nbenefited from local support of Eaker--support that ensured an \natmosphere where the Air Force could complete critical missions.\n  Today, a decade following Eaker's closure, the folks at Blytheville \nare trying to move forward and locate new businesses at the former \nbase. Regrettably, abandoned, decaying buildings with asbestos siding \nand pipe insulation were left behind after the Air Force's departure \nand this environmental hazard is preventing any potential economic \ndevelopment on these lands. Our Federal Government regulations are \nclear concerning these types of hazards and the required remediation \nthereof. It is my understanding that many of these buildings were \nscheduled for demolition by the Air Force prior to the base closure. It \nis further my understanding that there is a potential for the asbestos \nto become airborne as these building begin to collapse.\n  Mississippi County currently has the highest unemployment rate in the \nState. It was not the intent of the base closure process to leave a \nlocal community with environmentally hazardous waste, however, this is \nprecisely what has occurred. The county cannot relocate new business in \nthe facilities until the cleanup is complete.\n  I want to bring closure to this issue and I hope that Chairman Warner \nand Senator Levin will join me in looking into this matter. I plan on \ncontacting the Air Force to get a formal response to the environmental \nissues at the former Eaker Air Force Base. Again, I thank my colleagues \nfor any support that they might provide in helping the people of \nBlytheville, AR.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks made by Senator Pryor. This is a matter that I discussed with \nSenator Inouye last year during the consideration of the Defense \nappropriations bill. For reasons unknown, environmental restoration of \nthe former Eaker Air Force Base has languished for over a decade. It is \npast time to address this issue. It is time to clean up this land and \nenable the people of Blytheville to find new tenants that can \ncontribute to the local economy.\n  The people of Blytheville deserve Federal assistance to clean up the \nasbestos left behind by the Air Force. For 50 years, residents of \nBlytheville proudly support Eaker Air Force Base as home to a group of \nstrategic air command B-52 bombers and more than 3,000 military \npersonnel, before its closure in 1992. Before the closure, the military \naccounted for 15.2 percent of personal earnings, the largest of any \nindustry in the county.\n  Through industrial expansion at the Arkansas Aeroplex, I believe \nsignificant strides can be made to turn the economic situation in \nBlytheville around. The Aeroplex is home to a 2-mile runway. In fact, \nthe runway could serve as an alternate landing site for the NASA space \nshuttle. The potential for new business is abundant, but the \nopportunities are hampered because of the asbestos-filled buildings.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Pryor on this matter, and I \nhope our colleagues from the Senate Armed Services Committee will \nassist us on this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also would be glad to help the Senator get this issue \naddressed and will work with you in contracting the Air Force.\n\n\n              house provision on meals ready to eat (mre)\n\n  Mr. BAYH. As the chairman knows, I am a strong supporter of Buy \nAmerican requirements, and am generally open to strengthening current \nlaw, but the House Armed Services authorization bill contains a \nprovision that could impact our ability to produce MREs. This provision \nspecifically deals with the packaging requirements for MREs procured by \nDOD.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have not seen the provision but it sounds like it might \nbe a concern.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the distinguished Senator from Virginia would yield, \nMr. Chairman, I also have concerns about this provision and the effects \nit would have on our ability to meet production needs to get necessary \nmeals to our service men and women in the field.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is my understanding the implementation of \nthe House provision could seriously impact the industry's production \ncapacity and relegating MRE restocking to old, slower technology \nproducing less desirable meal options.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was unaware of this matter, but want to assure the \nSenator from Indiana and the Senator from Oklahoma that the Senate will \ngive this provision a thorough review in conference with the House.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the distinguished chairman and the Senator from \nOklahoma for their interest in the matter and look forward to working \nwith them to resolve this issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman and the Senator from Indiana and \nlook forward to working with them on this issue as we proceed with the \nbill.\n\n\n                  the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have in the Senate repealed the ban \non low-yield nuclear weapons, specifically, section 3136 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994, Public Law \n103-160.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have included, however, a requirement for the specific \nauthorization for low-yield warhead development beyond phase 2A or \n6.2A. With this amendment, Congress and this committee, will continue \nto play an important oversight role on nuclear weapons development.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have submitted an amendment which has been accepted, \nthat requires the Secretaries of the Departments of Defense, Energy, \nand State, to provide Congress by March 1, 2004, an assessment of the \neffects, if any, that such a repeal will have on the ability of the \nUnited States to achieve its nonproliferation objectives, and whether \nor not, changes in programs or activities would be required to achieve \nthese objectives. I have asked that this report be submitted in an \nunclassified form with a classified annex, if needed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe a careful, systematic study is needed by the \nexecutive branch on the effects of such a repeal, and especially, how \nit affects nations such as Russia, where we are cooperatively working \nto reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct. There is concern on the signal \nthat this repeal could send to other nations, especially those we are \nworking with to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In \nparticular, my intent in submitting this amendment was the effect that \nthe repeal would have on the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, \nwhich was started by Senators Nunn, Lugar, and Domenici. I want to be \nassured that we do not send any bad-faith signals to Russia, and other \ncountries, that participate in the program. The United States spends \nover a billion dollars a year in this effort; the repeal of the low-\nyield ban must not negatively affect this investment of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I share this concern. I will work with the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, through our important oversight role, to insure \nthat the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program continues to be carried \nout effectively by\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nthe Departments of Defense and Energy, especially now that we have \nrepealed the ban on low-yield nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the committee's help in this important \nmatter.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with \nthe administration's approach to competitive sourcing and the revisions \nto Circular A-76 currently under consideration by the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. \nCurrently, ``competitive sourcing'' as defined and interpreted through \nCircular A-76 is biased against work performed by Government employees. \nSome examples of this are: 1, there are very limited provisions for \nwork, including work that has been previously outsourced, being \ncompeted and returned to the Government, and, 2, any function that has \never been studied for outsourcing is required to be restudied for \noutsourcing every 5 years.\n  With this in mind, I urge the administration to incorporate \nprovisions in the revised A-76 to be released in the coming months. The \nfollowing items must be included for our support:\n  One, remove all barriers to moving previously outsourced or \n``inherently governmental'' work into Government facilities and develop \nclear provisions for competing previously outsourced work. The spirit \nof A-76 should be to have an even flow of workload between public and \nprivate facilities and a level playing field for public and private \nentities upon which they can compete for work.\n  Two, encourage public-private partnerships and establish clear \nprovisions for allowing public-private partnerships to compete for work \ncompetitively sourced under A-76.\n  Three, more explicitly define ``inherently governmental'' so that it \nwill be clear which activities are not subject to A-76 studies.\n  Four, eliminate the requirement once an A-76 competition has been \nawarded to the Government, for the work to be reviewed again every 5 \nyears and subject to recompetition. The option to restudy should remain \nbut the requirement to restudy should be eliminated.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I strongly agree with the Senator from \nGeorgia. I truly believe our depots are a national asset and we should \naddress the basic question of ``core'' requirements. Currently, there \nis no acceptable definition of ``inherently governmental'' functions or \n``core'' which can guide the administration and the Department of \nDefense as they decide which functions should be competed for \noutsourcing. As we have seen in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United \nStates does not have the luxury of time in addressing the threats of \ntomorrow. Before we start making short-term decisions, we need to look \nat the long-term effects and requirements in support of national \ndefense.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments \nand add my own.\n  Last November, the Office of Management and Budget proposed the most \nsweeping changes to the rules on outsourcing of Government work since \nthe last 1950s. Now, the administration wants to use the proposal to \nprivatize at least 225,000 Department of Defense civilian jobs over the \nnext several years.\n  The proposed changes have received strong criticism from the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, executive branch agencies, and Federal employee \norganizations. The CIA wrote that they will be unable to meet their own \nstatutory requirements to protect their intelligence sources and \nmethods if they fully implemented the revision. The Department of \nTransportation raised concern about the adverse impact of the changes \non women and minorities employed by the Federal Government.\n  The proposed revisions could undermine public-private competition. \nUnder the plan, if an agency is unable to complete public-private \ncompetitions in 1 year, it could automatically privatize the work. \nAfter an outcry from agencies and the public, OMB indicated that it \nwould consider changes, but it is far from clear what the changes will \nbe.\n  In addition, the proposal allows so-called ``streamlined'' \ncompetitions for activities involving 65 or fewer employees and lasting \nno more than 90 days. Under current rules, the Federal employee or the \ncontractor must be at least 10 percent or $10 million more efficient to \nwin a bid. Under this ``streamlined'' method, there would be no such \nrequirement. Clearly, the potential savings and efficiency created by \ncompetition would be threatened and would be contrary to the \nrecommendation of the Commercial Activities Panel, the panel charged \nwith reviewing outsourcing policies, for which all of the contractor \nand administration representatives voted.\n  The proposal would also include an automatic bias in favor of \ncontractors. It imposes a 12 percent overhead cost on all Federal \nemployee bids, and then imposes a superfluous charge for indirect labor \ncosts, but it does not impose the same charges on contractor bids, even \nthough both Federal employees and contractors would have similar \noverhead costs. The DoD inspector general has said that the 12 percent \noverhead factor is ``unsupportable.''\n  In addition, the proposal is likely to reduce the standard of living \nfor tens of thousands of Americans. By artificially inflating the costs \nof in-house personnel, contractors have incentives to reduce costs by \nproviding unfair compensation packages for those who perform Government \nwork. Good jobs with fair wages and opportunities for advancement would \nbe turned into lower wage jobs with no benefits and no security. \nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, more than one in 10 Federal \ncontract workers already earns less than a living wage.\n  The proposed revisions also apply different competition requirements \nto Federal employees and contractors in other ways that raise serious \nfairness concerns. Contractors have an incentive to low-ball their \nproposal, since there is relatively little likelihood of real private \nsector competition. The inspector general of the Department of Defense \nhas reported that over three-fifths of the contracts he and his staff \nsurveyed suffered from ``inadequate completion.''\n  Clearly, the proposed revisions will have significant implications \nfor undermining competition and reducing opportunities for Federal \nemployees to compete fairly for their own jobs.\n  Today, there is far too little real competition for contacts to \nprovide goods and services of Federal agencies. We should be getting \nthe most out of every taxpayer dollar. But, less than 1 percent of \nDepartment of Defense service contracts are subject to full public-\nprivate competition.\n  Government procurement should be based on what is best for taxpayers \nand our national defense. We face great challenges to the Nation's \nsecurity in these difficult times. More than ever, we rely on the \nDepartment of Defense and its dedicated employees. As the military \nbudget grows rapidly, we must see that taxpayers and our men and women \nin uniform obtain the benefits too. True competition is more critical \ntoday than ever.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nMassachusetts for their comments. I agree that we should not make \nshort-term decisions on these issues, that more precise definitions of \n``inherently governmental'' and ``core'' are required to guide \ncompetitive sourcing decisions and public-private partnerships, and \nthat the ``streamlined'' procedure OMB is advocating are a step in the \nwrong direction. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nadministration to ensure any revision to A-76 are done carefully and do \nnot discriminate against our Federal workforce.\n\n\n                           biobased products\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, Senator \nWarner, in a colloquy.\n  As we know, Executive Order 13101 provides guidance to the head of \neach executive agency, including the Secretary of Defense, regarding \nthe use and procurement of recycled and biodegradable products. In \nfact, the Order states each agency head ``. . . shall incorporate waste \nprevention and recycling in the agency's daily operations and work to \nincrease and expand markets for recovered materials through greater \nFederal Government preference and demand for such products.''\n  I think that now is a great opportunity to once again encourage the \nDepartment of Defense to procure products that both reduce waste and \nenhance recycling. I am aware that\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nbiobased products have been developed using a new composite material \nconsisting primarily of limestone and renewable starch for the \nproduction of food serviceware. Manufacturers of these products \nmaintain that they have proven to be strong, provide good insulation, \nand biodegrade in marine and composting environments. I am told that in \nrecent years, biobased products have become more prevalent and more \ncost competitive. Moreover, I believe that these products have been \ntested in the Pentagon cafeterias and are being considered for use in \nother Defense facilities.\n  I support environmentally friendly products such as biobased \nproducts. In my home State of Missouri, we have a manufacturing plant \nin the City of Lebanon that produces equipment for manufacturing \nbiobased products. The plant has already produced eight machines. By \nthe end of the year, the plant will have produced 50 additional \nmachines. Buy 2004, the plant will have built 100 additional machines. \nIn addition, due to the high demand for biobased products, the plant is \nalso producing biobased food serviceware. The plant takes up 50,000 \nsquare feet and requires 90 full-time and temporary workers. I \nappreciate the jobs and business created by this multimillion-dollar \nendeavor, and I am proud that we have a Missouri-manufactured product \nthat reduces the impacts of waste on our environment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate the Senator's concerns and support his \nefforts in this area.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, military planning is about balancing \nrisk and cost. Resources will always be limited. And actions will \nalways incur costs, whether financial or political. In the fiscal year \n2004 Defense Authorization Bill, the Bush administration sought to \ndevelop a new generation of nuclear weapons that would risk blurring \nthe distinction between conventional and nuclear arms. While the \nfinancial cost of this decision would not be insignificant, the \npolitical costs internationally--and the costs to America's security--\ncould be enormous.\n  Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has sought to \nlimit the spread of nuclear weapons. We have signed treaties, we have \ncajoled allies, we have threatened adversaries, and, in the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, we made it the stated goal of the United \nStates to pursue real nuclear disarmament. The President has stated \nthat the spread of nuclear weapons, when taken with the global danger \nposed by terrorism, represents the greatest threat to America's \nsecurity. We have fought one war over weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq. We are locked in a perilous stalemate with North Korea over their \nnuclear weapons program. We remain concerned about the pursuit of \nnuclear weapons in places like Iran. And we worry that the Indian-\nPakistan border might witness the first exchange of nuclear arms.\n  We find ourselves in an increasingly contradictory position. On the \none hand the Bush administration says that it will pursue whatever \nmeasures might be necessary to stop the spread of nuclear weapons \naround the world. Ye in our own affairs, the administration has broken \ndangerous new ground. Their Nuclear Posture Review urged the \ndevelopment of new nuclear weapons in order to target deeply buried, \nhardened targets or chemical and biological agents on the battlefield. \nEarlier this year, the president signed an order raising the prospect \nof American first-use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. \nThese are dangerous and sobering developments. They underscore the \nperils of this new age. But these policies do not make us safer. \nIndeed, I would argue they risk making us less secure.\n  The greatest challenge to the security of the United States is the \nthreat of terrorist armed with weapons of mass destruction. There is \nlittle debate of this assertion. At a time when stopping the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and securing those that \nalready exist is the principal security challenge of our time, it is \ninconceivable to me that the Bush administration would seek the \nauthority to develop new weapons of our own. It is another example of \nthe administration acting unilaterally and damaging America's long-term \ninterests in the process.\n  The most effective means to thwart the nuclear ambitions of others is \nour own moral leadership backed by unquestioned military might. That \nmoral leadership is predicated on the way we conduct ourselves. In \nshort, our efforts to keep nuclear arms out of the hands of others will \nlack international credibility and support--and ultimately success--if \nwe are determined to develop new nuclear weapons of our own. Without \ninternational support, our best efforts to prevent the spread of \nnuclear weapons will be greeted with cynicism and, quite simply, fail.\n  Our unquestioned military might is not predicated on the development \nof new nuclear weapons or our ability to target underground bunkers \nwith nuclear bombs; rather it flows from our investment in conventional \narms, our ability to project power around the world, our demonstrated \ncapability to strike any point on the planet with precision, and the \ninvestment we make in the men and women of our armed forces.\n  In fact, the United States alone has demonstrated the ability to \nachieve near-strategic effects through the use of conventional \nprecision munitions. No other country can do that. No other country is \neven close. Given that fact, it is not clear why this administration is \nwilling to bear the international costs of developing a weapon that \nwill raise new questions about America's intentions and hinder our \nleadership in the fight against proliferation without providing any new \nmilitary utility.\n  The two most likely scenarios in which United States military might \nuse these new weapons, whether low-yield nuclear weapons or larger \nbunker-busters, are in striking deeply buried, hardened targets and in \ndefeating chemical and biological agents on the battlefield. In both \ncases, there are conventional alternatives to the use of nuclear \nweapons. Deeply buried and hardened facilities can be disabled by using \nconventional munitions to seal their entrances. Other munitions such as \nincendiary and thermobaric bombs have proven effective in Afghanistan. \nA nuclear detonation, in contrast, would eject a plume of radioactive \ndebris that would contaminate the surrounding region, sickening \ncivilians in the area and endangering the well-being of American \nmilitary personnel. Crossing the nuclear threshold to accomplish these \nmissions would be overkill, it would violate accepted norms of \nbehavior, and it would produce a damaging political backlash against \nthe United States and our interests.\n  There has emerged in recent years an American way of war. Different \nobservers have ascribed different characteristics to it, but nearly all \nrecognize that among its features is a concern and respect for non-\ncombatants. The Secretary of Defense has even noted the additional risk \ntaken by our aircrews to avoid civilian casualties in Afghanistan and \nIraq. The use of nuclear weapons, however, would imperil anyone near a \ntarget with exposure to dangerous levels of radiation, introducing a \nnew horrific possibility to the euphemism ``collateral'' damage.\n  Some have contended that a low-yield nuclear weapon, detonated at \nsome depth, would provide shielding from the dangerous fallout \nassociated wit nuclear detonation. According to Rob Nelson, a nuclear \nphysicist at Princeton University, however, a nuclear bunker buster \nwith a yield of one-tenth of one kiloton--about two hundred times \nsmaller than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima--would need to penetrate to \na depth of 230 feet prior to detonation for the earth to absorb the \ntotality of the blast. To provide some perspective, the Pentagon's only \ncurrent nuclear earth penetrating weapon can reach a depth of only \nabout 20 feet in dry earth. At this depth, a 0.1 kiloton weapon would \neject hazardous debris and likely fail to damage a robust, deeply \nburied, hardened structure.\n  Finally, by pursuing new, ``usable'' nuclear weapons designs, this \nadministration underscores to every rogue regime in the world the value \nof nuclear arms, whether that value is real or not. This is the wrong \nmessage for the United States to send. In its place, we must find new \nways to demonstrate to countries around the world that these weapons \nare affordable, unusable, and undesirable.\n  Now is the wrong time to consider developing a new class of American \nnuclear arms. Instead of researching and developing new weapons, we \nmust redouble our efforts to secure the nuclear\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nweapons already in the world's inventories and safeguard the stores of \nnuclear materials scattered in unsecured facilities around the world. \nThere is simply no compelling need for a new generation of nuclear \nweapons. They will not add any meaningful value to our arsenal. But \nthey will undermine our efforts to stem the growth of nuclear \nstockpiles around the world while making America less secure and the \nrisks of war and catastrophic terrorism even greater.\n  The future is not about a return to the city-busting bombs of the \npast, nor smaller yield nuclear weapons that might blur the \ndistinction--in some minds--between conventional and nuclear arms. \nRather, the future is about eliminating the threat posed to us all by \nsuch weapons. Our strength and our power at this moment in history is \nunrivaled. Now is the time for bold leadership that makes the world \nsafer from nuclear dangers, not more eager for new weapons.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2004. I commend Chairman Warner and \nRanking Member Levin for their skillful stewardship.\n  I believe the committee completed its mark-up in near record time, \nwith one of the fastest subcommittee marks in history occurring at the \npanel I currently chair, the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities.\n  Nonetheless, Senator Jack Reed and I were able to provide funding for \na number of important programs. We focused not only on enhancing the \ncapabilities of our men and women in uniform, but also on those \ninitiatives that address threats we face right now here at home.\n  In fact, since Chairman Warner established the subcommittee in the \nWinter of 1999, most of the ``emerging threats'' have become current \nrealities. I am talking in particular about the use and potential use \nby terrorists of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\n  I am certainly thankful for the leadership of President Bush as we \ntry to navigate through this environment, one that includes apocalyptic \nterror groups acquiring and employing WMD.\n  Let us remember, day to day, it is the President of the United states \nwho is responsible for preventing terrorism where we live and work. I \nam confident President Bush is doing all he can to protect us.\n  He may not be popular in European cafes, universities, or newspapers, \nbut he gets results for us here at home. Foreign actors, be they \ngovernments, individuals, or groups, know our President will hold them \naccountable for terrorism against us. Perhaps more than any policy \naction or innovation, this posture contributes to success in achieving \na secure environment in which we find ourselves right now.\n  Up against the most asymmetric, organized, determined, and merciless \nenemy the United States has ever faced, we have not had a major terror \nattack in the homeland since beginning the Global War on Terrorism \nshortly after 9/11. In this urgent threat warning atmosphere, knock on \nwood, Mr. President.\n  Indeed, there have been recent attacks in Saudi Arabia, Israel and \nNorth Africa. At the same time, however, the State Department reports \nthat, globally, 2002 saw the lowest number of incidents of terrorism \nsince 1969, a 44 percent drop from 2001. That is the lowest number of \nattacks since the birth of modern terrorism.\n  I recall these facts because the nature of recent comments from \ncertain Members who suggest virtually every act of terrorism is somehow \nthe fault of our Commander in Chief. That is not only inaccurate but \ncounterproductive to the war against terrorism.\n  In closing, I would like to briefly summarize the funding \nauthorizations achieved by the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats & \nCapabilities for fiscal year 2004 include the following:\n  $88.4 million to field an additional 12 Weapons of Mass Destruction-\nCivil Support Teams (WMD-CST), resulting in a total of 44 teams by the \nend of 2004.\n  $76,6 million to the Chemical Biological Installation/Force \nProtection Program, doubling the number of bases, from 15 to 30, that \nwill be fully equipped with a highly effective suite of manual and \nautomated chemical and biological detection equipment.\n\n  $147.0 million in innovative technologies to combat terrorism and \ndefeat asymmetrical threats.\n  $135.0 million to rapidly accelerate the development and acquisition \nof unmanned systems such as UAVs.\n  $1.5 billion in university based research for transformational \ndefense technologies.\n  $10.7 billion for the Defense Science and Technology program, \nincluding an additional $515.0 million for critical, high-payoff \nscience and technology programs, including approximately $150.0 million \nfor technologies to combat terrorism.\n  $6.7 billion for the Special Operations Command, including an \nadditional $107.0 million for weapons systems, psychological operations \ncapabilities, and enhanced intelligence.\n  $450.8 million for the Department of Defense's Cooperative threat \nReduction (CTR) Program, as well as authorization for CTR projects and \nactivities outside the states of the Former Soviet Union, and one year \nauthority to waive the conditions that must be met before continuing \nthe Russian chemical demilitarization program at Schuch'ye.\n  Again, I commend Senators Warner and Levin. I also thank Senator Reed \nfor being an outstanding partner in completing the tasks given to our \npanel this year. We believe we are continuing the committee's \ninvestment in science and technology, cutting-edge systems, and efforts \nto prevent the proliferation of WMD.\n  I thank the Chair and I urge my colleagues to support the Fiscal Year \n2004 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to support this national \nDefense authorization bill, S. 1050, but I would like to speak candidly \nabout my reservations about it.\n  When I left the Senate in early 2001, weapon development and troop \ndeployment concerns indeed, even the idea of serious national security \nthreats seemed to be fading into the obscurity of our cold war past. \nOver the past 2\\1/2\\ years, this has changed. We now live in a world of \nmultiple and continuously emerging threats, emanating not only from \nstates but also from nonstate transnational groups.\n  What's more, we live in a time when America's superior armed services \nhave been called up for missions that embody the essence of defense \ntransformation. Defense transformation means that our country can \noverthrow the Taliban regime in Afghanistan 6,000 miles away almost \nsolely from the air. It has allowed special operations forces to train \nantiterrorist units in places such as Georgia and the Philippines. \nFinally, defense transformation has meant that military commanders can \ndirect precision-guided weapons at specific office buildings in \ndowntown Baghdad from a command room in Florida.\n  Today we debate the merits of this national defense bill and the \nimportant issues it raises regarding the future of weapons control and \nmilitary research, technology, and development. Let us first \nacknowledge and express gratitude to the men and women of our armed \nservices. We are proud of their successful wartime mission to liberate \nIraq. We wish them continued success in their peace time mission to \nsecure stability for the Iraqi people.\n  As we support our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, we must \nkeep in mind that their ultimate mission is to defend not only \nAmerica's security interests but also the cause of global security. I \nhave spoken about a new set of threats that require a transformation of \nour defense budget and priorities. I believe, however, that it is \nincumbent upon Congress to conceive of defense transformation--indeed \nour near-and short-term defense needs--in a way that will also seek to \nprotect world peace.\n  I am concerned about elements of S. 1050 that allow the Pentagon \ngreater flexibility in developing, testing, and producing new types of \nnuclear weapons. The diplomatic and security costs of even beginning \nresearch on these new types of nuclear weapons far outweigh any \nmarginal benefits of such weapons.\n  These new nuclear weapon initiatives will further weaken the already \nstruggling international efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. \nU.S. influence with the international community will erode if it seeks \nto upgrade U.S. nuclear weapons while demanding that other countries, \nsuch as Iran and North Korea, disarm.\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\n  Dr. Mohamed El Baradei, Director of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, recently said that instead of developing new nuclear weapons, \nthe U.S. should send a message to potential proliferators that, ``Even \nthough we have nuclear weapons, we are moving to get rid of them. We \nare going to develop a system of security that does not depend on \nnuclear weapons because that's the way we want the world to move.''\n  I agree with Dr. Baradei; I believe the best way to deter nations \ntrying to develop nuclear capabilities is to send the signal that the \nprospect of nuclear warfare is an idea confined to science fiction \nmovies.\n  I have supported the amendments offered by Senators Reed, Feinstein, \nand others intended to modify rather than repeal the 1994 Spratt-Furse \nprohibition on research and development of low-yield nuclear weapons. \nSecretary Rumsfeld has argued that these mini-nukes could be the ideal \nweapon for going after deeply buried stashes of chemical and biological \nweapons--the sort roguish regimes and terrorist groups like al-Qaida \nmight attempt to conceal.\n  But at the same time, the Pentagon is considering adapting existing \nconventional warheads for such bunker busting jobs. We don't need both \ntypes of weapons to do the same job. By dangerously treating nuclear \nweapons as just another explosive in the arsenal, rather than as a \ndeterrent weapon of last resort, researching low-yield nukes threatens \nto blur the line between conventional and non conventional weapons. \nGiven our interest in preserving the seriousness with which the world \nregards the nonproliferation treaty, we should not be doing anything in \nour own arsenals that would confuse this distinction.\n  I would also like to call attention to my amendment, S. 722, that \nwill help protect many endangered species. I am pleased that this \namendment passed.\n  I would also like to call attention to an amendment that I have \nsponsored along with Senator Boxer and Senator Warner regarding a \nnoncompetitive contract granted by the Department of Defense to \nHalliburton Co. for the reconstruction of Iraq. This amendment will \nensure that this no-bid contract gives way to a competitively bid \ncontract expeditiously. I am pleased by the bipartisan cooperation and \nSenator Warner's leadership in the passage of this amendment.\n  In recent weeks, I have become concerned with the lack of \ntransparency regarding this particular contract--worth up to $7 \nbillion--awarded in a no-bid process to Halliburton and Co.'s \nsubsidiary. The scope of the contract--both the actual task order and \nthe dollar amount--were not fully disclosed by the administration, and \ninformation leaked out about it piecemeal, when the Army was pressed \nfor it. It is extremely important that the Pentagon divulge information \nabout the contracts it awards in a public and systematic fashion.\n  I believe that this Defense authorization bill has merits and \nprovides comprehensive funding for the Department of Defense's needs. \nIt will effectively meet the needs of our men and women in the armed \nservices. I am, frankly, very concerned about its authorization of low-\nyield nuclear weapons research, ballistic missile development, and its \nreduction of the constraints on nuclear weapons testing.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on June 6, 2000, the National D-Day \nopened in New Orleans, LA. This museum was the culmination of a vision \nof the late Stephen Ambrose. Dr. Ambrose dedicated his life to \nchronicling American heroes, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was \nPresident Eisenhower who mentioned to Dr. Ambrose that World War II was \nwon in New Orleans because of the Higgins landing craft, designed by \nAndrew Jackson Higgins, which enabled Allied Forces to launch \nsuccessful amphibious invasions.\n  The National D-Day Museum has been an unquestioned success as a \ntourist attraction, meeting place for veterans, and teaching tool for \nmen and women, young and old, wishing to learn more about World War II. \nAlready, over 1 million people have come through the museum's turn-\nstyles.\n  America has a need to preserve its historical accounts and mementos \nfrom World War II. The National D-Day Museum is committed to such \npreservation. As a result of its mission, the museum has already had to \nexpand and is building a 250,000 square-foot addition. We must preserve \nthe stories and artifacts of the ``Greatest Generation.''\n  Accordingly, I submitted an amendment to designate the National D-Day \nMuseum as ``America's National World War II Museum.'' We owe it to the \nGreat Generation to maintain a museum that pays tribute to their great \nsacrifices so that we may live today in freedom.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to add my thoughts to the debate \non the defense budget for fiscal year 2004.\n  First and foremost, I want to thank the members of the United States \nArmed Forces for the excellent work that they are doing in the ongoing \nfight against terrorism, their efforts in Iraq, and the many missions \nthey have been assigned elsewhere at home and abroad. These dedicated \nmen and women do an exemplary job in every mission that they have been \nasked to undertake, often at great personal sacrifice. They spend time \naway from their homes and families in different parts of the country \nand the world, and are placed into harm's way in order to protect the \nAmerican people and our way of life. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to \nall our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and members of the Coast \nGuard for their selfless service.\n  I am pleased that this bill authorizes a 3.7-percent pay raise for \nour men and women in uniform, and that it includes a provision \nauthorizing additional pay for members of the Guard and Reserve who \nhave been called to active duty multiple times.\n  The men and women of our National Guard and Reserve are a cornerstone \nof our national defense, and we should ensure that they have adequate \npay and benefits. I am pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment to \ngive guardsmen and reservists the opportunity to enroll in TRICARE, the \nmilitary's health care program, whether or not they are on active duty. \nThe provision also would enable these personnel to elect to keep their \ncivilian health insurance for their families while on active duty with \na federal reimbursement program. We owe it to our guardsmen and \nreservists to give these options to help to ensure that they and their \nfamilies have access to affordable, stable health care coverage.\n  I have long advocated for the creation of an additional 23 Weapons of \nMass Destruction Civil Support Teams, which are staffed by full-time \nmembers of the National Guard. These important teams play a vital role \nin assisting local first responders in investigating and combating \nthese new threats. As the events of September 11, 2001, so clearly and \ntragically demonstrated, local first responders are on the front lines \nof combating terrorism and responding to other large-scale incidents. \nThe tragic events of September 11, the ongoing threat of terrorist \nactivities, and the ongoing military action in Iraq make the presence \nof at least one WMD-CST in each State all the more imperative.\n  Currently, there are 32 full-time WMD-CSTs and 23 part-time teams. As \na Senator representing one of the states without a full-time team, I \nwas pleased that last year's DoD authorization bill included a \nstatutory requirement that 23 additional full-time teams be \nestablished, and that at least one team be located in every State and \nterritory. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee for working with me to ensure that resources \nfor 12 of these 23 teams are provided in this bill. I look forward to \nworking with the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee to ensure that the resources authorized in this bill for the \nnew WMD-CSTs are appropriated.\n  I am also pleased that the committee report contains language asking \nthe Pentagon to include funding for the remaining 11 full-time WMD-CSTs \nin its fiscal year 2005 budget request. I urge the Secretary of Defense \nto do so, and to make every effort to select and begin staffing, \ntraining, and equipping the 12 new teams authorized by this bill as \nexpeditiously as possible. These teams will improve the overall \ncapability of Wisconsin and other States with part-time teams to \nrespond to potential WMD threats in the future.\n  On a related matter, as I noted on the floor earlier this week, I \nshare the\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nconcern expressed by many of our colleagues about a provision in the \nCommittee-passed bill that would repeal the 10-year ban on research and \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons, or so-called ``mini-nukes.'' \nLifting this ban could be the first step in a resumption of nuclear \ntesting and the creation of new classes of nuclear weapons, which I \noppose. I regret that the Senate failed to pass an amendment offered by \nSenators Feinstein and Kennedy, of which I was a cosponsor, that would \nhave reinstated this ban. While proponents of lifting the ban argue \nthat it will permit only study into the development of mini-nukes, I am \nconcerned that such study will be the first step toward the eventual \nresumption of an active nuclear program by the United States.\n  Nuclear weapons, low-yield or otherwise, are relics of the cold war. \nInstead of a true transformation during which outdated systems are \nreplaced with new technology geared toward combating emerging threats, \nthis bill regrettably continues the process of piling on expensive new \nversions of the weapon systems that we used to fight and win the cold \nwar. We cannot keep adding on to this behemoth defense budget. There \nare projects and programs that can and should be subtracted.\n  As an editorial in the May 20 New York Times points out:\n\n       [G]ood ideas for reforming the military are included [in \n     this bill]. But so are outdated submarines and jet fighters \n     designed for combat against the defunct Soviet threat. There \n     is a reasonable $1.7 billion for the next generation of \n     unmanned aerial drones and an unreasonable $42 billion for \n     anachronistic fighter planes. As social, education and health \n     care programs are being squeezed, the Pentagon is asking for \n     $9.1 billion to build a missile defense system that does not \n     work yet.\n\n  On that last point, I am deeply concerned about the $9.1 billion \nincluded in this bill for missile defense. We continue to pour billions \nand billions of taxpayer dollars into this still unproven program year \nafter year, despite the fact that DoD has not developed performance \ncriteria for this system and does not have an operational testing \nprogram in place to verify whether such criteria can be met.\n  I remain concerned about the President's December 2002 decision to \nfield a ground-based interceptor system by October 2004, despite the \nfact that the system has not yet been fully tested. I am troubled that, \ndespite this accelerated scheduled, the Pentagon has proposed cutting \nthe number of tests that were slated to be conducted on this costly \nprogram. While not everyone agrees on whether we actually need a \nmissile defense system, I think we can all agree that such a system \nshould work.\n  I was pleased to support an amendment offered by the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, that will require the Pentagon to develop \nperformance criteria for the missile defense system and an operational \ntest plan for these criteria. I am pleased that the Senate adopted a \nmodified version of the amendment, and I look forward to reviewing \nthese performance criteria.\n  I will support this flawed bill, but with some reluctance. While it \nprovides a well-deserved pay increase and other benefits for our men \nand women in uniform, it clings to the hardware of the cold war. Our \nmilitary personnel deserve top-notch equipment that will help them to \ncombat the threats of the 21st century. I regret that there is little \nin the way of true transformation in this bill, and I will continue to \nwork to change the cold war mentality of the Pentagon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the New York Times \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 20, 2003]\n\n                    The Defense Budget Spills Forth\n\n       Mammoth defense spending bills bloated with both new \n     military technology and obsolescent weaponry are being rushed \n     to breakneck approval this week as the administration \n     exploits Congress's weakness for leaving no defense \n     contractor unrewarded. The costliest defense budget since the \n     cold war--more than $400 billion and counting--is being \n     gaveled through by the Republican leadership in a \n     breathtaking few days of glancing debate. Good ideas for \n     reforming the military are included. But so are outdated \n     submarines and jet fighters designed for combat against the \n     defunct Soviet threat.\n       There is a reasonable $1.7 billion for the next generation \n     of unmanned aerial drones and an unreasonable $42 billion for \n     anachronistic fighter planes. As social, education and health \n     care programs are being squeezed, the Pentagon is asking for \n     $9 billion to build a missile defense system that does not \n     work yet.\n       The waste easily runs into the tens of billions of dollars, \n     making Congress's haste this week all the more outrageous. \n     The armed forces obviously deserve decent pay, better housing \n     and the most effective new technologies and weapons. But \n     these bills provide windfalls for the military, for defense \n     contractors and, not incidentally, for lawmakers who need the \n     hometown pork and fat-cat contributions being subsidized by \n     the new double-dip military-industrial complex. For all his \n     tough talk, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is not taking \n     on the generals and Congress to challenge the voracious old \n     ways of military budgeting.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, over 220,000 Guardsmen and Reservists \nwere mobilized as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Additionally, \nover 100,000 were activated as part of Operations Noble Eagle and \nEnduring Freedom. While the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act and \nthe Uniformed Servicemembers Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, \nprovide a number of protections of our Guard and Reserve personnel, \nthere are no Federal protections for the educational status of \nGuardsmen and Reservists involuntarily activated while participating in \nhigher education.\n  Currently, over 30 percent of Guard and Reserve personnel are \nenrolled in post-high school education. If they are activated while \nenrolled in higher-education, there are no safeguards to ensure that \ntheir academic status is preserved during activation; that they receive \nrefunds or credits for the portion of the school year they paid for but \ncould not complete to mobilization; that college grants and \nscholarships are preserved; or that they have a right to re-enroll in \nthe educational institution upon their return from active duty.\n  I submitted an amendment whereby involuntarily called up student \nReservists and Guardsmen would be able to take a leave of absence \nduring the activation and for 1 year after the conclusion of such \nmilitary duty from their institutions of higher education. Furthermore, \nthe student shall be entitled to be restored to the same educational \nstatus, without loss of credit, and offered a right to re-enroll at the \nsame educational institution where the student was enrolled prior to \nactivation. Grants and scholarships shall be reinstated. Moreover, \nstudents shall be entitled to a refund of tuition and fees for classes \nthey could not complete due to activation or be allowed to enroll in \nsuch classes subsequent to their re-enrollment at no cost.\n  Soon, thousands of Guardsmen and Reservists will be coming home from \nIraq and Afghanistan. They will be eager to re-enroll in colleges, \nuniversities, and trade schools. Let's help these heroes get back to \nthe classroom as effortlessly as possible.\n  Mr. BOXER. Mr. President, I support passage of the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense Authorization bill.\n  Our military men and women can rest assured that the Congress of the \nUnited States stands behind them--especially when they are doing so \nmuch for this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout world. I \nappreciate their dedication and service to this grateful nation.\n  That is why it is important to support the many good provisions that \nare in this bill--especially a well-earned pay raise and improved \nbenefits for our uniformed men and women. I applaud the work of Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin on these quality of life issues and am \nespecially pleased that they supported my amendment to study how we can \nprovide additional benefits to those who are so frequently deployed \nthat they are only home for hours at a time. This bill also includes a \nprovision to address the issue of children who are left behind when \nboth military parents are deployed to a combat zone--an important \npriority of mine since I was a member of the House of Representatives.\n  I am also pleased that the Congress passed my amendment to provide \nfairness to taxpayers and businesses by making sure that the Department \nof Defense replaces its sole source contract with Halliburton to \nprovide oil related services in Iraq with a contract that is subject to \nfull and open competition.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\n  However, this does not mean I support everything in this bill. Most \nalarmingly are the provisions in the legislation that advance the \nresearch and development of new high-tech nuclear weapons. These \nweapons will not make us more secure, but instead encourage other \nnations to join us in a new nuclear arms race. I urge the President to \nreverse his dangerous policy of advocating the development of new \n``usable'' nuclear weapons.\n  I am also disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to \naddress the issue of a future round of base closures. California was \ndisproportionally impacted by previous rounds of the base closure \nprocess. Even years later, my state continues to wait for the \nDepartment of Defense to meet its responsibility and provide funding \nfor the environmental cleanup of former military installations. For \nthese reasons, I believe the next round of base closures should not go \nforward in 2005 as scheduled.\n  It is my hope that these unfortunate shortcomings in the bill can be \naddressed either in a conference committee with the House or during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2004 defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as the war in Iraq demonstrated, our \ntroops are the finest in the world. Through their mastery of precision-\nguided weapons, they minimized casualties of noncombatants and \neffectively contained war's inevitable destruction. In just 21 days, \nthey liberated Iraq, a country almost the size of California, from a \nbrutal tyranny.\n  Many factors contributed to the success of the Iraq war. In my view, \nthe most important--and this, I believe, is true of any war--was \ntraining. To be strong in battle, soldiers must train as they fight. On \nU.S. training ranges, our troops engage in highly realistic, combat \nready exercises, preparing them to fight and protect themselves in \nbattle. This is what they deserve.\n  But gradually, those readiness exercises--so critical to the \nmilitary's training mission--are steadily being constrained and \ninhibited. Slowly, but surely, training simulations bear little \nconnection with the true-to-life. The cause is straightforward but very \ndisturbing: the extreme agenda of some environmental groups, whose \nhostile lawsuits are precipitating a crisis in training .\n  Environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council \nand the Center for Biological Diversity have launched an unconscionable \nwar on the military. They believe there are no compromises, even when \nthe issue involves protecting and preparing our troops for battle. They \nwould rather file lawsuits--something they are quite good at, \nincidentally--than find commonsense solutions to balance environmental \nprotection with the best military training available.\n  These lawsuits are gradually eroding not just the land available for \ntraining and readiness, but are gravely diminishing the actual training \nexercises and live-fire simulations that are so critical to prepare for \nreal-life combat.\n  Despite the claims made by environmental groups, the Pentagon has \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. The \nevidence is overwhelming. But land development is fast encroaching upon \nmilitary facilities, driving wildlife and endangered species into the \nrelative sanctuary of training ranges.\n  The military has made environmental accommodations time and time \nagain, but there is only so much it can do. The flood of environmental \nlawsuits is diverting the military away from its all-important training \nmission. As a result, training slowly but surely is dying a death of a \nthousand cuts.\n  There are too many egregious examples to recount here. The situation \nfacing Camp Pendleton in California bears special mention. Camp \nPendleton is considered the premier training base for the Marines. \nBecause of a lawsuit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council to \nlist the gnatcatcher as endangered, 57 percent of the base may become \n``critical habitat,'' which in effect means no training and readiness \nexercises in that area.\n  Also, there are 17 miles of beach at Camp Pendleton--because of \nenvironmental restrictions, only 200 yards of beach are available to \npractice amphibious landings. All military vehicles that come ashore \nduring an amphibious landing are restricted to designated roads. Troops \ncan only come ashore in single file columns, which is hardly a good \nsimulation of actual warfighting conditions.\n  To address these problems, the Pentagon has a reasonable, commonsense \nproposal to clarify existing environmental laws. Contrary to statements \nby some of my colleagues, the Pentagon is not seeking blanket \nexemptions from current laws. To say otherwise is simply false.\n  Take, for example, the provision clarifying how the Endangered \nSpecies Act applies to training bases. DoD wants to continue a policy \nfirst implemented by the Clinton administration's Fish and Wildlife \nService. The proposal would codify Integrated Natural Resource \nManagement Plans, INRMPSs, in place of critical habitat designations.\n  INRMPs, which are required to provide for, among other things, fish \nand wildlife management, land management, forest management, fish and \nwildlife-oriented recreation, and wetland protection, allow the \nmilitary to balance species protection and training needs.\n  DoD's proposal explicitly requires DoD to consult with the Fish and \nWildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service under \nsection 7 of ESA. Also, the Interior Secretary must approve INRMPs in \nwriting. Other provisions of ESA, as well as statutes such as the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, also would continue to apply.\n  Thus it is simply unconscionable that this is characterized as a \n``sweeping exemption.'' My Democratic colleagues also contend that such \na clarification isn't necessary because ESA already contains national \nsecurity exemptions. Ironically, while complaining about a proposed \nprovision that, in effect, continues to subject DoD to ESA, my \ncolleagues want to pursue exemptions under current law. In practice, \nthose exemptions mean DoD could ignore existing statutory requirements \naltogether under ESA.\n  Yesterday, 51 Senators voted for an amendment sponsored by Senators \nLautenberg and Jeffords that effectively guts the ESA provision in the \nfiscal year 2004 Defense reauthorization bill. The amendment upsets the \nbalance stuck between species protection and training. It tilts \nirresponsibly in favor of species protection, which is not the mission \nof DoD.\n  The amendment says DoD must ``conserve the species,'' rather than, as \nstated in the bills original language, provide ``conservation \nbenefits.'' The distinction is significant because ``conserve' means \nDoD must recover species. This is an unacceptably high threshold, one \nthat even Fish and Wildlife has been unable to meet under ESA.\n  According to original 1973 ESA, conserve means ``to use and use all \nmethods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered \nspecies or threatened species to the point at which the measures \nprovided pursuant to this act are no longer necessary. Such methods and \nprocedures include but are not limited to all activities associated \nwith scientific resources and management, such as research, law \nenforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance promulgation, live \ntrapping, and transplanting.'' As is obvious, the burdens on DoD \ntraining and readiness would be enormous.\n  DoD opposes the amendment because it could have perverse and \nunintended consequences, such as removing the Fish and Wildlife \nService's flexibility to make decisions based on the differing \ncircumstances facing each training range. Also, DoD and the Department \nof the Interior believe it will lead to more lawsuits, not less--\nexactly what DoD is trying to prevent.\n  The question remains: What should DoD's most important focus be, \ntraining or recovering the gnatcatcher?\n  I am also very disturbed by statements an characterizations of DoD's \ntraining predicament. Some Senators alluded to the March 13 testimony \nof EPA Administrator Christie Whitman before my committee. Governor \nWhitman, said, ``I don't believe that there is a training mission \nanywhere in the country that is being held up or not taking place \nbecause of the environmental protection regulations.'' With all due \nrespect to Governor Whitman, the EPA does not have jurisdiction over \nthe Endangered Species Act,\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nwhich, of all the existing laws addressed in the Pentagon's proposal, \nis responsible for the most serious training restrictions.\n  Moreover, I am extremely troubled by the way some Senators have \nsummarized a General Accounting report on military encroachment. To say \n``the GAO found the military has presented no evidence that the \nEndangered Species Act has impaired training'' is utterly false and \nirresponsible.\n  Here is what the GAO said about encroachment in its report:\n\n       Over time, the impact of encroachment on training ranges \n     has gradually increased. While the effect varies by service \n     and individual installation, in general encroachment has \n     limited the extent to which training ranges are available or \n     the types of training that can be conducted. This limits \n     units' ability to train as they would expect to fight and/or \n     requires units to work around the problem.\n\n  Barry Holman, director of the GAO's Defense Capabilities and \nManagement section, and author of the June 2002 encroachment report, \nstated in his testimony before the House Government Reform Committee on \nMay 16, 2002:\n\n       One thing I want to make clear, I would not want anyone to \n     conclude from looking at that report that GAO is saying `no \n     data, no problem.' We're not saying that. I think it's very \n     clear . . . that there are limitations on training.\n\n  In addition to the ESA clarification in the base bill, I filed an \namendment to clarify how the Superfund law applies to military training \nand readiness. Though it appears this issue will not be addressed as \npart of the Defense authorization bill this year, it does deserve some \nexplanation.\n  Live-fire training, which is the ``capstone event of a unit's \ntraining cycle,'' has come under heavy fire from environmental groups. \nThe Army at Fort Richardson is engaged in a lawsuit that could shut \ndown firing munitions at Eagle River Flats range. If environmentalists \nsucceed, live fire operations at every Army range--more than 400 \nsites--could be severely constrained, seriously threatening training \nand readiness for our men and women in uniform.\n  This suit is not an isolated incident--there is another one much like \nit regarding the range at Vieques in Puerto Rico. The pattern is clear, \nand the Committee on Environment and Public Works received testimony as \nto the real agenda behind this pattern of lawsuits.\n  Describing yet another lawsuit by an eco-radical group against the \nDepartment of Defense, witness Frank Gaffey, president and CEO of the \nCenter for Security Policy, stated illuminatingly ``a plaintiff in the \nlawsuit was Melanie Dutchen who was described in the New York Times as \nan Anchorage activist with Greenpeace who said, `Obviously the hope of \nthis litigation is that delay will lead to cancellation.' She went on \nto say, `That is what we always hope for in these suits.' I believe \nthis is sort of an instructive insight into why the Defense Department \nis concerned, not only about the circumstances that you personally \nobserved, in terms of limitations and impediments to training, but the \ntrain wreck that is coming. It is not something that is coming up by \naccident. It is coming about, I believe, by people, at least some of \nwhom, have very little interest in the readiness of our military.''\n  My amendment will try to stop this by clarifying how RCRA and CERCLA \napply to live-fire training ranges. I worked closely with the Pentagon \nand State officials--in particular, Doug Benevento of Colorado's \nDepartment of Public Health and Environment--in drafting compromise \nlanguage that will balance training needs with environmental \nprotection.\n  This amendment would codify and confirm longstanding regulatory \npolicy of EPA and every State concerning regulation of munitions on \noperational ranges under RCRA and CERCLA. The amendment excludes \nmilitary munitions from the definition of ``solid waste'' under CERCLA. \nThat way, the military can perform live fire training exercises without \nhaving to break up those exercises with extensive, time-consuming \nclean-up operations.\n  But this change would still offer environmental protections under \nexisting law. Again, as stated previously, this is not an exemption. \nCleanup of operational ranges is not required so long as material stays \non range, but if such material moves off range, it still must be \naddressed under existing law. Also, if munitions cause an ``imminent \nand substantial endangerment on range, EPA will still retain its \nauthority to address it on range under CERCLA.\n  If we fail to address these and other issues the Pentagon has put \nbefore us, we are doing a great disservice to our men and women in \nuniform. Unfortunately, it appears that Congress will pass only a few \npieces of the Pentagon's proposal this year. I think it is imperative, \nfor the sake of our troops, that we address the remaining pieces next \nyear.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Senate version of \nthe fiscal year 2004 national Defense authorization bill.\n  First, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee for their work on this vital \nlegislation. As a former member of the committee, I am acutely aware of \nthe intense effort required to bring the National Defense Authorization \nAct to the floor every year. For the chairman and ranking member to be \nable to bring this bill to the floor with a unanimous vote out of \ncommittee is a testament to their leadership. I would also like to \nthank each of my colleagues who are members of the committee for their \ninvaluable contributions to this bill.\n  I will take a few moments and discuss some of the provisions of the \nbill that I believe are important to providing the men and women of our \narmed services the tools they need to protect our Nation.\n  First and foremost, I am encouraged that the committee has supported \nthe President's shipbuilding budget that will provide the Navy with an \nadditional seven ships. As the former Chair of the Seapower \nSubcommittee, I have been concerned for many years about the downward \ntrend in naval shipbuilding that was moving us inexorably towards a \n250-ship Navy or less. The administration proposed in its budget to \nprocure seven new Navy ships in fiscal year 2004 and a total of 52 new \nNavy ships through fiscal year 2009. While this results in an average \nbuild rate of 8.6 ships, almost at the 8.9 ships per year necessary to \nmaintain a 310-ship fleet, this average is skewed by the 14 ships the \nNavy says it intends to build in fiscal year 2009. Fourteen ships is \ntwice the number of ships we have in the bill for fiscal year 2004.\n  Indeed, if we just look at the proposed shipbuilding plan for the \nnext 5 years, from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2008, there are only \n38 ships in the plan, an average of 7.6 ships per year. This is an \nimprovement but still results in the inability to maintain a 310-ship \nNavy, much less the 360- to 375-ship Navy the current Chief of Naval \nOperations has said is required to support his Sea Power 21 vision.\n  We can't afford to risk this essential component of our worldwide \ndefense force. After all, 80 percent of the planet's population lives \nalong the coastal plains of the world, and it is the Navy that has the \ncapability to project power in regional coastal flashpoints around the \nglobe--a capability that is imperative if we are to maintain military \nsuperiority and defend America's national interests in the 21st \ncentury.\n  It is the Navy we increasingly rely on to engage the enemy away from \nour shores. As we saw during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Navy provides \nour only means of assured access. Today we are engaged in Southwest \nAsia and other littoral areas of the world away from our cold war bases \nin Europe, Japan, and Korea. Our inability to land troops in Turkey \nduring Operation Iraqi Freedom and our withdrawal from bases in Saudi \nArabia only highlight the need for a flexible, mobile sea-based \ndefense.\n  The strength of those surface action groups and carrier battle groups \nare our major surface combatants. They provide air defense, launch \nTomahawk missiles to strike the enemy, interdict opposing naval \nforces--they truly are the backbone of the fleet. We must do everything \nwe can to ensure that we maintain a strong and healthy shipbuilding \nbase particularly with respect to major surface combatants, for it is \nonly through healthy competition that fresh ideas and reduced costs can \nbe achieved.\n  To maintain a 116-ship surface combatant force, given the projected \nservice life of 35 years for DDG-51 Class ships, requires a sustained \nreplacement\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nrate of over three ships per year. If you assume a 30-year service \nlife, which is more realistic historically, sustaining even the 116-\nship surface combatant force would require annual procurement of almost \n4 DDGs each year.\n  I believe it is in the vital national interest of America to procure \na minimum of three major surface combatants a year, not just this year \nor next, but in every year. I am encouraged that this bill supports \nthat level of procurement.\n  We must also look to the future and work to increase the warfighting \ncapability and operating efficiency of these Aegis destroyers as they \nage. We must embark on a modernization program now to incorporate new \ntechnologies and systems that will allow us to operate these vessels \nmore effectively with reduced manpower. This bill begins that process \nby authorizing $20 million for the design, nonrecurring engineering and \ninstallation planning of DDG-51 modernization and optimized manning \nupgrades for incorporation on fiscal year 2004 and/or fiscal year 2005 \nnew construction ships.\n  The bill also supports the President's request for $158 million for \nthe Littoral Combat Ship in the R accounts. However, just as the \ncommittee is, I am concerned about counting on an undeveloped ship \nconcept to provide the 375-ship force structure called for by the Chief \nof Naval Operations and its concomitant impact on the major surface \ncombatant force. I support the bill's call for a determination, through \na cycle of analysis and experimentation, of the ship's ability to \ndeliver the expected capabilities.\n  Furthermore, the bill correctly identified the looming gap in attack \nsubmarines by noting that decommissioning the USS Jacksonville, rather \nthan refueling her, would put the Navy below the QDR recommended attack \nsubmarine force of 55 submarines. In fact, the Navy also recognized \nthis gap and placed the refueling of the USS Jacksonville on the Navy's \nUnfunded Program List to support near term submarine force structure. \nThis bill authorizes $248 million for that refueling overhaul, noting \nthe need for the refueling as ``compelling.''\n  I cannot express strongly enough my belief that we must fund \nshipbuilding to reflect the increasing demands we place on the Navy. \nThe $12 billion included in this bill is needed and appreciated, but it \nonly represents about 3 percent of the total defense budget. For all we \nexpect of our Navy in today's world, we must do everything we can to \nprovide them with the ships and weapons systems they need.\n  In regard to the homeland security role of the Department of Defense, \nthe bill authorizes an additional $400 million over the President's \nbudget request to expand unit capabilities, field additional sensor \nsystems, and prepare to engage the threat here and abroad. For example, \nthe bill contains an additional $107 million for those special \noperations forces that have been so effective in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. At home, DoD will be able to \ndeploy an additional 12 Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams \nwith the funds provided in this bill. In addition, it also provides \n$173 million for chemical and biological detection and protection \ntechnologies such as those being developed in my home State of Maine.\n  The University of Maine system has been on the forefront of the \ndevelopment of chemical and biological sensors and decontamination \nsystems. The bill provides them with $1 million this year to begin the \ndevelopment of an environmentally friendly photocatalytic \ndecontamination agent that holds much promise for the safe and rapid \ndecontamination of exposed personnel as well as for the remediation of \nchemical agent and manufacturing and storage facilities.\n  It is this type of investment in new science and technology efforts \nthat will provide our forces with the advanced capabilities we saw used \nso effectively over the past 2 months. I am encouraged that this bill \nprovides $10.7 billion for the science and technology accounts which \nbrings us close to the goal of setting aside 3 percent of the defense \nbudget to invest in the ``seed corn'' of our future military \ncapability. From that investment we see the expansion in our research, \ndevelopment and test and evaluation efforts as evidenced by the \ncommitment of $63.2 billion toward those activities, including over a \nbillion in DD(X) destroyer R\n  The bill also addresses the need to modernize our military \ninfrastructure by authorizing over $9.0 billion in military \nconstruction, an increase of $373 million over the budget request \nincluding the addition of $200 million for quality-of-life projects for \nmembers and their families. This bill wisely increases investments in \nstateside facilities while reducing investments overseas while the \nUnited States assesses its long-term overseas basing requirements.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the bill continues our commitment to \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces and their families through the \nenactment of several important pay and benefits provisions. First, it \ninstitutes a 3.7 percent across-the-board pay raise and once again \nprovides an additional targeted pay raise for the senior \nnoncommissioned officers and midcareer personnel who are the backbone \nof our military. The bill contains several provisions which will \ndirectly aid the families of service members such as an increase in the \nfamily separation allowance and a high-tempo allowance of $1,000 per \nmonth for those troops and sailors deployed away from home for extended \nperiods of time.\n  Can any of us who watched the poignant homecoming of the USS Abraham \nLincoln earlier this month after 10 months at sea, the longest carrier \ndeployment since Vietnam, doubt that those dedicated sailors and \nmarines had earned every penny?\n  In closing, let me say that I hope that as we move this bill towards \nfinal passage, we do everything we can to strengthen the bill for those \nbrave young men and women who defend our Nation each and every day. We \nmust do no less.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment to \nthe Defense Authorization bill which Senator Voinovich and I have \nsubmitted. Our amendment would, among other things, provide for the \ncreation of a National Security Personnel System encompassing the \nDefense Department's 735,000 civilian employees.\n  In April, the Department delivered to Congress a proposal to grant \nthe Secretary of Defense authority to dramatically restructure the \nDepartment's civilian personnel system. The proposal was designed to \nprovide the Department with the flexibility and agility it needs so it \ncan respond to sudden changes in our security environment. To \naccomplish this objective, the Department's proposal would give \nSecretary Rumsfeld not only the personnel flexibilities Congress \ngranted to the Secretary of Homeland Security, but also additional \nauthority to unilaterally waive many personnel regulations.\n  Of primary importance to the Department of Defense were the following \nthree personnel flexibilities: First, the authority to replace the \ncurrent General Schedule, 12-grade pay system with a performance-based \npay system in which workers would no longer be awarded an automatic, \nacross-the-board pay increase; second, the authority to conduct on-the-\nspot hiring for hard-to-fill positions; and third, the authority to \nraise collective bargaining to the national level rather than \nnegotiating with more than 1,000 local units.\n  Our proposal would grant the Secretary these authorities. It would \nprovide the Secretary of Defense with the three pillars of his \npersonnel proposal and thus would allow for a needed overhaul of an \nantiquated system. But we do not give the Secretary all he asked for; \ninstead, we have attempted to strike the right balance between \npromoting a flexible system and protecting employee rights.\n  Over the past 3 weeks, Senator Voinovich and I have repeatedly \nreached out to a wide variety of interested parties in an attempt to \nput together a bipartisan proposal. As of today, I believe we have made \na considerable amount of headway toward forging a consensus.\n  For example, in certain areas, such as employee appeals, I am not \nprepared to support granting the Secretary the authority to immediately \ndo away with the Merit System Protection Board in order to create an \ninternal appeals process. Instead, my amendment allows for a gradual \ntransition from the MSPB to a new appeals process. During the \ntransition, the Department will consult with MSPB while it develops and \ntests a new appeals process.\n  I am also not prepared to grant the Secretary the authority to waive \nthe\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\ncollective bargaining rights of employees. Instead, my amendment places \nstatutory deadlines of 180 days on the amount of time any one issue can \nbe under consideration by one of the three components of the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority. This alone should make a significant \ndifference in the timeliness of the bargaining process, and prevent the \noccasional case from dragging on for years.\n  The bottom line is, we believe that our amendment would give the \nSecretary the authorities he needs to manage and sustain a civilian \nworkforce some 735,000 strong. Our amendment would grant the \nadministration's request for a new pay system, on-the-spot hiring \nauthority, and collective bargaining at the national level, not \nindividually with 1300 local union affiliates. In addition, our \namendment would enable the Secretary to offer separation pay incentives \nfor employees nearing retirement; to contract with individuals for \nservices performed outside the United States in support of the Defense \nDepartment; to offer special pay rates for highly qualified experts \nlike scientists, engineers and medical personnel; and to help mobilized \nFederal civilian employees whose military pay is less than their \nFederal civilian pay.\n  The House Armed Services Committee has already included a personnel \namendment in their own authorization bill. For that reason, I was \ndismayed to learn that our amendment was not deemed ``relevant'' to the \nunderlying legislation, and therefore shall not be made part of the \nSenate's bill.\n  But I have worked hard to find a consensus approach, and I don't \nintend to stop until this goal has been achieved. I believe that the \nHouse approach can be improved upon. This is why, on Friday, I plan to \nre-introduce this legislation as a free-standing bill and to hold a \nhearing on it the first week of June. Quite simply, I believe civil \nservice personnel reform of this magnitude is too important an issue \nfor the Senate to remain silent.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with Senator Voinovich and me as we \ncontinue our efforts on this very important issue. In addition, I would \nlike to thank Senators Warner and Levin for all the advice and input \nthey have already provided. In addition to serving as ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin is a senior member of the \nGovernmental Affair Committee, which I chair. As such, he brings \nexpertise to the process from both perspectives. I hope that the bill I \nintroduce on Friday will enjoy his support and that of the chairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I will join my colleagues in voting to \napprove the 2004 Defense authorization bill. This legislation provides \na significant increase to our defense budget, a total of $400.5 \nbillion, $17.9 billion more than was authorized for this year. This is \nthe largest defense budget in our Nation's history, and, for the most \npart, it could not come at a more important time.\n  This bill is good for our armed services, and crucial for the \nsecurity of our country. Above all else, it makes a substantial \ninvestment in our military's most important assets--our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines. It provides a 3.7 percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for all men and women in uniform and introduces a new \nhealth care benefit to Reserve and National Guard personnel. In \naddition, it funds important national security programs to curb the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction, with $450 million going towards \nthe Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to safeguard \nnuclear stockpiles and fissile material within the former Soviet Union. \nIt ramps up research and development accounts for counterterrorism \ntechnologies as well as for intelligence and Special Operations \nresources.\n  To respond to emerging threats to our country, these investments are \ncrucial components of the Defense authorization bill. I am also \nespecially pleased that the Senate accepted without dissent, my \namendment to establish a new initiative to assist States and \ncommunities in hiring firefighters. As we saw so vividly on September \n11, our firefighters play an integral part in responding to and \nprotecting our people from terrorist attacks. No homeland security \nstrategy can ignore the crucial role that firefighters play in keeping \nour Nation safe. My amendment, which was approved by the Senate, \nauthorizes the Department of Homeland Security to invest over $3 \nbillion over the next 3 years in partnership with States and local \ngovernments to hire firefighters so that communities are better \nprepared to respond to potential acts of terrorism.\n  As this amendment underscores, our States play crucial roles in \nprotecting our security. And the underlying bill supports a number of \nmilitary initiatives that are particularly supported by the State of \nConnecticut. Since the days of the Revolutionary War, Connecticut has \nrightly taken pride in its disproportionately large role in \ncontributing to the U.S. arsenal, earning it the nickname the \n``Provision State.''\n  The 2004 Defense authorization bill continues this strong tradition, \ngreatly outfitting the Nation's armed services and provisioning \nadvanced technology from Connecticut. The projects funded in this bill \nfrom Army helicopters and Air Force fighters to new advances in \nsubmarine technology, will allow America's military to prosecute its \nwar on terror from every corner of the globe. Included in this bill is \n$1 billion to fund the procurement of 36 additional UH-60 Blackhawk \nhelicopters, manufactured by one of my State's leading manufacturers, \nSikorsky. These aircraft have proven themselves repeatedly in combat on \nair assault and medical evacuation missions, as well as in peacekeeping \nmissions providing important cargo and personnel transport.\n  This bill also authorizes a multiyear procurement and $2 billion in \n2004 for a Virginia class submarine, manufactured in Groton. Production \nof this next generation ship will further enable the Navy to extend its \nreach to the coasts of every continent, staying undetected as it \nperforms various missions from special operations and intelligence-\ngathering to precision guided missile strikes.\n  The bill also funds our force's next-generation fighter aircraft, the \nF/A-22 and Joint Strike Fighter, which will be outfitted with the \nfinest engines in the world, developed at Pratt and Whitney. \nProcurement of these planes will maintain U.S. air superiority--\nequipping pilots with unprecedented speed, stealth, and advanced \nmunitions, and transforming the Nation's military into a 21st century \nforce.\n  I believe these investments will save lives in both the near and long \nterm, and they will strengthen the military industrial base that is so \ncrucial to the long-term viability of our military. I am pleased that \nthis authorization bill continues Secretary Rumsfeld's initiative to \ntransform the military and respond to terrorist threats to our Nation. \nBut I would be remiss if I did not enter into this record the serious \nreservations I have with this bill.\n  In particular, I am deeply concerned about the steps this legislation \ntakes toward developing new tactical nuclear weapons. Despite the good-\nfaith efforts of some of my colleagues, this Chamber failed to act as a \ncheck on an Executive bent on rolling back decades of strategic arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation policies. At the President's \nrecommendation, this bill repeals the 1993 Spratt-Furse provision that \nbarred the Government from developing low-yield nuclear weapons. It \nalso funds the study of a high-yield bunker-busting nuclear earth \npenetrator. Both weapons are part of the administration's long-term \nplan to field tactical nuclear weapons in war, as outlined in the 2001 \nNuclear Posture Review.\n  The defenders of these provisions believe that such weaponry will \nenhance America's security by enabling the United States to devastate \nterrorist targets in a more contained environment. They claim that the \nU.S. use of nuclear weapons during a war will not set an egregious \nprecedent for other nations to begin fielding their own tactical \nnuclear arsenal. And they claim that by lifting the ban simply on \nresearch, we are not opening a new chapter of the nuclear era.\n  They are dead wrong. And I am gravely disturbed by this shift in U.S. \nnonproliferation policy. In 2000, the United States joined the other \npermanent U.N. Security Council members in a declaration of an \n``unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of a\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty on general and \ncomplete disarmament under strict and effective international \ncontrol.''\n  This declaration was not made on a whim. This was the culmination of \ndecades of diplomacy that has led to the worldwide movement in arms \ncontrol. But today, with this legislation, we are taking a considerable \nstep away from the goal stated at the 2000 Non-Proliferation Treaty \nConference. While we insist that others disarm and cease their \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction, we are initiating plans to \nuse new atomic weapons on the battlefield.\n  As our Armed Forces hone their conventional abilities to surgically \nstrike with increasingly explosive force, it seems peculiar that the \nUnited States would now take steps backwards, and devote precious \nresources to expanding our nuclear arsenal. Our most recent operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq have demonstrated that the United States far \nexceeds any other nation in its ability to strike with nonnuclear \nweapons anywhere in the world with great precision, and minimal \ncollateral damage. Rather than capitalizing on these new advantages in \nwarfare, the administration's tactical nuclear policy, would actually \nleave the Nation less secure, and undercut our government's 50-year \nattempts at averting nuclear war.\n  But all in all, in spite of these provisions, I believe that this \nbill's passage is critical to sustaining our national security. \nAlthough major combat operations have ended in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nour military continues to be engaged in low-intensity conflict in this \nhighly unstable region of the world. Our Armed Forces--both Active Duty \nand Reserve--stand ready to complete their missions in this Nation's \nongoing campaign against terror, to stabilize the region, and win the \npeace.\n  To do this, they will need the resources provided in this bill. For \nthat reason, I have supported this legislation, and hope that the House \nand Senate Conferees move quickly toward a final version, so that this \nCongress will swiftly approve necessary authorizations for America's \nmen and women in uniform.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support S. 1050, \nthe fiscal year 2004 Defense Authorization bill. This legislation funds \n$400.5 billion for defense programs, which is 3.2 percent or $17.9 \nbillion above the amount appropriated by Congress last year. The \nDefense Authorization bill would authorize appropriations to purchase \nnew weapons systems and funds research and development for new weapons \nsystems, funds operations and maintenance for the services, provides \npay and quality of life improvements for service members and funds \nmilitary construction projects at military bases.\n  A number of provisions in this bill go a long way to ensure our \nservice members get the benefits they deserve. I am pleased the Senate \nincluded a provision which I offered as an amendment that was adopted \nby the committee that would eliminate the remaining so-called ``pay \ncomparability gap'' between military pay and civilian pay. This \namendment would tie subsequent military pay raises after 2006 with \nincreases in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). As a former ranking \nmember and long-time member on the Personnel Subcommittee when Senator \nJohn Glenn was the chairman, my experience with capping military raises \nbelow ECI during the last three decades shows that such caps inevitably \nlead to significant retention problems among second-term and career \nservicemembers.\n  Those retention problems cost our Nation more in the long run in \nterms of lost military experience, decreased readiness, and increased \ntraining costs. Since military pay was last comparable with private \nsector pay in 1982, military pay raises have lagged a cumulative 6.4 \npercent behind private sector wage growth--although recent efforts by \nCongress have reduced the gap significantly from its peak of 13.5 \npercent in 1999. Our efforts in 1999 increased pay raises, reformed the \npay tables, took 12,000 servicemembers off of food stamps, and \nestablished a military Thrift Savings Plan.\n  A key principal of the all volunteer force (AVF) is that military pay \nraises must match private sector pay growth, as measured by ECI. The \nSenate's action in this area will send a strong message of support to \nour servicemembers and women and their families that will continue to \npromote high morale, better quality-of-life, and ultimately a more \nready military force.\n  For the past 12 years, I have offered legislation on concurrent \nreceipt. This matter is of great significance to many of our country's \nmilitary retirees, because it would reverse existing, unfair \nregulations that strip retirement pay from military retirees who are \nalso disabled, and costs them any realistic opportunity for post-\nservice earnings. Last year, I was pleased that the committee, for the \nfirst time, included an authorization to begin to address a \nlongstanding inequity in the compensation of military retirees' pay \nover previous attempts in the past.\n  I am disappointed that Senator Harry Reid was unable to offer his \namendment on concurrent receipt, because the amendment was not ruled \nrelevant under an unanimous consent agreement that was passed by the \nleadership of the Senate. We must do more to restore retirement pay for \nthose military retirees who are disabled. I have stated this before, \nand I am compelled to reiterate now--retirement pay and disability pay \nare distinct types of pay. Retirement pay is for service rendered \nthrough 20 years of military service. Disability pay is for physical or \nmental pain or suffering that occurs during and as a result of military \nservice. In this case, members with decades of military service receive \nthe same compensation as similarly disabled members who served only a \nfew years; this practice fails to recognize their extended, more \ndemanding careers of service to our country. This is patently unfair, \nand I will continue to work diligently with the committee to correct \nthis inequity for all career military servicemembers who are disabled.\n\n  We have a military force that continues to rely more on the Reserve \nComponents--men and women in the National Guard and Reserves--to go to \nwar and to perform other critical military tasks abroad and at home. \nMany combat, combat support and other support missions are being \ncarried out on the backs of our active and Reserve Component forces--\nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\n  National Guard and Reserve servicemembers are performing many vital \ntasks: direct involvement in military operations to liberate Iraq in \nthe air, on the ground, and on the sea; guarding nuclear power plants, \nour borders, and our airports in the United States; providing support \nto the War on Terrorism through guarding, interrogating, and extending \nmedical services to al-Qaida detainees; rebuilding schools in \nhurricane-stricken Honduras and fighting fires in our western states; \noverseeing civil affairs in Bosnia; and augmenting aircraft carriers \nshort on active duty sailors with critical skilled enlisted ratings \nduring at-sea exercises, as well as during periods of deployment.\n  I believe that the civilian and uniformed leadership of our Armed \nForces and the Congress must recognize this involvement, and, at a \nminimum, provide equal benefits for reserve component servicemembers \nwhen they put on the uniform and perform their weekend drills or other \ncritical training evolutions. Reservists, on duty, who resemble their \nactive duty counterparts during training evolutions and are deployed at \ntimes around the world, should be treated equally when the \nadministration and Congress provide for quality of life benefits.\n  I am pleased at the inclusion of language authorizing a Selective Re-\nenlistment Bonus (SRB) for National Guard and Reserve service members \nwhen they are mobilized under a Presidential Select Reserve Call-up and \nthey re-enlist during that period. National Guardsmen and Reservists \nare prohibited from receiving SRB payments until they get off active \nduty or mobilization status, sometimes 1 or 2 years later.\n  The Senate has also authorized Survivor Benefit Plan, SBP, benefits \nto survivors of National Guard and Reserve service members who die \nwhile performing inactive duty training or weekend drills. This \nlegislation provides equity with active duty servicemembers and is \nconsistent with\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\nDefense Department regulations when National Guardsmen and Reservists \nare mobilized under a Presidential Select Reserve Call-up.\n  Since January, there have been 13 Reserve Component deaths during \nweekend military training while their units were preparing for \nOperations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom where families of \nNational Guard and Reservists did not receive the Survivor Benefit \npayments.\n  The Senate has also authorized Commanders' pay for National Guardsmen \nand Reservists, similar to the pay that active duty commanding officers \nand commanders receive.\n  Additionally, the Senate Authorization bill removes and arbitrary cap \non commissary privileges for drilling reservists and National \nGuardsmen, making the benefit similar to the benefit similar to the \nbenefit of authorized for active duty servicemembers.\n  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) continue to be of interest to me. \nOperations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been watershed events for \nmilitary utilization of UAVs. Increased use in the future as new war \nfighting capabilities come on line is key to our militaries strategy \nfor future conflicts. During the 1999 Yugoslav air campaign only three \nUAV systems were used. There are nine UAV systems currently deployed \nand in extensive use in Iraq. The Army's Shadow, Hunter, and Pointer, \nthe Marine Corps' Pioneer and Dragon Eye; the Air Force's Global Hawk, \nPredator and the Force Protection Surveillance System; and, the Navy's \nSilver Fox.\n  The Silver Fox is a small, inexpensive UAV with tremendous \napplication, particularly in downed pilot search and air rescue, border \npatrol operations, tactical support for ground troops and SOF, \nsubmarine detection, marine mammal detection efforts and other critical \nreconnaissance missions. Ninety Silver Fox systems were deployed for \nOperation Iraqi Freedom with great success. Additional resources should \nbe afforded to the unmanned aerial vehicle programs. Low cost, \ninnovative systems, like the Silver Fox, deserve considerable support \nby the committee and I strongly support this effort. I am extremely \nplease the Senate included a UAV pilot program to study the potential \nuses of UAVs on our borders.\n  As part of its consideration of this bill, the Senate approved an \namendment I sponsored with Senators Session, Lindsey Graham, and Bayh \ncreating a reporting requirement that should shed light on how to \nimprove decision-making within NATO. As a lifelong Atlanticist, my \ninterest is in keeping NATO relevant and effective as it adapts its \nmission to the new threats we face today. Doing so will require a hard \nlook at what works well within NATO, and what we can do to streamline \ndecision-making processes to improve the effectiveness of the Alliance.\n  Our amendment would build on a reporting requirement related to NATO \nis in the underlying bill. Our intention is to make NATO work better by \ntaking a close look at how some of its decision-making structures have \nrecently evolved, for expressly political reasons, in ways that I \nbelieve have weakened NATO, but which we, NATO's full members, can \nrectify in order to ensure that our Alliance remains strong.\n  Our amendment would require the Secretaries of Defense and State to \nassess whether certain new NATO military initiatives are within the \njurisdiction of NATO's Defense Planning Committee, which has \nhistorically overseen NATO's core defense and security missions. The \nreport would relate how NATO defense, military, security, and nuclear \ndecisions traditionally made in the DPC came to be made in other bodies \nwithin NATO. It would discuss the extent of France's contributions to \neach of NATO's component committees, and specifically the degree of \nFrench involvement in specific military and security issues within the \ncompetence of the DPC, on which the French do not sit. The report would \nexamine how NATO could make greater use of the DPC, by assuming its \ntraditional role of managing NATO's core defense mission, and how to \notherwise streamline NATO decisionmaking to make NATO more effective. \nNATO is actively engaged in discussions on how to reform and improve \nNATO decisionmaking, and I strongly believe our amendment will play a \nuseful role in animating that discussion.\n\n  In February, Turkey requested assistance from the Alliance to improve \nits defenses in the event of war with Iraq. Given Turkey's status as a \nkey member of NATO and the Alliance's only front-line state with Iraq, \nTurkey's routine request for defensive reinforcements under the terms \nof the NATO charter should not have been controversial in any way. \nRegrettably, France denied Turkey's request, and the Alliance spent 3 \nweeks in crisis trying to overcome French objections. France's position \nwas initially supported by Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium, but these \nnations ultimately sided with every other member of the Alliance, \nleaving the French isolated but refusing to relinquish their effective \nveto over a fundamental Alliance commitment to the defense of a member \nstate. Ultimately, Turkey's Article Four request for defensive \nassistance was approved by the Defense Planning Committee (DPC), a \ncomponent committee of NATO which does not include France. But the \nsingular French obstructionism over the course of nearly a month caused \nthe gravest crisis NATO has known in a generation and raised real \nquestions about whether NATO was going the way of the U.N. Security \nCouncil or, more ominously, the League of Nations.\n  In the wake of this debacle, Atlanticists in Europe and the United \nStates have pondered ways to reform and improve decision-making within \nNATO. In the interests of avoiding another such near-calamity within \nNATO that threatens the Alliance itself, Secretaries Wolfowitz and \nFeith have testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nthe DPC could be used more frequently for decision-making within NATO, \nthereby circumventing the French veto.\n  Since the mid-1990s, NATO's North Atlantic Council has been the \nprimary venue within the Alliance for decisions to be taken on Alliance \noperations. But for most of NATO's existence, the NAC was not \npreeminent. The Defense Planning Committee was created in 1963 and was \nco-equal to the NAC. The DPC was charged with NATO's core defense and \nsecurity business, including questions relating to Article Five, the \nmutual defense clause that is at the heart of NATO's charter. In 1966, \nwhen France withdrew from NATO's integrated military structure, the DPC \nassumed responsibility for the Alliance's core defense business. This \nallowed the Alliance to continue to function effectively without \nFrance's military involvement, and to avoid a French veto over matters \nrelated to NATO's core defense mission, in which France did not then \nand does not now participate.\n  The Defense Planning Committee was surprisingly active from its \ncreation in 1963 until 1995. It became less prominent following the end \nof the cold war because the use of NATO forces appeared less likely in \nArticle Five scenarios and more probable in non-Article Five scenarios. \nThe role of the DPC diminished when the North Atlantic Council rose to \npre-eminence in the 1990s with NATO peacekeeping scenarios, in the \naftermath of the dismal failure of UNPROFOR in Bosnia. In the 1990s, \nlooking for new roles, the NAC endorsed NATO peacekeeping missions in \nthe Balkans.\n  The process of relying on the North Atlantic Council was also rooted \nin the futile effort to woo France back into full membership in NATO. \nStarting with a 1992 decision to support peacekeeping operations and \nthe desire to involve France in Balkans operations, defense issues \nduring the 1990s came to be addressed in the North Atlantic Council. \nThe inclusion of France in NATO Defense Ministerials began in 1993 at \nTravemunde and has continued. Although they have not rejoined NATO's \nintergrated military structure, and are therefore not full contributing \nmembers of the Alliance, the French have very effectively shifted NATO \ndecision-making into the North Atlantic Council and other bodies in \nwhich they have a voice and a vote. Although France does not \nparticipate, or participates only selectively, in command structure, \ninfrastructure budget, and defense planning, it has successfully \ntransferred these issues to NATO committees on which it has a seat. \nFrance does not participate in 60 percent of NATO budget areas, but \nparticipates in 100 percent of the development of resource policy and \ncontribution ceilings.\n  The upcoming issues for the June NATO Defense Ministerial are of a\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nmilitary and security nature. They include the Capabilities Initiative, \nthe Command Structure Review, and the NATO Response Force. These are \nmilitary and security issues within the core competence of the DPC. Our \namendment is therefore not backward-looking, but would anticipate \npossible reforms to improve NATO's effectiveness in light of issues \ncurrently on the Alliance's agenda.\n  France unilaterally withdrew from NATO's military structure in 1966--\nat the height of the Cold War. France has since chosen to remain \noutside NATO's military structure. If France wants to return to NATO's \nmilitary structure, NATO should discuss it, debate it on the merits and \nmake a decision--among the 18 full members of NATO.\n  What we need now is a better understanding of why NATO came to rely \non the NAC, and what can be done to make NATO more effective. We need \nto understand what we can do to limit France's ability to manipulate \nNATO, and oppose American foreign policy goals. The report required by \nour amendment should shed light on how to make our Alliance work as it \nshould, in defense of the supreme national interests of the democracies \nit protects and nurtures.\n  I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on \nbilateral trade relations with our allies of the domestic source for \ninstance, ``Buy America'', restrictions enacted in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996. I am extremely concerned that \nan amendment was proposed that would impose ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions on the Department of Defense. From a philosophical point \nof view, I oppose these types of protectionist policies. I believe free \ntrade is an important element in improving relations among all nations \nand essential to economic growth. Moreover, from a practical \nstandpoint, the added ``Buy America'' restrictions could seriously \nimpair our ability to compete freely in the international markets and \ncould also result in loss of existing business from long-standing \ntrading partners. Although, I fully understand the need to maintain \ncertain critical industrial base capabilities, I find no reason to \nsupport a ``Buy America'' requirement for a product, like marine pumps, \nthat is produced by no fewer than 25 U.S. companies or a bullet-proof \nvest made from fabric by a U.S. manufacturer which is inferior and more \nexpensive than a bullet-proof vest made in the U.S. from a fabric \nproduced overseas.\n  There are many examples of the trade imbalance that I can point to. I \nwould like to review one example for you. The Dutch government, between \n1991 and 1994, purchased $508 million in defense equipment from U.S. \nmanufacturers, including air-refueling planes, Chinook helicopters, \nApache helicopters, F-16 fighter equipment, missiles, combat radios and \nvarious training equipment. During that same period, the United States \npurchased only $40 million of defense equipment from the Dutch. \nRecently, the Defense Ministers of the United Kingdom and Sweden \npointed to similar situations in their countries. In every meeting \nregarding this subject, I am told how difficult it is to buy American \ndefense products because of our protectionist policies and the strong \n``Buy European'' sentiment overseas. Our protectionist practices will \nhurt us nationally and internationally.\n\n  Some legislative enactments over the past several years have had the \neffect of establishing a monopoly for a domestic supplier in certain \nproduct lines. This not only adds to the pressure for our allies to \n``buy European,'' but it also raises the costs of procurement for DOD \nand cuts off access to potential state-of-the-art technologies. DOD \nshould have the ability to make purchases from a second source in an \nallied country covered by a defense cooperation MOU or Declaration of \nPrinciples agreement when only one domestic source exists. This would \nensure both price and product competition.\n  Defense exports improve interoperability with friendly forces with \nwhich we are increasingly likely to operate in coalition warfare or \npeacekeeping missions. They increase our influence over recipient \ncountry actions, and in a worse case scenario, allow the U.S. to \nterminate support for equipment. Exports also lower the unit costs of \nsystems to the U.S. military, and in recent years have kept mature \nlines open while the U.S. has developed new systems that will go into \nproduction around the turn of the century.\n  Finally, these exports provide the same economic benefits to the U.S. \nas all other exports--higher paying jobs, improved balance of trade, \nand increased tax revenue. ``Buy America'' restrictions on procurement \nwill hurt funding for readiness, personnel land equipment \nmodernization. These are really issues of acquisition policy, not \nappropriations matters. During debate on this legislation, I offered a \nsecond degree amendment with the intention of striking the \nprotectionist amendment proposed by one of my colleagues. I thank my \ncolleagues who successfully supported my amendment that worked to \nprotect not only our allies but the American taxpayer and most \nimportantly our servicemen and women who depend on the Department of \nDefense to train them and Congress to equip them with the best \nequipment irrelevant of its country of origin. Why is it that our \nspecial forces servicemembers routinely procure equipment without ``buy \nAmerica'' requirements?\n  In all my years on the committee, I have never seen anything like the \nproposed leasing scheme of the KC-767 aerial tankers. In my efforts and \nthose of others on the Senate Armed Service Committee, to get \ninformation on this proposed deal with Boeing, there has been \nobfuscation. There has been delay. There is withholding of information \nfrom me and this committee. Senior Air Force officials have even \nmislead the committee, according to the DoD Inspector General. It is \nincumbent upon all of us to provide the men and women of the Armed \nForces with the most capabilities in return for our expenditures.\n  In several hearings this year, we have heard the Air Force Secretary \nand the Air Force Secretary of Acquisition testify that they have not \ncompleted an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) on aerial tankers. The KC-\n767 aerial tanker effort requires the Secretary of Defense to do an \nAOA. Authorized funding should come from Air Force aviation programs \nwhich would have originally funded AOA if the program was appropriately \nplanned and programmed like other DoD program. Moreover, the AOA is \nrequired by Air Mobility Command (AMC) & DoD documents, TRS-05 and KC-\n135 ESLS. I am pleased the Senate is requiring the Secretary of Defense \nto undertake an AOA on aerial tankers.\n  In the Air Force's fiscal year 2004's budget request the Air Force \nproposed eliminating 68 KC-135E aerial tankers. The Tanker Requirement \nStudy (TRS-05) was conducted by the Air Mobility Command and the \nSecretary of Defense Program, Analysis, and Evaluation Division--OSD \nPA TRS-05 identified the need for approximately 500 to 600 \noperational KC-135 equivalents to meet air refueling requirements. No \nother program has received so much attention by the Air Force \nSecretary. Yet, in direct contrast to his own Air Force studies, he \nseems relentless in exaggerating aerial tanker shortfalls in order to \nwin approval of his KC-767 leasing scam. I am pleased the committee has \nincluded language reducing the number allowed to be retired to 12, but \nI still feel the Air Force should be prohibited from retiring the \nrequested number of tankers until the AOA is completed and we have \ndetermined the best way to replace these national assets. It is \nfoolhardy to begin retiring planes without a plan to replace them.\n  I am pleased the Senate included a provision that will save millions \ndown the road. The Senate directs the Air Force to provide adequate \nfunding for aviation depots for the purpose of correcting corrosion for \nthe KC-135 aerial refueling fleet. The Armed Services Committee has \nheard testimony that every $1 spent in preventive maintenance saves $7 \nin repair or replacement costs. This action to add funding to KC-135 \naviation depot level facilities would meet a top objective in the Chief \nof Staff of the Air Force's fiscal year 2004 Unfunded Priority List.\n  Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom demonstrated to the \nworld what we saw just 12 years ago. We went to war as the most combat-\nready force in the world. The value of that readiness is clear. We won \na massive victory in a few weeks, and we did so with very limited loss \nof American and allied lives. We were able to end aggression with \nminimum overall loss\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\nof life, and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian \ncasualties of Afghani and Iraqi citizens.\n  In order to understand the issues involved, it is necessary to \nrecognize just how difficult it is to achieve the kind of readiness we \nhad during Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Readiness is \nnot solely a matter of funding operations and maintenance at the proper \nlevel. It is not only a matter of funding adequate numbers of high \nquality personnel, or of funding superior weapons and munitions, \nstrategic mobility and propositioning, high operating tempos, realistic \nlevels of training at every level of combat, or of logistics and \nsupport capabilities.\n  Readiness, in fact, is all of these things and more. A force beings \nto go hollow the moment it loses its overall mix of combat capabilities \nin any one critical area. Our technology edge in Afghanistan and Iraq \nwould have been meaningless if we did not have men and women trained to \nuse it. Having the best weapons system platforms in the world would not \nhave given us our victory if we had not had the right command and \ncontrol facilities, maintenance capabilities, and munitions.\n\n  The military forces that we sent to participate in Operation Desert \nStorm, Kosovo and Serbia, and Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom, trained for their missions on military ranges here in the \nUnited States. Perhaps the premier range in the continental United \nStates is the Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona. This nearly 3 \nmillion acre range comprises portions of the Sonoran desert and the \nCabeza Prieta wilderness.\n  It is estimated that the military spends approximately $77 million a \nyear on conservation efforts on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. There are \nnearly 80 employees dedicated to continued protection of the Goldwater \nRange, including archaeologists, biologists, ornithologists and other \nnatural resources experts. In my view, the Air Force and the Marine \nCorps are very good stewards of this critical habitat.\n  Efforts are ongoing among environmental agencies, the Department of \nDefense, and the various land management agencies to further clarify \nand define the use and management of the Goldwater Range land and the \nairspace above it, While I applaud these efforts, I must affirmatively \nstate my strong support for preserving the military use of this land \nand associated airspace. Every service has approached me to convey \ntheir deep concern that the military maintain its ability to train in \nthis one-of-a-kind training range.\n  The Barry M. Goldwater Range is one of the last open-space ranges \navailable to our Armed Forces for realistic, integrated, joint training \nexercises. I am glad the Senate has included language to help ensure \nthat this training ``jewel'' remains available to our military for \ntraining purposes.\n  I am very concerned with the trend in the services to curtail live \nfire opportunities in training. As weapon systems become more expensive \nand are manufactured in fewer quantities, we are creating a military \nforce that often fires a weapon for the first time in combat. In the \nNavy, aviators used to fire one radar-guided and one heat-seeking \nannually. This was reduced to one missile each during a single tour of \nduty, and has now been further reduced to a single missile each during \nan entire career.\n  Luke Air Force Base (AFB) is home to the 56th Fighter Wing and 228 F-\n16, single engine, high performance aircraft. Luke AFB, similar to the \nsituation at Nellis AFB, that the committee has previously addressed, \nhas significant urban development encroachment issues that impact \ntraining at the base. Armed aircraft are no longer permitted to take \noff to the north of Luke AFB and over the past several years, there \nhave been 16 serious aircraft accidents due to catastrophic engine \nfailure. It is critical that land use along the southern departure \ncorridor (SDC) remain compatible with armed aircraft weapons training, \nto preserve access to the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR), to prevent \nland use or encroachments that are incompatible with activities at Luke \nAFB in the SDC and to increase the margin of safety associated with the \nLive Ordnance Departure Are (LODA) southwest of Luke AFB.\n\n  The Fiscal Year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act provided $10 \nmillion to the Air Force for land acquisition at Luke AFB intended to \nprevent encroachment from residential development and to ensure safe \noperations for flight departures and munitions storage.\n  The Air Force identified an immediate requirement to purchase 234 \nacres around the munitions storage and is in the process of executing \nthis purchase to correct the most serious safety deficiencies. \nFurthermore, other parcels have been identified to be purchased to \nprotect surrounding communities from impeding upon explosive blast \ndistance arcs and the danger of single-seat F-16 Falcon jets with live \nordnance that overfly land areas in the Southern Departure Corridor \nheaded to the BMGR.\n  A land compatibility use study is currently ongoing to identify \npotential additional real estate to be purchased in the Southern \nDeparture corridor of the airfield overflown by F-16's headed to the \nBMGR. I am pleased the chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness and \nManagement Support included in the chairman's mark, $14.3 million as a \nmodification to the Fiscal Year 2003 authorization to facilitate the \nquick acquisition of additional parcels around the munitions area and \nin the Southern Departure corridor once they are identified. The Air \nForce has identified significant encroachment problems hindering safe \nflight operations at Luke AFB and will be able to protect accident \npotential zones from residential development through additional land \nacquisitions. The Senate Armed Services Committee expects the Air Force \nto send the committee the results of the land compatibility use study \nby June 1st, as promised by the Office of the Secretary of the Air \nForce. The project is a modification to a current requirement \npreviously considered by this committee, authorized, appropriated, and \nnow being executed by the Air Force.\n  For too long, we have asked our Armed Forces to do more with less. \nNow it is time to provide them with the funding they need, and to \nensure that it is spent more wisely. The American people must also be \nassured that their tax dollars are being spent to provide for their \ndefense--for the national interest, not for special interests.\n  More must be done to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative work and \nmilitary installations. More effort must be made to turn over \nnonmilitary functions to civilian contractors, to reduce the continuing \nbloat of headquarters staffs, and to decentralize the Pentagon's \nlabyrinth of bureaucratic fiefdoms.\n  The base realignment and closure (BRAC) legislation that Congress \nauthorized in 2000 will make available from $4 to $7 billion per year \nby eliminating excess defense infrastructure. There is another $2 \nbillion per year we can put to better purposes by privatizing or \nconsolidating support and maintenance functions, and an additional $5.5 \nbillion per year by eliminating ``Buy America'' restrictions that \ndiscourage U.S. competition and raise costs.\n  Similar attention is required to wean our political system of its \nhighly developed taste for pork. I identified $5.2 billion in items \nthat the Appropriations Committee, not the Defense Department, added to \nthe budget last year. We should not tolerate the sacrifice of limited \ndefense resources to special interests masquerading as improvements to \nour defense. These total savings in the Defense Department amount to \nalmost $20 billion per year--$20 billion that must be reallocated \nwithin the defense budget to higher priority military personnel and \nmodernization requirements.\n\n  While I am pleased that amount of member adds in this year's \nlegislation has been reduced to around $1 billion, I am still troubled \nby the amount of unrequested spending on this legislation. Year after \nyear, funding for the same unrequested, unnecessary projects are \nincluded in this legislation. For example, the 21st century truck has \nreceived $17.5 million dollars in this legislation. I wonder how many \nveterans Concurrent Receipts benefits would be funded by the total \namount we have sunk into the development of the 21st century truck over \nthe years? In the wisdom of the Senate, we have provided $35 million \nmore than the President requested to buy the JPATS Texan. That is a lot \nof money for an aircraft the Navy does not need or even want. We have \nprovided $10 million for\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nthe High Temperature Superconducting Alternating Current HRSAC \nSynchronous Motor. We have provided $60 million for Advanced Extra High \nFrequency Spare Parts. Also on the member adds list is $50 million for \nthe Los Alamos National Lab.\n  The fiscal year 2004 defense authorization bill adds $60 million for \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). This project is one of the \nlargest additions in the bill. This is in addition to the $609.3 \nmillion that was included in the President's defense budget request.\n  With this funding the Air Force will provide a $669.3 million boost \nto defense companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin to keep both companies \nin the rocket-launch business, easing the impact of a steep falloff in \ncommercial orders for such services in the commercial-satellite market, \nwhere orders have all but dried up.\n  I am opposed to the ``assured access to space program'' as it is \ncurrently designed. I believe the Committee should hold hearings to \nreview whether to drop one company. I do not believe that two companies \nare providing adequate competition in this critical program. I believe \nthat a proper accounting of the EELV program will result in a report \nthat more rocket launches and additional weather, communications, \nreconnaissance, eavesdropping and global position satellites would be \nlaunched if the Department of Defense would simply choose a single \nsource for military rocket launches.\n  I could continue in this vein, but it is sufficient to say that the \nmilitary needs more money and should spend it more wisely to address \nthe serious problems caused by a decade of declining defense budgets. I \nhave included a copy of the fiscal year 2004 Member Add List which I \nask unanimous consent be printed in the record.\n  I will continue to fight for additional support of increases to the \nDepartment of Defense budget. I also will continue to examine with a \nkeen eye all congressional marks that take money away from needed \nmilitary programs and instead buy political support through favoritism \nin awarding contracts. In addition, I will persist in placing the men \nand women who fight for our flag and country at the top of my priority \nlist where they belong; we owe them our gratitude, respect, and \nunwavering support. They keep us free.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe

Mr. President, I would like to indicate to my \ndistinguished colleague we are prepared to move to third reading.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is my understanding. I don't know of any other \nmatters that can be resolved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I don't \nwant you to lose the floor, but if I had the floor I would suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. If that is your wish, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to make a brief speech on the bill. \nAre we under a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mine will not be a lengthy speech.\n  Mr. President, just weeks ago, our Armed Forces once again \ndemonstrated--demonstrated--the overwhelming might of the United States \nmilitary. Due to the sustained commitment of our country to invest a \nsubstantial proportion of our national wealth into our national \ndefense, our military is faster, more agile, more lethal, better \nequipped, better protected, and better compensated than any other in \nthe world.\n  Make no doubt about it, the sums that we invest in defense are \nenormous. According to the most recent CIA World Factbook, the world \nspent about three-quarters of a trillion dollars on arms in 1999, the \nlatest year for which statistics are available. That same year, the \nUnited States spent $292 billion on its military that is nearly 40 \npercent of all military spending on Earth. Our country spends more on \ndefense than all the other 18 members of NATO, plus China, plus Russia, \nand plus the six remaining rogue states combined.\n  Yet our defense budget continues to increase. This bill authorizes \n$400 billion for our national defense in the next year.\n  In an age when we talk about smart bombs, smart missiles, and smart \nsoldiers, any talk of smart budgets has gone out the window.\n  It was not that long ago that Secretary Rumsfeld conducted an \nextensive series of top-to-bottom reviews of the Defense Department. I \nsupported him in those exercises, and said so, as did many other \nMembers of Congress. Those reviews were supposed to eliminate old \nweapons systems, field new ones, and cut the fat at the Pentagon, all \nfor the purpose of getting more bang for our defense buck.\n  I understand that a huge bureaucracy like the Defense Department \ncannot turn on a dime. But any hopes of containing military spending \nincreases while preparing our forces for the 21st century seem to be a \ndistant memory. Two years into what was supposed to be a major \noverhaul, the Pentagon's budget has grown by 24 percent, not counting \nany of the billions of dollars that we have spent on the war on \nterrorism and the war in Iraq. Our defense budget seems more the same \nthan ever: not more bang for the buck, just more bucks.\n  The administration has charted a course now to increase defense \nbudgets to $502.7 billion within the next 5 years. At the same time, \nCongress has passed one tax cut of $1.35 trillion, and the Senate is \nheaded at flank speed to pass another $350 billion in tax cuts before \nthis week is over. Budget deficits are soaring--soaring--out of \ncontrol, while our economy is in the doldrums.\n  Instead of saving money by skipping a generation of military weapons, \nwe are sending our country even deeper into debt a debt that will have \nto be borne by yet another generation of Americans who will be expected \nto pay for our defense largess.\n  Let there be no doubt that we can and must provide first-rate \nfighting capability for our troops. But we can do so without committing \nto defense budgets that are set to spiral ever, ever higher. I know of \nno one who would seriously propose to give our troops second-rate \nequipment or to cut their pay and benefits. The size of our defense \nbudget is not a good measure of our support for our troops.\n  We have plenty of headroom in which to maintain our overwhelming \nmilitary superiority without bowing to every request by the powerful \ndefense industry for more and more and more money for more and more and \nmore programs that are all too often over budget and behind schedule. \nPropping up unproven weapons systems through infusions of taxpayer cash \nis the surest means to short change our men and women in uniform.\n  There remains much to be done regarding the business practices at the \nPentagon. Secretary Rumsfeld has made a commitment toward improving \nDOD's financial management and accounting systems, and he appears to be \nmaking an earnest effort toward that end, but progress is painfully \nslow. Untangling the mess of unreliable accounting entries will take \nyears to solve. The bottom line is that the Pentagon still has no way--\nnone--no way of knowing how much it spends, how much it owns, or what \nits real budgetary needs are. It makes little sense to keep piling more \nmoney on a Department that does not know how it spent last year's \nfunds.\n  The DOD proposed a transformation package that was said to be able to \nmake the Department more efficient. ``Flexibilities''--and I use that \nword in quotation marks--``flexibilities'' are held up as the cure-all \nto what ails the Pentagon's management. The answer to problems like the \nPentagon's accounting system clearly is not more flexibility--what is \nneeded is more accountability. Accountability within the Department, \naccountability to Congress, which means accountability to the \nConstitution and accountability to the American people.\n  It is a good sign that this bill does not include most of the \n``flexibilities'' requested by the Department of Defense. Senator \nWarner and Senator Levin acted wisely in crafting a bill that upholds \nthe prerogatives of Congress in this respect.\n  Now, we owe a great debt of gratitude to both of these managers, \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin, because they went against the grain \nwhen they opposed those ``flexibilities'' and when they took them out. \nIt is a good sign that this bill does not include most of the \n``flexibilities'' requested by the Department of Defense.\n  But we remain on the wrong track when it comes to defense spending. \nInstead of truth in budgeting, Congress cannot even get a straight \nanswer about how much it will cost to occupy Iraq. Congress could not \nget a straight answer as to what it would cost to wage the war in Iraq. \nAnd Congress still cannot get a straight answer about the costs of \nreconstructing Iraq or how long we will be there. Instead of choosing \npriorities for our military and skipping a generation of weapons, \ndefense spending is through the roof while our Government is swimming \nin red ink.\n  Instead of holding the Pentagon accountable for what it spends, we \nare kept busy fighting off legislative proposals that would reduce \noversight of the Department of Defense.\n  Here again, I compliment Senator Warner and Senator Levin. They put \nthe foot down and said no; this far but no further. They took out those \nvarious and sundry so-called flexibilities that the Department wanted.\n  We are living in a time when the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity is the threat of asymmetrical warfare. We learned that on \nSeptember 11, 2001. We are in no danger of being outmatched militarily \nby any nation on Earth, but as the current orange alert status reminds \nus, we remain vulnerable to the very real threat of terrorists. Yet our \nDepartment of Defense is on a track to be the instrument--get this--to \nbe the instrument of a doctrine of preemptive attacks: Ready and \nwilling to invade and take over sovereign states that may not even pose \na direct threat to our security. The name ``Department of Defense'' is \nincreasingly a misnomer for a bureaucracy that is poised to undertake \nconquests at the drop of a hat.\n  Senator Warner and Senator Levin have done an excellent job of \nmanaging this bill and of stripping some of the most egregious \nprovisions from the President's request.\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\n  I have been on the Armed Services Committee a good many years. I \nfirst came to the Armed Services Committee when the late Senator \nRichard Russell, who stood at this desk and who sat in this chair, was \nchairman of that great committee. I have been a supporter of our \nnational defense. I supported the war in Vietnam until most everyone \nelse had left the field. I held up President Nixon's hand when others \non my side and the then majority leader--God rest his soul--were \nopposed to an amendment that I offered which said in essence that if \nthe President sends our boys, our young men--young men for the most \npart at that time--to Vietnam, then the President has a responsibility \nto protect those men to the best of his ability and to enable them to \nreturn home safely. I lost on the amendment. I received a call from \nCamp David from the late President Nixon complimenting me on that \namendment.\n  I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to national defense, \nbut I think we are going too far. I commend Senator Warner and I \ncommend Senator Levin for their hard work, but I believe this bill is \nstill too costly and steers our Nation in exactly the wrong course for \nthe future. I hope they will not think that I in any way am criticizing \nthem or the other members of my Armed Services Committee. I believe it \nis time to just say no to Pentagon excesses. I believe it is time to \nforce the Defense Department to work smarter and waste less. I believe \nit is time to demand accountability for our enormous investment in \ndefense.\n  For these reasons I will vote against this bill.\n  We will revisit this subject in the Defense Appropriations Committee \nand the Appropriations Committee as a whole, votes on Defense \nappropriations bill. But we will meet that challenge when it comes. I \nthank both the managers for their patience and for their good work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague, former \nmajority leader of the Senate, has been on the Armed Services Committee \nfor 25 years, the quarter of a century Mr. Levin and I have been on \nthere.\n  The Senator invoked the name of Richard Russell. When I was Secretary \nof the Navy, I used to come up and testify before him. I don't think \nanybody--maybe Senator Stennis--could match his skill. It was \nremarkable. Senator Tower, Senator Goldwater idolized him as we all \ndid. But I thank the Senator for his remarks about this Senator. I do \nrespectfully disagree with some of his conclusions, but that is the \nnature of the magnificence of the Senate. We have argued and expressed \nto the people of this country our own views.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman will yield a minute, I join in thanking \nSenator Byrd. He has a unique role in this institution and in this \nNation. He makes a huge contribution in ways sometimes which are \nvisible but often in ways which are not visible and are not known. One \nof those ways has been on the Armed Services Committee with so many \nissues. The issues he pointed out where the so-called flexibility was \nbeing sought but was not incorporated in this bill is in significant \nmeasure a tribute to his strength in defending the role of the \nlegislative branch. It is a reflection of what is not only a big part \nof him but what he has instituted in so many others as a role model in \nthis institution for fighting for a branch of government which is truly \ncoequal to the executive branch. We have sustained that in this bill.\n  While the Senator from West Virginia will be voting no for the \nreasons he gave, the fact that he noted and welcomed the effort we made \nto keep out the excess power and flexibility in the executive branch to \nme is very heart warming indeed. I thank him for it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both the very distinguished managers \nof the bill. May I say once again, to the distinguished Senator and to \nhis comrade, the ranking manager, you have indeed properly upheld the \nrole of the Senate and the principle of the separation of powers when \nyou insisted that those various requests for ``flexibility'' be \ndropped. I hope you will be able to maintain that position in \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Levin and I, at the \nconcurrence of the distinguished leadership on both sides, are prepared \nto proceed to a third reading and final passage.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \npassage of S. 1050, the Senate proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of calendar No. 171, the nomination of Consuelo Maria \nCallahan to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit; further, there \nthen be 10 minutes equally divided for debate on the nomination prior \nto the vote on the confirmation of the nomination, without intervening \naction or debate; further, I ask unanimous consent that following that \nvote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would that be the 126th judge we have \napproved during the Bush years?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am unable to give an answer to that, I say to my \ndistinguished colleague. I am sure in the course of the colloquy \npreceding the vote on that jurist, that could be answered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we are proceeding, I first want to \nacknowledge my profound gratitude to my colleague and almost lifetime \nfriend of 25 years in this Chamber, Senator Levin, for his support and \nthat of his staff and indeed to my staff who, under the tutelage of \nJudy Ansley, have done a magnificent job, and for the support of our \nrespective leaderships in making this bill pass, particularly the two \nwhips, the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, let me thank Senator Warner, \nour chairman, for his usual courtesy, his indomitable spirit, and his \nwillingness to try to find ways in which we can resolve differences. He \nhas done a masterful job. We thought it was going to get done in record \ntime. It probably didn't end up quite that way, but not because of any \nfailure on the part of our good friend from Virginia.\n  I thank Rick DeBobes and all the staff on this side, Judy Ansley and \nall the staff on the Republican side, all the members of our committee \nwho contributed so much, as members of the committee, as chairmen and \nas ranking members of the subcommittee. I think we have produced a good \nbill.\n  Let me add my thanks to Senator Reid in particular. I want to single \nout Senator Reid, if I may. All the leaders help us, but I must say \nwhat a unique whip we have in Harry Reid. He really makes things happen \naround here which otherwise simply could not happen.\n  I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the minority staff \nmembers of the Committee on Armed Services for their extraordinary work \non S. 1050, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2004. To arrive at final passage of this important legislation requires \nhours and hours of hard work and many personal sacrifices. The \ncommittee and the Senate are so fortunate to have men and women of \ntheir expertise and dedication so ably assisting us on this bill. Rick \nDeBobes leads our minority staff of fifteen. Although small in numbers, \nthey all make huge contributions to the work of the Committee each and \nevery day. As a tribute to their professionalism, I thank Chris Cowart, \nDan Cox, Madelyn Creedon, Mitch Crosswait, Rick DeBobes, Evelyn Farkas, \nRichard Fieldhouse, Creighton Greene, Jeremy Hekhuis, Maren Leed, Gary \nLeeling, Peter Levine, Arun Seraphin, Christy Still, Mary Louise \nWagner, and Bridget Whalan.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of the \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, that they be permitted \nbefore the close of business tonight to file such statements as they \nwish relative to this bill.\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my profound gratitude to the \nmembers of the committee and, most notably, the Presiding Officer. I \nask that the bill be read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on passing of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the two managers for their hard \nwork and willingness to stay late into the evening in an effort that \nsome said could not be done over the course of the last 3 days, but \nboth managers said we were going to do it. I congratulate them for \ndelivering on that commitment.\n  In a couple of moments, we will have an additional vote on a Ninth \nCircuit court judge.\n  Before doing that, the Democratic leader and I wanted to have a \ngeneral understanding with our colleagues of where we are and where we \nwill be going over the next couple of days, or next couple 12 hours, \nsay, 18 hours. We will see how long it will be.\n  It is my understanding we will be receiving sometime in the next hour \nthe conference report on the jobs and growth package. It will be filed \nshortly in the House. I don't know exactly what time that will be. We \njust left there. Hopefully, it will be in the next hour or so. It is my \nhope we will be able to begin debate tonight, following the vote on the \njudge, on the jobs and growth package.\n  If that is the case, what I think, in talking to the Democratic \nleader, we would like to accomplish is the debate, which statutorily \nwould be 10 hours, would begin, although we will not officially start \nthe clock at that point, right after the vote on the judicial nominee. \nIf that were acceptable to our colleagues, again, depending on what \ntime the language arrived and papers could be filed, we would be able \nto vote on final passage tomorrow morning. This is on the jobs and \ngrowth package.\n  That is not all the business and I will comment on the other \nbusiness.\n  Ideally, we would be able to vote sometime around 9:30 tomorrow, \nalthough we cannot say with certainty at this juncture.\n  If that were the case and we were able to complete that vote, we \nstill have the debt limit extension to address, which is something that \nwe have to, absolutely no question about it, deal with tomorrow. \nEveryone agrees with that, although I do understand there will be \namendments from the other side of the aisle to allow discussion. Some \nof those amendments will be substantive and useful to discuss and \ndebate and some, hopefully, will disappear, and we will talk about the \nissues at some point. I believe we are talking about eight amendments.\n  We will have to pass the debt ceiling extension tomorrow. How many \namendments, we have not yet decided. We have to wait until tomorrow. I \nam not sure how long we need to talk on the debt ceiling, but if we had \nthe vote on the jobs and growth package at 9:30 in the morning, I \nimagine there is a period we might be able to agree to tonight--or may \nnot--at which time we start the amendment process and have a series of \namendments, hopefully one after another, or I would encourage that to \nbe the case.\n  People have a lot of commitments tomorrow and tomorrow evening. We\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\nwant to do the business in a very deliberate way. That is a rough \noutline.\n  Let me turn to my distinguished colleague, Senator Daschle, to \ncomment. Right now we are talking not unanimous consents but a general \nunderstanding of how the next day will play out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have been \ndiscussing this now for the last several hours and he has described it \naccurately. Our hope is we can use this evening productively, knowing \nthat a lot of people have schedules tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow \nevening they will want to keep.\n  While it would be difficult for us to agree at this point to begin \nthe deliberative process on the conference report until we have \nactually had a chance to see it and review it, there is no reason why \nwe cannot begin the debate.\n  We are suggesting that we informally begin the debate, have people \naddress the issues if they want to be heard on the issues. If we can \nget a copy of a conference report in the next couple of hours, we may \nbe in a position then to retroactively agree to the time already spent \nand make a commitment with regard to the time certain on the conference \nreport itself. That could be as early as tomorrow between 9:30 and 10.\n  It would then be our hope we could move to the debt limit. We are not \nsure yet how many amendments may be offered, but we will try to limit \nthe amount of time on each amendment so we can accommodate the \nschedules, with the expectation that by early afternoon we could \ndepart.\n  The majority leader has articulated this understanding accurately and \nwe will work with him to see if we can accomplish this in the next few \nhours.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me add, for tomorrow we do the jobs and \ngrowth package, we would take what time is necessary on the debt \nceiling extension, and then we also have one other issue, which is \nunemployment insurance, which we will be addressing tomorrow. Again, \nall of this can be done in a very short period of time. These are not \nnew issues. In each and every one of them, we know what the \nconsequences are. They have been debated. The jobs and growth package \nwe talked a lot about, although it is not exactly as written now, but \nthe issues we talked about and discussed.\n  On all three of these issues, we will finish them. We could finish \nthem, actually, early afternoon tomorrow if we stay focused, and that \nwill be my intent. I understand some people on the other side of the \naisle may want to talk on the debt ceiling and possibly unemployment \ninsurance as well.\n  I think if we work together in a collegial way, we will be able to \ncomplete all of this legislation. Again, it has been an ambitious \nschedule for the week, but based on what we have seen over the last 3 \nyears, we are making progress as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6942-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6942-S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CONSUELO MARIA CALLAHAN, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED \n               STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Consuelo Maria \nCallahan, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 10 minutes \nevenly divided prior to the vote on the nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on this nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I express my enthusiastic support for the \nconfirmation of Consuelo Callahan to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Justice Callahan is an outstanding nominee with broad support \non both sides of the aisle. She has the support of both of the \ndistinguished senators from her home state of California, and she was \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee the day after her \nhearing.\n  Justice Callahan received her undergraduate degree from Stanford \nUniversity and her law degree from McGeorge School of Law. In 1976, she \nbegan her 10-year career as a Deputy District Attorney with the San \nJoaquin County District Attorney's Office where she specialized in the \nprosecution of child abuse and sexual assault cases. During her 10-year \ncareer as a prosecutor, she handled more than 50 jury trials.\n  Justice Callahan also has first-hand experience with breaking the \ngender barrier. In 1992, she was appointed to the Superior Court in San \nJoaquin County, where she was the first female and Hispanic to serve on \nthat court. She was also the first female member of two local social \nand service organizations. In 1996, Justice Callahan became the first \njudge from San Joaquin County to be elevated to the California Court of \nAppeal in more than 73 years.\n  In addition to her outstanding career as a prosecutor and a jurist, \nshe has donated her time to organizations involved in addressing the \nproblem of child abuse and sexual assault and has received an award for \nher work in this area. She has received other awards during her career, \nincluding the Governor's award for Criminal Justice Programs and the \nSusan B. Anthony award for Women of Achievement. In 1999, Justice \nCallahan was inducted into the San Joquin County Mexican-American Hall \nof Fame.\n\n  The Committee has received numerous letters supporting Justice \nCallahan's nomination to the Ninth Circuit. The La Raza Lawyer's \nAssociation of Sacramento described Justice Callahan's professional \nqualifications in the following way: ``as a state appellate court \njustice, her opinions have been detailed, thoughtful and supportive of \nlegal precedent. . . . She possesses both the intellect and temperament \nto be an outstanding justice of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.''\n  The ten justices that serve with Justice Callahan on the Third \nAppellate District and work with her every day also sent a letter to \nthe Committee praising her skills as a jurist. They write, ``During her \nmore than six years on our court, Connie has shown that she has the \nintegrity, capacity, collegiality, and diligence to serve with \ndistinction on the Ninth Circuit. Our only reservation in recommending \nher confirmation is that it will mean a significant loss to our court. \nWe will miss Connie's energy and enthusiasm, her legal skills, and the \npositive way in which she fulfills her responsibilities as an appellate \njurist.''\n  Her colleagues' loss will be the federal judiciary's gain, as I have \ngreat confidence that the beleaguered Ninth Circuit will greatly \nbenefit from her confirmation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each of the Senators from California would \nlike to speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Justice Callahan \nto go from the California State appellate court to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. This woman was really born in Senator Boxer's and my \nbackyard. She is a Bay area person. She was born in Palo Alto. She \nattended Stanford, graduated with honors, attended the University of \nthe Pacific McGeorge Law School. She has been both a deputy city \nattorney and deputy district attorney. She founded the first child \nabuse unit in the DA's Office of San Joaquin County. In 1996 she was \nelevated to the State Court of Appeals from the Superior Court of San \nJoaquin County. She has served with distinction for the past 6 years, \nhas extraordinarily strong support.\n  I certainly believe, and I believe Senator Boxer concurs in this, \nthat she is going to be an excellent judge of the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. I am delighted to support her and to recommend her and to \nvote for her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, in support of this fine nominee,\n  To support Consuelo ``Connie'' Callahan to be a judge for the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Judge Callahan is a native Californian, born in Palo Alto. She is a \ngraduate of Stanford University and the\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nMcGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific.\n  She was the first female and the first Hispanic judge to sit on the \nSan Joaquin County Superior Court. She currently serves on the Third \nDistrict Court of Appeals located in Sacramento.\n  She has been a champion of protecting children. When she served as a \nprosecutor, she focused on major felony prosecutions in the area of \nchild abuse. She has received public recognition for her work on this \nissue.\n  She also is a former board member and President of the San Joaquin \nCounty Child Abuse Prevention Center. I applaud her involvement in this \nvery serious cause.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Feinstein, to support \nthis nominee. In addition to having the support of both of her home-\nstate senators, Judge Callahan received unanimous support from the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this well-qualified, \nmainstream nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm Judge Consuelo \nMaria Callahan to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit. This is another judicial nominee of President Bush whom \nSenate Democrats have strongly supported and whose consideration we had \nexpedited through the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank the Democratic leader and assistant leader for supporting \nJudge Callahan's nomination and working out this arrangement with the \nRepublican leadership so that this consensus nomination can be \nconsidered without further delay. I appreciate that the majority leader \nhas been willing to work with us to allow this nomination to go forward \ntoday.\n  I still do not know who on the Republican side delayed consideration \nof this consensus nominee. Just as Senate Democrats last month cleared \nthe nomination of Judge Edward Prado to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit without delay, so, too, the nomination of \nJudge Callahan to the Ninth Circuit was cleared on the Democratic side \npromptly. All Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee \nvoted to report her nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators \nindicated that they were eager to proceed with her nomination and, \nafter a reasonable period of debate, vote on her nomination.\n  Unlike the divisive nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the same court, \nboth home-State Senators support the nomination of Judge Callahan and \nshe is expected to be confirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe \nunanimously. Rather than disregarding time-honored rules and Senate \npractices, I urged my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us \nfill more judicial vacancies more quickly by bringing those nominations \nthat have bipartisan support, like Judge Callahan, to the front of the \nline for committee hearings and floor votes. I noted in a statement \nlast week to make the point that the nomination of Judge Callahan to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was cleared on the Democratic side.\n  We still do not know who on the Republican side delayed consideration \nof the consensus nomination of Judge Prado for a month. I thank the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus for its support of that nomination as \nwell as for its support of Judge Callahan, and for working with the \nSenate to bringing fair evaluation of these nominees and for adding \ntheir voice to the discussion of these lifetime appointments.\n  It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration \nand on the other side of the aisle insist on bogging down consensus \nmatters and consensus nominees in order to focus exclusively on the \nmost divisive and controversial of this President's nominees as he \ncontinues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have \nworked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill \njudicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is our effort, \nour fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve without much \nhelp from the other side or the administration.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 \nmonths, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including \nseveral who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer \nreview ratings from the ABA and at least 1 who had been rated not \nqualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced \njudicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' \nby Senator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the \nRepublican's fixation on the President's most controversial \nnominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even \nfurther. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies has been reduced \nto 45 and is the lowest it has been in 13 years. That is lower than at \nany time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton administration. We \nhave already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to 45, in 2 years. We \nhave reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.2 percent, the \nlowest it have been in the last two decades. With some cooperation from \nthe administration, think of the additional progress we could be \nmaking.\n  Earlier this month, we were able to obtain Senate consideration of \nthe nomination of Judge Prado, and another distinguished Hispanic \nnominee, Judge Cecilia Altonaga, to be a Federal judge in Florida. We \nexpedited consideration of that nominee at the request of Senator \nGraham of Florida. I am told that she is the first Cuban-American woman \nto be confirmed to the Federal bench. Indeed, Democrats in the Senate \nhave worked to expedite fair consideration of every Latino nominee this \nPresident has made to the Federal trial courts in addition to the \nnominations of Judge Prado and Judge Callahan.\n  As I have noted throughout the last 2 years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus nominees to consider. In a \nrecent column, David Broder noted that he asked Alberto Gonzales if \nthere was a lesson in Judge Prado's easy approval, but that Mr. \nGonzales missed the point. In Mr. Broder's mind: ``The lesson seems \nobvious. Conservatives can be confirmed for the courts when they are \nwell known in their communities and a broad range of their constituents \nhave reason to think them fair-minded.'' Judge Consuelo Callahan is \nanother such nominee.\n  With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 126 judges, \nincluding 24 circuit court nominees, nominated by President Bush, 100 \nin the 17 months in which Democrats comprised the Senate majority. The \nlesson that less controversial nominees are considered and confirmed \nmore easily was the lesson of the last 2 years, but that lesson has \nbeen lost on this White House and the current Senate leadership.\n  One hundred judicial nominees were confirmed when Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate for 17 months, and 26 have been confirmed in the \nother 12 months in which Republicans have controlled the confirmation \nprocess under President Bush. This total of 126 judges confirmed for \nPresident Bush is more confirmations than the Republicans allowed \nPresident Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997 the 3 full years of his \nlast term. In those 3 years, the Republican leadership in the Senate \nallowed only 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed, which included only \n18 circuit court judges. We have already exceeded that total by 13 \npercent and the circuit court total by 33 percent before Memorial Day \nand with 7 months remaining to us this year.\n  Today's confirmation makes the seventh court of appeals nominee \nconfirmed by the Senate just this year. That meets the annual average \nachieved by Republican leadership from 1995 through the early part of \n2001. The Republicans have now achieved as much in less than 5 months \nfor President Bush as they used to allowed the Senate to achieve in a \nfull year with President Clinton. They are moving two to three times \nfaster for this President's nominees, despite the fact that the current \nappellate court nominees are more controversial, divisive and less \nwidely supported than President Clinton's appellate court nominees \nwere.\n  Understand that if the Senate did not confirm another judicial \nnominee all year and simply adjourned today, we would have treated \nPresident Bush more fairly and would have acted on more of his judicial \nnominees than Republicans did for President Clinton in\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\n1995 to 1997. In addition, the 45 vacancies on the Federal courts \naround the country are significantly lower than the 80 vacancies \nRepublicans left at the end of 1997. Of course, the Senate is not \nadjourning for the year and Chairman Hatch continues to hold hearings \nfor Bush judicial nominees at between two and four times as many as he \ndid for President Clinton's.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I regret the administration's refusal to work with us to end \nthe impasse it has created in connection with the Estrada nomination. \nThe partisan politics of division that the administration is practicing \nwith respect to that nomination are not helpful and not respectful of \nthe damage done to the Hispanic community by insisting on so divisive a \nnominee.\n  I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more \nmainstream individuals like Judge Prado and Judge Callahan with proven \nrecords and bipartisan support. In connection with the unexplained \nRepublican delay before consideration of the nomination of Judge Prado, \nsome suggested that Judge Prado had been delayed because Democratic \nSenators were likely to vote for him and thereby undercut the \nRepublican's shameless charge that opposition to Miguel Estrada is \nbased on his ethnicity.\n  We all know that the White House could have cooperated with the \nSenate by producing Mr. Estrada's work papers. This would have enabled \nthe Senate to have voted on the Estrada nomination months ago. The \nrequest for his work papers was sent last May 15 and has been \noutstanding for more than a year. Rather than respond as every other \nadministration has over the last 20 years and provide access to those \npapers, this White House has stonewalled. Rather than follow the policy \nof openness outlined by Attorney General Robert Jackson in the 1940s, \nthis administration has stonewalled. And Republican Senators and other \npartisans could not wait to claim that the impasse created by the White \nHouse's change in policy and practice with respect to nominations was \nsomehow attributable to Democrats being anti-Hispanic. The charge would \nbe laughable if it were not so calculated to do political damage and to \ndivide the Hispanic community. That is what Republican partisans hope \nis the result. That is wrong.\n  Unfortunately, in the case of Mr. Estrada, the administration has \nmade no effort to work with us to resolve the impasse. Instead, there \nhas been a series of votes on cloture petitions in which the opposition \nhas grown and from time to time the support has waned. Recently, there \nhave been press reports indicating that Mr. Estrada asked the White \nHouse months ago to withdraw his nomination. I understand his \nfrustration. If this administration is not going to follow the practice \nof every other administration and share with the Senate the government \nwork papers of the nominee--the very practice this administration \nfollowed with its own EPA nominee in 2001--then I can understand him \nnot wanting to be used as a political pawn by the administration to \nscore partisan, political points. That the administration has not \nacceded to his reported request but has plowed ahead to force a \nsuccession of unsuccessful cloture votes and to foment division in the \nHispanic community for partisan gain is another example of how far this \nadministration is willing to go to politicize the process at the \nexpense of its own nominees.\n  Judge Callahan is a fine candidate for elevation to the appeals \ncourt. She has years of experience serving on the bench in the state of \nCalifornia, first on the California Superior Court and then on the \nCalifornia Court of Appeal. She enjoys the full support of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus. Not a single person or organization has \nsubmitted a letter of opposition or raised concerns about her. No \ncontroversy. No red flags. No basis for concern. No opposition. This \nexplains why her nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee \nwith a unanimous, bipartisan vote on an expedited basis.\n  During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 Latino \nnominees, including Judge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Christine \nArguello to the circuit courts, were delayed or blocked from receiving \nhearings or votes by the Republican leadership. Republicans delayed \nconsideration of a well-qualified Hispanic nominee to the Ninth \nCircuit, Judge Richard Paez for over 1,500 days, and 39 Republicans \nvoted against him. The confirmations of Latina circuit nominees \nRosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor were also delayed by Republicans. \nJudge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat by Republicans based on \nclaims about her judicial philosophy, but those efforts were not \nsuccessful. After significant delays and an unsuccessful Republican \nfilibuster, 36 Republicans voted against the confirmation of Judge \nBarkett. Additionally, Judge Sotomayor, who had received the ABA's \nhighest rating and had been appointed to the district court by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, was targeted by Republicans for delay or \ndefeat when she was nominated to the Second Circuit. She was eventually \nconfirmed, although 29 Republicans voted against her.\n  The fact is that the Latino nominations that the Senate has received \nfrom this administration have been acted upon in an expeditious manner. \nThey have overwhelmingly enjoyed bipartisan support. Under the \nDemocratically led Senate, we swiftly granted hearings for and \neventually confirmed Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge \nPhillip Martinez and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of \nFlorida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Judge Jose Linares of \nNew Jersey to the district courts. This year, we also confirmed Judge \nJames Otero of California, and we would have held his confirmation \nhearing last year if his ABA peer rating had been delivered to us in \ntime for the scheduling of our last hearing. As I have noted, we also \nhave recently confirmed Judge Cecilia Altonaga and Judge Edward Prado \nwith unanimous Democratic support.\n  Judge Callahan's nomination was delayed on the Senate executive \ncalendar unnecessarily in my view. I am pleased to see that at the \nurging of the Democratic leadership--the Republican majority has agreed \nto bring up this uncontroversial Latina nominee for a vote. I \ncongratulate Judge Callahan and her family on her confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I thank both the majority leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader for clearing this action. We have tried on this side \nof the aisle for some time to clear this nomination. I appreciate my \nfriends on the Republican side lifting their hold. I support the \nnominee and yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nwill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Consuelo Maria \nCallahan, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce S. 1125, the \nbipartisan Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003, the FAIR \nAct. I am joined by my colleagues Senators Ben Nelson, DeWine, Miller, \nVoinovich, Allen, and Chambliss who share my concern on this important \nissue and have worked very hard to help bring about a resolution up to \nthis point. They have all felt the impact of this situation in their \nhome States and have shown the courage that we need to move forward to \nlegislate a solution.\n  I also commend the interests of my good friend and Judiciary partner, \nSenator Leahy, as well as Senators Dodd and Carper, whom I would hope \nwill continue to work with us to improve this important legislation.\n  I also want to recognize and commend my colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, who has also been a leader on this issue and \nrecognizes the harm the current system poses to our workers and to our \neconomy.\n  There can be no doubt that our Nation faces an asbestos litigation \ncrisis. We have all heard the statistics, but they bear repeating. The \nRAND Institute for Civil Justice tells us that, to date, over 60 \ncompanies--I have been informed almost 70 companies--have been forced \ninto bankruptcy--at least three with operations in my own home State of \nUtah.\n  The number of claims continues to rise, as does the number of \ncompanies pulled into the web of this abusive litigation, often with \nlittle, if any, culpability. More than 600,000 people have filed \nclaims, and more than 8,400 companies have been named as defendants in \nasbestos litigation, some of them for no good reason at all but who are \nnow stuck with horrendous defense costs, even though they would win \nevery case.\n  This has become such a gravy train for some abusive trial lawyers--\njust some--that over 2,400 additional companies were named in the last \nyear alone. RAND also notes that ``about two-thirds of the claims are \nnow filed by the unimpaired, while in the past they were filed only by \nthe manifestly ill.'' Two-thirds of the complaints are filed by people \nwho are not even sick. Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, amongst \nmany others, has denounced this type of ``jackpot justice.''\n  There is broad support for a comprehensive solution, and I believe \nthat our legislation is a major step in the right direction. I have \nbeen and will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to resolve this issue. We need to ensure that the truly sick get \npaid, while providing stability to our economy by stemming the rampant \nlitigation that has resulted in a tidal wave of bankruptcies, \nendangering jobs and pensions and health care and almost everything \nelse that workers need in these companies. This crisis reaches far and \nwide, and it hurts everyone.\n  I am pretty pleased with what we have been able to accomplish to \ndate. I have worked with all kinds of companies. I have worked with the \nunions. I have worked with some trial lawyers. And I have worked with \ninsurance companies, reinsurers. You name them--they have been to \nSenator Nelson's office and my office. And Senator Nelson has worked \nlong and hard and diligently side by side with me to be able to come up \nwith what we have right now, which is a pretty darn good package and a \ngood bill.\n  I am proud of the product we are putting forth today, but we are not \ndone. We know that. But we have made significant progress.\n\n  Let me tell you what this bill does. We pay victims faster. The FAIR \nAct creates a fair and efficient system to resolve claims of asbestos \nvictims in a reasonable way that enables legitimate claimants to obtain \nrecovery much faster and easier than the current system. A new \nspecialized court will pay eligible claimants through a no-fault system \nwithin just a few months. Asbestos victims will no longer have to wait \nseveral years or more to be paid.\n  Our proposal will streamline the process and decrease the need for \nattorneys so that claimants will be able to retain more of their \nawards, without huge attorney's fees or transaction costs. Transaction \ncosts--most specifically, attorney's fees--have drained essential \nresources in the current system, to the point where there will not be \nresources for those who are truly ill, unless we do this bill.\n  Non-sick claimants will no longer deplete resources that should pay \nthe truly sick victims. In order to direct the resources to those most \nin need, the FAIR Act implements measured medical criteria and fair \ndollar values for claimants so that all those who are sick will be able \nto get compensation. The medical criteria are modeled on the 2002 \nManville Trust Distribution Process. These standards were intensely \nnegotiated with the plaintiff's bar before they were enacted, and they \nrepresent a fair guideline for determining the respective diseases, and \nfor determining who is impaired and who is not. For those who are not \nsick, we provide medical monitoring. If and when they become sick, they \nare ensured access to the fund. This is the FAIR approach.\n  Payments in the new court process will be fair and reasonable. \nClaimants will have a reasonable expectation of the amount they will \nreceive. There will not be any more runaway jury awards for people who \nhave never actually been sick, draining the resources away from the \nvictims who truly need our help.\n  We provide stability and certainty. In order to get the stability we \nneed for victims and the economy, the Fair Act is the exclusive remedy \nfor asbestos personal injury claims. There will be no more ``forum \nshopping'' abuses that have made a mockery of our justice\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nsystem where some legitimate victims are currently left with no \nrecourse while others with no illness at all receive windfalls.\n\n  We have taken great pains to ensure adequate funding for claim \nawards. Awards to claimants are paid out of a newly created fund \nconsisting of contributions over a 25-year period from both the \nbankrupt and solvent defendants with asbestos liabilities and insurance \nand reinsurance companies with policies covering asbestos personal \ninjury claims.\n  The business community receives the certainty they need to protect \njobs and pensions. In our legislation, we set out mandatory funding of \n$90 billion from industry and insurers, with an additional $4 to $6 \nbillion or more available from current asbestos trusts, and the \nauthority to assess another $14 billion from companies that may be \navoiding future liability. I am really pleased that the various \ncompanies and industry have come together on this. Defendant companies \nhave reached an agreement on allocating their $45 billion in \ncontributions. I am encouraged that the insurers continue to work \ntoward a similar agreement. For now, we have in place a Blue-Ribbon \ncommission that can make those determinations should the insurers be \nunable to resolve their shares. Overall, the business community has \nreally made tremendous progress to provide funds that are projected to \ncompensate victims appropriately and for the next 50 years.\n  They haven't been happy to do that but they are going to have to do \nthat. They are not happy with this $108 billion trust fund. It is at \nleast $18 billion more than what they were willing to pay. But I \nbelieve that they will, in the end, have to come along with this bill. \nAnd many of them are saying that right now. They are not happy but they \nrealize that we are trying to resolve this in a way that is fair to \neverybody.\n  We all want to ensure that there is enough money in the fund to \ncompensate claimants. Toward that end, I have included provisions such \nas a payment guarantee surcharge account and an orphan share account \nwhere additional funds will be set aside to grow and be available in \nthe unlikely event of a shortfall. In addition, I provide for \ncontribution obligations to be a priority in bankruptcy and for \nAttorney General enforcement of contribution obligations.\n  Over the last few days since I circulated the FAIR Act, I have \nreceived a lot of helpful feedback. As a result, we have made a number \nof changes in response to reasonable concerns. I expect we will make \nmore down the road. All we have to do is have reasonable people work \nwith us in good faith, and we are going to try to improve this bill \nevery step of the way. But we have a limited time in which to get this \ndone. Anybody who does not understand that is going to be somebody who \ndestroys or at least attempts to destroy the only game in town, the \nonly way we can resolve these problems.\n  We have received some suggestions from Senators Leahy and Dodd. I \ncommend their interest in and leadership on this issue. They have \nprovided some valuable suggestions which we will study. We have already \nincorporated some of their suggestions in the bill we introduce today.\n  First, we have included language that permits the Administrator of \nthe fund to refer to the Attorney General for enforcement any \ninformation received regarding violations of EPA or OSHA regulations.\n  Second, we specify that life insurance will not be counted as a \ncollateral source offset to any award granted to victims.\n\n  Third, as a further safeguard against imbalance in the appellate \nprocedure, we ensure that the judges of the en banc panel of the new \nU.S. Court of Asbestos Claims are assigned randomly.\n  We are considering other proposed suggestions that will further our \nprogress on this issue. Again, I want to thank my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle who have been engaged in this issue over the \nlast several months, especially my cosponsors, Senators Nelson and \nMiller, as well as Senators Leahy, Dodd, Carper, Levin, and Feinstein, \nwho are contemplating cosponsorship down the line but have not been \nable to do so as of this date. I encourage them to stay involved and \nwork with us during this process.\n  I also want to thank the leadership of Senators DeWine, Voinovich, \nBrownback, Nickles, and Zell Miller in particular, who all share my \nview that this asbestos crisis must be resolved. I know there are other \nissues that remain. The issue of a potential shortfall in funding at \nthe end is certainly an important one. I think we can work together to \naddress this issue, although it is premature to come up with a solution \nto that right now. Perhaps exploring private insurance mechanisms or \nsome other avenue may be the way to go. I don't know. But we are \nwilling to listen.\n  We have to start now, or we don't have a chance of getting a bill \nthrough that will help all of those concerned in this area, from the \nunions to the smallest company and the largest company. As I have said \nbefore, I oppose making taxpayers responsible for any potential \nmismanagement of the fund. If we employ appropriate medical criteria to \nensure that those who are actually sick receive the compensation, that \nwill go a long way toward increasing the manageability of this fund so \nthat we don't have to worry about a shortfall. With our funding levels \nset at the highest level of current projection, I do not expect a \nshortfall to occur, and I don't think others do as well who have done \nthe accounting work on this. But we can find a way to give more comfort \nto those who believe that even the highest level may underestimate the \nnumber of claims. If the medical criteria are reasonable, then it will \nbe much easier to resolve the issue of ensuring that there will be \nenough funds to redress future claimants.\n  As I have mentioned to my colleagues, if the desire for a legislative \nsolution is genuine, then we must take a position and move forward with \nthe legislative process. This complex legislation will require our \ncollective efforts and our serious cooperation.\n  I would like to go to this chart. This chart is on the effects of \nasbestos bankruptcies on workers. A lot of people don't realize, a lot \nof union members don't realize how serious this is. According to a \nstudy by the notable Nobel-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, \ncommissioned by the American Insurance Association, entitled ``The \nImpact of Asbestos Liabilities on Workers in Bankrupt Firms'' in \nDecember of 2002, bankruptcies led to a loss of an estimated 52,000 to \n60,000 jobs. That was in 2002. It is higher now. Each displaced worker \nat the bankrupt firms will lose on average an estimated $25,000 to \n$50,000 in wages over his or her career because of periods of \nunemployment and the likelihood of having to take a new job paying a \nlower salary. The average worker at an asbestos-elated bankrupt firm \nwith a 401(k) plan suffered roughly $8,300 in pension losses, which \nrepresented on average roughly a 25-percent reduction in the value of \nthe 401(k) account.\n\n  That is important. If we don't solve this problem within the next \nmonth, I believe we will have many more companies headed towards \nbankruptcy with a loss of jobs, a loss of high-paying jobs, a loss of \nunion members' jobs. I believe in the end, the unions will go broke, \ntoo. Because if they have any guts at all and any desire to help their \nmembers, they will have to help pick up the health costs for these \npeople among other things. But the pensions are going to be gone. The \nunion jobs will be gone. That is why we have to do something now, not \nkeep trying to get blood out of a stone. Unfortunately, we have some \nwho want to do that.\n  Let me go to this next chart, which is the New York Times. This shows \nthe surge in asbestos suits, many by healthy plaintiffs. The ones who \nare very injured, cancer ones, are represented by the red line on the \nbottom. Look at the black line, which is noncancer victims, many of \nwhom have never suffered a sick day in their lives who are now \napproaching 70,000 claims, many of whom show no signs of being sick at \nthis point. We provide medical monitoring for them during the lifetime \nof this trust. We pay for it. If they get sick at any time, they can \ncome in and on a no-fault basis get their compensation without having \nto pay exorbitant attorney's fees or transactional costs. This is \nsomething I think every worker should be cheering and hoping for.\n  The impact of bankruptcy on employment: After adjusting for the \nchanges in industry employment, the firms for which we have data lost \n51,970 jobs in the 5 years prior to bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\nThat is a couple years ago. It is a lot worse than that now. Assuming \nthat employment losses at the firms for which we lack data were \nproportionate to those for which we have data, the implied total \nemployment loss would be roughly 60,000.\n  Now, with regard to the change in employment in 5 years prior to \nbankruptcy, after accounting for changes in industry employment, in \nfirms filing for bankruptcy before January 1998, was 24,551, the number \nof jobs lost. Firms filing for bankruptcy after January 1998, 27,419 \njobs. Total for firms with data, 51,970. The estimated total for all \nbankrupt firms is 60,000 as of the day that was done. I believe it is \nnow over 70,000.\n\n  This is a serious issue. We have to get serious about it. I have \ntried to work in good faith on behalf of everybody involved. I am \ncalling on all parties--from the unions to the reinsurers--to get \ntogether with us and help us to improve this bill.\n  But realize there is only so much blood you can get out of this \nstone. If we don't do that, there are going to be hundreds of thousands \nof union jobs and other jobs lost that literally are going to be \ndevastating to this country and to the individuals involved; and we \nwould deserve the blame in the Congress because this bill would go a \nlong way toward solving it.\n  Having said that, I praise my colleague, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, \nand the other cosponsors of this bill. Without Senator Nelson and his \nencouragement over the last number of months, I don't think we would \nhave reached this far. He has had the guts to cosponsor this bill at \nthis time, and I have nothing but respect for him, and also Senator \nMiller as well on his side, and the others on our side, who are willing \nto stand up. I haven't talked to a lot of Senators about cosponsoring, \nbut I will. I pay tribute to my colleague for his stalwart support in \ntrying to do something about this tremendous set of problems we have in \nour society today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity \nto appear here with my colleague from Utah to say how much I appreciate \nthe opportunity to cosponsor with him and others this very important \nlegislation.\n  I should also say that when I went to the ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, a year or so ago and talked about how difficult an issue this \nwas and how difficult it was becoming, he was gracious and granted a \nhearing, and he has worked very diligently to make certain this issue \ngets the kind of exposure it should. He has also worked toward finding \nsolutions to it. Senator Dodd has also worked tirelessly on this issue, \nand they both remain very interested in finding a solution.\n  My colleague from Utah has outlined very clearly much of the \nstatistical support for this kind of legislation. Historically, in the \nearly 1970s, lawsuits against the asbestos manufacturers opened the \ndoor for victims suffering from asbestos-related diseases to be justly \ncompensated for their issues, and they were.\n  When Johns-Manville--the largest asbestos manufacturer--filed for \nbankruptcy in 1982, there were fewer than 20,000 asbestos cases, most \non behalf of individuals with severe asbestosis or mesothelioma--a \nvicious asbestos-related cancer. The system worked. Sick people and \ntheir families were given the financial security they deserved.\n  But then the system stopped working. A flood of cases overwhelmed \nit--some from individuals who were not yet sick but could potentially \nget sick in the future. We don't want to prevent these individuals from \nrecovering down the road, but we also need to work toward allowing \nthose who are sick now to recover now. With the current docket load, \nthat just isn't happening. Over 90,000 new asbestos lawsuits were filed \nin 2001 alone, representing an increase of 30,000 from the previous \nyear. However, the American Academy of Actuaries estimates that there \nare only about 2,000 new mesothelioma cases filed each year, another \n2,000 to 3,000 cancer cases that are likely attributable to asbestos, \nand a smaller number of serious asbestosis cases. As a result, we need \nto work toward finding a way to address the lawsuits of seriously ill \nindividuals immediately without eliminating the ability for those who \nmay become sick in the future to have their case addressed at the \nappropriate time.\n  The unfortunate result of these tens of thousands of lawsuits is that \npeople who are seriously sick and dying from asbestos must wait longer \nto recover less money than they deserve--if they can recover anything \nat all. After transaction costs and fees for both plaintiff and defense \nlawyers, only about one-third of the money spent on asbestos litigation \nwill actually reach the claimants.\n  Moreover, as insurance is depleted and an increasing number of these \ndefendants declare bankruptcy, it is inevitable that many asbestos \nvictims who develop cancer in the future will go uncompensated, unless \nwe take the action this bill will provide.\n  The economic fallout from this situation, though, extends beyond sick \nvictims. Because every company that manufactured asbestos is now \nbankrupt, plaintiffs have been forced to seek alternative defendants to \ntake their place. According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, \n300 firms were listed as defendants in asbestos cases in 1983. But by \n2002, Rand estimates that more than 6,000 independent entities have \nbeen named as asbestos liability defendants. More recently, another \nRand Institute study has estimated that there is about $200 billion in \npending asbestos claims. Many of these new defendants are small \nbusinesses located in every community across the country, with little \nor no actual connection to asbestos.\n\n  I have heard from scores of small businesses in my State--local \nhardware stores, plumbing contractors, auto parts dealers, lumber \nyards--and none of these businesses manufactured it. Many did not sell \nit or install it. But these businesses and the jobs they represent are \nat stake. They are now afraid that as primary asbestos defendants \ndeclare bankruptcy, they will be next in line for the thousands of \ncases being filed and their businesses will not, therefore, survive.\n  As the Wall Street Journal reported recently:\n\n       Lawsuits are now piling up against consultants, engineering \n     firms, plant owners, and maintenance and construction \n     contractors, all of whom are being blamed for workers' \n     exposure to asbestos.\n\n  Also, part of this litigation is now being targeted at insurance \nproviders. As the same story states:\n\n       Many of the smaller [companies] lack resources to defend \n     thousands of lawsuits or pay huge verdicts. But the companies \n     do have one thing in common: plentiful insurance.\n\n  As the number of asbestos claims filed each year has nearly tripled \nin the last 5 years, the pace of asbestos-related bankruptcies has also \naccelerated dramatically.\n  Since 1998, more companies have filed for bankruptcy protection than \nin the previous 20 years combined; and in the first 7 months of 2002 \nalone, 12 companies facing significant asbestos liability went \nbankrupt--more than in any other 3-year period before 1999. Firms \ndeclaring bankruptcy since 1998 employed more than 120,000 workers \nprior to their filing, many of whom were significantly invested in \ntheir company's stock, pension, and 401(k) plans.\n  According to Fortune magazine, for example:\n\n       [A]t the time of the Federal-Mogul's bankruptcy filing [in \n     2001], employees held 16 percent of the company's stock, \n     which had lost 99 percent of its value since January 1999.\n\n  It was reported that Federal-Mogul employees lost over $800 million \nin their 401(k). Similarly,\n\n       [A]bout 14 percent of Owens Corning's shares--which lost 97 \n     percent of their value in the two years before its filing--\n     were owned by employees.\n  I think we can all agree that those individuals with legal claims who \nare truly very sick need to be taken care of in the most timely and \nequitable manner possible. That must be our No. 1 priority. We must \nalso work to ensure that those who are not sick now, but may become \nsick in the future, are not precluded from recovery and that there are \nstill funds available for such a recovery.\n  Mr. President, this bill, as it is currently, begins the process of \ndoing just that. And as indicated by my colleague, it is a work in \nprogress. There are many opportunities yet to modify and to improve it \nas we go through this\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\nprocess. That is what the hearing will be about, and that is what the \nnegotiation would be about.\n  I am a strong believer that every American has a right to their day \nin court, but I also believe people dying of asbestos-related disease \ndeserve just compensation for themselves and their families. \nFortunately, we are coming closer to being able to restore balance to \nthe system. The fund is in the process of being created that will, I \nhope, provide a pool of lasting benefits for those with meritorious \nclaims. At the same time, this fund will spread the burden of the cost \nmore evenly and ensure the financial impact will not solely be directed \nat some parties due to their ability to pay rather than their true \nliabilities.\n  There are a number of task that remain to be done, and we recognize \nthat, and we welcome the opportunity to bring all those folks together \nto make sure we come together with the best possible bill that will do \nthe best possible job for those who are truly sick and those who will \nbecome sick.\n  We are now at a time, I believe, when this issue can be and should be \nresolved, perhaps not once and for all, as some would hope, but for a \ngood long while, giving us a chance to restore stability and certainty \nto a very uncertain issue.\n  While this may not be a perfect bill, as they say, we must not let \nour desire for the perfect become the enemy of the good. Much work \nremains to be done, but I hope the parties, the stakeholders, will come \ntogether and work with us to refine the bill.\n  I look forward to working with Members on all sides who truly are \nstriving to ensure that those who have been injured the most have an \nopportunity to make their cases heard.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6950-S6958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TAX CUT BILL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, sometime in the near future--near is in \nthe eyes of the beholder--we are going to vote on the conference report \nto the tax cut bill. When that does come up before the Senate, I will \noppose the bill and recommend the conference report not be adopted.\n  The conference report, which will be before us soon, is, first, not \nfiscally responsible. It is not fair to working Americans, and is not \nlikely to succeed in rebuilding the American economy.\n  First, fiscal responsibility: Two years ago when we considered the \n2001 tax cut, the Congressional Budget Office projected trillions of \ndollars of surpluses well into the future. In fact, $5.6 trillion was \nprojected as budget surpluses over the next 10 years. Today, that same \nneutral, independent body, the Congressional Budget Office, projects \ndeficits well into the future, and the rough estimate is about $2 \ntrillion of deficits, a swing of close to $7 trillion to $8 trillion \nover just 2 years.\n  The fiscal environment has dramatically changed since 2002. If that \nis the case, I believe our tax policies should also change. Whereas in \n2001 it made sense to cut taxes, today we should look much more \ncarefully at any potential tax cut.\n  The fiscal environment has changed very much today compared to where \nit was in 2001. Consequently, we should be carefully examining our tax \npolicies and asking whether our tax policies should change accordingly.\n  The Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, kept his word and forced the \nconferees to keep the conference report, at least on its face, within \nthe $350 billion Senate agreement. Unfortunately, this tax cut bill \nbusts through that $350 billion ceiling through a series of gimmicks \nthat hide the true cost of the bill, and in this time of increasing \ndeficits, I believe we must live within our limits, and this conference \nreport fails to do so.\n  Instead, it uses phase-ins and sunsets to shoehorn large tax cuts \ninto a small budget window. Republicans have designed a tax cut that is \none big yo-yo. Now you see it, now you don't. Here again, on again, off \nagain. It is one big yo-yo which I will explain in a few minutes.\n  The child credit, for example, has increased for the years 2003 and \n2004, and then guess what. It is taken away. That is one yo-yo.\n  Part of the marriage penalty is eliminated for the years 2003 and \n2004. Guess what again. The penalty comes back again after 2004.\n  The 10-percent bracket is expanded for 2003 and 2004. Then it reverts \nback.\n  Even the dividend tax cut disappears after 2008.\n  Individual taxpayers and corporate taxpayers, I believe, want \ncertainty. They want some predictability. They want to be able to plan \nfor their families, and companies want to plan for the future. \nIndividuals want to know whether they can plan for vacations, \neducation, and companies want to know whether to invest or not invest. \nWe certainly do not give them that certainty and predictability in this \nbill.\n  As for planning, this bill tells American taxpayers, for example, to \nget married in the year 2003 or 2004, have a child in 2003 or 2004, and \nthen get divorced in 2005. This bill is simply full of way too many \ngimmicks.\n  Last year, Members of Congress and the President expressed their \noutrage at the accounting gimmicks and manipulations of income and \nexpenses by Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia. In fact, legislation was enacted \nlast year to put the brakes on the use of accounting gimmicks by \ncorporate America.\n  If these accounting gimmicks and financial statement manipulations \nare so intolerable in corporate America, then why are they not \nintolerable for the U.S. Congress? Why should Congress be allowed to \ndeceive the American public?\n  What is really going on here? What is really going on is that the \nmajority intends to extend these tax cuts beyond the budget window. \nThat is what is really going on here. That is the accounting gimmick. \nThat is what is hidden. But if we extend the tax cuts, they will only \nadd to the long-term budget problem. That is, if they are extended as \nintended by the majority party, they will add to the fiscal nightmares \njust as we face budget strains brought on by the baby boom generation. \nCongress should come clean with what is really going on, what it is \nreally up to.\n  Second, this conference report is not fair to working Americans. The \nbenefits of this bill are skewed heavily to the elite in this country. \nIt mistakenly directs less of its resources to working American \nfamilies--much less. In this sluggish economy, that is also not good \neconomic policy. Working American families are more likely to spend tax \ncuts quickly; that is, tax cuts directed at working American families \nwill more likely help rebuild the American economy, but that is not \nwhat this bill does.\n  Take, for example, the tax cuts for dividends. This tax cut alone is \nheavily weighted to the elite. Three out of four American taxpayers \nhave no dividend income, and half of those who do have dividend income \nhave less than $500 in dividend income. That is about one out of eight \nat $500 or less in dividend income. So the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans will get little or no benefit from this provision. But look \nhow much this single provision will benefit the elite who do profit \nfrom it.\n  A taxpayer who had a million dollars in dividend income will get a \ntax break of $236,000. In contrast, $118 or less in tax cuts for the \nseven-eighths of taxpayers who receive $500 or less in dividend income \nand $236,000 for the dividend millionaire. That is simply not fair.\n  Let's look at priorities. The dividends provision is the single \nlargest provision in the bill. That means the bill imposes a penalty on \nwage earners by definition.\n  Under the bill, the maximum tax on investment income, that is, \ndividends and capital gains, is 15 percent. The tax on the wages, \nhowever, continues to be heavy. A single fireman earning $35,000 per \nyear pays 40 percent of his marginal income in Federal taxes, 15 \npercent in payroll taxes, plus 25 percent in income taxes.\n  In contrast, a retired investment banker living off the dividends on \na $1 million portfolio of stocks pays only 15 percent of his marginal \nincome in Federal taxes. Again, this is not fair.\n  Whatever happened to the argument that we need to eliminate the \ndouble taxation of dividends? I thought that is what this bill was \nsupposed to be primarily about. This conference report does not do \nthat. It does not eliminate the double taxation of dividends. Rather, \nin many cases it would eliminate not only the double taxation of \ndividends, but it eliminates even the one-\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\ntime taxation of dividends income. That means zero taxation on \ndividends.\n  In many cases, as a consequence of the way this conference report is \nwritten, there will be no taxation on many dividends offered by \ncorporations. The corporation will not pay the tax, and the shareholder \nwill not pay the tax.\n  So this bill lowers the tax for dividends. It lowers the tax for \ncapital gains. The bill says it is a priority of the majority party and \nthe President, apparently, to ensure that the only people who need to \npay full freight are those hard-working Americans who earn their income \nin wages.\n  The American way is to work hard, to earn income, to do well. There \nis much more opportunity and mobility in America than any other \ncountry, by far. Foreigners who come to America to live and start a \nbusiness are astounded at the opportunity and mobility in this country \ncompared to the country from which they came.\n  I do not criticize--in fact, I applaud--anybody who works hard and \ncan earn an income and do well in America. At least they have a much \nbetter chance in this country compared with any other country. So I am \nnot being critical of those who make a lot of money. That is great. I \nwish all Americans could make a lot of money. In fact, that is my \nunderlying goal, certainly in my home State of Montana, to do what we \ncan to get more people to earn more money and get higher paying jobs so \nmore Americans are able to make ends meet.\n  In this bill, all of America is not being treated alike. We are not \nbeing treated together as Americans. This bill is tilted very heavily \ntoward the elite, the extremely wealthy. They are the ones who get the \nbig tax breaks, whereas the average American does not. That is not \nfair. The benefits of this bill should be evenly distributed among all \nAmericans. That is not what has happened in this bill.\n  I am not being critical of tax breaks for the wealthy. They should \nget tax breaks, but I am saying as Americans we should pass legislation \nthat treats Americans equally. That is not what is happening in this \nbill.\n  Basically, this bill is not fair. It is not good tax policy, and it \ndoes nothing to encourage the work ethic that built this Nation.\n  I might ask now, how did the conference committee pay for this \nnontaxation of dividends? The conference committee turned to the \nAmericans today who otherwise would receive the relief under the \nmarriage penalty to, in effect, pay for these tax-free dividends. To \nsay it differently, the marriage penalty tax cuts were scaled back to \npay for the dividend proposal in this bill; that is, couples are going \nto be penalized under this bill to pay for the huge breaks in dividend \nincome for the elite of this country.\n\n  What about the marriage penalty for lower income families? No, this \nconference report does not find the resources to speed up the \nelimination of the marriage penalty for recipients of the earned-income \ntax credit, but it does find the money for the dividend tax break. Once \nagain, that is not good tax policy. It is not fair. It does illustrate \npriorities but I think the wrong priorities for our country.\n  So this bill increases the budget deficit and lays the bill at the \ndoor of our children and grandchildren. I think those of us who seek \npublic office have a moral responsibility to represent people in our \nhome States. That moral responsibility is to do our best to leave this \ncountry in as good a shape or better shape than we found it. We have \nthat responsibility because we are not going to be here forever.\n  We are going to have children and grandchildren and they will have \nchildren and grandchildren. We would like the United States of America \nto continually be strong and be the country that most people in the \nworld look up to. That is our responsibility because we are not going \nto be here forever. This bill does not fulfill that moral \nresponsibility. It leaves a huge additional burden on our children and \ngrandchildren. That is another reason to not pass this bill.\n  By the time the baby boomers start to retire, when there will be huge \nbudget pressures to help reform Medicare, to make sure that our senior \ncitizens have the health care benefits they need and, in addition, \nSocial Security, make sure that our senior citizens have the retirement \nbenefits, at least the basic minimum benefits, a safety net, we should \nnot pass this bill because this bill, in effect, makes that problem \nmuch more difficult. It adds a huge burden that Members of Congress are \ngoing to have to face when those years come up in about 5, 10, or 15 \nyears from now.\n  This bill increases the budget deficit and lays the bill at the door \nof our children and grandchildren. It inappropriately targets its tax \nbreaks at the elite instead of those more likely to spend it. This bill \nis simply not structured to be effective in rebuilding the American \neconomy. I believe it would be irresponsible to enact this legislation, \nespecially at this time.\n  I might add, there is an interesting article--in fact, it is a bit of \nan alarming article--in the Financial Times printed on Wednesday, just \nyesterday. On the front page of the Financial Times, they reported \ntheir interview of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. \nGreenspan aised concerns about the impact of further tax cuts and \nspending increases.\n  According to the Times, Mr. Greenspan:\n\n       [E]xpressed dismay at what he characterized as a breakdown \n     in budget discipline in Washington. He reminded lawmakers \n     that the U.S. Government was facing a ``significant'' budget \n     problem as the baby-boom population ages and draws on more \n     healthcare and retirement benefits.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan added that he would:\n\n       [L]ike to see that addressed more seriously than it is.\n\n  In his words:\n\n       The silence is deafening.\n\n  I will not be part of that silence. I strongly urge Members of this \nbody to do what is right, to consider what they are doing today.\n  In return for a short-term gain, they will be creating a long-term, \nmuch greater problem if they vote for this bill. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I, too, wish to speak on the \ntax bill which will soon be before us. I rise in opposition. There are \nmany reasons to oppose this reckless proposal. I will mention three.\n  No less an authority than Warren Buffett pointed out in written op-\neds and television appearances the obvious fact. The obvious fact is \nthat this legislation, as it relates to the tax-free status of \ncorporate dividends, will create zero new jobs. Why will it create zero \nnew jobs? It will do so because there is no additional money in the \nsystem to generate new jobs. If the corporations that are induced to \npay dividends or increase the dividends that they are currently paying \nas a result of the tax-free status to the stockholder remove those \nfunds from the corporate treasury, there is actually less chance that \nit will be invested in productive matters.\n  Since generally only the wealthiest of Americans will benefit by this \nproposal to make the remainder of dividends which are subject to \ntaxation free of taxes, the practical effect is going to be to have \nthese high-income Americans put the money into some account, not to \nspend it, and create the demand that our economy needs. Conversely, if \nthe funds stay at the corporate level, the corporation has ongoing \nneeds which are likely to be met by those funds. If the economic theory \nbehind the nontaxability of dividends is that it will stimulate the \neconomy--and the title of this bill indicates that is the objective--it \nis likely to have just the opposite effect.\n\n  The second concern which causes me to speak this evening is the fact \nthat this legislation belies congressional concern for honest \naccounting. We have spent a lot of time in the last few months berating \ncorporate America for its inappropriate and in some cases duplicitous \naccounting procedures. Now we are about to pass legislation which makes \nthose shenanigans pale in comparison to what we are about to do.\n  It is hard to believe this Senate has already passed a version of \nthis tax cut which said for the first year taxation of dividends could \nbe cut by 50 percent; for the second year taxation of corporate \ndividends would be cut 100 percent; for the third year corporate \ndividends tax could be cut by 100 percent; and in the fourth year we \nwould go back to the current level of taxation of\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\ncorporate dividends--an absurd proposition. Clearly, the only rationale \nfor such cooked accounting books is to allow what appears at the most \nsuperficial level to be a $350 billion tax cut, in fact, balloon into a \ntax cut of between $800 billion and $1 trillion. This is according to \nthe Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.\n  I wanted to talk about a third reason. That is that this agreement, \nfilled with many irresponsible policies and tax cuts, undermines our \nefforts to adequately fund homeland security. As a candidate for the \nPresidency, George Bush, when asked what would be his priorities for \nthe use of the $5 billion surplus that lay ahead in the 10 years after \nJanuary 20, 2001, said the first would be to meet our priority domestic \nchallenges--at that time, he particularly focused on providing a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare; certainly today he would \ninclude homeland security--the second, to pay down the national debt, \nand third, if there was any money left over, to return it to the \nAmerican taxpayers in the form of tax reductions.\n  Subsequent events have made the President's choices easier. We do not \nhave a $5 billion surplus to consider allocating among domestic \npriorities, paying down the national debt and, if funds are left over, \nreturning them to the American taxpayer because there is no surplus. \nThe surplus has magically, in 28 months, been converted into one of the \nlargest deficits that our Nation has ever suffered. And the 10-year \nprojection of those deficits is $2 trillion. When you add those two \nnumbers together, the $5 trillion surplus that was thought to be in \nhand as recently as January of 2001, and now the $2 trillion addition \nto our national debt that we face over the next 10 years, we have in \nexcess of a $7 trillion swing in our Nation's fiscal well-being in the \ncourse of barely over 2 years.\n  One of the areas in which this change in fiscal fortune has been \nparticularly pronounced has been homeland security. The Transportation \nSecurity Administration has told the appropriators that the agency is \nfacing a $913 million shortfall. This situation is so dire that the \nadministration is now requesting authority to shift funds from one \nsecurity program to another.\n  Our Nation's seaports stand out as an example of the administration's \nblind eye to the vulnerabilities faced by our Nation. Our Presiding \nOfficer represents a State with one of America's great seaports. \nBecause of the vulnerability of our Nation's 361 seaports, Congress \npassed the Maritime Transportation Security Act in November of last \nyear. The Senate attempted to include in that legislation provisions \nthat would guarantee the funding of maritime security. That effort, \nregrettably, failed.\n\n  But the failure did not stop there. The administration has ignored \nthe need to improve security at our Nation's seaports, requesting \nlittle to no seaport security funds in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and \nagain in 2004. The majority of funding which has been made available in \nseaport security grants has come at the action and the behest of \nCongress: $92 million in fiscal year 2002 through an emergency \nsupplemental; $125 million in fiscal year 2002 through yet another \nsupplemental; and $150 million in fiscal year 2003 in the omnibus \nappropriations bill. Of these amounts, only $92 million, those funds \nappropriated by the emergency supplemental in fiscal year 2002, has \nactually been distributed.\n  Recently, in my State of Florida, two of our ports received \napproximately $11 million of this $92 million. While this funding is a \nstep in the right direction, it is clearly inadequate. According to the \nCoast Guard, port security improvements are estimated to cost $963 \nmillion in the first year and $4.4 billion over the next 10 years. The \nneed is clear. The fiscal year 2002 $92 million garnered grant request \nthat totaled $695 million, the local governments, administrators, and \nusers of our seaports, found there were needs of $695 million but we \ndecided that $92 million was sufficient funding to meet those needs.\n  For the next $125 million--these are the funds that were appropriated \nin the supplemental appropriations of fiscal year 2002--for $125 \nmillion in funds available, there were $997 million of requests. \nAccording to information from the intelligence community, the threat is \nclear.\n  Although a great deal of information is necessarily classified, the \nAssociated Press is reporting today that the FBI arrested a New York \nCity cabdriver who had conducted surveillance on bridges in Miami, FL, \nafter he attempted to buy enough explosives to blow up a mountain from \nan undercover law enforcement agent, as well as purchasing bulletproof \nvests and night vision goggles.\n  Few can forget the recent tragedy of October 6, 2002, when the \nsupertanker Lindberg was attacked by a small boat packed with \nexplosives off the coast of Yemen.\n  Despite these threats, the administration has consistently reduced \nlevels of funding for homeland security. For example, the White House \nrefused to designate $2.5 billion in homeland security money as a \nbudgetary emergency in fiscal year 2002. This resulted in a loss to the \nTransportation Security Administration of $480 million.\n  This should not be an either/or choice. We should not have to decide \nwhether to protect our airports or protect our seaports. We should not \nhave to decide whether to go on the offensive against international \nterrorists by effectively carrying the war to where they are as opposed \nto adequately defending the homeland from terrorist attacks.\n  Why are these programs, vital to our homeland security, struggling \nfor funding, while we enact tax cuts which are projected over the next \n10 years to cost $1 trillion? Why are we doing this? This tax cut is \nsupposed to stimulate the economy. As Mr. Buffett has so eloquently \npointed out, the major component of the tax cut, which is the removal \nof taxation on corporate dividends, is unlikely to stimulate even the \nfirst job. But imagine the impact on our economy if we had to close \nAmerica's seaports due to a terrorist incident. Just as a point of \nreference, the cost last year of a labor strike at the seaports on the \nwest coast was estimated at more than $1 billion a day. What will be \nthe economic price for closing all 361 of our seaports?\n\n  A recent Booz Allen Hamilton port security analysis concluded that if \nthe Government were unable to open U.S. seaports within 20 days after \nan attack, the New York Stock Exchange would have to halt all trading.\n  In June of 2002, a White House press release on homeland security \nstated:\n\n       The President's most important job is to protect and defend \n     the American people.\n\n  Regrettably, this rhetoric has not been matched by performance. It is \nwrong that the price of these tax cuts may be our homeland security.\n  It does not have to be. In October, during the debate on the Iraq war \nresolution, I spoke about how the lives of millions of Americans are \nliterally in our hands. We will determine whether the level of security \nis that which our Nation is committed to do by the President's \nstatement that the most important job is to protect and defend the \nAmerican people, or if the only thing that stands between the American \npeople and additional and more lethal terrorist attacks is the rhetoric \nof the President.\n  We are making the false choice in favor of tax cuts as opposed to \nAmericans' security here at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the conference agreement on this tax \nbill, to oppose creating the artificial impression that this is going \nto actually improve the economy by creating new jobs, to oppose the \ncriticism that will legitimately be raised against the Congress for \nsetting one standard in terms of proper accounting for corporate \nAmerica but applying quite a different standard to ourselves.\n  We should oppose this conference report because it is denying to \nAmerica the resources necessary to truly protect our people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Florida on \nan outstanding statement. The Senator from Florida, who sits next to me \non the Senate Finance Committee, has long been a voice of fiscal \nresponsibility. His record is clear. I very much hope people across the \ncountry were listening to his excellent statement.\n  I also want to take a moment to thank our ranking member on the \nFinance Committee, the Senator from Montana. Earlier this evening, he \ngave outstanding statement describing the\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\nproblems with what is being proposed here. This is not a growth \npackage. This is not a package that is going to lift the economy. In \nfact, the evidence is increasingly clear that, in the long term, this \nis going to hurt economic growth in this Nation.\n  The ranking member also made clear the unfairness of this package. \nThis is as unfair a package as I have seen in the 17 years I have \nserved in the Senate.\n  All of those who vote for this package are going to have a lot of \nexplaining to do in the future because, as a former tax commissioner, I \nguarantee you are going to see one scandal after another as a result of \nthe passage of this tax bill.\n  This is going to provide lots of fodder for lots of writers, as they \nexamine the consequences of this tax bill because it is going to \nproduce, I predict on the floor of the Senate tonight, some of the most \nperverse tax outcomes we have ever seen as a result of legislation to \npass the Congress.\n  As Warren Buffett observed, in commenting on the President's proposed \nrepeal of taxes on dividends, his receptionist was going to pay a rate \nof taxes 10 times what he pays. He is the second richest man in the \nUnited States, and his receptionist is going to pay taxes at a rate 10 \ntimes what he pays.\n  Let me be clear. The measure we will vote on tomorrow morning is not \nquite the same measure as he was critiquing in his op-ed piece in the \nWashington Post. Instead of his paying one-tenth of what his \nreceptionist pays, it may be down to one-eighth of what his \nreceptionist pays.\n  I tell you, this is a scandal, and it is going to explode, and it is \ngoing to explode right in the faces of those who vote for it.\n  Here is the reality. We were told 2 years ago by the President that \nwe could expect almost $6 trillion of surpluses--$5.6 trillion, to be \nabsolutely precise--over the next decade. Now we know, instead of \nnearly $6 trillion of surpluses, if we enact the President's plan, we \ncan look forward to $2 trillion of deficits. That is the hard reality \nconfronting this Nation.\n  This chart shows what is happening to budget deficits year by year. \nThe President said, once we went into deficit, after he told us, you do \nnot have to worry about that, that is not going to happen: My program \nwith big tax cuts is going to lift the economy; it is going to produce \nmore jobs, more economic growth; we are going to be able to pay off the \ndebt; we are going to be able to protect Social Security, protect \nMedicare.\n  Here are the results. The deficits are exploding. The deficit this \nyear, on an operating basis, is going to be between $500 and $600 \nbillion. It is going to be about $400 billion before you deal with \nSocial Security. Under the President's plan, every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus money is going to be taken this year to pay for tax \ncuts and other expenses of the Government--every single dime.\n\n  The President said the deficits will be small and short lived. Wrong \nagain. These deficits are massive, and we see no end in sight. We have \n$550 billion of deficits on a $2.2 trillion budget? That is large by \nany calculation. We do not see deficits on an operating basis below \n$300 billion a year anytime for the next decade.\n  The President told us 2 years ago, if we adopted his plan, we would \nbe able to virtually eliminate the national debt. He said he would be \nable to retire all of the debt that was available to retire. He said by \n2008 we would be down to $36 billion of publicly held debt. Now, after \nadopting his plan, we see that by 2008 we will not be down to $36 \nbillion.\n  Instead, the debt is going to be $5.2 trillion. That is the publicly \nheld debt. That is just part of the story. The gross debt of the United \nStates is even worse. The gross debt of the United States at the end of \nthis year will be approximately $6.7 trillion. If we adopt the \nPresident's plan, at the end of this decade it is going to be $12 \ntrillion. The deficits and debt are exploding. They are exploding at \nthe worst possible time.\n  Why is it the worst possible time? Here is the reason it is the worst \npossible time.\n  This chart shows the Medicare trust funds, the Social Security trust \nfunds, and the cost of the tax cut the President has proposed. The blue \nbar is the Medicare trust fund, the green bar is the Social Security \ntrust fund, and the red bars are the tax cuts. You can see that right \nnow the trust funds are throwing off big surpluses. In fact, just this \nyear, Social Security will produce a surplus of $13 billion. But look \nat what happens later on in this decade and in the next decade when the \nbaby boomers start to retire. Then the trust funds turn cash negative. \nAt the very time they go cash negative, the cost of the tax cuts \nexplodes, dragging us deep into deficit and debt in a way that is \ntotally unsustainable--over $1 trillion a year in deficits.\n  This isn't my projection. These are the President's own projections. \nThis is page 43 of his analytical perspectives from the budget.\n  Here is his long-term outlook on the deficit as a percentage of the \ngross domestic product. Economists like to use that measurement because \nit is an apples-to-apples comparison over time. It takes out the effect \nof inflation.\n  This is the President's projection of where we are headed. If we \nadopt his tax plan and his spending plan, we never get out of deficits. \nThese deficits that look relatively small compared to where we are \nheaded according to the President are, in fact, record deficits. The \ndeficit we are going to run this year is going to be the largest \ndeficit ever in the history of America. The previous largest deficit we \nran on a unified basis where all the money is put into the same pot and \nall the expenses come out of that pot--the largest deficit we ever had \non the unified basis was $290 billion. On a unified basis this year, \nthe deficit is going to be over $400 billion. That is here. As a \npercentage of gross domestic product, you can calculate it yourself--\n$400 billion on a $1.5 trillion economy. That is about 3.6 percent or \n3.7 percent of gross domestic product deficit. But look at where we are \nheaded. Again, this is the President's assessment of where we are \nheaded if we adopt his plan.\n  Deficits as a percentage of gross domestic product of over 12 \npercent. Twelve percent on the economy of today would be a deficit of \nover $1.2 trillion this year.\n  Who is going to loan us the money? America is going to become a \ndeadbeat. Why has the dollar plunged 20 percent in value in just the \nlast several months? Why are economists saying it is poised to plunge \nperhaps another 10 percent? What are the implications for foreigners \nwho are buying dollar-denominated investments today when they see the \ndollar dropping like a rock? Do you think they want to hold American \nbonds? Do you think they want to hold American stocks when the value of \nthe dollar is dropping like a rock? What happens to the American \neconomy if they start to pull their money out of our stock market and \nout of our bond market? Do you want to see interest rates jump and see \nequity values plunge? Just have this dynamic continue, and it will \nrattle the eyeteeth of the markets in this country. The idea that this \nis going to increase markets--I am afraid it is going to be painful.\n\n  This year alone, revenues are running $100 billion below forecasts--\nforecasts made only 7 months ago. Yet it is running $100 billion below \nwhat was forecast. If that continues, we are going to have the lowest \nrevenue as a percentage of our gross domestic product since 1959, the \nlowest revenue in 44 years.\n  Remember when the President told us 2 years ago when revenue was the \nhighest percentage of gross domestic product it has been in 40 years, \nhe said we had to have a big tax cut to give the money back to the \npeople. And we did. Now revenue is poised to be the lowest it has been \nin more than 40 years, and the President's answer is the same: Let's \nhave another big tax cut. Give the money back to the people. He says it \nis the people's money. He is right about that. That is exactly whose \nmoney it is. It is the people's money.\n  Do you know what else? It is the people's debt. It is the people's \nSocial Security. It is the people's Medicare. And this President is \nrunning up the debt in an unprecedented way and at the worst possible \ntime. He is running up the debt right before the baby boomers start to \nretire.\n  If there is any question about his running up the debt, we are going \nto have it in our face tomorrow. We are\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\ngoing to have it before us tomorrow. He is asking not only for one of \nthe biggest tax cuts ever, but he is asking for one of the biggest \nincreases in debt ever. In fact, it is the biggest increase in debt in \nthe history of our country.\n  The last time he increased the debt, it was a $450 billion increase \nin June of 2002. But by April of 2003, the President is back asking \nCongress to increase the debt by $984 billion in one fell swoop--almost \n$1 trillion of added debt.\n  This is an economic plan that is not working. It is failing. It is \ndangerous to the future of our country. The plan before us isn't going \nto work.\n  How can I be so sure? I just said we have a $10.5 trillion economy, \nand this tax cut will provide $55 billion of lift in a $10.5 trillion \neconomy. That is less than one-half of 1 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. If all of it translates into increased economic activity, the \nmost it can affect is one-half of 1 percent of gross domestic product.\n  This is a $350 billion package. At least it is advertised to be, \ndespite the gimmicks it has. It is the most gimmick-laden package we \nhave ever considered on the floor of the Senate. It costs $350 billion. \nOnly 16 percent of it is effective this year to give stimulus to the \neconomy. It is an upside-down plan. It provides too little lift now \nwhen we need it, and it costs too much in future years when we can't \nafford it. It is totally an upside-down plan.\n  If you took out the gimmicks, all the sunsets, and the phase-ins, and \nthe dodging around that is in this plan, it doesn't cost $350 billion. \nIt costs $1 trillion.\n  Those who are the most fervent advocates of this plan have no \nintention to sunset the various elements of this tax plan. If you do \nnot sunset it, the true cost is $1 trillion.\n\n  We go to the question of, Will this stimulate the economy? This is \nthe answer of the people who were hired by the White House and hired by \nthe Congressional Budget Office to answer that question. This is their \nanswer, as shown on this chart. This black line is the President's \npolicy. The green line is the base; that is, if you do nothing.\n  What this shows is, you get that one-half of 1 percent increase in \nGDP in the early years, but after 2004 this plan is worse than doing \nnothing--worse than doing nothing in terms of economic growth. Why?\n  Well, the people who do that analysis--and, again, they are hired by \nthe White House; they are hired by the Congressional Budget Office to \ndo this kind of analysis--this is what they say:\n\n       Initially the plan would stimulate aggregate demand \n     significantly by raising disposable income, boosting equity \n     values, and reducing the cost of capital. However, the tax \n     cut also reduces national saving directly while offering \n     little new, permanent incentive for either private saving or \n     labor supply. Therefore, unless it is paid for with a \n     reduction in Federal outlays--\n\nwhich it is not--\n\n     the plan will raise equilibrium real interest rates, ``crowd \n     out'' private-sector investment, and eventually undermine \n     potential GDP.\n\n  That is what Macroeconomic Advisers say. They are not alone.\n  This is from the Joint Committee on Taxation with a macroeconomic \nanalysis of the House bill, which is the basis of the conference \nagreement we will have before us to vote on tomorrow:\n\n       The simulations indicate that eventually the effects of the \n     increasing deficit will outweigh the positive effects of the \n     tax policy, and the buildup of private non-residential \n     capital stock will likely decline.\n\n  I do not know how many of our own experts we have to have tell us \nthat we are going down the wrong path, but let's say you don't put any \nstock in the people we have hired to advise us. Let's say you don't \ntrust the Joint Committee on Taxation. Let's say you don't trust \nMacroeconomic Advisers.\n  How about 250 of the most prominent CEOs in America, the Council on \nEconomic Development? They say current budget projections seriously \nunderstate the problem. While slow economic growth has caused much of \nthe immediate deterioration in the deficit, the deficits in later years \nreflect our tax-and-spending choices. And the inevitable conclusion: \ndeficits do matter.\n  Those who are running around this town now telling us that deficits \ndo not matter are the folks who, for years, made political careers in \nsaying deficits did matter. Well, deficits do matter. Anybody who tells \nthe American people they don't is shoveling smoke.\n  The final point they made is the aging of our population compounds \nthe problem. They could not be more right.\n  Of course, they are not alone. Here are 10 Nobel laureates in \neconomics, 10 people who have had the greatest achievement, the \ngreatest recognition in economics. What do they say?\n\n       The tax-cut plan proposed by President Bush is not the \n     answer to our problems. Regardless of how one views the \n     specifics of the plan, there is wide agreement that \n     its purpose is permanent change in the tax structure, not \n     the creation of jobs and growth in the near term.\n\n  ``Not the creation of jobs and growth in the near term.'' They need \nto change the title of this bill from the ``Jobs and Growth Package'' \nto the ``Not Jobs and Growth Package'' because that is what it is \nbecause it explodes the deficits and debt. It is all financed with \nborrowed money. The dead weight of those deficits and debt will reduce \neconomic growth, not improve it.\n  The economists go on to say--again, 10 Nobel laureates--\n\n       Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget \n     outlook, adding to the Nation's projected chronic deficits.\n\n  It is not just them. This is the head of the Federal Reserve Board, \nChairman Alan Greenspan, who endorsed the President's last round of tax \ncuts. Now he is saying we have to start paying attention to the growth \nof these deficits.\n  He says:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended to.\n\n  But he said more. He said the tax cuts that the President is \nproposing should be paid for. The President has no proposal to pay for \nthese tax cuts. He is not offsetting them by reducing spending. In \nfact, he is increasing spending by over $600 billion above the baseline \nat the same time he is recommending $1.6 trillion of additional tax \ncuts, when we already have record deficits.\n  My grandmother told me: If somebody tells you something is too good \nto be true, it probably is. When the President told us, 2 years ago, \nyou could have it all, you could have a major defense buildup, you \ncould have a massive tax cut, you could protect Social Security and \nMedicare fully, and in addition, you would be able to pay off the \nnational debt, that sounded awfully good. But do you know what? It was \nnot true. It was not close to being true.\n  We have already seen that instead of paying off the debt by 2008, it \nis going to be over $5 trillion. We also know now, instead of \nprotecting Social Security, the President's plan is going to take and \nloot virtually every penny of the Social Security surplus every year \nfor the rest of the decade. This year, he is going to take every dime. \nNext year, he is going to take every dime; the next year, every dime; \nthe next year, every dime.\n  There are real consequences to the decision that is going to be made \non this floor tomorrow. These are consequential decisions.\n  Chairman Greenspan said: If, however, in the process of cutting taxes \nyou get significant increases in deficits, which induce a rise in long-\nterm interest rates, you will be significantly undercutting the \nbenefits that would be achieved from the tax cuts.\n  Again, it is not just Chairman Greenspan or 10 Nobel laureates or any \nof the others we have cited. Here are people at McKinsey & Co., one of \nthe foremost consulting firms in the Nation, in fact, in the world. Mr. \nKoller and Ms. Foushee noted in a recent report that, as of last year, \nowners of 61 percent of all common stock were not subject to tax. They \nwere not even subject to tax.\n  Anybody who is listening: If you have a 401(k), you do not pay taxes \non dividends. In fact, 61 percent, according to their analysis, of all \ncommon stock owners were not subject to tax. So markets are driven by \ninvestors who are not concerned with the tax treatment of dividends. \nThus ``the proposed tax cut'' on dividends ``seems unlikely to have a \nsignificant or lasting effect on U.S. share prices.''\n  It is not just consultants from one of the most prominent consulting \nfirms or 10 Nobel laureates or the Chairman of the Federal Reserve who \nare warning us about the danger of the direction we are taking. But \nhere is Warren Buffett. I think he is the second most wealthy\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nman in America. He calls this ``dividend voodoo.'' He calls dividend \ntax relief ``welfare for the rich.'' He said:\n\n       When you listen to tax-cut rhetoric, remember that giving \n     one class of taxpayer a ``break'' requires--now or down the \n     line--that an equivalent burden be imposed on other parties.\n\n  Now, obviously, that is true because we are in deficits. Remember, \nall of this money that is going out for a tax cut is being borrowed. In \nwhose name is it being borrowed? It is being borrowed in all of our \nnames.\n  This is not out of surplus funds. This is out of borrowed funds. \nEvery dime of this tax cut is being financed with borrowed money. When \nthe President says it is the people's money, he is right. It is also \nthe people's debt. That is how this is being financed. It is being \nfinanced by debt. Mr. Buffett goes on to say:\n\n       Government can't deliver a free lunch to the country as a \n     whole. It can, however, determine who pays for lunch. And \n     last week the Senate handed the bill to the wrong party.\n       Supporters of making dividends tax-free like to paint \n     critics as promoters of class warfare. The fact is, however, \n     that their proposal promotes class welfare. For my class.\n\n  Mr. Buffett is referring to himself and other extraordinarily wealthy \nindividuals.\n  Where is a big chunk of the money coming from? Here it is. We are \ngoing to run, in Social Security, $2.7 trillion in surpluses over the \nnext decade. Under the President's plan, $2.698 trillion is being taken \nto pay for these tax cuts and other expenses. This is the biggest raid \non Social Security that has ever been conducted. It is being done right \non the eve of the retirement of the baby boom generation. What a \nprofound mistake.\n  This plan is also deeply unfair. As Mr. Buffett said: His class is \nthe biggest beneficiary. But he has that right. For those earning over \n$1 million a year, their tax cut for this year alone will be over \n$93,000. Let me say that again. If you are fortunate enough to be \nearning over $1 million a year in 2003, this package will give you on \naverage a tax cut this year of over $93,000. If you are a middle-income \nperson, if you are in the 20 percent of taxpayers who are right in the \nmiddle of the income distribution, your average benefit will be $217. \nDo you think that is fair? Our friends on the other side will say: \nWell, rich people pay more taxes. Indeed, they do. That is how our tax \nsystem works. But they don't pay that disproportionate a share of the \ntaxes. No. No. They pay about 23 or 24 percent of the taxes. They are \ngetting almost 40 percent of the benefit out of this plan. That is what \nis going on here. Don't let anybody tell you this is a fair plan, \nevenly distributed, based on what people pay in taxes, because it is \nnot. It is not even close to being evenly distributed.\n  It doesn't end there. This tax bill produces gimmick after gimmick \nafter gimmick to hide its true cost. This is a ``now you see it, now \nyou don't'' tax plan that comes and goes. Taxes are lower. Taxes are \nraised. Taxes are jumping all around because they have to hide the true \ncost of this plan.\n  Here is how they propose fixing the standard deduction marriage \npenalty. The marriage penalty is eliminated when you get to a standard \ndeduction for joint filers of $9,500. So for 2003 and 2004, they are at \n$9,500. Then in 2005, they drop it down to $8,265, representing a huge \ntax increase for those couples for 2005. Then they jump it up to $8,740 \nfor 2006; $8,883 for 2007; then in 2009 and 2010, it goes back up to \n$9,500. Then look what happens in 2011, 2012, 2013. I mean this thing \nis embarrassingly bad. Then it goes down to the standard deduction to \n$7,950--meaning another big tax increase for people facing the marriage \npenalty. They don't just do it with the marriage penalty.\n  Here is what they do with the child tax credit: it was $600 in 2002; \nthey increase it to $1,000 in 2003 and 2004. Then they cut it to $700 \nfor 4 years. Then they raise it to $800. Then in 2010 they raise it to \n$1,000. Then they cut it in 2011, 2012, and 2013 back down to $500.\n\n  Does this make any sense to anybody watching or listening; this kind \nof tax policy? The ranking member calls this a yo-yo tax plan. It is at \nleast a yo-yo. And it doesn't end with the marriage penalty or the \nchild tax credit. Here is the 10-percent bracket. It shrinks for 2 \nyears, then disappears altogether in 2011. Look at this plan. I don't \nknow. It is not a pretty thing. From $12,000, it goes up to $14,000 for \n2 years, then back down to $12,000 for 3 years, then it jumps for 3 \nyears up to $14,000. Then it goes down to zero for 3 years. Who is \nkidding who about this plan?\n  This thing is absurd on its face. Here is the small business \nexpensing limit. From $25,000 in 2002, they increase it to $100,000 for \n2003, 2004, 2005. Then they cut it back to $25,000 all the rest of the \ntime. Top rate on dividends, same pattern, jumping all around: 38.6, \nthen they cut it to 15 percent for 6 years. Then they jump it back up \nto 35 percent for 5 years.\n  Our ranking member has called it a yo-yo tax plan. There is the yo-\nyo, up and down and all around. Economists say this is going to create \nsuch confusion, such chaos, such a lack of predictability in the tax \nsystem that in and of itself, the unpredictability will cost the \neconomy substantially.\n  The top rate on capital gains, same thing, jumping all around: 20 \npercent, then down to 15 percent for 6 years, then it is back up to 20 \npercent for 5 years.\n  This is a tax policy that not even a mother would love, if this were \na child.\n  We can do better than this. This is a policy that is irresponsible \nfiscally. It is ineffective in terms of stimulus, and it is totally \nunfair. Those are the best things I can think to say about it.\n  This is a tax policy that is going to plunge us right off the cliff \ninto deficits and debt as far as the eye can see, and it is going to \nhurt this economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference report. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, as always the Senator from North Dakota \nhas made an eloquent presentation, a graphic presentation, an \nintellectually honest presentation of where we stand with regard to the \neconomic policies before us in the Senate. I appreciate his strong \neffort in trying to educate our colleagues and the public with a \ngraphic demonstration of many of the weaknesses which I will discuss \ntonight with regard to the conference report, the so-called tax relief \nprogram.\n  Tomorrow, this body will in all probability pass two pieces of \nlegislation which will have tremendous economic impact on the American \npeople and our economy. In my view, they will have a negative economic \nimpact. I do not consider this a jobs and growth package. I believe it \nis antigrowth, and I will go through some of the reasons that is the \ncase.\n  One thing for sure is, I know when we pass that debt limit tomorrow--\nthat $984 billion debt limit, just a little smidgen under $1 trillion. \nIt's like pricing something at $99.95, just under $100. It is so we \ndon't have to say it is by $1 trillion we are increasing the debt limit \ntomorrow. We are increasing, for every single American who is watching \nthis tonight, their debt load $3,500. That is how much we are \nincreasing it as we spend out that debt limit increase over the next \nyear or 15 months.\n  By the way, that is $28 billion of debt we are laying on the people \nof the State of New Jersey. I think they ought to know that. That is a \nhuge cost and a big implication over time. I don't want to talk about \nthe debt limit tonight because we will have time to go through that \ntomorrow. It is really indicative of the problem; it is not the \nproblem. The underlying economic policy is what has allowed that to \nhappen.\n  The conference report that will be before us--I hope we get a chance \nto read it so we don't have $70 billion errors that show up after the \nfact because of how we have framed it. But I know from the outlines of \nwhat we have been able to see this is going to have a dramatic impact \non the future of our economy and the quality of life for every \nAmerican, because in this tax program we are making enormous choices. I \nthink this legislation is going to lead to--well, we already have \nmassive deficits. I am hearing estimates from people in the private \nsector that we are now well over $400 billion this year--north of 4 \npercent GDP. That is deepening the debt as we go forward. I think this \nwill weaken the economy in the long term. I will try to say some of the \nreasons why. I almost certainly know it is going to reduce the quality \nof life for the people of the United States.\n  Before I talk about the economic implications, I think this needs to \nbe\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\nframed in the context of the values we are speaking to while we go \nthrough this tax cut legislation. It says a lot about us as Senators, \nAmericans, and about what our priorities are.\n  Here we have a huge set of tax breaks for the privileged few, some \nwould say elite: $93,000 is the estimate for people making over $1 \nmillion, with 53 percent of all taxpaying Americans only getting $100 \nor less. Let's hear that again. Less than 1 percent of taxpayers make \nover a million dollars, but they get a $93,000 tax break, and 53 \npercent of the taxpaying Americans get less than $100.\n  What are we trading that off against with our ability to invest back \nin America? I don't think investing in America is really the issue. The \nadministration is calling for deep cuts in education. We are not \nfulfilling our mandate on Leave No Child Behind. We gave them the test, \nbut not the money. We are talking about limiting the benefits for our \nveterans. We are cutting back on the number of people who have access \nto veterans hospitals and clinics in my home State--a number of \nveterans who have access to a prescription drug benefit they were \npromised. We are talking about limiting the dollars we can invest in \nhomeland security.\n  We are now at level orange, and every State and community now has \ntheir law enforcement and local folks on overtime, running up huge \ntabs. In New Jersey, I think the figure is about $1.2 million a week, \nwith the way they calculated it the last time. If it is wrong, it is a \nlot more. These are incredible burdens we are putting on them. Frankly, \nI think what really is a mistake is that we are going to lose our \nability to protect Social Security and make sure Medicare is there for \nfuture generations. We have 37 million Americans now who are over 65 \nand in another 10, 15 years, we will have about 75 million, give or \ntake. We will not, with tax policies that we have in place today, be \nable to secure Social Security and Medicare as we know it today. You \nare going to hear the term ``reform'' all the time. All that is about \nis not having the capacity to deal with the demands Medicare is going \nto place on our system of Social Security in the years ahead. Some of \nus think there is a real attempt to undermine the basic social safety \nnet programs that are very much a part of the values of the American \nway of life.\n\n  Maybe the President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve in this tax cut, or that tax breaks for a very limited number \nof folks are more important than education. I don't think people feel \nthat way in New Jersey. Maybe they believe it is more important to \nforce cuts in Social Security or guaranteed benefits on Social Security \ndown the road. Maybe we need to privatize it because we don't have the \nresources. I don't think I am hearing that from constituents in New \nJersey, and that is not what I will fight for on the floor as we go \nahead.\n  Most of my constituents strongly disagree with those priorities and \nthe values of placing these tax breaks that are heavily loaded and \nbenefiting those who are already doing well in our society versus \nhaving the ability to invest back in America the way I think so many \nbelieve--at least my constituents. I think it will be a hard sell when \nthey get the fundamental facts out about what this tax cut program is \nall about.\n  Having said what I had to say about values, the problem with this \nlegislation goes well beyond those issues. The key problem is very \nsimple. I don't think it works. I just think it is flat out not \nintended to revive our economy. There is no indication it is going to \ncreate jobs. Actually, it might well do the opposite because we are \nundermining the tax base of our State and local governments. They have \nto raise taxes. We are taking money off the balance sheets of \ncorporations by giving them encouragement to pay dividends. I don't \nknow how companies go out and hire people, invest in plant and \nequipment, or put projects together on research and development when \nthey don't have cash. I think that is actually what drives and gives \nincentive to the corporations to operate. So I have a hard time \nunderstanding even the theory of this program.\n  I know the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle disagree. I know they have a theory about how these tax breaks \nwork. They seem to really believe that huge windfalls or large tax \nbreaks for a limited number of investors eventually will trickle their \nway through the system to working Americans. They seem to believe \ncutting taxes will actually increase flows of revenue to the Federal \nGovernment. They have to believe that. I believe they are sincere; they \nmust be. I didn't come to the floor to question anybody's motivations \nor sincerity. But their arguments don't stand up to serious analysis \nand scrutiny by anyone who stands back and asks: Does this work? What \ndoes history tell us? It contradicts these views; it directly \ncontradicts the basic principles of economics as expressed in the past \nby some of the administration's own policymakers, which I will cite as \nwe go down the road.\n  We have tried radical supply-side economics before; we tried them \nback in the 1980s. We certainly got the massive deficits. Then we had \nthe crash of 1987, and we had all kinds of serious dislocations and a \nsustained period of slow economic growth in the late 1980s and early \n1990s. We tried them just 2 years ago when President Bush and Congress \npushed through the first tax cut. Where are the results? Tell me what \nhas happened to employment since we passed the first tax cut. I think \nit is something like we have lost 2 million jobs since then. We have \nhad 2.7 million private sector jobs lost since we have been \nimplementing and debating these kinds of policies. So it didn't work \nthe first time, and we are going to try the second time.\n  We have to also understand our fiscal position does have something to \ndo with what happens in the economy. We have moved, in the 2 years and \n4 months since this administration has been in office, from a projected \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion to a deficit projection of $1.8 trillion.\n  It is mind-boggling how big these numbers are, but a $7 trillion \nswing in the cash position of the Federal Government is a big deal. It \nis not just a little bit of money. That is not $1. That is $1 trillion, \n$2 trillion, all the way up to $7 trillion of negative cash swing for \nthe Federal Government in 2 years and 4 months.\n  If you were running a business and you had that kind of cash swing, I \nguess you would be scrambling to find someone to lend you money. Maybe \nthat is what we are seeing with respect to our dollar today, which has \nhad a 20-percent depreciation. Maybe people are a little less \nenthusiastic about holding dollar assets outside the United States.\n  As I said, we lost 2.7 million private sector jobs. Two million \npeople today have been unemployed for over 6 months. Frankly, this \nadministration is on track for the worst job creation record in over 50 \nyears, and we are trying to do the same thing over and over.\n  The history is clear, at least to this reader of history. Large tax \nbreaks, privileged few, massive deficits, and massive debt simply do \nnot work. They do not make the pie expand; they make it shrink. They do \nnot lift all boats; they drain the economy and hurt everyone, \nincluding, by the way, many of those who get the bulk of the tax \nbreaks.\n  I do not understand why we thought policies were so bad in the 1990s. \nThere was a great expansion of wealth at all levels across the economic \nspectrum in this country. Probably more millionaires were made in the \n1990s than any time in the history of the United States.\n  That is the history that I know, and it should not come as a surprise \nbecause economists have been arguing against these kinds of policies \nfor years. Which economists? The Senator from North Dakota talked about \nthe 10 Nobel Prize winners, and there are 450 economists from academic \ninstitutions across America, 250 business folks, economists such as \nAlan Greenspan, major economists on Wall Street--across the economy--\nwho speak out against these policies. I will add, and this is the hard \none, economists from the Bush administration.\n  Let me read from the book authored by President Bush's nominee--I \nguess he has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, but the nomination \nhas been reported out of the Senate Banking Committee--to be head of \nthe Council of Economic Advisers, Greg Mankiw. He is a great economist \nfrom Harvard. He wrote the textbook for Economics 101 that is being \nused at most colleges\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\nacross America today. It is called ``The Essentials of Economics.'' I \nusually bring it with me and read it but I did not do that tonight.\n  In this book, obviously written before joining the Bush \nadministration, Professor Mankiw, in effect, points out the fundamental \nfallacies of this tax policy, this fiscal policy. I will take, for \nexample, the argument from many administration officials that deficits \ndo not matter. This happens to be on page 401. I do not have the book. \nI used to cite it regularly. Professor Mankiw says:\n\n       When the Government reduces national savings by running a \n     budget deficit--\n\n  I think that is what we are doing now--\n\n     the interest rate rises and investment falls because \n     investment is important for long run economic growth. \n     Government budget deficits reduce the economy's growth rate.\n\n  That is Professor Mankiw at page 401 of his textbook, ``The \nEssentials of Economics.''\n  What about claims that cutting taxes will actually lead to higher \nlevels of revenue? That is the supply-side dynamic scoring. What does \nProfessor Mankiw say about that? This is another quote:\n\n       Some supplysiders push their arguments to ridiculous \n     extremes claiming, for instance, that tax cuts would generate \n     so much growth that they would be self-financing. The \n     experience of the Reagan years puts this theory to rest.\n\n  Professor Mankiw is obviously right about the bankruptcy of supply-\nside economics, at least from my perspective. Fortunately, he is wrong \nabout one thing. The Reagan years did not prove it to somebody or a \nwhole bunch of folks because we are trying it all over again. It is \nalive and well right here in Washington, DC, and we are not following \nwhat I think are the essentials of economics, and we are practicing \nideological economics, politics, as opposed to dealing with the real \nworld as I think most folks know it.\n  The truth is deficits do matter. They matter for our economy, just as \nthey matter for ordinary American families, just as they do for our \nState and local governments, just as they do for everyone who operates \nin an economic context.\n  According to one analysis, by lowering national savings and \nincreasing long-term interest rates, the incomes of working Americans \nwould be reduced by about 2 percent, or about $1,000 per person. That \nis the economic analysis that is often an accepted rule of thumb. While \nthe tax breaks would go primarily to the few of the best-off Americans, \nmost Americans will suffer from this reduction in their income. Most \nAmericans will.\n  Keep in mind, the Federal debt does not come free. It leads to \nincreases in interest payments that must be paid by ordinary American \ntaxpayers. Over 10 years, spending on interest on additional debt, what \nmight be called a debt tax, in my view--and I would like to get that \nout--of the increase of the deficit that is projected in the years \nahead would amount to $2.4 trillion for the tax cut that we are going \nto probably sign off on tomorrow.\n  That, by the way, is $30,000 in interest burden for a family of four. \nI don't know, that sort of offsets a lot of this talk about the kind of \nbenefit this is supposedly going to have in the pockets of individuals. \nSomehow or another, those interest expenses for the Federal Government \nare going to have to get paid by the taxpayer. Somehow or another they \nare going to have to show up. For a family of four, that is the \ninterest burden.\n  The impact of higher interest rates is not limited to higher taxes \nthat our taxpayers will have to pay to service the Federal debt. It is \nalso going to impact the debt payments they are going to have to make. \nIt has been estimated that for every 1-percent increase in the deficit \nas a percentage of GDP, other things being equal, interest rates go up \nto where they would have been otherwise one-half to 1 percent.\n  We have a weak economy right now, so we have very low interest rates. \nMaybe they would be lower if we did not have huge deficits, and if we \nhappened to get back into a more rapidly growing economy, then the \nincrease in interest rates will be very rapid and the cost for ordinary \nfamilies will be very real.\n  For instance, on a $100,000 30-year mortgage, the increase in \nmortgage payments by that 1-percent increase would be a $860 per year \npayment. That is out of pocket. That is a tax.\n  Consider what you are going to be paying in additional dollars on car \nloans, something approaching $100 a year if you had a $10,000 car loan; \nmultiply it out by 30,000, you get $300 or $400 on car loan payments, \nand then on a $20,000 student loan or maybe it is a $100,000 student \nloan, and you get another $500. Cumulative, if the economic analysis is \nright by people who have been doing this over and over, we have \nfamilies paying something like $2,000 more in higher interest costs \nthan they would pay if we did not have these kinds of deficits.\n  The Bush debt tax would take a real bite out of family budgets. \nRemember, 53 percent of Americans are going to get $100 or less, and I \njust went through how somebody could end up paying $2,000 more in \ninterest expense, which I call a debt tax.\n  This bill will not really result in tax cuts for many, if not most, \nAmericans, and it will result in a massive tax burden shift with a \nhandful of elite investors paying far fewer Federal taxes and other \ntaxpayers eventually having to make up the difference somehow or \nanother.\n  Somehow or another it often is at the State and local level. Rising \nproperty taxes, sales taxes, State income taxes, and gas taxes all are \nlikely to be going up. I should not say likely; they are going up. New \nJersey property taxes at the local level went up 7 percent this year. \nAcross the river in New York City they went up 18 percent.\n  We are putting a burden on State and local governments that is going \nto more than make up for anybody's average--pick the number. We are \ngoing to end up paying more in taxes at the State and local level than \nanybody could argue someone is making on the kinds of tax breaks we are \ndoing, other than the very top income earners in America.\n  This does not do very much for average Americans, for people who are \nmiddle income, working hard, trying to make things happen with a solid \nbudget. This is a massive tax shift from those who are doing well to \nmiddle-income folks, lower income folks.\n  Four out of five Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in \nincome taxes. Why we did not think about payroll taxes or wage tax \ncredits is hard for me to understand. That is where the real tax burden \nis. If we are going to protect Social Security and Medicare as we go \nforward, I wonder where we are going to get those dollars. Probably \nright back in the payroll taxes.\n  In my view, this is not a tax cut; it is a tax shift. Frankly, this \nshould not come as a surprise to anyone. One does not need an economics \ndegree to be skeptical about promises based on the premise that we have \na free lunch; that if we cut taxes, revenues are going to grow so much \nthat we do not have to worry about our budget deficit.\n  The truth is, we pass these tax breaks out to a very narrow segment \nof society. Everybody else ends up paying. I suppose there might be an \nargument for the Bush debt tax if it were being used somehow to create \njobs and strengthen the economy, but it will not. According to one \nrespected firm, Economy.com, the White House plan, which is similar to \nthe legislation before us in many ways, causes the loss of 750,000 jobs \nover the next 10 years. That is on top of the 2.7 we have already lost.\n  In my view, the Republican plan will depress economic growth not only \nbecause it will dramatically increase Federal debt but because of its \nfailure to address the worst fiscal crisis facing our States in 50 \nyears.\n  I am glad we put $20 billion into this program. I am glad that in the \nnegotiations we have provided some help. But with the dividend \nexclusion and the capital gains tied to State income tax rates, in most \ninstances they are going to be losing, if it were pure dividend \nexclusion, $10 billion. I do not really know how this is going to apply \nto the States, but it is not going to be a healthy benefit to our State \ngovernments.\n  Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who do not care. Again, \nthere is this ideological policy as opposed to an economic policy. I \nwill only quote one leading supporter of this proposal who is very \nstrong in supporting most of\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\nthe things the administration does, and that is Grover Norquist. He has \nstated, I guess, what we are trying to practice: I hope the State goes \nbankrupt.\n  Well, some of my colleagues may hope that States go bankrupt. I do \nnot think many of them do. The truth is, when States face problems, it \nis not just State officials who suffer. It is working families. It is \nkids on CHIPS, the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It is our hospitals. It is our roads. It is all that \nholds us together as a society.\n\n  I go full circle and come back. This is about values as well as about \neconomic numbers: Who gets what and what is going to happen to the \neconomy? I think we are missing it and missing it big time in \nunderstanding that for the benefit of a very few, we are actually \nwalking away from helping those in whom I think many of us believe we \nought to be investing.\n  I could go on and on about other elements, but I see the ranking \nmember who has fought so hard for reasonable economic policies, Senator \nBaucus. He has talked about this as a yo-yo or shell game, whatever one \nwants to call it, with sunsets. We have made sunsets, which should be a \nbeautiful thought in American minds, into something that is almost \nsilly in the context of this particular package. The $350 billion is \nreally $800 billion to $1 trillion. I am sure those who have proposed \nthis think this is a program that is going to stay on the books. If we \nare going to stay with this program, including even some of the middle-\nclass income tax breaks on marriage penalty, child tax credits and \nother things, this will amount to $800 billion to $1 trillion.\n  This is bad fiction. This is not even a fair representation of the \nreality of the cost. So not only is it bad economic policy, I think it \nalso challenges the basic values that we should be representing in the \nSenate. It is not even truthful.\n  Some could argue that it is Enron-like accounting. I think it is not \nthe right way to deal with the American people to say we have a $350 \nbillion tax cut when we really have a $1 trillion tax cut, at best. It \nmay be a little less, may be a little more, depending on how things \nwork out.\n  This is going to bring on a new age in tax shelters, a new \nopportunity that people are going to be working on. They are probably \nworking on it right now on Wall Street. The differential between earned \nincome and dividend and capital gains income creates an enormous \nbonanza of opportunity for the creative mind to translate current \nearnings, wage earnings, into capital gains.\n  There will be more midnight oil burned in the next 3 months figuring \nout tax shelter strategies than we have ever been able to imagine. From \nwhat I understand--again I have not seen the detail of it--we took out \nall of the closing of loopholes that were a positive part of the Senate \nbill. I find some of the values that we are reflecting there an \nenormously disturbing element from what I understand about this \nconference report.\n  The saying is, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on \nme. I think that is what we are doing with this proposal. I do not \nthink it does what it says it is going to do about growing the economy. \nI do not think it reflects our values. I sure do not think the American \npeople are getting a tax break. What they are getting is a debt tax \nlaid on them that is going to overwhelm any of the benefits. In the \nlong run, we threaten ourselves and our ability to invest in education, \ninvest in Social Security.\n  I do not get it. I think it is a bad thing to do. I hope my \ncolleagues will have a good night's sleep, think a little bit about how \nsome of this works, come back and be honest with the American people, \nrid ourselves of some of these gimmickries, and get on with an \neffective fiscal policy and economic policy that really does work for \nworking families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the order is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). We are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6958-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6958-S6964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOBS AND GROWTH PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I use morning business as a forum to \ndiscuss some of the issues that are going to be coming up tonight and \ntomorrow morning before we vote on the tax bill conference, the jobs \nbill, the growth package--whatever you want to call it. I take my \nopportunity to speak to the conference report that was agreed to this \nafternoon.\n  There has been a great deal of hard work that has taken place in the \nlast few days to bring the reconciliation conference agreement to \ncompletion. I thank all of my colleagues and the House for their hard \nwork and their cooperation in meeting our goal of getting a jobs and \ngrowth bill to the President by this Memorial Day recess.\n  We all agree the economy needs a shot in the arm. Although our \neconomy is growing, it is not growing fast enough to create jobs. The \ndifference is it has been growing for about a year and a half at 2 \npercent, roughly. We do not create jobs at 2 percent even though the \neconomy is growing. It takes growth of about 3 to 3.5 percent to create \njobs. We believe this bill will bring about the proper growth.\n  Some estimates, some versions of the growth package, although not \nnecessarily this compromise before the Senate, is that it will create \n1.4 million new jobs. A major cause of the sluggish economy is the \nbursting of the stock market bubble created in the 1990s. This bill \nwill address the ailing stock market. It will help create jobs. It will \ngrow the economy. It will put money back into the hands of families, \nconsumers, investors, and businesses that will help fuel our economic \nengines that create those jobs that we hope will be created from this \nlegislation.\n  It is often said that various bills before the Congress might be \nhistoric in nature, and I don't want to overplay this one, but I do \nwant to use the term about this being an historic agreement in this \nsense: It will amount to the third largest tax cut in history. \nPresident Bush should be highly praised for initiating two out of the \nlast three largest tax relief packages passed by the Congress in that \nperiod of time.\n  The packages before the Senate abide by the budget agreement of the \nSenate side limiting the overall number to $350 billion. It includes \nthe speeding up of all rate reductions, as well as the House's \ninnovative version of the President's dividend proposal that will not \nonly reduce dividend tax but also reduce the capital gains rate, as \nwell.\n  Capital gains and dividends will be taxed when this bill becomes law \nat 15 percent and 5 percent depending upon the level of income. The 5 \npercent eventually will be phased down to reach zero level of taxation \nin the year 2008.\n  This happens to be the lowest level of capital gains tax since 1934. \nDividends will also be taxed at historic lows, and those figures would \nbe the same rates of taxation as apply to capital gains.\n  We also included in this package an expenditure of $20 billion in aid \nto States that was in the Senate bill, which I know my fellow Senate \ncolleagues, including Senator Rockefeller, who was a conferee, will \nappreciate.\n\n  In addition, the bill includes further child tax credit and marriage \npenalty relief. Some may argue that we did not do enough regarding the \ntwo problems. This bill will greatly improve current law. If Senators \nvote for this measure, they are voting to put approximately an extra \n$1,000 in the pockets of a family of four if that family has two \nchildren. They are going to do this for the next couple of years \ncompared to current law. That is going to be retroactive to January 1 \nof this year, and it would presume a rebate of $400 per child back to \nany family who reported children on their income tax. That check should \nbe in the mail later this summer or very early in the fall. So a family \nwith two children would get an $800 rebate check from the Federal \nTreasury later this year.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I certainly intend to continue \nand enhance improvements in marriage penalty and child tax credit in \nthe coming years. In other words, we should get to that goal of \ncontinuing\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\nthe $1,000 credit as permanent legislation, not as temporary \nlegislation. We should resume our goal of eliminating the paper right \nnow rather than down the road a few years when it is slated to be \nphased out.\n  I happen to be very disappointed about an aspect of the conference \nreport I and a lot of other people from rural States worked on, to \nbring some equity in Medicare reimbursement to our respective rural \nStates. My amendment had 86 votes in the Senate. We addressed the \nMedicare rural equity. This is what was not included in the final \nagreement.\n  Here is where the House comes from. They did not have a similar \nprovision in their bill. They argued in the other body that this tax \nrelief bill and the Medicare issues should be addressed in the Medicare \nlegislation coming up for consideration in just 2 weeks. What I heard \nwas this is a tax bill, not a Medicare bill, and why can't this wait an \nadditional 2 weeks and take it up in an environment very closely \nrelated to the subject of Medicare reimbursement and not isolate it in \na tax bill.\n  My answer to that is, I know this bill before the Senate will be \nsigned by the President. I hope later on this summer or early fall we \nhave a Medicare prescription drug bill for the President to sign. But, \nobviously, I am not as sure of that as I am of this bill going to the \nPresident. There are obviously a lot of things about the reimbursement \nof Medicare for our health care providers in rural America that are \nvery unequal to that of urban areas.\n  On this very issue of Medicare rural equity, President Bush weighed \nin strongly supporting my efforts in the context of the Medicare bill, \nand this is a continuation of things that he spoke about at two or \nthree different events over a period of months in Iowa just in the last \nyear. It is a continuation of discussions I have had with the President \non this very same subject during the month of December, last year, and \nthe month of April, this year, when I had very private meetings with \nthe President on the subject of Medicare.\n  Given the President's strong endorsement of my proposal, and the \nstrong support in the Congress evidenced by the 86 votes in the Senate, \nand the fact we will be considering Medicare very soon, and also \nChairman Thomas's willingness to consider these issues, I am encouraged \nwe will succeed before the end of summer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the President's letter in \nthe Record, wherein the President speaks about support for my efforts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  The White House,\n                                         Washington, May 22, 2003.\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley, I want to congratulate you on \n     Senate passage of the jobs and growth bill, and also on the \n     passage of your amendment to that bill which increased \n     federal assistance to rural providers through the Medicare \n     program.\n       When we met in the Oval Office in early April, we discussed \n     our concerns that rural Medicare providers need additional \n     help, and we committed to addressing their problems. We \n     agreed on the need to address issues faced by rural \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, \n     and physicians.\n       You demonstrated your commitment by passing your amendment \n     last week with tremendous bipartisan support, and by pushing \n     hard for it in the conference negotiations on the jobs and \n     growth bill.\n       I will support the increased Medicare funding for rural \n     providers contained in your amendment as a part of a bill \n     that implements our shared goal for Medicare reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, some are going to say during this debate \non this reconciliation compromise tax relief for working men and women \nthat we cannot afford to give money back to the American people. You \nget the impression from people who say that this is the Government's \nmoney and not the people's money. It is the people's money that comes \nto Washington. We spend it for them--a lot of times not as they would. \nBut it is never the Government's money. No government creates wealth. \nOnly working men and women, either through their labor or the use of \ntheir genius and using that in a productive manner, is what creates \nwealth in America.\n  It is not right to assume in this body or any other legislative body \nthat the resources of the American people belong to Government and we \nlet them keep some of their own resources to use as they want, but it \nall belongs to us. This attitude is that we in Government are smarter \nand know better than other people how to spend other people's money.\n  This bill before us underscores the President's, and the majority's, \nbelief that this is the people's money first. The people will spend and \ninvest their money in more productive ways than government ever will. \nThis bill reinforces that philosophy. I commend the President for his \nleadership, his perseverance, and his ability to get things done.\n  I am still going to speak on the issue of the conference committee \nreport before us, but I want to concentrate now for just a few minutes \non the accuracy and intellectual honesty in the debate over our \nbipartisan tax relief package. This mostly would address who benefits \nand who does not benefit. Too many people on the other side of the \naisle want you to believe this legislation only benefits the wealthy or \nhigh-income people of America. In fact, what this bill is about is not \nworrying just about income, but it is an effort through what we do on \ncapital gains and what we do on dividend taxation to encourage the \ncreation of wealth.\n  We are not starting from ground zero here in the creation of wealth. \nThis was started by the people themselves over the last now maybe a \ncouple of decades. Because just 20 years ago, maybe less than that, \nabout 12 percent of the people in the country had money invested in the \nstock market or had pensions and 401(k)s that were dependent upon the \nstock market. Today that is about 55 percent of the people in the \ncountry. So there is an expansion of instruments leading to the \ncreation of wealth. There is a broader range of people in the United \nStates now, compared to 10 years ago, or let's say 20 years ago, who \nhave an interest in the stock market. So I want to discuss the \nimportance of the accuracy of the data in the debate over the \nbipartisan tax relief package before us.\n  In this and all tax policy debates, it is very important to have \naccurate data and to debate the issues in an intellectually honest \nmanner. Involved is the key question of whether a tax relief package is \nfair. In evaluating fairness, we frequently look at whether a proposal \nretains or improves the progressivity of our tax system.\n  We have critics of President Bush's growth plan who attempt to use \nwhat we call distribution tables to show that a certain proposal--in \nthis case President Bush's proposal--disproportionately benefits upper-\nincome taxpayers. Let me say flat out this is factually inaccurate. But \nmore importantly, it misses the point of this legislation for several \nreasons I want to present to my colleagues.\n\n  Make no bones about it, this is not a tax relief package for the sole \npurpose of just giving more money back to the taxpayers. It is for the \npurpose of doing that with the end result that it will lead to the \ncreation of jobs and it will cause our economy to grow, which is \nnecessary to create jobs. As such, the proposal attempts to promote \ninvestment incentives so that companies will purchase capital and \nlabor. Although the package is balanced between consumption and \ninvestment, it is the investment-side incentive that will result in \nlong-term economic growth.\n  What we are trying to do is enhance the capital-to-labor ratio. When \nthere is a surplus of capital, that is when labor benefits. When there \nisn't capital to invest, there is a surplus of labor and consequently \nlabor cannot advance up the economic ladder the way we want all \nAmericans to be able to do. But when you bring in a surplus of capital \nthat is invested, there is an increase in demand for labor. When there \nis an increase in the demand for labor, wages and benefits go up for \nworking men and women. This bill is all about increasing--or at least a \ngood part of it; some of it is oriented toward consumer spending, but a \ngood part of this is oriented towards encouragement for capital and \nenhancing that capital-to-labor relationship.\n  Those who criticize this plan for benefiting wealthy taxpayers assume \nthe rich stay rich and the poor stay poor through a lifetime. It is \nalmost ``born rich, you are always rich; born poor, you are always \npoor.'' That is not\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nAmerica. America is all about economic mobility, the dynamics of the \nfree marketplace. That gives people opportunity to improve themselves \nand that is what America is all about.\n  Recent studies, including one produced by the National Center for \nPolicy Analysis, indicate this is untrue, that the rich are always rich \nand the poor are always poor. The study measures income mobility by \nbreaking same-age workers into five income levels and monitoring their \nmovement between the income quintiles over a period of 15 years. The \nstudy shows there is considerable economic mobility in America and that \nlarge numbers of people move up and down the economic ladder in \nrelatively short periods of time.\n  Moreover, in recent years, earnings mobility has in fact increased. \nThe study demonstrates that within a single 1-year timeframe, one-third \nof the workers in the bottom quintile moved up and, in fact, one-fourth \nof the workers in the top 20 percent of our population moved down. One-\nhalf of the remaining labor force changed quintiles within that year, \nand 60 percent of the workers are upward mobile within 10 years.\n  The University of Michigan study also concluded that taxpayers tend \nto move between income groups during their lifetime. It is quite \nobvious how much sense this makes. It makes a lot of sense.\n  Taxpayers are likely to be lower income earners early and late in \nlife, but are likely to be higher income earners during their midpoints \nof life.\n  My colleagues, just think of your own lifetime starting out in your \nfirst job out of high school or your first job out of college. Hasn't \nthere been a great deal of movement during your lifetime, both up and \ndown? We hope most of it is up. But for some, it is down. What allows \nthese people to escape the lowest-income quintile and start earning \nmore money is a college education and acquiring necessary skills on the \njob.\n  Interestingly, anecdotal evidence shows that 80 percent of the \nindividuals in the Forbe's 400 list were self-made as opposed to those \nwho inherited fortunes. Again, this underlies the importance of taking \nadvantage of educational opportunities. Education allowed these people \nto overcome differences in income, increase their chances to escape \nlow-wage jobs, and determine the success of their future earnings.\n  These findings are backed by a third study produced by the Financial \nServices Roundtable by the same organization I have been quoting, the \nNCPA. This study confirms that there is substantial economic mobility \nbetween generations. Almost 60 percent of the sons whose parents' \nincomes were in the bottom 20 percent are in higher income groups. \nThirty-one percent have incomes in the top 60 percent.\n  Therefore, whoever is saying that once rich, Americans always stay \nrich and once poor, they always stay poor are purely mistaken.\n  I welcome this data on this important matter for one simple reason. \nIt sheds light on what America really is all about. We are a nation of \nvast opportunities. We are a nation of tremendous economic mobility by \npeople from all over the world. Our country truly provides unique \nopportunities for everyone. These opportunities include better \neducation, health care services, financial security but, most \nimportantly, our country provides people with freedom to obtain \nnecessary skills to climb the economic ladder and to live better lives.\n  We are a free nation. We are a mobile nation. We are a nation of \nhard-working, innovative, skilled, and resilient people who like to \ntake risks when necessary in order to succeed.\n  We have an obligation as lawmakers to incorporate these fundamental \nprinciples into our tax system, and this bill succeeds in doing that.\n  If I could, I would like to continue on an item that was in the \nSenate bill more specifically than I have spoken about the bill in the \npast. I want to speak about a provision that was, in fact, dropped in \nconference. It was very important to Zell Miller, the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  On a preliminary point, I express my appreciation to Senator Miller \nfor his support of the President's package. It has not been easy for a \nperson from the other side of the aisle to be so consistent in their \nsupport. But he has been a fearless man with the Marine courage and \nconviction that is in his background.\n  Senator Miller discussed a proposal regarding CEOs to sign a \ncorporate tax return. This measure has been in the tax shelter \ncurtailment proposal passed by the Senate Finance Committee. I support \nthe proposal.\n\n  I share Senator Miller's commonsense view of this proposal. As does \nSenator Miller, I think CEOs ought to be accountable on their companies \ntax returns just as individuals are. Unfortunately, I was not able to \nsecure Senator Miller's position in conference. I faced two barriers. \nOne was a potential procedural problem. The other, the opposition of \nthe House to any proposals that raised revenue.\n  Despite my effort, I was not able to deliver this provision back to \nthe Senate for Senator Miller. But I would like to make clear to \ndowntown lobbyists and to corporate America that Senator Miller and I \nwill be back on this very important provision.\n  Chairman Thomas and his staff know the importance of this issue to \nSenator Miller and to me. I have let them know that we will be back at \nit in legislation that has passed the Senate called the CARE Act--that \nis a charitable giving act--or if we don't do it there, we will do it \nin other tax legislation this year.\n  At a later point in this debate, Senator Miller and I may engage in a \ncolloquy on this very important subject to all of us; but very \nimportant for Senator Miller because of his instigation of it, the CEO \nsignature provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments regarding \nthe bill.\n  First, I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nleadership. Passing a budget has not been an easy process. If we had \nnot passed a budget, we wouldn't be passing a tax bill.\n  Senator Grassley was a very strong supporter of us getting a budget. \nHe showed great courage in doing that. Some people criticised him for \nit. I take issue with that. Senator Grassley, in bringing to the floor \nthe tax provision reconciliation bill that we are going to be voting on \ntomorrow, frankly, made a commitment, as any chairman would, that he \ndidn't want to bring a bill back to the floor of the Senate that \nwouldn't have the necessary votes to pass. He is exactly right. He, as \nI, count votes.\n  We are passing the biggest, best growth package we could get through \nthe Senate. Both of us would like for it to be more. We met with our \ncolleagues in the House. They would like for it to be more. The \nPresident would like for it to be more. This is the best we can do with \nthe votes we have. With the package, I think we have done a good job, \nwhich we have, in loading up front, doing the best job we can to create \njobs and create growth in our economy.\n  I compliment Senator Grassley because if he hasn't shown leadership, \nwe wouldn't have a budget and we wouldn't be voting on a tax bill. \nTomorrow, we will be passing one of the best that this Congress has \npassed--maybe not just this Congress but in a long time.\n  I wish to talk about some of the provisions that are in the tax bill.\n  Senator Grassley complimented Senator Miller. Senator Miller and I \nintroduced the President's tax bill several months ago. It was $696 \nbillion. The tax bill we are voting on tomorrow, most people say, is \n$350 billion. Actually, the tax portion of it is significantly less \nthan that. It is closer to $315 billion.\n  Somebody might ask, What is the difference? There are outlays. We had \nto pay for the outlays. When we passed this bill in the Senate, we \npassed $430 billion worth of tax cuts. We had some offsets, user fees, \nand other things that were extended to make the bill come out at a net \nof $350 billion, which was consistent with the budget resolution.\n  Now, let me just make a couple other comments.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues say that $350 billion is \noutlandish, such a large tax cut. It is $350 billion over 10 years when \nthe total revenue to be received by the Federal Government will\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\nprobably be $25, $26, maybe $27 trillion, so it is really a very small \npercent, maybe 1.3 percent or thereabouts. Granted, we loaded more of \nit upfront so it is a greater percentage the first couple of years. We \ndid that because we wanted to have more positive impact on the economy. \nWe want to grow the economy. We want to create jobs.\n  The economy is very soft, some people would say very stagnant. It is \nnot growing to near the potential we want it to be. We have lost a lot \nof jobs, so we want to do some things, and we believe we can do some \nthings, in the Tax Code that will create an environment that will be a \nlot more conducive to creating jobs.\n  I have been in the Senate a long time. I have seen us pass tax bills \nthat encouraged growth, and I have seen us pass tax bills that, \nfrankly, discouraged growth. I might touch on those just for a minute.\n  But I remember, in 1997--frankly, the Clinton administration was not \nin favor of it at the time--I remember negotiating this provision \nreducing the capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent. \nPresident Clinton eventually signed the bill. By doing that, we created \na lot of jobs. That created a lot of economic activity. That was a \npositive thing to do. That generated revenue. That helped our economy. \nThat is just an example.\n  If you go back a little further in history, when Ronald Reagan came \ninto office, in 1981, the maximum tax rate was 70 percent. When he \nleft, 8 years later, it was 28 percent, and we had one of the longest \nperiods of economic growth in our Nation's history and created millions \nof jobs. Phenomenal. Incidentally, the Government revenues increased \nsubstantially over that period of time.\n  Well, what are we doing in the tax bill today that will help this \neconomy of ours grow? There are several provisions in it. I look at \nthis bill, and I am amazed we were able to do as much as we did. I \ncompliment our friends and colleagues in the House. We worked together, \nand we fashioned a pretty good bill.\n  I will also say, it is not perfect, and it is not exactly what I \nwould have written, but we make compromises to pass legislation in \nlegislative bodies. I think the Senate reported out a good bill. I am \nproud of the bill we reported out on the floor of the Senate just last \nweek. We have compromised with the House. I will touch on several of \nthese provisions.\n  Both the House and the Senate accelerated the rate reductions we \npassed in 2001. What does that mean? It means somebody who was paying \nthe maximum rate of 38.5 percent will be paying 35 percent. It just so \nhappens 35 percent is the same rate that General Electric pays, \ncorporations pay. Why should individuals--many of them have their own \nbusiness--why should they be paying personal rates higher than the \nlargest corporations in America? So that was a positive stop.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues say: Wait a minute, these are tax \ncuts for the wealthy and the rich, and so on. For the wealthy, the \nmaximum tax rate was 39.6 percent. We passed that in 2001. To date, it \nhas only been reduced 1 percentage point, from 39.6 percent to 38.6 \npercent.\n\n  Now, we will finally get it to 35 percent, the same rate as \ncorporations. People who were paying 35 percent will pay 33 percent; \npeople who were paying 30 percent will pay 28 percent; people who were \npaying 27 percent will pay 25 percent; and a lot of the people who were \npaying 15 percent, when we passed the bill in 2001, will have a rate \nreduction to 10 percent. So they got the entire rate reduction in 2001 \nretroactive. I just mention those facts so people will be aware of \nthem.\n  We put in a provision to allow small business expensing. We raised \nthat from $25,000 to $100,000. I used to own and operate a small \nbusiness. This will help a lot of small businesses. We had that in the \nSenate bill. The House had it in their bill. That sunsets after a \ncouple years.\n  Bonus depreciation was not in the Senate bill. It was in the House \nbill. I compliment the House. That increased the bonus depreciation \nsegment we had in the 2001 tax bill from 30 percent to 50 percent \nthrough the end of next year. This will encourage all corporations, \nlarge and small, to make more significant investment. When they make \nsignificant investment, they will be able to recoup half that \ninvestment over a much shorter period of time.\n  We also did something that dealt with dividends and capital gains. \nThe bill that passed the Senate was basically a 100-percent exemption \nfor dividends for 4 years. Some people say: Wait a minute, it was only \n50 percent the first year. That was for 2003 that we passed in the \nSenate. Frankly, we are halfway through 2003, so I am looking at this, \nand at least from this point on it would have been a total elimination \nof double taxation on dividends for the remainder of 2003, 2004, 2005, \nand 2006. I thought that was superior to the House provision that said: \nLet's tax dividends at 15 percent.\n  What came out of conference was the House provision. Again, we make \ncompromises. The House provision has a lot of merits. It says: Let's \ntax capital gains and dividends at 15 percent. Well, for capital gains, \nthat are presently taxed at 20 percent, to go to 15 percent is a 25-\npercent reduction. That is pretty significant.\n  I mentioned earlier in my statement, when we reduced capital gains \nfrom 28 percent to 20 percent, we reduced the tax on financial \ntransactions, and we turned over a lot more transactions. That had a \nvery positive impact on the economy. I expect we will have a positive \nimpact on the economy by reducing the rate on capital gains again. And \nI think there is a lot of merit in saying we should have the tax on \ndividends be the same as the tax on capital gains. That was the House \nprovision. That is a 15-percent rate. That is maybe a little more than \na 50-percent exclusion.\n  Now, if you looked at the chart--I do not have the chart with me \ntoday--we tax dividends higher than any other country in the world. If \nwe want to create a climate that is going to be productive for \ninvestment, we should not tax the proceeds or profits from those \ninvestments higher than anybody else in the world. We consider \nourselves the ``free enterprise mecca'' of the world, but yet we tax \nthe distribution of those profits higher than anybody. We are basically \ntied with Japan for taxing corporate dividends higher than anybody. We \ntax them higher than Great Britain, we tax them higher than France, and \nwe tax them higher than Germany. It makes no sense.\n\n  Well, this is going to be a big step toward probably putting us about \nin the middle range of countries as far as taxation is concerned. It \nstill has double taxation. I still would much prefer the Senate \nprovision. We did not prevail in conference. Again, it's the art of \ncompromise.\n  This is a giant step forward. If you asked me 3 months ago, could you \nget a 50-percent exclusion, I probably would have said: Let's take it. \nThat is a giant step forward.\n  Let me just give a couple of personal examples on corporate \ndividends.\n  I think a lot of people have tried to construe this as only \nbenefiting the wealthy, and so on. That is hogwash. That is absolute \nhogwash. Over half of Americans today have some ownership of stock. \nMaybe they own it. Maybe they don't own the shares in their name, but \nthey are participants in a retirement plan. Maybe they are in a \nteachers retirement plan. Maybe they are in a retirement plan for \nfiremen. Maybe they are in a Teamsters retirement plan. Maybe they are \nin a civil service Federal employees retirement plan. Maybe they have a \nportion--maybe all, maybe some--of their retirement based in stocks. A \nlot of those stocks pay dividends. This is going to help the value of \ntheir account. This will cause the market to go up.\n  The stock market has been on a significant decline for the last 3 \nyears. Some people want to say: Well, that was President Bush's \nrecession. I hate to remind them, but the stock market collapse or \ndecline--rapid decline--started in March of 2000. The Nasdaq fell by 50 \npercent between March of 2000 and the end of 2000. So we have seen a \nprecipitous decline in the stock market.\n  I believe the proposal we have before us--certainly the one that \npassed the Senate, and I also believe the one that we will be passing \ntomorrow--will help the stock market. It will be positive because we \nare not going to tax the proceeds or distributions from gains in an \ninvestment so high. We are basically going to cut the tax rate on those \ninvestments in half. That is a positive, giant step forward.\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n  So I again compliment our colleagues. I think we are doing something \nthat will encourage investment, not discourage it.\n  Let me give you another example. I used to run a corporation. A \ncorporation makes money. It wants to distribute some of the proceeds or \nprofits of that money to their stockholders. In doing so, let's just \nsay the figure is $100,000. If they do so today, they have to pay \ncorporate tax on it. That is $35,000. Then they have $65,000 left to \ngive to their stockholders. They give the $65,000 to the stockholders \nand--guess what--they are taxed today, and they might be taxed at 38 \npercent, they might be taxed at 30 percent. Regardless, you add the two \nrates together and they are taxed at about 65 percent, in some cases 70 \npercent, in some cases more than 70 percent. So out of that $100,000, \nthe Government is getting about $60,000, and the owner of the \ncorporation is getting about $30,000.\n  That is not a good deal. That is not a prudent investment. As a \nmatter of fact, as a result of that, anybody who is managing a \ncorporation says: wait a minute, let's not give money to the owners \nthrough dividends. Let's do it in the form of bonuses or through other \nmeans. And you come up with a lot of schemes--some are very legitimate; \nsome are not so legitimate--to avoid this enormous Government take on \nthe proceeds of distribution of gains from a corporation.\n  They should be taxed once. Once is enough. Thirty-five percent is \nenough. Again, our provision, which will hopefully pass tomorrow, is a \ngiant step in the right direction. This provision cuts capital gains \nfrom 20 percent to 15 percent and, I might mention, from 8 percent to 5 \npercent for lower income taxpayers. Again, this is a 25-percent \nreduction, and it eliminates the long-term/short-term capital gains. If \nyou want income tax in capital gains simplification, we do it. Right \nnow you have long-term and short term capital gains. Anybody who has an \ninvestment in anything, they have to keep track: How long did you own \nthis? Does it qualify for a 20-percent or 18-percent rate? We are \nsaying we will not do that. The rate for capital gains is 15 percent, \nand it has to be the same rate on dividends.\n  There is another advantage to this. If somebody who has a portfolio \ninvests today, the present Tax Code says, let's make a lot of \ninvestments in growth stocks because they pay capital gains, and the \ntax rate on capital gains is 20 or 18 percent. That is about half of \nthe present rate on dividends, on ordinary income tax. That is the \npresent law. A lot of people, because of the Tax Code, were encouraged \nto go to more growth-oriented stocks, i.e., stocks that don't pay \ndividends, to make their investments. Many of those stocks are a lot \nmore volatile, a lot riskier, a lot more subject to variations in \nprices. Again, having a policy that at least taxes dividend \ndistribution and capital gains on an equal basis will take the bias out \nthat presently exists for growth stocks as compared to dividends or \nmore oriented stocks that pay dividends. That is good. That will change \ncorporate behavior, and that is good.\n  So when you add all these things together, we have done some things \nfor families. Somebody says, this is just going to benefit corporations \nand small businesses. That is not correct. We have done something for \nfamilies. Individuals and married couples who have kids are going to \nget a $1,000-per-child tax credit. Present law is $600. That is a $400 \nincrease. If you have four kids, that is an increase of $1,600. I have \nfour children. My kids are a little old so they don't qualify, but this \nwill help families all across America. That is $1,000 per child that \nthey don't have to pay in taxes. Frankly, most families need that extra \nmoney to raise their kids. So it is family friendly.\n  We did something on marriage penalty. We doubled, basically, the 15-\npercent bracket for couples. Let me give an example. It is kind of \nwonkish. People move from a 15-percent bracket in present law to a 27-\npercent bracket. I think now it is $28,000. So if they have taxable \nincome above $28,000, they move from a 15-percent bracket to a 27-\npercent bracket. That bracket is almost twice as high. So what is the \nbracket for couples? If you look at couples, under our provision we say \nwe should double the individual bracket for couples. So if the break \nline of going from 15 percent to 27 percent under current law is \n$28,000, we say it should be $56,000 for a couple. Right now it is 40-\nsome thousand. The difference of that is about $1,200.\n  Let me make sure people understand that. If you have a married couple \nwho has a combined taxable income of $56,000, their savings under this \nprovision is $1,200. If they have two kids, that is an additional \nsavings of $800. That is over $2,000 that a family of four with income \nof $56,000 will save. That is significant. That is family friendly. \nThat eliminates the marriage penalty for those couples.\n\n  Again, we have some positive measures in this bill, positive for \nfamilies, positive for companies, positive to grow the economy, \nincentives for people to hire, for people, frankly, to make investments \nbecause they can recoup them earlier. Instead of amortizing over 10 \nyears, they might be able to amortize them immediately or maybe half in \nthe first year. Those are significant, positive changes.\n  We will eliminate at least partially this very high rate of double \ntaxation in current law for corporate distribution.\n  Both the House and the Senate have done some good work. I compliment \nSenator Grassley for his leadership. It has not been easy. It has not \nbeen easy through the budget or tax process. When we marked up this tax \nbill last week, we had, I believe, 33 or 34 amendments. I believe the \nmajority of those amendments were decided by one vote. Senator Grassley \nis to be complimented for his leadership. This tax bill, unlike many, \nis 43 pages. We have seen tax bills before that are hundreds of pages.\n  So this is simple. It is clean. It does not have a lot of Members' \nadd-ons that touch on one page and deal with rewriting the Tax Code. \nThis is simplified. We make it much simpler on capital gains. We will \ntax capital gains and dividends at the same rate. It is simplified \nbecause we will accelerate the rate cuts already in the tax law so \nsomebody won't defer income from one year to the next year so there \nwill be a lower tax rate. It is simplified because we will allow small \nbusiness to be able to expense items in some cases 100 percent of the \ncost of the item up to $100,000, so they don't have to amortize it over \nyears.\n  There are a lot of positive things in here that will help the \neconomy, help American families, and create a much better environment \nboth for investment and creating jobs.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Grassley and Senator \nMiller, for their support and their hard work. The American taxpayer \nand the economy will be a lot better off by passing this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tonight we debate and tomorrow we act on \nlegislation that will help set a course for a stronger national economy \nin the coming months. Next month, we will begin to address issues in \nthe health care sector. We will look at ways to strengthen and improve \nMedicare. We will also begin the appropriations process, funding \neducation, training, and other critically important programs that make \ncontributions to our future economic growth. These issues and others \nare fundamental to the overall objective of maintaining stable, \nsustained economic growth that creates jobs and opportunities for all \nour citizens.\n  For today we must act on the conference agreement we worked so hard \non throughout this week, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2003. This is legislation that justly deserves the expedited \nconsideration it was given over the last month and the special \nprocedures afforded it under the Budget Act.\n  It is, simply put, must-do legislation. The good things we enjoy as \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\ncome, in large part, from the wealth of our vast human and natural \nresources. They come from a political and economic system that rewards \nhard work, rewards the entrepreneurial spirit, rewards personal \ninitiative--all conducted within a framework of fair, just, and \nequitable laws of commerce.\n  History is replete with governments that have failed because of \nfailed economies. Our responsibility as elected officials to do \nwhatever is necessary to maintain economic growth is real not only for \ntoday but for future generations. I am concerned about our economy not \nonly because of its current sluggishness in creating jobs but also \nbecause of the new risk--the risk of disinflation.\n  But you don't have to take my word. Recently, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee decided to keep the target for the Federal funds rate at 1\\1/\n4\\ percent, the lowest level in nearly 40 years. But more importantly, \nthe committee concluded that:\n  The probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though \nminor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level \nand the balance of risks . . . is weighted toward weakness over the \nforeseeable future.\n  I hope my colleagues are listening. The Fed is raising the specter of \nboth continued economic weakness and disinflation--something that we \nhave not experienced in this country. While the economy continued to \ngrow in the first quarter of this year, although at a lackluster rate, \nit was not sufficient to generate enough demand to encourage businesses \nand employers to create new jobs. The result is that the unemployment \nrate has risen to 6 percent.\n  Now the Fed has added another concern. With insufficient growth, the \neconomy lacks the momentum to stop inflation from falling further.\n  I continue to meet with economists and business groups to better \nunderstand the policies and programs that best address weak economic \ngrowth and a jobless recovery. Most all agree that economies are like \nships--they cannot be turned around quickly. But while this economy \ndoesn't need to be turned around, it is headed in the right direction. \nIt just needs to pick up its pace. Indeed, that is what the jobs and \ngrowth package is all about.\n  In order to achieve growth sufficient to create jobs, to reduce \nunemployment, and to stem this potential disinflation phenomena, there \nmust be a substantial injection of new demand into our economy, and it \nmust be now. This is for the job security of the American people. We \nneed to stoke the boilers on this ship. The tax bill before us \nrepresents an immediate opportunity to inject new demand in the \neconomy, as much as $60 billion immediately. Of the $350 billion \nstimulus and growth provided in this conference agreement, 60 percent \nof that stimulus is provided this year and next.\n  Equally as important, this stimulus translates directly into money in \nthe pockets of American families. As an example, a married couple with \ntwo children and an income of $40,000 will see their taxes decline this \nyear nearly 96 percent--from $1,978 to $45.\n  The legislation provides for immediate and retroactive to the \nbeginning of this year tax relief to millions of American families by \nincreasing the tax credit for each child to $1,000 each year. The \nlegislation accelerates all the tax rates we enacted 2 years ago, \nproviding in total nearly $31 billion in tax relief this year, \nimmediately. The legislation provides incentives for businesses by \nproviding a 50-percent bonus depreciation for capital investments, up \nfrom 30 percent enacted last year--a powerful known stimulus to the \neconomy.\n\n  The legislation will increase expensing for small businesses from \n$25,000 today up to $100,000. As we all know, these small businesses \nare the real engines of job creation and economic growth.\n  On the proposal to reduce taxes on dividends and capital gains, this, \nof course, has generated much discussion in this body and in the House \nof Representatives. While the Senate passed a different measure than \nwhat is in the underlying reconciliation tax bill, the compromise \nprovides significant reduction in taxes on dividends immediately, a \nnearly 60-percent reduction, and makes reductions in capital gains tax \nrates to further stimulate investment and growth.\n  Finally, the legislation does address aid to our fiscally strapped \nStates by providing over $20 billion in direct fiscal relief \nimmediately.\n  It is clear that we must act, and we must act quickly if we are to \nensure that the economy continues on a course of stronger growth and \njob creation. I ask my colleagues to join me in doing our job.\n  The House has acted and now it is time for us to act. We must present \nto the President a strong job creation, anti-inflation economic growth \nbill. The American economy needs a boost. The American people need \njobs, and that duty falls inescapably to us right here and now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I am looking forward to voting for the \njobs and growth package when it comes out of conference and reaches the \nSenate floor. One of the lessons of the last few years is that we \ncannot do anything that any of us want to do without prosperity. We \ncannot do education the way we would like; we cannot improve the \nquality of health care the way we want to; we cannot protect our \nNation's borders the way we would like to; and we cannot provide for \nour defense the way we would like to without prosperity.\n  Prosperity means jobs. The way to get jobs, among other things, is to \nput more money into the hands of people who save, spend, and invest, \nand that means tax relief. That is what the jobs and growth package is \nabout.\n  It is not the only way, though, to increase jobs and create economic \ngrowth in our country. Another way to do that is by opening up markets \nabroad. One of the ways we do that is by getting our competitors to end \ntariffs, end the nontariff obstacles they have placed on importing our \nproducts.\n  For too long we have let the European Union get away with illegal, \nunwarranted, and protectionist trade policies regarding agricultural \nbiotechnology. I strongly support the President and the administration \nin the case before the WTO against the European Union. I want to take a \nfew moments to talk about that situation this evening.\n  For the past 5 years--half a decade--the European Union has \neffectively blocked our agricultural trade into Europe through their \nmoratorium on the approval of new biotechnology products entering the \nEuropean market.\n  Since its implementation in October 1998, the moratorium has blocked \nmore than $300 million annually in U.S. corn exports to the European \nUnion countries. When you look at the total cost of the moratorium, our \ncorn producers have lost $1.5 billion in exports to the European Union.\n  This moratorium clearly violates WTO rules requiring measures \nregulating imports to be based on ``sufficient scientific evidence'' \nand mandating countries to operate regulatory approval procedures \nwithout ``undue delay.'' And as far as sufficient scientific evidence \nis concerned, they have zero standing. Moreover, their policies are \nholding back products that hold tremendous promise for improving the \nfood supply, advancing human health and preventing famine in the \ndeveloping world.\n\n  The actions of the EU not only violate laws established by the WTO, \nbut also, the EU is violating its own laws requiring science-based \nregulatory decisionmaking.\n  The EU policy decisions on biotechnology are being driven by people \ndisdainful of science and its capacity for solving problems facing \nmankind and critical of the leading role of the United States in \nscientific advancement.\n  It is likely that nearly every American has eaten a meal made with \ncorn and soybeans enhanced through biotechnology. These products have \nbeen sold and served in restaurants, local grocery stores and farmers' \nmarkets for years, without any adverse health consequences ever being \nreported.\n  Additionally, agriculture biotechnology, contrary to what the EU may \nsay, is good for the environment. In 2001 alone, biotechnology reduced \nthe application of pesticides by 46 million pounds, in addition to \nreducing soil erosion and creating an environment more hospitable to \nwildlife.\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\n  However, the facts have not stopped the EU from propping up their \nmoratorium on a flimsy foundation. In addition to their anti-American \npolicies, the EU has more recently pursued policies to undermine the \ndevelopment and support of genetically engineered products around the \nworld, including in countries facing famine, and that was the turning \npoint in this case.\n  About 40 million people in Africa's famine-stricken nations are at \nrisk of starvation and diseases brought about by incessant hunger. \nAdditionally, 800 million children are starving worldwide. Ongoing \ndroughts and famines have devastated these countries, leaving them \nwithout options, and much too often, without hope.\n  Last fall, three African countries--Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique--\nwere pressured to turn down shipments of safe, nutritious, U.S. \nhumanitarian biotech food aid by the EU. The EU even threatened their \nexport markets if they accepted biotechnology food aid. To do that to a \ncountry threatened with famine is nothing less than extortion.\n  This is the same food that we eat here in the United States. It is \nunconscionable to me that the EU would promote these anti-humanitarian, \nanti-development policies.\n  The EU should try honesty for once. They should try explaining the \nreal reason they do not like American biotechnology: they want to \nprotect their market from competition. They want to protect European \nmarkets by ignoring the scientific evidence, which makes clear the \nsafety and nutritional advantage of biotechnology.\n  Our agriculture producers are leading the biotech revolution and \nproviding us with the most affordable, most abundant and safest food \nsupply in the world. And Missouri's producers are among the leaders in \nthe country.\n  When the U.S. wins this lawsuit, it will be a victory for our \nproducers who have lost more than $300 million annually in corn \nexports, and also for science, the environment and everyone who wants \nto win the war against famine and world hunger.\n  I applaud the President for filing this suit in the WTO. In doing so, \nhe is once again demonstrating the kind of leadership and courage we \nhave come to expect from him I appreciate our leadership working so \nquickly on this important issue.\n  Senator Bond and I, along with several others, have submitted a \nresolution in support of the action in the WTO against the European \nUnion. I urge my colleagues to consider this resolution expeditiously, \nto support it, and to give the administration the ammunition they need \nto prosecute this lawsuit successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take an opportunity just \nbefore we close down tonight to express some disappointment on my part \nthat none of the specific small business and agricultural provisions \nsurvived the final conference agreement.\n  I truly believe there are many provisions in the final agreement that \nwill be generally good for small business, but there are several \nspecialty areas that continue to need tax relief in a special way to \naddress the particular concerns of some industries.\n\n  Many of the items included in the original Senate bill are important \nto the bipartisan membership of the Senate. It previously passed the \nFinance Committee as well as the Senate. Again, I stress \nbipartisanship.\n  I plan to continue to work on a bipartisan basis with Senator Baucus, \nthe ranking member of the committee, to assure that we are able to \naddress the tax needs of S corporations, cooperatives, particularly \nfarm cooperatives, small business excise tax problems, livestock \ndrought relief through the tax efforts, and historic rehabilitation, \njust to name a few areas of concern.\n  As we finalize this growth package for the Senate's final vote and \nthe President's signature, we will review the upcoming Finance \nCommittee schedule and move forward with these important small business \nand agricultural provisions, all of which have bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Grassley, for making that statement. We both \nagreed. Those are provisions that are very important, particularly to \ncertain parts of America. These are provisions that we have been \nworking on in the past to try to get included in law, and I very much \nappreciate the chairman of the committee making that statement to that \neffect just now. I join with him and look forward to working with him \nas we get these measures passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in case I do not get an opportunity \ntomorrow--or who knows, maybe even forget it--I am reminded by the \nSenator's statement that even though we have disagreed on the substance \nof this legislation, the Senator from Montana, the ranking member of \nthe committee, has very cooperatively helped us move this legislation \nalong. We have entered into several agreements to help us get \namendments out of the way. A couple of times when there were some \npolitical differences, he helped smooth my path to move this bill \nalong. That is all within the tradition of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and I say it not only to bring attention to the cooperative \neffort of Senator Baucus and also of the committee but also to \ndemonstrate to the people of the country who might be watching this \ndebate on the Senate Finance Committee bill and feel, well, it is just \nall the Republicans on one side and all the Democrats on the other \nside, that we are always that way and very seldom is a product from the \nSenate Finance Committee not a bipartisan product.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for helping us move this bill along, even \nthough he is not in agreement with the substance of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the 5th U.S. Army demobilized \nBattery C, 1st Battalion of the South Dakota National Guard's 147th \nField Artillery. This unit, headquartered in Yankton was among more \nthan 20 Guard and Reserve units from my State called to active duty in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Today, these soldiers and their service become a part of South \nDakota's military heritage. Like those who served in the two world \nwars, in Korea, in Vietnam and numerous other places, this new \ngeneration has answered the call. They have offered to make every \nsacrifice, including life itself, to protect our freedom and security. \nWe must never forget them or the honor with which they served.\n  This unit participated in a mobilization with few precedents in South \nDakota history. Nearly 2,000 Guard and Reserve troops were called to \nactive duty in our State, by far the largest mobilization since World \nWar II. At the time the fighting began, units from more than 20 \ncommunities had been called up, from Elk Point in the south to Lemmon \nin the north, from Watertown in the east to Custer in the west. Indeed, \nour State's mobilization rate ranked among the highest of all the \nStates on a per capita basis.\n  These soldiers were proud to serve, and their communities are proud \nof them. Across the State, thousands of citizens pitched in to \nparticipate in send-off parades, to lend a hand for families who \nsuddenly had to get by without a mom or dad, and even to assist with \nfinancial hardships caused by the mobilization. This mobilization was a \nstatewide effort, in many ways.\n  South Dakota's Guard and Reserve units provided our Active-Duty \nForces in Iraq with invaluable support. Many units did not participate \ndirectly in combat, which ended more quickly than anyone expected. But \nwe all know that the battle would have been waged much differently if \nour Guard and Reserve units had not been ready to deploy as needed. \nFurthermore, we know that some units will play an important role in the \nwork of restoring peace and order to Iraq, as well as rebuilding basic \ninfrastructure. These tasks will be vital to ensuring that Iraq becomes \na stable nation, hopefully with a prosperous economy and democratic \ngovernment. This is how we can win the peace--and save future \ngenerations from another conflict.\n  In addition to the service of this particular unit, I want to \nacknowledge the sacrifices and dedication of the families who stayed \nhome. They are the unsung heroes of any mobilization. They motivate and \ninspire those who are far from home, and they, too, deserve our \ngratitude.\n  Today, I join these families and the State of South Dakota in \ncelebrating the courage, commitment, and success of the members of the \n147th Field Artillery, and I honor their participation in this historic \nevent in our Nation's history. Welcome home. Thanks to all of you for \nyour courage, your sacrifice, and your noble commitment to this country \nand its ideals.\n\n\n                      HEADQUARTERS SERVICE BATTERY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks we have seen \ndramatic proof that the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein is over and \nthat a new day is dawning for the Iraqi people.\n  President Bush has announced that major military combat operations in \nIraq have ended, and that America and her Allies are turning our \nefforts toward helping the Iraqi people build a free society.\n  Like many Americans, I was thrilled and heartened by the dramatic \nimages of U.S. troops helping Iraqi citizens tear down statues and \npaintings of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people needed our help, our \ntanks, our troops, and our commitment to topple Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in their lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, \nand like people everywhere, they think it is wonderful. I am proud of \nour military and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle \nEast more free and secure.\n  Our military men and women may face more difficult days in Iraq, and \nthe Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come with \nfreedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside \nforces with goals of their own may cause problems, stir up trouble, and \ninitiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than in a country \nthat has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But today I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one \ncan make for his country. LCpl Thomas Alan Blair was Oklahoma's first \nknown casualty in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nThis 24-year old Broken Arrow native was killed on March 23 in a fierce \nbattle near Nasiriyah when an enemy rocket propelled grenade hit his \namphibious assault vehicle.\n  Tommy graduated from Broken Arrow High School in 1997 but had decided \nlong before then that he would be a marine. He chose his career nearly \na decade ago when he watched his older brother SSgt Al Blair graduate \nfrom boot camp. In a way he followed in his brother's footsteps, but \nhis family will tell you that he would have been a marine no matter \nwhat. His brother recalled that Tommy ``truly wanted to help people.''\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Lance Corporal Blair did not die in vain. He died so that many others \ncould live freely. For that sacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with him and his family today and with the \ntroops who are putting their lives on the line in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, recently we have seen dramatic proof that the brutal \nregime of Saddam Hussein is over and that a new day is dawning for the \nIraqi people.\n  President Bush has announced that major military combat operations in \nIraq have ended, and that America and her Allies are turning our \nefforts toward helping the Iraqi people build a free society.\n  Like many Americans, I was thrilled and heartened by the dramatic \nimages of U.S. troops helping Iraqi citizens tear down statues and \npaintings of Saddam Hussein.

LTC Dominic R. Baragona, 42, was stationed at \nFort Sill. He was killed in Iraq on May 19, when a tractor-trailer lost \ncontrol and hit his Humvee near Safwan.\n  Colonel Baragona was assigned to and commander of the 19th \nMaintenance Battalion. He was deployed to CENTCOM in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom on March 16 with about 100 other members of his \nbattalion.\n  Colonel Baragona's cousin Anthony said, ``wherever they needed him, \nthat's where he went.'' Baragona, like so many of our military men and \nwomen, placed the call to duty above self.\n  Our prayers and debt of appreciation now go to his family, who had \nexpected him to come home in June. He is survived by his parents who \nlive in St. George Island, FL.\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Baragona did not die in vain. He died so that many \nothers could live freely.

Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than in a country \nthat has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But today I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one \ncan make for his country. Sgt Randall Rehn died April 3 amid fierce \nfighting for control of what is now Baghdad International Airport.

He \nloved it.''\n  Tragically, the death of Sergeant Robbins was said to be a result of \nfriendly fire in the form of coalition bombs. While our military always \nworks to prevent such accidents, they always occur during war fighting.\n  The fact that his death was accidental in no way diminishes his \nsacrifice.

Donald Oaks, who was stationed at Fort Sill, \nwould have turned 21 on April 26. He was a bright young man who was \ngood at math and computers. Also, he enjoyed playing baseball and \nfishing with his dad. He joined the Army to get money for a college \neducation after his service.

LOUIS BROWN\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I just received word that a dear friend of \nmine, the Air Force Academy, and the State of Colorado passed away last \nnight and I would like to take this opportunity to recognize retired \nChief Master Sergeant Louis Brown Jr. One of Colorado's finest \ncitizens, CMSgt, Ret., Louis Brown Jr., has made numerous contributions \nto the young men and women--past, present and future--of the United \nStates Air Force Academy. Chief Brown has been a steadfast proponent \nand volunteered more than 10 years of service to recruit, advise, \ninterview, and mentor cadets for the Air Force Academy with my \ncongressional office. Additionally, he has spent over 30 years of \ntireless interaction with some of the Air Force's finest officers and \nAcademy graduates.\n  Chief Brown has made a difference to the Air Force, the Air Force \nAcademy, and to Colorado as a whole. Specifically, he has worked \ncountless hours with members of my staff since my tenure in the United \nStates Congress helping to interview potential candidates to the \nacademy, educating them on the appointment process, and encouraging \nthese young men and women to contribute to the United States armed \nforces. He has been a mentor and a role model to countless cadets who \nhave gone forward to become Air Force officers.\n  I want to honor the life of Chief Brown who served the Air Force \nfirst as an enlisted Airman and later in life as an advocate for \nrecruitment of future officers. His contributions to the State of \nColorado and the United States Air Force will not be forgotten. I ask \nthe Senate now to join me in thanking Chief Brown and his family for \nthese contributions and also to pray for his loved ones in their time \nof mourning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6968-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6968-S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEMORIAL DAY: HONORING OUR FALLEN HEROES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the many \nindividuals who have died in defense of our great Nation. Next week we \nwill all return to our States to join our constituents in honoring \nthose who gave their lives to ensure that we enjoy the principles of \nliberty and justice as Americans.\n  One of my constituents, Mr. Keith Haugen, has written a song entitled \n``Walking Through the Memories, A Requiem to the Fallen.'' Mr. Haugen \nserved in the U.S. Army and has been honored by a number of \norganizations for songs he has written to honor military members and \nveterans. Mr. Haugen will perform this song on Memorial Day at the \nNational Memorial of the Pacific.\n  I have reviewed the lyrics to this melody and have Mr. Haugen's \npermission to share them with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint a copy of these lyrics in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Walking Through The Memories, a Requiem to the Fallen\n\n                        (By Keith Haugen, ASCAP)\n\n     The peace they fought for is right here, between the rows of \n           crosses\n     They died to save our freedom, they're numbered among our \n           losses\n     Although they came from far and wide, this place is now their \n           home\n     A peaceful, final resting place, where they'll never be alone\n\n     And I'm walking through the memories, where honor knows no \n           end\n\n     That unmarked grave is special, for I know that he's my \n           friend\n     We were comrades on a foreign shore, buddies to the end\n     In the distance I hear a bugle call, as I stroll alone with \n           God\n     It's haunting voice is singing ``Taps'' for those beneath the \n           sod\n\n     And I'm walking through the memories of those who gave their \n           all\n\n     Walking, walking, walking, past graves both old and new\n     Their sun has set, their day is done, they were the chosen \n           few\n     We salute and pay our tribute, flags and flowers all abound\n     They all came back to make their home in this hallowed ground\n\n     And I'm walking through the memories of those who gave their \n           all\n     Yes, I'm walking through the memories where honor knows no \n           end\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this Memorial Day is an especially \nmeaningful time for our Nation. It comes as the images of defending \nfreedom and democracy are still fresh in our minds.\n  This weekend, we remember and honor the men and women who paid the \nultimate price for their country. Flags fly at half-mast, relatives and \nfriends place wreaths and flowers on the graves of their loved ones, \nand communities host parades adorned in red, while, and blue. In \nactuality, these tributes are small acts we perform in an effort to \nexpress our gratitude to those who have served the cause of freedom.\n  Since the time of the Civil War, communities have paid tribute to \nfallen soldiers with spontaneous gestures of remembrance. In May of \n1868, GEN. John A. Logan officially recognized the public's desire to \nhonor those who died in pursuit of liberty by declaring May 30 of each \nyear a day to decorate the graves of fallen soldiers. A century later, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation declaring, in part, that \nMemorial Day be held the last Monday of May every year.\n  Memorial Day weekend has since become a signal for family gatherings, \nbarbeques, sales at the mall, trips to the beach, and the opening of \ncommunity pools. We should celebrate our freedom but we must also \nremember that freedom is not free--it comes to us at a great cost. In \nour Nation's history, upwards of 40 million Americans have risked life \nand limb to defend our country and make the world a safer place. More \nthan a million service men and women have died for our country. \nMoreover, 140,000 were taken as prisoners of war and many of them have \nnever been accounted for. They are our Nation's heroes who acted \nselflessly throughout our history to bring forth freedom and \nopportunity for generations.\n  We also honor the families who bear the heaviest burden of liberty. \nOur fallen and missing soldiers were moms,\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\ndads, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters. They are not statistics \nbut empty voids in their families' hearts. While the grief and pain for \nsome may not have faded, I hope it is comforting for them to know that \ntheir fallen loves ones' cause was just.\n  In addition, let us remember that thousands of service men and women \nwill spend this Memorial Day stationed in other countries defending our \nfreedoms far away from their families. I join Americans today in a \nprayer for peace so that we can reunite them with their loves ones \nsoon.\n  We take 1 day out of the year to honor our fallen soldiers but we \nbenefit from their sacrifice each and every day. I hope that Arkansans \nwill take a break from their Memorial Day activities to remember and \nhonor our fallen soldiers. Let us display the noble patriotism for our \ncountry that our Armed Forces exemplify each day.\n\n\n           HONORING SERGEANT RICHARD CARL OF KING HILL, IDAHO\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a sad occasion that is \nunderway in my home State of Idaho. We are burying one of our soldiers \nwho was killed during the war in Iraq, and I wanted to take a few \nmoments to share my thoughts with you about SGT Richard Carl. While I \nwas not privileged to know him personally during his short 26 years, he \nhas come alive for me through the memories that you have shared in the \npast few days. He is remembered as a son to Richard and Karen, a \nhusband to Audrey, a father to 3-year-old Ealy Ann and 18-month-old \nDominick, and a friend to many, many others.\n  It is a weighty job--the one we, as a nation, ask of people like \nSergeant Carl. It brings uncertainty and sacrifice, not just for the \ntroops, but for their families and loved ones. But our Nation is built \non the foundations laid by good people like Sergeant Carl, and it is \nthrough their sacrifice, that their children and our children will \ninherit a free nation.\n  Such lofty language pales against the stark reality that confronts us \ntoday at this service. In the last few days, news articles have brought \na quiet, brave family man to the attention of many Idahoans. I have \nbeen touched by the memories of good deeds, unheralded kindness, and a \ngood heart. One memory frequently mentioned was that he was always \nhelping someone else, and that is a remarkable legacy to leave. In his \nduty to his country, he died helping someone else--in this case, an \ninjured Iraqi child who needed to be taken to a hospital. We cannot \nfind the words to express the full extent of the debt that we owe to \nSergeant Carl and so many other young men and women who have served our \ncountry to the fullest measure.\n  In his wife Audrey's words, ``Our family is dealing with this loss as \nwell as can be expected. Richard was a good man, and while he was not \nknown to the world, he played an important role. We are so proud of his \ncontributions to our nation and his role in making the world a better \nplace. He will never be forgotten.''\n  We are honored to have him remembered as an Idahoan. We are blessed \nto have had him here, even for the short time, and I am confident that \nthose who knew him will make certain that his children have the \nopportunity to know their father through those memories. Sergeant Carl \nand so many others who have sacrificed for our freedoms will continue \nin my thoughts and prayers and in our Nation's grateful hearts.\n\n\n            national former prisoner of war recognition day\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague \nSenator Patty Murray to sponsor a resolution federally acknowledging \nApril 9, 2003, and recognizing April 9, 2004, as National Former \nPrisoner of War Recognition Day.\n  As we watch the overjoyed faces of soldiers returning home from Iraq \non television, we also remember those taken hostage by enemy forces. In \nthis age of technology, we watched the images of brave soldiers from \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, courageous in the face of physical and mental \nhardships most of us can only imagine. I am outraged and saddened that, \nin clear violation of international treaties, opposing troops have \ntaken even one of our fighting American men and women against their \nwill.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of all of \nthese soldiers, from recent as well as past conflicts. It is my sincere \nhope that the still-captive prisoners from previous wars will be home \nto participate in the celebrations next April, and I have faith that \nthey will be.\n  At this time, it is appropriate that we pause and reflect on the \nbravery and sacrifice made by all of our Nation's former prisoners of \nwar, and to remember that tens of thousands of our friends and \nneighbors have endured unthinkable brutality fighting throughout \nAmerica's history.\n  The men and women who braved captivity and imprisonment gave up \nmonths and years of their lives to ensure the continuation of the \nfreedom we enjoy today. Their service has taught us about patriotism, \nperseverance, and character. There is little we can do to repay these \nmen and women but we can recognize their invaluable contribution.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Murray and myself in \ncosponsoring this important resolution honoring our former prisoners of \nwar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6969-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FCC VOTE ON OWNERSHIP RULES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to state my opposition to the \nFederal Communications Commission's scheduled June 2nd vote to overhaul \ncurrent broadcast media ownership rules of newspapers, television ,and \nradio stations. I am disappointed that FCC Chairman Michael Powell has \nrefused to hold a single public hearing regarding the proposed changes \nto these rules, or to entertain further public comment on what is \nturning out to become a historic rulemaking.\n  The public needs to be heard from, and the public needs to know what \nwill happen if the changes that Chairman Powell has proposed become \nreality. The biennial review required by the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct requires the FCC to review its rules every 2 years, but this review \nshould not be used as an excuse to radically alter the way our \nconstituents receive their news from the media.\n  Not only am I disappointed at how this situation has come to pass, \nbut I am also dismayed at what the FCC proposes. There are a number of \nchanges that I disagree with--and this is just from what we have \nlearned last week.\n  For instance, we have learned that the FCC is considering to allow \nthe major broadcast networks to purchase more television stations and \nstrip them of local control. The FCC is also proposing to ease ``cross-\nownership'' rules and allow a media company to own a newspaper and \ntelevision company in the same community.\n  I urge everyone to reflect on this and how this will impact \ncommunities throughout this country. In my State of Vermont, we have a \nvery proud tradition of grassroots activism. Our local Vermont media \nknows this and reports the day's events with a Vermont audience in \nmind. If more Vermont media companies are controlled by out-of-state, \nor out-of-country owners, I fear a significant deterioration in the \ncoverage of local news.\n  The Vermont Press Association and the Vermont State Legislature have \nconcerns similar to mine. The Vermont Press Association has written a \nletter to the FCC explaining its position, and the Vermont State \nLegislature passed unanimously a joint resolution regarding this \nmatter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both documents be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Vermont Press Association\n\n                                     Colchester, VT, May 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Michael Powell\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Powell: The Board of Directors of the Vermont \n     Press Association, which represents the interests of the 10 \n     dailies and four dozen non-dailies circulating in Vermont, \n     endorses a Joint Resolution passed May 13th by the Vermont \n     Legislature. The resolution, which I include at the end of \n     this letter (an official copy is to be sent to you by Vermont \n     Secretary of State Deborah Markowitz), urges the Federal \n     Communications Commission to provide for a public comment \n     period prior to the adoption of any changes to the broadcast \n     media ownership rules.\n       We urge you to give serious consideration to this Joint \n     Resolution and allow for a public comment period, including \n     Congressional hearings, prior to issuing any new rules \n     concerning cross ownership.\n       Although FCC rules are a federal matter, what we read in \n     newspapers, hear on the radio and see on television is a \n     local and state issue. There is too much consolidation in the \n     news business and too few independent voices; relaxing cross \n     ownership rules even more will hurt all citizens. As a board, \n     we support increased diversity in media ownership, not less.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this press \n     association's viewpoint, and for taking into account the \n     resolution passed by the Vermont Legislature. We would \n     appreciate it if you would enter this resolution into the \n     public record on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Ross Connelly,\n\n                           President, Vermont Press Association,  \n                                            Editor & Co-publisher,\n     The Hardwick Gazette.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Joint House Resolution 18\n\n       Whereas, pursuant to the provisions of 47 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 73.3555, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has \n     established a series of ownership rules for radio and \n     television stations in a designated market area (DMA), and\n       Whereas, these rules were intended to prevent a \n     monopolization of media voices within a community, and\n       Whereas, over the last several decades, the number of \n     commercial radio stations a single entity may own in a DMA \n     has risen dramatically, from the former universal limit of \n     one AM and one FM, to, depending on the total number of local \n     radio stations in the DMA, as many as eight, with no more \n     than five on either the AM or FM broadcast band, and\n       Whereas, the number of local television stations a single \n     entity may own in a DMA has risen from one to two, depending \n     on technical considerations, and nationally, the number has \n     risen from a total of 7-35 percent of the aggregate national \n     audience, and\n       Whereas, the significant relaxation of multiple broadcast \n     media ownership restrictions has led to the creation of a \n     small number of national media conglomerates, including \n     Viacom (owner of CBS), General Electric (owner of NBC), \n     Disney (owner of ABC), and Clear Channel Communications, each \n     of which owns large numbers of broadcast stations, often \n     including multiple radio stations\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\n     in the same DMA in addition to national programming services, \n     and\n       Whereas, this concentration in the corporate ownership of \n     commercial broadcast media, both locally and nationally, has \n     severely limited the diversity of perspectives offered on \n     important issues, and also has resulted in a significant \n     reduction in local radio news coverage, and\n       Whereas, in an unusual, but nevertheless poignant, impact \n     of concentrated media ownership in a single community, public \n     safety officials in Minot, North Dakota, where all six \n     commercial radio stations are owned now by the same national \n     chain, were unable to reach anyone at the designated \n     emergency radio station when a train derailment resulted in \n     anhydrous ammonia fertilizer being released over the city, \n     and\n       Whereas, until now, the existing prohibition on daily \n     newspapers owning an AM, FM, or television station whose \n     primary signal serves ``the entire community in which such \n     newspaper is published,'' 47 C.F.R. Sec. 73.3555(d), has \n     remained in place, and\n       Whereas, under Sec. 212(h) of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996, P.L. No. 104-104 as amended, the FCC is directed to \n     review biennially all of the broadcast media ownership rules, \n     and\n       Whereas, there are strong indications the commission's \n     current review will result in the further relaxation of the \n     existing ownership rules, possibly allowing newspapers to \n     purchase radio or television stations in their publication \n     communities, and\n       Whereas, FCC Chair, Michael Powell, has announced the newly \n     revised ownership rules will be released in final form on \n     June 2 without an opportunity for public or congressional \n     comment, and\n       Whereas, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, Olympia \n     Snowe, Republican of Maine, Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North \n     Dakota, Ernest Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, and \n     Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, has written to \n     Chairman Powell requesting that Congress and the public be \n     afforded an opportunity to review any proposed changes before \n     they take effect, and\n       Whereas, both the potential substantive changes in the \n     media ownership rules and the lack of a public comment period \n     are greatly disturbing, now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives: That \n     the General Assembly strongly urges the Federal \n     Communications Commission to refrain from relaxing further \n     the restrictions on broadcast media outlet ownership, and be \n     it further\n       Resolved: That the General Assembly urges the Federal \n     Communications Commission to provide for a public comment \n     period prior to the adoption of any changes to the broadcast \n     media ownership rules, and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a \n     copy of this resolution to Michael Powell, Chair of the \n     Federal Communications Commission, and to each member of the \n     Vermont Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6972-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Fresno, \nCA. On September 20, 1998, the apartment of transgender female Chanel \nChandler was set ablaze. Inside the apartment the authorities \ndiscovered Chandler's body, stabbed repeatedly with a broken beer \nbottle. According to a police spokesperson, Chandler's gender identity \nand expression was a primary motivation for the attack. The fire, which \ndid not reach the room where Chandler's body was found, was likely a \nfailed attempt to hide Chandler's murder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6972-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OP-ED BY SENATOR GEORGE McGOVERN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the delineation between an \n``internationalist'' and ``isolationist'' has too often been drawn at \nthe doctrine of preemption. Those who supported the war in Iraq are \nconsidered ``internationalists'' while those who did not, are shunted \nas ``isolationists.'' This classification is unprecedented in the more \nthan two centuries of American foreign policy. Opposition to an \nunprovoked invasion is not isolationism. And internationalism is more \nthan merely waging war.\n  On May 12, the Washington Post published an op-ed by my friend and \nour former colleague, Senator George McGovern. As he has done many \ntimes in the past, Senator McGovern has provided important and timely \ninsights on U.S. foreign policy.\n  The debate over U.S. policy towards Iraq over the past several months \nhas been littered with references to ``internationalists'' and \n``isolationists.'' Senator McGovern has penned some important \nreflections about how these labels have been used in previous foreign \npolicy debates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the op-ed by Senator McGovern \nin the Washington Post on May 12, be printed in the Record so that all \nSenators and staff have an opportunity to review his comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Washington Post, May 12, 2003]\n\n                  A More Constructive Internationalism\n\n                        (By George S. McGovern)\n\n       In his May 1 op-ed piece, Will Marshall praised \n     presidential candidates Dick Gephardt, Joe Lieberman, John \n     Kerry and John Edwards as ``Blair Democrats''--\n     internationalists who are willing ``to use force in the \n     national interest.'' He rejoiced that the Democratic Party \n     ``is moving away from McGovernism and back to its \n     international roots.''\n       One wonders why Marshall went to Britain for an example of \n     how American Democrats ought to behave. It is more puzzling \n     why he concluded that I'm opposed to internationalism and the \n     ``use of force in the national interest.'' I first used force \n     in the national interest during World War II, when I flew 35 \n     combat missions in Europe.\n       American involvement in that war was clearly in our \n     national interest, and that is why I volunteered at the age \n     of 19 to be part of it.\n       It is true that I opposed the American war in Vietnam, but \n     not because I had ceased to be an internationalist. That war \n     was a disastrous folly, as all literate people now \n     acknowledge. We were never more isolated from the \n     international community than when our troops were deepest in \n     the Vietnam jungle. A close second in isolating us from the \n     international community was the invasion of Iraq, a largely \n     defenseless little desert state that posed no threat to us \n     and had taken no action against us.\n       The best way to support our troops is to keep them out of \n     needless wars such as Iraq and Vietnam. The best way for \n     America to play a constructive role internationally is to \n     support the United Nations and to work toward expanding \n     international trade, aid and investment while protecting our \n     workers and the environment. An internationalist would also \n     support the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the \n     International Criminal Court, the Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty and an international ban on land mines.\n       An internationalist also would support the International \n     Food for Peace Program, which I directed during the Kennedy \n     administration, as well as the efforts I carried forward to \n     reduce global hunger during my service as a Clinton \n     administration ambassador to the U.N. Food and Agriculture \n     agencies in Rome. Former senator Bob Dole and I have teamed \n     up to press for an international school lunch program that \n     would reach 300 million elementary school children who are \n     not being fed.\n       I am opposed to the Bush doctrine of ``preemptive war''--\n     what heretofore has been known as aggression or invasion. I \n     am also opposed to congressional resolutions that give the \n     president a blank check to go to war when he pleases.\n       I have always thought America to be the greatest country on \n     earth. One of the reasons I think so is because of our great \n     founding fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, who spoke of \n     ``a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.'' Is there any \n     doubt that the opinion of mankind was overwhelmingly against \n     our wars in Vietnam and Iraq?\n       We don't measure a nation's internationalism by the number \n     of troops it sends to other countries.

On March 12, 2003, during the debate on S. 3, the \nPartial Birth Abortion Ban Act, I made the following statement in \nsupport of the Durbin amendment:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \n     Durbin amendment.\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\n       I support the Durbin amendment because it is consistent \n     with my four principles. These are my principles: It respects \n     the constitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade. It prohibits \n     all post-viability abortions, regardless of the procedure \n     used. It provides an exception for the life and health of a \n     woman, which is both intellectually rigorous and \n     compassionate. And it leaves medical decisions in the hands \n     of physicians--not politicians.\n       The Durbin alternative addresses this difficult issue with \n     the intellectual rigor and seriousness of purpose it \n     deserves. We are not being casual. We are not angling for \n     political advantage. We are not looking for cover.\n       The Durbin amendment offers the Senate a sensible \n     alternative, one that would prohibit post-viability abortions \n     while respecting the Constitution and protecting women's \n     lives. I believe it is an alternative that reflects the views \n     of the American people.\n       I support the Durbin amendment because it is a stronger, \n     more effective approach to banning late term abortions. The \n     Durbin amendment respects the Constitution and the Supreme \n     Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade.\n       The Santorum bill before us does not. It is \n     unconstitutional.\n       In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart \n     just 3 years ago that a Nebraska State law that bans certain \n     abortion procedures is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court \n     ruled it was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, it did \n     not include an exception for a woman's health. Second, it \n     does not clearly define the procedure it aims to prohibit and \n     would ban other procedures, sometimes used early in \n     pregnancy.\n       The bill before us, the Santorum bill, is nearly identical \n     to the Nebraska law the Supreme Court struck down. The \n     proponents of this legislation say they have made changes to \n     the bill to address the Supreme Court's ruling. They have \n     not. It still does not include an exception to protect the \n     health of the woman. It still does not clearly define the \n     procedure it claims to prohibit. Let me be clear about this. \n     The Santorum bill is unconstitutional.\n       The Santorum bill violates the key principles of Roe v. \n     Wade and other Court decisions. When the Court decided Roe, \n     it was faced with the task of defining, ``When does life \n     begin?'' Theologians and scientists differ on this. People of \n     good will and good conscience differ on this.\n       So the Supreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a \n     fetus is viable it is presumed to have not only a body, but a \n     mind and spirit. Therefore it has standing under the law as a \n     person.\n       The Roe decision is quite clear. States can prohibit \n     abortion after viability so long as they permit exceptions in \n     cases involving the woman's life or health. Under Roe, states \n     can prohibit most late term abortions. And 41 states have \n     done so.\n       In my own state of Maryland, we have a law that does just \n     that. It was adopted by the Maryland General Assembly. It \n     prohibits post viability abortions. It provides an exception \n     to protect the life or health of the woman, as the \n     Constitution requires. It also provides an exception if the \n     fetus is affected by a genetic defect or a serious \n     abnormality. This law reflects the views of Marylanders. It \n     was approved by the people of Maryland by referendum.\n       Like the Maryland law, the Durbin alternative is consistent \n     with Roe. It is a compassionate, Constitutional approach to \n     prohibiting late term abortions.\n       It says that after the point of viability no woman should \n     be able to abort a viable fetus. The only exception can be \n     when the woman faces a threat to her life or serious and \n     debilitating risk to her health as required by the \n     Constitution.\n       The Durbin amendment is stronger than the Santorum bill. It \n     bans all post viability abortions. Unlike the Santorum bill, \n     the Durbin amendment doesn't create loopholes by allowing \n     other procedures to be used.\n       I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should \n     abort a viable fetus for a frivolous, non-medical reason. It \n     does not matter what procedure is used. It is wrong, and we \n     know it. The Durbin alternative bans those abortions. It is a \n     real solution.\n       On the other hand, Senator Santorum's bill does not stop a \n     single abortion. It does not ban all late term abortions. It \n     bans certain procedures and diverts doctors to other \n     procedures. This approach is both hollow and ineffective. It \n     bans procedures that may be the safest for a woman's health. \n     But let me be clear. Under Santorum, late term abortions \n     would still be allowed to happen.\n       It does not make late term abortions more rare. It makes \n     them more dangerous. And for that reason, the Santorum \n     approach is ineffective.\n       The Durbin amendment provides a tough and narrow health \n     exception that is both intellectually rigorous and \n     compassionate. It will ensure that women who confront a grave \n     health crisis late in a pregnancy can receive the treatment \n     they need. The Durbin amendment defines such a crisis as a \n     ``severely debilitating disease or impairment caused or \n     exacerbated by pregnancy'' or ``an inability to provide \n     necessary treatment to a life-threatening condition.''\n       And we don't leave it up to her doctor alone. We require \n     that a second, independent physician also certify that the \n     procedure is the most appropriate for the unique \n     circumstances of the woman's life.\n       I want to be very clear in this. The Durbin amendment does \n     not create a loophole with its health exception. We are not \n     loophole shopping when we insist that an exception be made in \n     the case of serious and debilitating threats to a woman's \n     physical health. This is what the Constitution requires--and \n     the reality of women's lives demands.\n       Let's face it. Women do sometimes face profound medical \n     crises during pregnancy. Breast cancer, for example, occurs \n     in one in 3,000 pregnancies. In some unfortunate \n     circumstances, pregnant women in their second trimester \n     discover lumps in their breasts and are diagnosed with \n     invasive breast cancer. Continuing the pregnancy--and \n     delaying medical treatment--would put a woman's health in \n     grave danger.\n       The Durbin amendment recognizes that to deny a woman in a \n     situation like this access to the abortion that could save \n     her life and physical health would be unconscionable. To deny \n     her other children a chance to know a healthy mother would be \n     unconscionable.\n       When the continuation of the pregnancy is causing profound \n     health problems, a woman's doctor must have every tool \n     available to respond. I readily acknowledge that the \n     procedure described by my colleagues on the other side is a \n     grim one. I do not deny that. But there are times when the \n     realities of women's lives and health dictates that this \n     medical tool be available.\n       I support the Durbin alternative because it leaves medical \n     decisions up to doctors, not legislators. It relies on \n     medical judgement, not political judgement about what is best \n     for a patient.\n       Not only does the Santorum bill not let doctors be doctors, \n     it criminalizes them for making the best choice for their \n     patients.\n       Under this bill, a doctor could be sent to prison for up to \n     two years for doing what he or she thinks is necessary to \n     save a woman's life or health. I say that's wrong.\n       In fact, those who oppose the Durbin amendment say it is \n     flawed precisely because it leaves medical judgements up to \n     physicians. Well, who else should decide? Would the other \n     side prefer to have the government make medical decisions?\n       I disagree with that. I believe we should not substitute \n     political judgement for medical judgement. We need to let \n     doctors be doctors. This is my principle whether we are \n     talking about reproductive choice or any health care matter.\n       Physicians have the training and expertise to make medical \n     decisions. They are in the best position to recommend what is \n     necessary or appropriate for their patients. Not bureaucrats. \n     Not managed care accountants. And certainly not legislators.\n       The Durbin amendment provides sound public policy, not a \n     political soundbite. It is our best chance to address the \n     concerns many of us have about late term abortions.\n       Today we have an opportunity today to do something real. We \n     have an opportunity to let logic and common sense win the \n     day. We have an opportunity to do something that I know \n     reflects the views of the American people. Today, we can pass \n     the Durbin amendment.\n       We can say that we value life, and that we value our \n     Constitution. We can make clear that a viable fetus should \n     not be aborted. We can say that we want to save women's lives \n     and protect women's health.\n       The only way to do this is to vote for the Durbin \n     amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6973-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WYNONA WARD OF ``HAVE JUSTICE--WILL TRAVEL''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a truly \nremarkable Vermonter who delivers ``justice on wheels'' to victims of \ndomestic abuse.\n  Wynona Ward is the founder and director of Have Justice--Will Travel, \nHJWT, an innovative, mobile, multi-service program that assists rural \nvictims of domestic violence through the legal process. She \naccomplishes this by combining her present profession as an attorney \nwith her experiences as a truck driver to provide a variety of \nservices--including free legal aid, in-home counseling, and \ntransportation to and from court hearings and other social service \nappointments to rural families trapped in the generational cycle of \nabuse.\n  Based on her pioneering and inspirational work on behalf of domestic \nviolence victims and their families, Wynona has been selected by \nLifetime Television to be honored in ``Lifetime's Achievement Awards: \nWomen Changing the World,'' which will air tonight. An independent \npanel of judges reviewed thousands of nominations before selecting six \nwomen for the honor. Wynona received the ``Champion Award,'' presented \nto a woman who overcame ``seemingly insurmountable odds to create a \npositive change for herself or others.''\n  Wynona was born into a poor family where alcoholism and abuse was \nroutine--her father beat her mother and his 5 children, and sexually \nassaulted his daughters. Family violence was an accepted way of life \nthen in rural Vermont. Local doctors treated the black-and-blues and \nother injuries that\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nfrequently appeared on the bodies of Wynona, her mother and her \nsiblings, but they never once asked how those bruises got there. No law \nrequired that they be reported, and even if suspected abuse were \nreported, law officials would hesitate to interfere with goings on in \nthe home. The family had no choice but to suffer in secret.\n  To escape her abusive father, Wynona married young and then worked 15 \nyears with her husband, Harold, in their own trucking business driving \ntheir 18-wheeler tractor-trailer unit cross-country. Years later, she \nreceived word from home that the abuse she had known was beginning for \nthe next generation of her family. Wynona decided to take action by \nrevealing the family secret so that her family could no longer deny \nthat abuse existed, and volunteered as the victim's advocate for the \nchild who had been sexually abused. Her experience led her to her \ncurrent career after realizing how traumatizing and confusing the legal \nsystem can be for victims and their families.\n  After she turned 40, Wynona entered the Adult Degree Program at \nVermont College of Norwich University. She and Harold continued to run \ntheir trucking business, and as they crossed the U.S., she completed \nher B.A. on a laptop in the living compartment of their truck. She then \nentered Vermont Law School, and in April 2000, she passed the bar and \nwas sworn in as a licensed Vermont Attorney.\n  Drawing on her personal experience as a survivor of childhood \ndomestic abuse, Wynona created a new way to bridge the legal, \ngeographical, psychological, cultural and economic gaps that exist for \nbattered women and their children. She came up with the concept of Have \nJustice--Will Travel from the knowledge that battered rural women \nliving in isolation often lack education or job skills and access to \ntelephones and transportation. They need comprehensive assistance in \nachieving self-reliance and independence. HJWT serves about 50 clients \na year, and offers assistance to several hundred more women not only in \nVermont but those in rural areas throughout the United States.\n  ``Have Justice--Will Travel'' has been successful in serving women \nand children throughout the State of Vermont. It is a shining example \nfor grassroots domestic violence assistance on a national level. I have \nmet this extraordinary woman many times, and I never fail to be \ninspired and humbled by her dramatic personal story and her venture \ninto a non-traditional career. I salute Wynona Ward today as a true \nchampion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6974-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6974-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6974-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6974-S6975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT THAT DECLARES A NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO DEAL WITH THE UNUSUAL AND \nEXTRAORDINARY THREAT POSED TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY \n  OF THE UNITED STATES BY THE THREAT OF ATTACHMENT OR OTHER JUDICIAL \n  PROCESS AGAINST THE DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR IRAQ, IRAQI PETROLEUM AND \n PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND INTERESTS THEREIN, AND PROCEEDS, OBLIGATIONS, \n OR ANY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM OR \n RELATED TO THE SALE OR MARKETING THEREOF, AND INTERESTS THEREIN--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport, which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 204(b) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), section 5 of the United \nNations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), and section 301 of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I \nhave exercised my authority to declare a national emergency to deal \nwith the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States by the threat of \nattachment or other judicial process against the Development Fund for \nIraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, \nand proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature \nwhatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, \nand interests therein.\n  A major national security and foreign policy goal of the United \nStates is to ensure that the newly established Development Fund for \nIraq and other Iraqi resources, including Iraqi petroleum and petroleum \nproducts, are dedicated for the well-being of the Iraqi people, for the \norderly reconstruction and repair of Iraq's infrastructure, for the \ncontinued disarmament of Iraq, for the costs of indigenous civilian \nadministration, and for other purposes benefiting the people of Iraq. \nThe Development Fund for Iraq and other property in which Iraq has an \ninterest may be subject to attachment, judgment, decree, lien, \nexecution, garnishment, or other judicial process, thereby jeopardizing \nthe full dedication of such assets to purposes benefiting the people of \nIraq.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to the armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of \n     2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No.65\n\n       Whereas, Under the provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     1997, home sellers are relieved of the obligation to pay \n     taxes on capital gains of up to $250,000 ($500,000 per \n     couple), if they have owned and occupied their home for at \n     least two of the five years before the sale. This historic \n     legislation made the federal tax code fairer and more \n     equitable for millions of American taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, A glaring inequity in the tax code, however, \n     affects a number of those who serve our nation as military \n     personnel and who leave their homes on extended assignment. \n     These brave men and women may be penalized for their selfless \n     service on behalf of the American people and our allies. Many \n     are unable to take advantage of the capital gains tax relief \n     afforded ordinary citizens because their call to overseas \n     duty may prevent them from physically occupying their homes \n     for the required period of time; and\n       Whereas, Two measures currently before the 108th Congress \n     (H.R. 1307 and S. 351) propose ending the injustice of the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act's limitation regarding extended overseas \n     military service. The Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 \n     would, in part, extend the five-year period used in \n     calculating the full exemption for capital gain to ten years \n     for persons engaged in qualified official extended duty in \n     military or foreign service. This legislation will help \n     assure that those who so proudly serve our nation will not be \n     disserviced by its tax code: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the United States Congress be \n     memorialized to enact the Armed Forces Tax Relief Act of \n     2003; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be presented to \n     the Speaker of the United\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n     States House of Representatives, the President of the United \n     States Senate, and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-125. A concurrent resolution passed by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona relative to rescinding all of \n     Arizona's previous calls for a constitutional convention to \n     amend the Constitution of the United States, received on May \n     15, 2003; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution 1022\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Arizona, acting \n     with the best of intentions, has in the past applied to the \n     Congress of the United States by memorial or resolution in \n     accordance with article V, Constitution of the United States, \n     for one or more constitutional conventions for the purpose of \n     amending the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, over the course of time, the will of the people of \n     the State of Arizona has changed with regards to Arizona's \n     previous calls for a constitutional convention to amend the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, certain persons or states have called for a \n     constitutional convention on issues that may be directly in \n     opposition to the will of the people of this state; and\n       Whereas, the people of this state do not want their \n     previous applications for a constitutional convention to be \n     aggregated with those calls for a convention from other \n     states; and\n       Whereas, former Justice of the United States Supreme Court \n     Warren E. Burger, former Associate Justice of the United \n     States Court Arthur J. Goldberg and many other leading \n     constitutional scholars are in general agreement that a \n     convention, notwithstanding whatever limitation might be \n     placed on it by the call for a convention, may propose \n     sweeping constitutional changes or, by virtue of the \n     authority of a constitutional convention, redraft the \n     Constitution of the United States creating an imminent peril \n     to the well established rights of citizens and to the duties \n     of various levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States has been \n     amended many times in the history of this nation and may be \n     amended many more times without the need to resort to a \n     constitutional convention, and has been intercepted for more \n     than two hundred years and found to be a sound document that \n     protects the lives and liberties of citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is no need for, and in fact there is great \n     danger in, a new constitution or in opening the Constitution \n     of the United States racial changes, the adoption of which \n     could create legal chaos in this nation and begin the process \n     of another two centuries of litigation over its meaning and \n     interpretation: and\n       Whereas, changes or amendments that may be needed in the \n     present Constitution of the United States may be proposed and \n     enacted without resorting to a constitutional convention by \n     using the process provided in the Constitution and previously \n     used throughout the history of this nation: Therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House \n     of Representatives concurring:\n       1. That the Legislature of the State of Arizona hereby \n     repeals; rescinds, cancels, renders null and void and \n     supersedes any and all existing applications to the Congress \n     of the United States for a constitutional convention under \n     Article V of the Constitution of the United States for any \n     purpose, whether limited or general.\n       2. That the Legislature of the State of Arizona urges the \n     legislature of each and every state that has applied to \n     Congress for either a general or limited constitutional \n     convention to repeal and rescind their applications.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Administrator of General Services in \n     Washington, DC., each Member of Congress from the State of \n     Arizona and the Secretaries of State and presiding officers \n     of both houses of the legislation of each state in the Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S6977-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 579.

A bill to clarify the authority of the Secretary of \nAgriculture to prescribe performance standards for the reduction of \npathogens in meat, meat products, poultry, and poultry products \nprocessed by establishments receiving inspection services and to \nenforce the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) System \nrequirements, sanitation requirements, and the performance standards; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Meat and \nPoultry Pathogen Reduction Act of 2003. This legislation, commonly \nknown as Kevin's Law, is dedicated to the memory of 2-year-old Kevin \nKowalcyk, who died in 2001 after eating a hamburger contaminated with \nE.coli H7:0157 bacteria. Passage of this bill is vital because on \nDecember 6, 2001, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld and expanded \nan earlier District Court decision that removes the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's, USDA, authority to enforce its Pathogen Performance \nStandard for Salmonella. The 5th Circuit's decision in Supreme Beef v. \nUSDA, Supreme, seriously undermines the sweeping food safety changes \nadopted by USDA in its 1996 Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and \nPathogen Reduction, HACCP, rule.\n  More recently, there was another court case that calls into question \nUSDA's authority to enforce its microbiological performance standards. \nA company called Nebraska Beef sued USDA after the Department tried to \nshut down the plant for numerous alleged food safety violations. The \njudge in the case granted a temporary restraining order, preventing \nUSDA to take enforcement action.\n  According the 5th Circuit's opinion in Supreme and the Nebraska Beef \ndecision, today, there is nothing USDA could do to shut down a meat \ngrinding plant that insists on using low-quality, potentially \ncontaminated trimmings. These decisions seriously undermine the new \nmeat and poultry inspection system.\n  The Pathogen Reduction Rule recognized that bacterial and viral \npathogens were the foremost food safety threat in America, responsible \nfor 5,000 deaths, 325,000 hospitalizations and 76 million illnesses \neach year. To address the threat of foodborne illness, USDA developed a \nmodern inspection system based on two fundamental principles.\n  The first was that industry has the primary responsibility to \ndetermine how to produce the safest products possible. Industry had to \nexamine their plants and determine how to control contamination at \nevery step of the food production process, from the moment a product \narrives at their door until the moment it leaves their plant.\n  The second, even more crucial principle was that plants nationwide \nmust reduce levels of dangerous pathogens in meat and poultry products. \nTo ensure the new inspection system accomplished this, USDA developed \nPathogen Performance Standards. These standards provide targets for \nreducing pathogens and require all USDA-inspected facilities to meet \nthem. Facilities failing to meet a standard are shut down until they \ncreate a corrective action plan to meet the standard.\n  So far, USDA has only issued one Pathogen Performance Standard, for \nSalmonella. The vast majority of plants in the U.S. have been able to \nmeet the new standard, so it is clearly workable. In addition, USDA \nreports that Salmonella levels for meat and poultry products have \nfallen substantially. Therefore the Salmonella standard has been \nsuccessful. The 5th Circuit Court's and the Nebraska Beef decisions \nthreaten to destroy this success and set our food safety system back \nyears.\n  The other major problem is we have an industry dead set on striking \ndown USDA's authority to enforce meat and poultry pathogen standards. \nEver since the original Supreme decision, I have spent untold hours \ntrying to find a compromise that will allow us to ensure we have \nenforceable, science-based standards for pathogens in meat and poultry \nproducts. I have introduced bills to address this issue and I have even \nworked with industry leaders to reach a reasonable compromise.\n\n  However, despite repeated attempts to address industry concerns, \nindustry has continually backtracked and moved the finish line. Many \ntimes, I have made changes in my legislation to address their \n``pressing'' concern of the moment only to have them come back and say \nwe hadn't gone far enough. We cannot let a few bullies in the meat and \npoultry industry place our children, our families at a increased risk \nof getting ill or dying, because some of the industry want to backtrack \non food safety.\n  In addition, the recent announcement that a cow in Alberta, Canada \ntested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, otherwise \nknown as ``mad cow disease'', provoked the U.S. government to \nimmediately close the U.S.-Canadian border for the trade at beer and \nbeef products. I applaud the current Administration for taking this \naction to ensure the safety of our Nation's food supply until more \ninformation is made available about the true extent of the problem.\n  And without downplaying the seriousness of that horrible disease, I \nthink its necessary to look at the impact of BSE in light of other food \nborne illnesses. Researchers believe that BSE is linked to variable \nCreutzfeldt-Jakob,\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nvCJD, disease. Since its onset in Britain in 1995, 129 people have died \nworldwide from vCJD. Foodborne pathogens, on the other hand, have cause \n5000 deaths, 125,000 hospitalizations, and 76 million illnesses each \nyear. The numbers speak for themselves.\n  The swift and comprehensive response provoked by a single diseased \ncow in a neighboring country stands in stark contrast to the way our \ngovernment currently responds to outbreaks of foodbornes illness in our \ncountry today. USDA has the ability to shut down the trade from the \nbiggest importer of beef into out country on suspicions of possible \nfood safety problems, but cannot even temporarily shut down one plant \nthat USDA knows has problems.\n  I plan to seek every opportunity to get this language enacted. I \nthink it is essential, both to ensuring the modernization of our food \nsafety system, and ensuring consumers that we are making progress in \nreducing dangerous pathogens.\n  I hope that both parties, and both houses of Congress will be able to \nact to pass this legislation without delay. The public's confidence in \nour meat and poultry inspection system is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Meat and Poultry Pathogen \n     Reduction and Enforcement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the primary purpose of the Federal meat and poultry \n     inspection program is to protect public health;\n       (2) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report \n     that human pathogens found in raw and cooked meat, meat \n     products, poultry, and poultry products are a significant \n     source of foodborne illness;\n       (3) to reduce the public health burden of foodborne \n     illness, the Federal meat and poultry inspection system \n     should focus on reducing the risk of foodborne illness \n     associated with the presence of foodborne pathogens through--\n       (A) establishment and enforcement of performance standards \n     for the reduction of pathogens in meat, meat products, \n     poultry, and poultry products processed by establishments \n     receiving inspection services; and\n       (B) enforcement of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control \n     Point (HACCP) System requirements and sanitation \n     requirements;\n       (4) good public health practice requires controlling \n     pathogens as close as practicable to the initial source of \n     contamination to reduce pathogens and prevent foodborne \n     illness;\n       (5) there is a need for strong safeguards at slaughter \n     establishments during the slaughter and processing of meat \n     and poultry products because those establishments are where \n     pathogen contamination often originates;\n       (6) while proper handling and cooking of meat and poultry \n     products can virtually eliminate the risk of foodborne \n     illness from the consumption of meat and poultry, the \n     presence of pathogens in raw meat and poultry products leads \n     to cross-contamination of other foods and surrounding \n     surfaces;\n       (7) to reduce the risk of foodborne illness and protect \n     public health, regulatory authorities and all parties \n     involved in the production and handling of meat, meat \n     products, poultry, or poultry products should make a \n     concerted effort to reduce, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, contamination by pathogens using the best \n     available scientific information and appropriate technology;\n       (8) the distribution of meat, meat products, poultry, or \n     poultry products that contain human pathogens--\n       (A) impairs the effective regulation of wholesome meat, \n     meat products, poultry, or poultry products in interstate and \n     foreign commerce; and\n       (B) destroys markets for wholesome products;\n       (9) all articles and other animals that are subject to this \n     Act and the amendments made by this Act are either in or \n     substantially affect interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       (10) regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture and \n     cooperation by the States are necessary to prevent or \n     eliminate burdens on interstate or foreign commerce and to \n     protect the health and welfare of consumers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Harkin today \nin introducing Kevin's Law, which is an essential piece of legislation \nthat will clarify the U.S. Department of Agriculture's authority to \nenforce pathogen reduction standards in meat and poultry products.\n  Our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant \nfood supplies in the world. However, we can do better. While food may \nnever be completely free of risk, we must strive to make our food as \nsafe as possible. Foodborne illnesses and hazards are still a \nsignificant problem that cannot be passively dismissed.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate as many as 76 \nmillion people suffer from foodborne illnesses each year. Of those \nindividuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized and more than \n5,000 will die. With emerging pathogens, broader distribution patterns, \nan increasing volume of food imports, and changing consumption \npatterns, this situation is not likely to improve without decisive \naction.\n  Foodborne illnesses can have devastating effects on certain \npopulations in our society. Children are especially vulnerable. Because \ntheir immune systems are not fully developed, they are at greater risk \nfor developing life-threatening or fatal complications associated with \nfoodborne illnesses. Quite simply, a child's lower weight means that it \ntakes a smaller quantity of pathogens to make a child sick than it \nwould a healthy adult. The elderly and those with compromised immune \nsystems are also at high risk for developing life-threatening \nconditions associated with foodborne illnesses.\n  A key tool for addressing foodborne illness in this country has been \nthe USDA's pathogen reduction/hazard analysis and critical control \npoint, PR/HACCP, regulations that were phased in beginning in January \n1998. Under these regulations, USDA developed a scientific approach \naimed at protecting consumers from foodborne pathogens. Instead of a \nsystem based on sight, smell, and touch, USDA moved to a system that \nwould successfully detect harmful pathogens whether visible or not.\n  A major part of this system includes testing for harmful pathogens, \nsuch as salmonella. USDA uses the data from this testing to determine \nif meat and poultry plants are producing products that are safe to \nconsume.\n  USDA's pathogen testing regulations have provided consumers with \nincreased confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products. \nHowever, in December of 2001, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld \nan earlier district court decision that removes the USDA's authority to \nenforce its pathogen standards for salmonella. The result of this court \ncase is that USDA can no longer ensure that meat and poultry plants \ncomply with pathogen standards. This creates a significant risk that \nmeat and poultry products contaminated with common but potentially \ndeadly pathogens will be sold to unsuspecting consumers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will clarify USDA's \nauthority to enforce strong safety standards for contamination in meat \nand poultry products. Specifically, this legislation will provide the \nSecretary of Agriculture with the clear authority to control for \npathogens and enforce pathogen performance standards for meat and \npoultry products. Only with this authority will the Secretary of \nAgriculture be able to ensure the safety of the meat and poultry \nproducts sold in this country.\n  We must work together to ensure that USDA has the necessary authority\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nto enforce pathogen performance standards that will protect public \nhealth. Let's not turn our back on food safety and consumer protection \nat such a critical time for food safety and security. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join this effort to protect our food supply and public \nhealth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1105. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of designating the French Colonial \nHeritage Area in the State of Missouri as a unit of the National Park \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrecognizing the historical significance of downtown Sainte Genevieve, \nMO. Sainte Genevieve was the first European settlement west of the \nMississippi River, and still contains many structures and artifacts \nthat have survived from its rich early history. Establishing this area \nas a unit of the National Park System will provide an unparalleled \nopportunity for Americans to be educated about our Nation's colonial \npast.\n  Sainte Genevieve was founded by French settlers in 1735. These early \npioneers traveled south from French Canada, and built the rare French \nColonial style structures that remain in place to this day. Today, the \ncity contains an invaluable wealth of Native American and French \nColonial sites, artifacts, and architecture. Perhaps most impressively, \ndowntown Sainte Genevieve contains three of only five poteaux-en-Terre, \npost in the ground, vertical log French homes remaining in North \nAmerica, dating from approximately 1800.\n  In addition to the historic downtown district, the area adjacent to \nSainte Genevieve is rich in historic sites. The ``Grand Champ'' common \nfield of the French colonists still retains its original field land \npattern. The area's saline salt springs were an important industry \nsource for Native American and European settlers. And nearby ceremonial \nmounds are evidence of a prehistoric Native American village.\n  This area is a truly valuable asset to the State of Missouri, and I \nfeel that it is only fair to share it with the entire Nation by \nestablishing the French Colonial Heritage Area as a unit of the \nNational Park System. My legislation would take the first step toward \nsuch an establishment by directing the National Park Service to conduct \na study of the historic features of Sainte Genevieve. After a thorough \nstudy, I am confident that the National Park Service will determine \nthat Sainte Genevieve is the best tool with which to tell the important \nand fascinating story of the French in the New World.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1106. A bill to establish National Standards for Fishing Quota \nSystems; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Kerry, to \nintroduce the Fishing Quota Act of 2003 which will address one of the \nmost complex policy questions in fisheries management--fishing quotas. \nThis bill will amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to authorize the establishment of new fishing quota \nsystems. This legislation will in no way whatsoever force Fishing Quota \nprograms upon any regional fishery management council and this is not a \nmandate to use Fishing Quota programs. Rather, it is intended to \nprovide the councils with an additional conservation and management \ntool.\n  Fishing Quota programs can drastically change the face of fishing \ncommunities and the fundamental principles of conservation and \nmanagement. Therefore, this legislation was developed in a careful and \nmeaningful manner over the span of many years with significant input \nand participation from all of the many affected and interested parties.\n  In 1996, Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act through enactment of the Sustainable \nFisheries Act, SFA. The SFA contained the most substantial improvements \nto fisheries conservation since the original passage of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act in 1976. More specifically, the SFA included a five year \nmoratorium on new fishing quota programs and required the National \nAcademy of Sciences, NAS, to study and report on the issue.\n  In 1999, the NAS issued its report, Sharing the Fish, which contained \na number of critically important recommendations addressing the social, \neconomic, and biological aspects of Fishing Quota programs. The Fishing \nQuota Act of 2003 incorporates many of the recommendations in this \nreport and provides the regional councils with the flexibility to adopt \nadditional NAS recommendations.\n  During the 106th Congress, the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries \ntraveled across the country and held six hearings on reauthorizing the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act. We began the process in Washington, DC, and then \nvisited fishing communities in Maine, Louisiana, Alaska, Washington, \nand Massachusetts. During the course of those hearings, we heard \nofficial testimony from over 70 witnesses and received statements from \nmany more fishermen during open microphone sessions at each field \nhearing. The Subcommittee heard the comments, views, and \nrecommendations of Federal and State officials, regional council \nchairmen and members, other fisheries managers, commercial and \nrecreational fishermen, members of the conservation community, and many \nother interested in these important issues. After these hearings, I \nintroduced the Individual Fishing Quota Act of 2001, S. 637, at the \nbeginning of the 107th Congress beginning the legislative dialogue. \nSince then, we have heard from many stakeholders who assisted the \nSubcommittee in shaping and re-shaping this bill.\n  The Fishing Quota Act of 2003 creates a framework under which fishery \nmanagement plans, FMPs, or plan amendments may establish a new fishing \nquota system. As with other components of fisheries conservation and \nmanagement, there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' solution to Fishing Quota \nprograms. Therefore, this bill sets certain conditions under which \nFishing Quota programs may be developed, if such a program is desired. \nIn doing so, it clearly provides the regional fishery management \ncouncils and the affected fishermen with the flexibility to shape any \nnew Fishing Quota program to fit the needs of the fishery.\n  The bill ensures that any regional council which establishes a new \nfishing quota program will promote sustainable management of the \nfishery; require fair and equitable allocation of fishing quotas; \nminimize negative social and economic impacts on local coastal \ncommunities; ensure adequate enforcement of the system; and take into \naccount present participation and historical fishing practices of the \nrelevant fishery. Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of \nCommerce to conduct referenda to ensure that those most affected by \nfishing quotas will have the opportunity to formally approve the \nadoption of any new fishing quota program by a two-thirds vote.\n  This bill authorizes the potential allocation of fishing quotas to \nfishing vessel owners, fishermen, and crew members who are citizens of \nthe United States. In addition, participation in the fishery is \nrequired for a person to obtain quota. Moreover, this bill permits \ncouncils to allocate quota shares to entry-level fishermen, small \nvessel owners, or crew members who may not otherwise be eligible for \nindividual quotas. While this bill authorizes the transfer of fishing \nquotas, it requires the regional councils to define and prohibit an \nexcess accumulation of quota shares.\n  This is a good bill which allows Fishing Quota programs to be created \nwhere they are needed and desired. The Fishing Quota Act of 2003 \nincorporates many of the suggestions we heard from those men and women \nwho fish for a living and those who are most affected by the law and \nits regulations. I appreciate the participation of Senator Kerry and \nall the impacted stakeholders who assisted in drafting this \nlegislation. I look forward to moving this bill through the legislative \nprocess toward final passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fishing Quota Act of 2003''.\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Ms. Snowe, \nto introduce the Fishing Quota Act of 2003, legislation to establish \nnational criteria governing the use of individual fishing quota IFQ \nsystems. Work began in earnest on this bipartisan bill in the Commerce \nCommittee last spring, as the expiration of the national moratorium on \nthe use of IFQs approached, and small boat fishermen voiced concerns \nthat existing legislative criteria governing the use of IFQs would not \noffer sufficient protection to communities. I would like to thank \nSubcommittee Chair Snowe for her efforts to work with me and with other \nmembers of the Commerce Committee on this legislation, which draws from \nseparate IFQ legislation that both Senator Snowe and I introduced \nbeginning in the 106th Congress.\n  The IFQ moratorium established under the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries \nAct was set to expire September 30, 2000. Senator Snowe and I supported \na 2-year extension of that moratorium to allow for hearings and full \nconsultation with affected groups on the issues surrounding IFQs. Our \ndiscussions focused on the need to provide regional flexibility to use \nIFQs as a management tool, while providing national ``rules of the \nroad.'' Such rules of the road would ensure IFQ systems developed after \nexpiration of the moratorium are adopted with the support of the \nfishery, allocate quota fairly and equitably, address region-specific \nneeds, further the conservation and management goals of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, prevent consolidation of quota, address the needs of small \nfishing communities, and recognize both the public nature of the \nresource and that issuance of an IFQ does not give rise to a \ncompensable property right.\n  To develop such rules, we worked with fellow Commerce Committee \nmembers, including Senators Breaux, Lott, Boxer, Stevens, and Cantwell, \nconsulted with interested groups, and obtained technical advice from \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service. While New England has \nhistorically been opposed to IFQs, other regions are interested in \nutilizing IFQ programs in certain fisheries. I believe the resulting \nbill provides a balance between the need to provide national policy \nguidance that considers the concerns of communities and harvesters, but \nallows for development of IFQ systems, where appropriate, on a fishery-\nby-fishery basis. This preserves the balanced regional approach to \nfishery management that Congress intended in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. \nI also want to clarify that this bill does not authorize the \nestablishment of ``processor quota,'' and relates only to issuance of \nharvester quota.\n  The bill Senator Snowe and I are introducing today sets forth a set \nof national criteria that councils wishing to adopt IFQs would follow. \nImportantly, this bill contains a provision that directs councils to \nconsider the use of community or area-based approaches and strategies \nthat would preserve the vitality of small fishing communities, \nincluding the allocation of quota to a fishing community. It also \ndirects councils to consider use of other management measures, \nincluding those that would facilitate formation of fishery cooperative \narrangements, taking account of the dependence of coastal communities \non these fisheries.\n  This bill addresses many of the concerns raised by fishermen, and I \nunderstand the many concerns of small fisherman in New England \nregarding the use of IFQs. I believe this bill gives fishermen the \npower to decide whether to implement an IFQ program and ensures that \nthose who do will operate under a fair system. First, no region could \nimplement an IFQ system without approval of a two-thirds majority of \neligible permit holders through a referendum process run by the \nSecretary of Commerce. In addition, any IFQ system developed under the \nlegislation would have to meet a set of national criteria. These \nnational criteria would include: (1) ensuring a fair and equitable \ninitial allocation of quota, including the establishment of an appeals \nprocess for qualification and allocation decisions, taking into account \npresent and historic participation in the fishery; (2) establishing \nlimits necessary to prevent inequitable concentration of quota share; \n(3) preventing any person from acquiring an ``excessive share''; (4) \nconsidering allocation of a portion of the annual harvest specifically \nto small fishermen, skippers, crew members, fishing communities, or \ncategories of vessels or gear types; and (5) providing for revocation \nof quota if the owner is no longer an active fisherman.\n\n  I also believe this bill responds to concerns that IFQ systems would \nundermine the national interest in conserving fishery resources held in \nthe public trust. In order to respond to those concerns, the bill \nwould: (1) specify that an IFQ is a permit under the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct and does not confer any right of compensation or any right, title \nor interest to any fish before it is harvested; (2) established that \nthe quota expires after 10 years, unless extended by a fishery \nmanagement plan; (3) require that the systems promote management \nmeasures to improve the conservation and management of the fishery, \nincluding reduction of bycatch; (4) provide for regular review and \nevaluation of the system, including specifying actions to be taken for \nany failure to meet the criteria; (5) require that the systems provide \nfor effective enforcement, monitoring, and management, including use of \nobservers; and (6) require that quota be revoked from individuals found \nto be subject to civil penalties under section 308 of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act.\n\n  The bill also would require a 5-year recurring independent review of \nIFQ systems by the National Research Council, to: (1) evaluate the \neffectiveness of such systems and determine who the systems contribute \nto improved management, conservation and safety; (2) evaluate the \nsocial, economic and biological consequences of the systems, including \neconomic impacts on fishing communities; (3) evaluate the costs of \nimplementation; and (4) provide recommendations to ensure the systems \nmeet Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements and the goals of the plans.\n  I believe this legislation provides guidelines for the use of IFQs \nthat will help ensure the health of our marine fisheries. During the \nlast reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, our\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nNation's fisheries were at a crossroads, and action was required to \nremedy our marine resource management problems, to preserve the way of \nlife in our coastal communities, and to promote the sustainable use and \nconservation of our marine resources for future generations and for the \neconomic good of the Nation. We must stay the course, and this bill \nwill help us do just that. I remain committed to the goal of \nestablishing biologically and economically sustainable fisheries so \nthat fishing will continue to be an important part of the culture and \neconomy of coastal communities throughout Massachusetts, as well as the \neconomy of the Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 1107. A bill to enhance the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program \nfor the National Park Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Recreation \nFee Authority Act of 2003. This legislation modifies the \ncongressionally created Recreation Fee Demonstration Program.\n  The issue of user fees on public lands is a difficult one. As you \nknow, our Nation's parks and recreation areas are in serious trouble \nand have significant maintenance and infrastructure needs. The National \nPark Service alone has roughly a $5 billion backlog in maintenance and \ninfrastructure repair. There are a number of reasons for this funding \nshortage, including poor park management, congressional inaction and \napathy from the American public.\n  Currently, the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program allows the \nNational Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife \nService and the U.S. Forest Service to collect and expend funds for \nareas in need of additional financial support. Agencies collect fees \nfor admission to a unit or site for special uses such as boating and \nback country camping fees and are able to use 80 percent of the \nreceipts for protection and enhancement in that area. Fees are \ntypically used for visitor services, maintenance and repair of \nfacilities as well as cultural and natural resource management. The \nremaining 20 percent is used on an agency-wide basis for parts of the \nsystem, which are precluded from participating in the Recreation Fee \nDemonstration program.\n  The legislation I am introducing today allows permanent authorization \nof the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program for national parks, and \nprovides some new flexibility. For example, many visitors frequent \nnational and State parks, but are not allowed to use State and national \npasses interchangeably. In cooperation with State agencies, the \nSecretary of the Interior will be authorized to enter into revenue \nsharing agreements to accept state and national park passes at sites \nwithin that state--providing a cost savings and convenience for the \nvisitor.\n  In the past, concerns have been expressed about ``nickel and dime'' \nefforts where there appears to be a lack of planning and coordination \nby agency officials. Fee programs under this legislation would be \nestablished at fair and equitable rates. Each unit would perform an \nanalysis to consider benefits and services provided to the visitor, \ncumulative effect of fees, public policy and management objectives and \nfeasibility of fee collection. This review would serve as a business \nplan for each site so that managers could utilize scarce resources in \nthe most efficient manner.\n  The Recreation Fee Demonstration program was an effort by Congress to \nallow public land agencies to obtain funding in addition to their \nannual appropriations. This legislation will help provide resources for \nbadly needed improvement projects and ensure an enhanced experience for \nall visitors.\n  We need to guarantee our national treasures are available for \ngenerations to come. I believe that Congress, the National Park Service \nand those interested in helping our parks should cooperate on \ninitiatives to protect resources, increase visitor services and improve \nmanagement throughout the system. Working together, we can ensure that \nthese areas will remain affordable and accessible for everyone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Communities Act of 2003. This legislation is \nco-sponsored by Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, Daschle, Murray, \nCantwell, Dayton, Lieberman, Lincoln, and Feinstein.\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nCompanion legislation will be introduced in the House by Congressman \nSander Levin tomorrow.\n  I first introduced Trade Adjustment Assistance legislation in the \nlast Congress, and I was very pleased when that legislation--the \nprovisions relating to both individuals and communities--passed the \nSenate as part of the Trade Act of 2002. I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts in making \nthis happen. But I would like to thank Senator Baucus in particular for \nmaking Trade Adjustment Assistance one of his priorities last session \nand pushing on it to the very end. And I would also like to thank \nSenator Grassley for understanding the importance of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance to the ongoing trade debate, and his decision to make it \npart of the trade package that went through Congress.\n  But I also have to express my disappointment with the way the process \nended. In spite of the bi-partisan consensus that formed around Trade \nAdjustment Assistance during the negotiations last year and the efforts \nof my colleagues, I regret to say that the provisions related to \ncommunities did not make it out of conference. I can not tell you why \nthis happened. However, I can tell you that it is incredibly naive to \nignore the problems that are occurring right now across the country and \nnot understand what it means for our country's long-term economic \ninterests. Look at the newspaper and you will see that in many \ncommunities, people are pretty much out of work for good, at least when \nyou look at the jobs they had and the wages they were making. And as \nthe lay-offs have expanded, the impact the lay-offs have had on entire \ncommunities have become more pronounced. Now it is not just the \nindividuals who are struggling, but the communities in which hundreds \nor thousands of people live, all because a company or a group of \ncompanies have closed their doors for good.\n  From what I can tell from statements some of my colleagues have made \nin committee or on the floor of the Senate, this is really nothing more \nthan tough luck. This is the way markets work and you simply make do \nwith what you have. I disagree completely. From where I sit you can't \njust let individuals who have worked their whole life at a company, who \nhave played by the rules for their entire life, who have committed \ntheir entire life to keeping their communities intact, be reduced to \nlittle more than hope that something will change for the better. They \ndeserve more than that. You also can't let the communities where these \npeople live just die, because they form the foundation of what we are \nas a society. These are the networks that have lasted generations, that \nconnect us, and define who we are. I firmly believe we need to do \neverything we can for these folks and the communities where they live, \nsimply because we owe them something for what they have given us and \nour country. I believe we have a responsibility to give these \ncommunities a shot at a new future. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday does just that.\n  Let me make it clear that writing this legislation is not an abstract \nexercise. For me, this is about my friends and neighbors that I have \nknown for years. Right now, in my hometown of Silver City, NM, I have \nfolks that I grew up with, wondering what they are going to do next.\n  Over the last few years the copper mines closed, and then the \nbusinesses that supported the copper mines closed, and then the tax \nbase began to disappear, and then services started to be cut, and it \nseems to everyone like the whole community has been caught in a \ndownward spiral. In spite of what some of my colleagues might claim, \nthis is not because of lack of effort on the part of the people of \nSilver City. These people are not content with the way things are. On \nthe contrary, they are trying desperately to change direction. They \nhave ideas about where they want to go and what they need to do to make \nthings better. They have acted on these ideas to the best of their \nability. And I want to commend them for that. But right now they are \nstuck because there is no money available to get things started, to \ntake the first step so other steps can be taken afterward.\n  And this is the way it is across the country in a good many \ncommunities just like Silver City. I strongly believe this has to \nchange. We have let things stand just the way they are for far too \nlong. The status quo is not acceptable, and it is time for Congress to \nmake a serious effort to change how we manage these kinds of problems.\n  My interest in Trade Adjustment Assistance actually began in \nNovember, 1997 when Levi-Strauss announced its decision to close most \nof its plants in the United States and transfer production to other \ncountries. Levi-Strauss decided to close two plants in New Mexico one \nin Albuquerque and one in Roswell--with the Roswell facility alone \nlosing close to 600 workers. This number didn't even include the \ncontract workers and other folks that relied on Levi Strauss for their \nliving. They lost their jobs as well. 600 plus individuals would be a \nsignificant blow in any town, but in a town of 50,000 people--which is \nwhat Roswell--is with a workforce of only 25,000 people, this lay-off \nwas truly devastating. What exactly were these people going to do? \nWhere could they go to get work so they could pay their mortgage, pay \nfor health care, pay for their kids' education? Sure, some of them \ncould be re-trained through Trade Adjustment Assistance, but the \nquestion that was on everyone's mind was: retrained for what? What do \nyou re-train 600 people for when there are no other jobs available in \ntown, and no new companies coming into town?\n  The questions surrounding what happened in Roswell--actually, what \nshould have happened in Roswell if we had more effective Trade \nAdjustment Assistance policies in place--combined with other plant \nclosures across the country in towns just like Roswell, made me ask \nwhat actually could be done to help individuals and communities adapt \nto this kind of collective crisis. In cooperation with Senators Roth \nand Moynihan, who were the Chair and Ranking Member of the Finance \nCommittee at the time, I requested studies from the General Accounting \nOffice on the over-all efficacy of Trade Adjustment Assistance program. \nI also asked them to study how communities across the country had \nresponded to the changes that derive from international trade \nagreements and globalization.\n  I have to say that the answers we got back from the General \nAccounting Office were not very encouraging. To begin with, the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for individuals program suffered from \ninconsistencies, incoherence, and a general lack of accountability. \nSome states managed their programs well, but others--my home State of \nNew Mexico being one--did not. There was no Trade Adjustment Assistance \nfor Communities program at the time, but in analyzing how particular \ncommunities responded to economic crises, the General Accounting Office \nreport clearly stated that government funds available for economic \nrecovery efforts were limited and the road to real recovery was \ndifficult even when funds were available. There were no ``best \npractices'', no obvious answers, to refer to because success had been \nso limited. In most cases, there was no way out of the downward spiral \nat all.\n\n  But over time some individual lessons appeared, and interestingly \nenough, those lessons were very similar to the ones we learned in \nRoswell. Among other things, technical assistance is needed early on in \nthe process to ensure that a community-wide recovery strategy can be \ndeveloped. Funding needs to be made available to assist in strategic \nplanning. Individual and institutional differences need to be bridged \nin the community so there is a tangible collective interest in the \nstrategic plan. Short-term, medium-term, and long-term funding needs to \nbe available for communities to use as they pursue their economic \nstrategy. U.S. government agencies need to cooperate to ensure that \ntheir efforts are not duplicative or contradictory. State governments \nneed to be involved in the recovery process to encourage cooperation \nwhere there has been none before.\n  I admit that it is very difficult to make sure all these things \nhappen, especially in communities that are struggling to stay on an \neven keel. Clearly much of the burden for the activities fall on \ncommunities, because they are the ones that have to decide what is best \nfor them. And that is the way it should be. But Congress can play a \nrole in helping communities attain the\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\ngoals they have set for themselves, and I believe the bill I am \nintroducing today offers a very good start. The key components of the \nlegislation are as follows: First, the legislation establishes a Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Communities Program at the Department of \nCommerce, signaling that communities that are negatively impacted by \ntrade are deserving of a separate stream of funds to help them through \ntheir economic crisis. Ideally this program will be located at the \nEconomic Development Administration, which has the expertise and \nexperience to manage a program of this type.\n  Second, the legislation establishes a U.S. government inter-agency \nTrade Adjustment Assistance for Communities working group, the goal \nbeing to ensure that agencies work in cooperation to assist communities \nnegatively impacted by trade, integrating personnel, activities, and \nresources as they respond to existing or anticipated problems.\n  Third, the legislation provides funding for strategic planning and \ndevelopment grants for communities negatively impacted by trade. As \nwritten, there is no limit on the funds that a community can receive. \nInstead, the level of funding is determined by the individual needs of \neach community, the coherence of their strategic plan, and the \ncooperation that exists among the stakeholders applying for the grant.\n  Fourth, the legislation allows funding from programs at other \nagencies to be used in concurrence with Trade Adjustment Assistance for \nCommunities funding, and, furthermore, allows Federal funding to be \nused to fulfill most non-Federal matching requirements that exist. In \nthe past, some economic development efforts have been stopped in their \ntracks because communities don't have the matching funds necessary to \nget grants. This legislation would give communities that are now \nsuffering under serious financial constraints some initial flexibility \nin their effort to get funding.\n  Fifth, the legislation gives preference to rural communities in \nfunding guidelines, since these are the communities that have the \nfewest options available to them as they attempt to respond to trade \nrelated problems.\n  Sixth, the legislation authorizes $350 million per year for the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Communities program, essentially doubling the \nfunds that are currently available for economic adjustment in the \nUnited States. I believe this amount is consistent with the needs that \nwe see of communities across the United States.\n  Seventh, the legislation establishes a lookback to January 1998, \nallowing communities that were negatively impacted by trade and have \nyet to overcome their problems an opportunity to obtain funds and begin \ntheir recovery.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a set of new triggers for \neligibility that are designed to help not only communities that have \nbeen negatively impacted by trade, but also communities that have \nexperienced some negative impacts but want to set a new course so any \nfuture impacts will be limited. This approach is far different than \nanything that has been done before in Trade Adjustment Assistance \nlegislation--far different even than the legislation that my colleagues \nand I introduced last year--and is designed specifically to avoid the \ncriticism that Trade Adjustment Assistance is really nothing but \n``death insurance''.\n  The inclusion of the category of ``affected domestic producers'' as a \ntrigger, for example, would allow certain companies to work with their \ncommunities to create a coherent strategic plan to renovate or \nconstruct basic or advanced infrastructure, diversify the local \neconomy, attract new investment, and encourage long-term economic \nstability and global competitiveness--all this before a company is \nclosed and the entire community is affected. The inclusion of TAA for \nfirms as a trigger would allow restructuring at a firm to occur in \ntandem with restructuring in a community. The inclusion of TAA for \nworkers as a trigger would allow funds to be directed into a community \nat the initial onset of problems at a company--at the moment when lay-\noffs are first occurring--not when the problems are so far down the \nline that there is very little that can be done about it.\n  Let me say straight out that this legislation cannot be considered a \nsubstitute for a strong trade or manufacturing policy. But I do believe \nthis legislation is complementary to those policies. From where I sit, \nthere will always be individuals and communities negatively impacted by \ntrade, and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that these \nindividuals and communities are treated with the respect they deserve \nand with the strategic economic interests of our country in mind. The \neconomic ideology that suggests we just let things take their course \nand things will work out the way they are supposed to is, from my \nperspective, wrongheaded and misguided. The fact is we must look very \ncarefully at the changes that are occurring to our national economy as \na result of globalization and position ourselves to do better than we \nare now.\n  This legislation carves out an area of real need and addresses it in \na coherent, comprehensive, and innovative fashion. If enacted, it will \nhave an immediate, concrete, and important impact on communities across \nthe country. Every State in the country would benefit from the \nlegislation. It will allow communities to take charge of the future and \ncontribute to the economic welfare of the Nation. It is a practical \napproach that is designed to keep our communities intact and our \ncountry competitive and strong. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Communities Act of 2003.\n  I want to commend Senator Bingaman for introducing this bill today. \nHe has been a strong advocate of Trade Adjustment Assistance and a \nstrong voice for communities that need a helping hand facing the \nchallenges of the global economy.\n  Trade and trade-opening policies create benefits for our country. But \nthat fact should not keep us from acknowledging that the benefits of \ntrade are seldom evenly distributed. In fact, there can be losers from \ntrade, even when the economy as a whole is better off.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy said that ``those injured by . . . trade \ncompetition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the \nimpact.'' ``There is an obligation,'' he said, for the Federal \nGovernment ``to render assistance to those who suffer as a result of \nnational trade policy.''\n  That year, President Kennedy and a bipartisan majority of Congress \ncreated Trade Adjustment Assistance--a program designed to help those \nwho are displaced by trade policy to retrain and get back on their \nfeet.\n  Last year, with help of another bipartisan majority of Congress, we \npassed the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002--a historic \nexpansion of the TAA program.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities Act continues to \nbuild on this important tradition by creating a new TAA program for \ncommunities.\n  In a recent study, the General Accounting Office found that, even \nwith TAA benefits available to displaced workers, the loss of a major \nemployer can have ripple effects on the local economy.\n  In addition to the direct job losses, local economies can experience \nreduced tax revenues, reduced sales by the closed plant's supplier \nfirms and by local retailers, and rising social services costs. Until \nthey can attract well-paying new jobs, these communities can face \nextended periods of economic distress.\n  This is especially true in smaller and rural communities, such as we \nhave in Montana. These communities may not have a lot of job \nopportunities for displaced workers, even with TAA retraining. Indeed, \none of the main criticisms of the current TAS program has been that it \ndoes nothing to make sure there are jobs for workers at the end of the \nretraining process.\n  There are a number of Federal programs out there that might offer \nsome help. They are all over the map--in Commerce, Treasury, Labor, \nAgriculture, HUD and the SBA, just to name a few. But these communities \nhave no way to start, no go-to person or resource to guide them through \nthis maze of potential help. And the Federal Government doesn't make it \nany easier. There is very little coordination of response among the \nvarious agencies. Finally, even if communities can find\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nthese Federal resources, most existing programs are not tailored to the \nspecial needs of trade-impacted communities.\n  This bill tries to make Federal economic assistance work better for \ntrade-impacted distressed communities in a few simple ways.\n  It creates a single office responsible for coordinating the Federal \nresponse.\n  It creates a simple trigger process to identify potentially eligible \ncommunities and bring appropriate resources to their attention.\n  It gives communities the technical assistance they need to develop a \nstrategic plan--basically a roadmap for economic recovery. That helps \nensure that Federal resources are being used in the most coordinated \nand cost-effective way possible.\n  Finally, it makes sure that there are expertise and resources \ntailored to the special needs of trade-impacted communities.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill. I hope we will be able \nto consider it in the Finance Committee this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1111. A bill to provide suitable grazing arrangements on National \nForest System land to persons that hold a grazing permit adversely \naffected by the standards and guidelines contained in the Record of \nDecision of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment and pertaining to \nthe Willow Flycatcher and the Yosemite Toad; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nprevent unnecessary hardship for ranching families in the Sierra Nevada \nMountains.\n  This summer, restrictions imposed for the Yosemite Toad and willow \nflycatcher will force about fifteen to thirty ranchers off the land \nthat they have long used for grazing.\n  This bill requires the Forest Service to explore all the options \navailable to avoid this outcome. For example, the bill makes it easier \nfor the Forest Service to offer ranchers suitable alternative grazing \nland.\n  Besides alternative grazing arrangements, the Forest Service should \nlook at fencing, active management of the cattle, and other options. If \nnone of these alternatives are feasible, the bill provides relief for \nthe most seriously affected ranchers.\n  The bill would allow ranchers to keep using 15 parcels of land during \nthis calendar year where Yosemite Toad and willow flycatcher \nrestrictions would otherwise make grazing unworkable. For many other \nranches, where grazing and the species could coexist with some \nadjustments, environmental protections would fully remain in place.\n  I urge the Forest Service to quickly devise a long-term strategy to \npromote the coexistence of ranchers and the species. The Forest Service \nshould work proactively with the Fish and Wildlife Service to establish \na conservation plan for the species--with the goal of avoiding the need \nfor any listing of it.\n  I believe that if the regulatory agencies collect better information \non the Yosemite Toad and the willow flycatcher, we can find ways to \nprotect the species without completely shutting down long-term ranching \noperations. I am committed to expediting these long-term solutions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1112. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pharmacies to dispense medications on \nprescriptions written by private practitioners to veterans who are \ncurrently awaiting their first appointment with the Department for \nmedical care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are now nearly 200,000 American \nveterans today who are forced to wait at least 6 months for their first \nvisit with a Department of Veterans Affairs physician. Despite having \nserved their country and been promised health benefits, these veterans \nare receiving deferred and rationed health care because of chronic \nunderfunding and bureaucratic red tape. It amounts to a broken promise \nwith men and women who have served in our armed forces. To help ensure \nthat our veterans receive the care they need and have been guaranteed, \ntoday I am pleased to introduce the Veterans' Prescription Drug Reform \nAct of 2003.\n  Veterans enrolled in the VA health care program are entitled to a \nprescription drug benefit. This is an essential benefit given the \nimportance of pharmaceuticals in health care today. However, there's a \nbureaucratic catch: the benefit only applies to prescriptions written \nby a VA physician, and there are nearly 200,000 veterans who now wait 6 \nmonths or longer for their first visit with a VA physician. For those \nveterans in need of medicine and waiting months on end to see a VA \nphysician, the benefit has little value.\n  The VA has reported to Congress that, while it has no exact figure, \nit estimates that tens of thousands of the veterans now on the waiting \nlist are there primarily to access their prescription drug benefit. In \nmany of these cases, veterans have already seen a private physician and \nhave a prescription. But in order to use the VA pharmacy and receive \ntheir prescription benefit, these individuals must duplicate their \nhealth care visits and see a VA physician. This delays health care \nbenefits for far too many veterans.\n  The Veterans' Prescription Drug Reform Act of 2003 would permit \nveterans already on the waiting list to fill a prescription written by \na private physician at the VA pharmacy.\n  Specifically, the Veterans' Prescription Drug Reform Act of 2003 \nwould give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to permit \nveterans on the waiting list for their first appointment with a VA \nphysician at the date of enactment to use the VA pharmacy to fill \nprescriptions written by a private physician. It would also preserve \nthe core healthcare mission of the VA by limiting this initiative only \nto those currently waiting for their first appointment. The proposal \ncalls for a report to Congress in 1 year so that its potential \nexpansion can be evaluated.\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has told Congress that he would \nsupport such a proposal, and I look forward to working with Senator \nHarkin, who joins me in sponsoring this legislation, and my other \ncolleagues in the Senate on this common-sense approach to reducing the \nlengthy wait-lines for veterans' healthcare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to reduce \nthe health risks posed by asbestos-containing products; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \ndo what should have been done decades ago: fully ban asbestos in the \nUnited States. I am introducing the Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2003 \nto prohibit this known carcinogen from being used to manufacture \nproducts in this country. The bill also bans imports of asbestos \nproducts from other countries where asbestos is still legal. I am \npleased that Senators Baucus, Boxer, Cantwell, Dayton, Jeffords and \nLeahy are original cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  The primary purpose of the Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2003 is to \nrequire the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to ban the substance \nwithin two years. Most people think that asbestos has already been \nbanned. In fact, in 1989 EPA finalized regulations to phase out and ban \nthe substance by 1997. But in 1991, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals \noverturned EPA's ban, arguing that EPA did not ``first evaluate and \nthen reject the less burdensome alternatives'' under the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act. Unfortunately, the first Bush Administration \ndid not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. While new uses of \nasbestos were banned, existing ones were not.\n  As a result, it is still legal in 2003 to construct buildings in the \nUnited States with asbestos cement shingles and to treat them with \nasbestos roof coatings. It is still legal to construct new water \nsystems using asbestos cement pipes imported from other countries. It \nis still legal for cars and trucks to be made and serviced with \nasbestos brake pads and clutch facings.\n  Asbestos is still not banned, and as a result, we're still using it. \nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2001, businesses in this \ncountry consumed 26 million pounds of chrysotile asbestos to make \nroofing products, gaskets, friction materials and other products. Last \nmonth, my staff walked into a local home improvement store and bought \noff the shelf roofing sealants made with asbestos. In addition, we are \nstill importing asbestos products from other countries, many of which \nhave less stringent environmental and public health standards.\n  Everyone knows that asbestos is harmful. The term asbestos, like \narsenic, lead, mercury or DDT, is synonymous with poison. Asbestos may \nwell be the most regulated toxic substance that federal and state \nagencies have ever dealt with. At least eleven different Federal \nstatutes address asbestos. The EPA, Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, Mine Safety and Health Administration and \nConsumer Product Safety Commission are only some of the Federal \nagencies tasked with implementing rules to protect workers and \nconsumers from the dangers of this substance.\n  But the sheer volume of rules and regulations in place does not \nguarantee that public health and the environment are being adequately \nprotected. We have significant evidence suggesting that because \nasbestos is still not banned, we're still not safe from its dangers. \nI'd like to highlight some of this evidence for my colleagues.\n  First, workers in this country are still being exposed to dangerous \nlevels of asbestos. According to OSHA, ``An estimated 1.3 million \nemployees in construction and general industry face significant \nasbestos exposure on the job. Heaviest exposures occur in the \nconstruction industry, particularly during the removal of asbestos \nduring renovation or demolition. Employees are also likely to be \nexposed during the manufacture of asbestos products, such as textiles, \nfriction products, insulation, and other building materials, and during \nautomotive brake and clutch repair work.''\n  It is important to remember that there is no known safe threshold \nlevel of asbestos exposure. OSHA's permissible exposure limit of 0.1 \nfibers per cubic centimeter is based on technical measurement \nlimitations. OSHA's limit assumes that workers exposed to this \nconcentration have a lifetime exposure risk of 3 to 5 in 1,000 for \ncancer and 2 in 1,000 for asbestosis. This is a very high risk compared \nto the cancer risk levels that are considered acceptable for some \nenvironmental cleanups.\n  The extent to which workers are exposed to dangerous levels of \nasbestos is especially troublesome when one considers the frequency \nwith which OSHA's standards are violated. On July 31, 2001, I chaired a \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing on asbestos and \nworkplace safety. At the hearing I learned from OSHA that since 1995, \nthe agency had cited employers for violations of its asbestos standards \n15,691 times. This is astounding given the known dangers of asbestos \nand the high risks of disease even when OSHA's exposure limit is being \nmet.\n  As follow-up to the hearing, I asked OSHA to provide more information \nabout asbestos-related violations. In an October 17, 2001 letter to me, \nMr. John Henshaw, Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and \nHealth, wrote that between fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 2001, OSHA \nconducted a total of 190,971 inspections generating a total of 427,786 \nviolations. Of these, 3,000 inspections and 15,691 violations involved \nasbestos. According to Mr. Henshaw, about 2 percent of inspections and \n4 percent of violations were asbestos-related. In his letter to me, Mr. \nHenshaw wrote, ``OSHA does not consider any level to be an acceptable \nnoncompliance level. We strive for 100 percent compliance.'' Despite \nOSHA's best intentions, workers are still being exposed to dangerous \nlevels of asbestos.\n  It is also important to consider that the vast majority of workplaces \nwhere asbestos exposure occurs, such as construction jobs and auto \nrepair shops, are not regularly inspected by OSHA. The Administration \nconducts inspections only in response to complaints or as a result of \nreferrals from law enforcement or the media. Many more violations of \nthe standard occur in the real world than are actually recorded by \nregulators. Many employees likely do not contact OSHA about potential \nasbestos exposure on the job because they think asbestos has been \nbanned long ago and is no longer a problem.\n  But asbestos in the workplace is clearly still a problem. Recent news \ninvestigations provide more evidence that workers are being exposed to \ndangerous levels of this mineral. According to an article in the \nSeattle Post-Intelligencer on November 16, 2000, ``During the past \nthree months, the P-I collected samples of dust from floors, work areas \nand tool bins in 31 brake-repair garages in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, \nDenver, Richmond, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Asbestos, almost \nexclusively chrysotile, which has been used for decades in brakes, was \ndetected in 21 of the locations. The amount of asbestos in the dust \nranged from 2.26 percent to 63.8 percent.''\n\n  When dust with these concentrations of asbestos in them is disturbed, \nairborne concentrations of asbestos occur that are well above OSHA's \npermissible exposure limit of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter. Under \ncurrent OSHA regulations, if airborne asbestos concentrations exceed \nthis level, employers must conduct air monitoring, take measures to \nreduce asbestos emissions, post warning signs and record concentrations \nof airborne asbestos. Workers are supposed to wear respirators and \nprotective clothing and are required to undergo long term medical \nmonitoring.\n  Now I recognize that much of the exposure to asbestos in the \nworkplace comes from asbestos products installed years, and in many \ncases, decades ago. By one estimate, about 30 million tons of asbestos \nwas used in this country between 1900 and 1980. Asbestos in place, in \nour buildings, schools and homes, will be with us for decades to come.\n  But given the known dangers of this mineral, why are we still using \nit? Why are we still adding it to products on purpose when there are \nperfectly acceptable substitutes? In retrospect, it is tragic that \nasbestos was so widely used during the 20th century, for the\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\neconomic and public health impacts have been disastrous. One very \nimportant step in overcoming the problems caused by asbestos is to stop \nadding to the problem--however incrementally--by continuing to use this \ndangerous mineral in products on purpose.\n  I'd like to point out some additional evidence supporting the need to \nban asbestos in the United States and to raise awareness about this \nissue. Most of my colleagues are familiar with the tragedy in Libby, \nMT, where hundreds of workers and their families suffer from asbestos-\nrelated diseases caused by exposure to asbestos-tainted vermiculite.\n  For decades, the W.R. Grace mine in Libby supplied about 80 percent \nof the vermiculite used in this country. W.R. Grace very successfully \nmarketed its product, without any warning labels, even though the \ncompany was well aware its product was contaminated with this known \ncarcinogen. Asbestos-contaminated ore was shipped to more than 300 \nsites around the country for processing and use in industrial and \nconsumer products. According to the EPA, 14 of these sites are so \ncontaminated with asbestos that they still need to be cleaned up, even \nthough the Libby mine closed in 1990. While this is a problem that came \nfrom a small mining town in Montana, the ramifications and consequences \nare clearly national in scope.\n  In addition, vermiculite from Libby is still around and is still a \nthreat to public health. It is estimated that tens of millions of \nhomes, schools and businesses contain insulation made with Libby \nvermiculite, known as Zonolite. A recent study conducted for EPA, \nentitled Asbestos Exposure Assessment for Vermiculite Attic Insulation, \nfound that Zonolite in homes today contains up to 2 percent asbestos. \nThis study included tests on Zonolite insulation from Seattle Public \nUtilities and from a home in Washington State. It found that when this \ninsulation was disturbed, airborne concentrations of 3.3 asbestos \nfibers per cubic centimeters were measured. In other words, handling \nZonolite asbestos can cause levels of asbestos in the air that \nsignificantly exceed OSHA's exposure limit for workers. Even more \ntroubling, perhaps, the study found ``vermiculite that tests non-detect \nfor asbestos by bulk analysis can still generate airborne asbestos \nconcentrations when disturbed.'' When vermiculite without significant \namounts of asbestos in bulk was disturbed, concentrations of asbestos \nin the air up to 0.5 fibers per cubic centimeters were detected. This \nmeans that even vermiculite with only trace amounts of asbestos in bulk \ncan generate unhealthy concentrations of asbestos in the air.\n  Yesterday EPA launched a national consumer education campaign warning \npeople not to disturb Zonolite attic insulation if they have it in \ntheir homes. The agency also warned people not to let their children \nplay in attics with vermiculite for fear of asbestos exposure. EPA has \ndeveloped a consumer education brochure and has created an asbestos \nhotline for people to call for more information. The Agency for Toxic \nSubstances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational \nSafety and Health have joined EPA in this education effort by creating \nmaterials to educate consumers and workers about the dangers of \nasbestos-contaminated vermiculite.\n  While we need to ensure that we are no longer adding asbestos to our \nproducts on purpose, we also need to ensure that asbestos in harmful \nconcentrations isn't ending up in our consumer products by accident. I \nam glad EPA, ATSDR and NIOSH are now proactively reaching out to \nconsumers and workers to warn them to stay away from vermiculite attic \ninsulation. This is an important first step in dealing with just one \naspect of the legacy created by W.R. Grace in Libby.\n  There is another important reason to ban asbestos that I would like \nto share with my colleagues. As I mentioned previously, the United \nStates is still importing products that contain asbestos. \nUnfortunately, we do not have precise statistics on which products \ncoming into this country contain the deadly mineral. The Department of \nCommerce's import database does not distinguish between asbestos-\ncontaining products and products containing asbestos substitutes. \nAccording to the U.S. International Trade Commission, in 2002 this \ncountry imported more than 44,000 tons of asbestos-cement products, \nsome of which may have contained cellulose instead of asbestos.\n  With increased globalization and international trade, U.S. imports of \nasbestos containing consumer and industrial products will continue to \nrise--unless we prohibit these products from crossing our borders in \nthe first place.\n  Although we do not have accurate numbers for the extent to which \nasbestos products are flowing across our borders, we do know that \nasbestos is being heavily marketed to developing countries. According \nto an August 2, 1999 USA Today article, ``As asbestos demand has \nplummeted in the industrialized world the past 25 years, it has soared \nin many developing nations and formerly communist countries. Its use in \nthese countries is largely unregulated, haphazard and deadly.''\n  A more recent editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal \ncompares the asbestos industry to the tobacco industry. The February \n20, 2001 article by Doctors Joseph LaDou, Philip Landrigan, John C. \nBailar III, Vito Foa and Arthur Frank reads:\n  ``The commercial tactics of the asbestos industry are very similar to \nthose of the tobacco industry. In the absence of international \nsanctions, losses resulting from reduced cigarette consumption in the \ndeveloped countries are offset by heavy selling to developing nations. \nIn a similar fashion, the developed world has responded to the asbestos \nhealth catastrophe with a progressive ban on the use of asbestos. In \nresponse, the asbestos industry is progressively transferring its \ncommercial activities and the health hazards to the developing \ncountries.''\n  Banning asbestos in the United States sends an important message to \nthe rest of the world. The asbestos industry will no longer be able to \njustify its marketing to developing countries by pointing out that \nasbestos is still legal in the U.S., and therefore, it must be safe. \nMore than 30 countries have already banned asbestos, and it is time for \nthis country to follow suit. It is our moral responsibility as the \nworld's strongest economy, the most powerful Nation and a leader in \nenvironmental protection and public health to ban this harmful \nsubstance.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Ban Asbestos in America Act. \nThe legislation has five main parts. First, this bill protects public \nhealth by doing what the EPA tried to do 14 years ago: ban asbestos in \nthe United States. The legislation requires EPA to ban it within two \nyears of passage of the Act. As under the regulations EPA finalized in \n1989, companies may file for an exemption to the ban if there is no \nsubstitute material available.\n  Second, the bill requires EPA to convene a Blue Ribbon Panel on \nasbestos policy and to have the National Academy of Sciences conduct an \nasbestos study. In response to the 2001 EPA Inspector General's report \non Libby, Montana, the EPA promised to convene a Blue Ribbon Panel on \nasbestos and non-regulated fibers. But instead of convening a high \nlevel panel, EPA hired a non-profit organization, the Global \nEnvironment and Technology Foundation, to develop an asbestos policies \nfocus group. Just yesterday EPA released GETF's Asbestos Strategies \nReport. I am very pleased that the Report recommends several aspects of \nthe Ban Asbestos in America Act, including that Congress pass \nlegislation to ban asbestos.\n  While the recommendations are certainly helpful in providing guidance \nto EPA, Congress and other federal agencies on the next steps to \naddress asbestos, the GETF report does not replace a full fledged Blue \nRibbon Panel. The Ban Asbestos in America Act codifies creation of a \nBlue Ribbon Panel as EPA first committed to in 2001. The panel will \ninclude participation from the Department of Labor and the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. It will review the current laws and rules in \nplace to protect workers and consumers, and make recommendations for \nimproving protections within 2 years of passage of the Act.\n  In addition, the bill calls for EPA to have the NAS conduct a study \non the current state of the science relating to the human health \neffects of exposure to asbestos and other durable fibers. The NAS study \nshall also include recommendations for a uniform system of asbestos \nexposure standards and for a uniform system to create protocols to\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\ndetect and measure asbestos. As I mentioned previously, asbestos is \nregulated under multiple statutes. There are different standards within \nEPA and across Federal agencies, and agencies rely on different \nprotocols to identify the substance. The NAS shall be required to \nsubmit the study to EPA, other federal agencies and Congress within 18 \nmonths of passage of the Act.\n  Third, the legislation requires a survey to determine which products \ncontain asbestos, either on purpose or as a contaminant. EPA will be \nrequired to conduct this review with input from the Department of \nLabor, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the International \nTrade Commission.\n  The bill directs the EPA to conduct a survey on the status of \nasbestos-containing products, such as roofing materials, brake pads and \ngaskets, which contain asbestos on purpose. EPA must also study \ncontaminant-asbestos products, such as some insulation and \nhorticultural products, which contain asbestos as a contaminant of \nanother substance. The study will examine how people use these products \nand the extent to which people are exposed to harmful levels of \nasbestos. The study must be finalized within 18 months to inform the \nBlue Ribbon Panel and the education campaign.\n  Fourth, based on the results of the study, EPA shall conduct a public \neducation campaign to increase awareness of the dangers posed by \nasbestos-containing products and contaminant-asbestos products, \nincluding those in homes and workplaces. The agency shall give priority \nto those products posing the greatest risk, as determined by the study \nrequired by the bill. The education campaign must be conducted within 2 \nyears of passage of the bill.\n  EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall still be \nrequired to conduct a national education campaign about vermiculite \ninsulation within 6 months of passage of the Act. As many as 35 million \nhomes and businesses may contain asbestos-contaminated insulation made \nwith vermiculite from Libby. This requirement is still in the bill \ndespite EPA's recent announcement of an education campaign about \nvermiculite attic insulation. This will ensure EPA's long-term \ncommitment to educating the public.\n  Finally, the Ban Asbestos in America Act increases the federal \ncommitment to finding new treatments for the terrible diseases caused \nby asbestos. At least 2,000 people per year die from mesothelioma, a \ndeadly cancer of the lining of the lungs and internal organs caused by \nexposure to asbestos. The legislation would direct the head of NIH to \n``expand, intensify and coordinate programs for the conduct and support \nof research on diseases caused by exposure to asbestos.'' The Centers \nfor Disease Control would be required to create a National Mesothelioma \nRegistry to improve tracking of the disease, which in many cases goes \nundiagnosed and thus unrecorded. In addition, the bill creates 10 \nmesothelioma treatment centers around the country to improve treatments \nfor and awareness of this fatal cancer.\n  Our hope is that by continuing to work together, we will build \nsupport for the Ban Asbestos in America Act. If we can get this \nlegislation passed, fewer people will be exposed to asbestos, fewer \npeople will contract asbestos diseases in the first place, and those \nwho already have asbestos diseases will receive treatments to prolong \nand improve quality of life. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  In the meantime, we should do all we can to ensure that the rules in \nplace to protect workers, consumers and schoolchildren from asbestos \nare followed and are strengthened if necessary. We also need to make \nsure that Federal agencies are given adequate resources to fully \nimplement Congress' many mandates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Ban Asbestos in America \nAct of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ban Asbestos in America Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance;\n       (2) there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos;\n       (3)(A) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the \n     example of asbestos was used to justify the need for \n     comprehensive legislation on toxic substances; and\n       (B) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);\n       (4) in 1989, the Administrator promulgated final \n     regulations under title II of the Toxic Substances Control \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) to phase out asbestos in \n     consumer products by 1997;\n       (5) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th \n     Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the \n     Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court;\n       (6) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were \n     banned, asbestos is still being used in some consumer and \n     industrial products in the United States;\n       (7) the United States Geological Survey has determined that \n     in 2000, companies in the United States consumed 15,000 \n     metric tons of chrysotile asbestos, of which approximately 62 \n     percent was consumed in roofing products, 22 percent in \n     gaskets, 12 percent in friction products, and 4 percent in \n     other products;\n       (8) available evidence suggests that--\n       (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products \n     may be increasing; and\n       (B) some of those products are imported from foreign \n     countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;\n       (9) many people in the United States incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (10) the Department of Commerce estimates that in 2000, the \n     United States imported 51,483 metric tons of asbestos-cement \n     products;\n       (11) banning asbestos from being used in or imported into \n     the United States will provide certainty to manufacturers, \n     builders, environmental remediation firms, workers, and \n     consumers that after a specific date, asbestos will not be \n     added to new construction and manufacturing materials used in \n     this country;\n       (12) asbestos has been banned in Argentina, Australia, \n     Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \n     Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \n     Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi \n     Arabia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and \n     the United Kingdom;\n       (13) asbestos will be banned throughout the European Union \n     in 2005;\n       (14) in 2000, the World Trade Organization upheld the right \n     of France to ban asbestos, with the United States Trade \n     Representative filing a brief in support of the right of \n     France to ban asbestos;\n       (15) the 1999 brief by the United States Trade \n     Representative stated, ``In the view of the United States, \n     chrysotile asbestos is a toxic material that presents a \n     serious risk to human health.'';\n       (16) people in the United States have been exposed to \n     harmful levels of asbestos as a contaminant of other \n     minerals;\n       (17) in the town of Libby, Montana, workers and residents \n     have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos for \n     generations because of mining operations at the W.R. Grace \n     vermiculite mine located in that town;\n       (18) the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n     found that over a 20-year period, ``mortality in Libby \n     resulting from asbestosis was approximately 40 to 80 times \n     higher than expected. Mesothelioma mortality was also \n     elevated.'';\n       (19)(A) in response to this crisis, in January 2002, the \n     Governor of Montana requested that the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency designate Libby as a \n     Superfund site; and\n       (B) on October 23, 2002, the Administrator placed Libby on \n     the National Priorities List;\n       (20)(A) vermiculite from Libby was shipped for processing \n     to 42 States; and\n       (B) Federal agencies are investigating potential harmful \n     exposures to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite at sites \n     throughout the United States;\n       (21) the Administrator has identified 14 sites that have \n     dangerous levels of asbestos-tainted vermiculite and require \n     cleanup efforts; and\n       (22) although it is impracticable to eliminate exposure to \n     asbestos entirely because asbestos is a naturally occurring \n     mineral in the environment and occurs in several deposits \n     throughout the United States, Congress needs to do more to \n     protect the public from exposure to asbestos and Congress has \n     the power to prohibit the continued, intentional use of \n     asbestos in consumer products.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \ndirect the Great Lakes National Program Office of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to develop, implement, monitor, and report on a \nseries of indicators of water quality and related environmental factors \nin the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my colleagues Senators DeWine and Voinovich \nof Ohio, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, and I are pleased to introduce \nthe Great Lakes Water Quality Indicators and Monitoring Act. This bill \nwill provide science-based assessments of the health of the Great Lakes \nand whether restoration projects are working. The bill directs the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to develop indicators of Great Lakes \nwater quality and related environmental factors and a comprehensive \nnetwork to monitor those indicators.\n  The Great Lakes contain almost 20 percent of the world's fresh water. \nMillions of people rely on the lakes for drinking water, for economic \nlivelihoods such as fishing and shipping, and for recreational \nopportunities, including swimming and boating. But the Great Lakes have \nsuffered from decades of toxic discharges, urban and agricultural \nrunoff, and other environmental challenges. We've made some progress in \nimproving water quality, but we know we have a long way to go.\n  The stewards of the lakes at the Federal, State, and local levels use \na variety of methods to determine the health of the Great Lakes and \nwhether they are improving. For example, EPA and the Fish and Wildlife \nService monitor the accumulation of chemicals in Great Lakes fish. The \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration detects changes in the \necosystem from space-based satellites and waterborne buoys. The \nGeological Survey samples stream flow and quality, and the states \ninspect for compliance with water quality standards.\n  But these efforts to collect scientific data are largely voluntary \nand suffer from a lack of funding and coordination. They use \ninconsistent methods that often produce incompatible results.\n  This week, members of the Great Lakes Task Force released a General \nAccounting Office report on Great Lakes environmental programs. GAO \nlooked at almost 200 Federal and State programs and found that a lack \nof coordination, poorly defined goals, and insufficient data make it \ndifficult to evaluate the success of these programs. GAO found that \nthere are no data collected regularly throughout the Great Lakes, and \nthat the existing data are inadequate to determine whether water \nquality and other environmental conditions are improving.\n  In 1990, I authored the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act, which \nstrengthened the water quality standards in the Great Lakes region. \nThis year, Congress passed the Great Lakes Legacy Act, to speed the \ncleanup of contaminated bottom sediment. But we haven't established a \nway to evaluate the impact of these measures.\n  A restoration program is only as good as its ability to demonstrate \nresults. To show results, we need science-based indicators of water \nquality and related environmental factors, and we need to monitor those \nindicators regularly throughout the ecosystem.\n  GAO recommends that EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office lead an \neffort to develop indicators and a monitoring network. Our bill gives \nthat office the mandate to work with other federal agencies and Canada \nto identify and measure water quality and other environmental factors \non a regular basis. The initial set of data collected through this \nnetwork will serve as a benchmark against which to measure future \nimprovements. Those measurements will help us make decisions on how to \nsteer future restoration efforts. With a clear picture of how the Great \nLakes are changing, we can change course when needed and spend public \nfunds on the most pressing demands.\n  This bill serves a second purpose--it provides EPA with dedicated \nfunding to make sure that data collection can begin in a timely manner \nand be carried out consistently and comprehensively as long as the \nGreat Lakes are in need.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and help speed its \npassage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Water Quality \n     Indicators and Monitoring Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are no comprehensive, regularly-collected data \n     that reveal whether the water quality or related \n     environmental factors of the Great Lakes have improved as a \n     result of efforts to remediate and protect the Great Lakes;\n       (2) that lack of data was confirmed in May 2003 in a report \n     by the General Accounting Office that concluded that existing \n     data were inadequate to assess the overall progress of \n     restoration efforts in the Great Lakes; and\n       (3) without those data, it is impossible to determine \n     whether--\n       (A) progress is being made toward achieving the goals \n     contained in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between \n     the United States and Canada; or\n       (B) Federal and State water quality standards and \n     remediation programs are effective.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide a definition of a prevailing party for \nFederal fee-shifting statutes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nSettlement Encouragement and Fairness Act of 2003. This bill provides \nthat when plaintiffs bring a lawsuit that acts as a catalyst for a \nchange in position by the opposing party, they will be considered the \n``prevailing party'' for purposes of recovering attorneys' fees under \nFederal law. The bill will help ensure that people who are the victims \nof civil rights, environmental and worker rights' abuses can obtain \nlegal representation to enforce their rights.\n  Over the course of our history, Congress has often enacted laws \nencouraging private litigants to implement public policy through our \ncourt system. An integral part of many such laws are provisions that \nhelp individuals obtain adequate legal representation by providing that \nthe defendants will pay the plaintiffs' attorneys fees in cases were \nthe plaintiff prevails. In laws involving public accommodations, \nhousing, labor, disabilities, age discrimination, violence against \nwomen, voting rights, pollution and others, Congress has acted over and \nover again to empower private litigants in their pursuit of justice. \nPresently, there are over two hundred statutory fee-shifting provisions \nthat allow for some sort of payment of attorneys' fees to a prevailing \nplaintiff.\n  Until 2001, in interpreting these fee-shifting statutes in cases \nwhere a settlement was reached before trial, nine circuit courts of \nappeals embraced the ``catalyst theory'' to determine whether \nattorneys' fees could be obtained. The catalyst theory required the \npayment of fees where the lawsuit caused a change in the position or \nconduct of the defendant. Only one circuit court, the Fourth Circuit, \napplied a more narrow definition of prevailing party, requiring a \njudgment or a court approved settlement in order for a plaintiff to \nobtain attorneys' fees.\n  In Buckhannon Board of Care & Home Inc. v. West Virginia Department \nof Health and Human Services (2001), a case arising out of the Fourth \nCircuit, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that \nplaintiffs may recover attorneys' fees from defendants only if they \nhave been awarded relief by a court, not if they prevailed through a \nvoluntary change in the defendant's behavior or a private settlement. \nThe Buckhannon ruling eliminated the catalyst theory for all fee \nshifting statutes in federal law.\n  The bill I introduce today restores the catalyst theory that the vast \nmajority of courts had approved prior to the Buckhannon decision as a \nbasis for seeking attorneys fees under Federal fee shifting statutes. \nIt provides a new definition of ``prevailing party'' for all such \nstatutes to encompass the common situation where defendants alter their \nconduct after a lawsuit has commenced but without waiting for a court \norder requiring them to do so. This critical change in the definition \nof ``prevailing party'' will allow attorneys representing clients who \ncannot otherwise afford to hire a lawyer to recover their costs and to \nbe paid a reasonable rate for their work.\n\n  The Buckhannon case itself illustrates the need for this legislation. \nBuckhannon Board and Care Home in West Virginia, an operator of \nassisted living residences, failed a state inspection because some \nresidents were incapable of ``self-preservation'' as defined by state \nlaw. After receiving orders to close its facilities, Buckhannon sued \nthe state seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the ``self-\npreservation'' requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. While the lawsuit was pending but \nbefore the court ruled, the state legislature eliminated the ``self-\npreservation'' requirement.\n  Imagine how the plaintiffs felt when they learned that their lawsuit \nhad forced a change in the law not only for their own case but also for \nall of the other individuals who had been subject to the improper self-\npreservation doctrine. If ever there was a complete and total victory \ncaused by litigation, this was it. But, as Casey Stengall once said, \n``It ain't over 'til it's over.'' Once the state legislature changed \nthe law, the District Court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the \ncase as moot and denied Buckhannon's request for attorneys' fees. The \ncourt ruled that the legislative action did not amount to a judicially \nrequired change in position that would permit Buckhannon to be \nconsidered a ``prevailing party'' in the case. On appeal, the Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit and then the U.S. Supreme Court denied \nattorneys' fees for the plaintiffs, ruling that because the change in \nthe defendants' conduct was voluntary rather than ordered by the court, \nBuckhannon was not a prevailing party.\n  I believe the narrow definition of ``prevailing party'' endorsed by \nthe Buckhannon decision will result in many injustices going \nunchallenged. Indeed, in calculating whether to take a case, an \nattorney for a plaintiff will have to consider not only the chances of \nlosing, but the chances of winning too easily. If businesses or \nindividuals are able to engage in egregious conduct, refuse to change \ntheir behavior without a lawsuit being filed against them, and then \navoid paying attorneys' fees by changing their conduct on the eve of \ntrial, the effect will be that\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nsome lawyers will decide they cannot afford to take a case even if the \nclaims are very strong.\n  Imagine a case involving a legitimate claim of housing discrimination \nwhere, after many months, perhaps even years of work, as the attorney \nwho labored for the plaintiff prepares into the evening for opening \nstatements, the attorney learns that the defendant has admitted its \nwrongful conduct and offered substantial compensation and a promise to \nchange its practices. This offer came about only because of the \nspotlight the lawsuit put on the defendant and the possibility of a \nlarge jury verdict. This would be a complete victory for the plaintiff, \nbut under Buckhannon, the attorney who labored for years to bring about \nthis result may not be paid. Later, if the same defendant returns to \ndiscriminatory practices, the next plaintiff might very well not be \nable to find competent counsel who will take the case.\n  Ironically, the failure to correct the Buckhannon decision could lead \nto plaintiffs' attorneys dragging out law suits far beyond a point in \ntime where the parties could reach a fair settlement, in order to \ninsure that they meet the Buckhannon definition of ``prevailing \nparty.'' This will increase the costs of litigation and discourage \nsettlement. Simply put, Buckhannon creates unnatural tensions between \nattorneys and clients and may even push attorneys to not act in the \nbest interest of their clients.\n  Certainly we can do better. Congress has passed important laws to \nprotect the public in the work place and in our communities; we must \nensure that these laws can be enforced, when necessary, in court. The \nSettlement Encouragement and Fairness Act of 2003 will help insure that \nall our citizens have the ability to meaningfully challenge injustice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 1118. A bill to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage \nPartnership in the States of Vermont and New York, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the \nChamplain Valley National Heritage Act of 2003. I am joined by Senator \nLeahy and Senators Schumer and Clinton of New York. This bill will \nestablish a National Heritage Partnership within the Champlain Valley. \nPassage of this bill will culminate a process to enhance the incredible \ncultural resources of the Champlain Valley.\n  The Champlain Valley of Vermont and New York has one of the richest \nand most intact collections of historic resources in the United States. \nFort Ticonderoga still stands where it has for centuries, at the scene \nof numerous battles critical to the birth of our Nation. Revolutionary \ngunboats have recently been found fully intact on the bottom of Lake \nChamplain. Our cemeteries are the permanent resting place for great \nexplorers, soldiers and sailors. The United States and Canada would not \nexist today but for events that occurred in this region.\n  We in Vermont and New York take great pride in our history. We \npreserve it, honor it and show it off to visitors from around the \nworld. These visitors are also very important to our economy. Tourism \nis among the most important industries in this region and has much \npotential for growth.\n  The Champlain Valley Heritage Partnership will bring together more \nthan one hundred local groups working to preserve and promote our \nheritage. Up to $2 million a year will be made available from the \nNational Park Service through the Lake Champlain Basin Program to \nsupport local efforts to preserve and interpret our heritage and \npresent it to the world. Most of the funding will be given to small \ncommunities to help preserve their heritage and develop economic \nopportunities.\n  This project has taken many years for me to bring to the point of \nintroducing legislation. This has been time well spent working at the \ngrass-roots level to develop a framework to direct federal resources to \nwhere it will do the most good. I am confident that we have found the \nbest model. This will be a true partnership that supports each member \nbut does not impose any new federal requirements.\n  The Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership will preserve our \nhistoric resources, interpret and teach about the events that shaped \nour nation and will be an engine for economic growth. I am hopeful that \nthis bill, which was considered by the Senate last year, will become \nlaw during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Champlain Valley National \n     Heritage Partnership Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Champlain Valley and its extensive cultural and \n     natural resources have played a significant role in the \n     history of the United States and the individual States of \n     Vermont and New York;\n       (2) archaeological evidence indicates that the Champlain \n     Valley has been inhabited by humans since the last retreat of \n     the glaciers, with the Native Americans living in the area at \n     the time of European discovery being primarily of Iroquois \n     and Algonquin descent;\n       (3) the linked waterways of the Champlain Valley, including \n     the Richelieu River in Canada, played a unique and \n     significant role in the establishment and development of the \n     United States and Canada through several distinct eras, \n     including--\n       (A) the era of European exploration, during which Samuel de \n     Champlain and other explorers used the waterways as a means \n     of access through the wilderness;\n       (B) the era of military campaigns, including highly \n     significant military campaigns of the French and Indian War, \n     the American Revolution, and the War of 1812; and\n       (C) the era of maritime commerce, during which canals \n     boats, schooners, and steamships formed the backbone of \n     commercial transportation for the region;\n       (4) those unique and significant eras are best described by \n     the theme ``The Making of Nations and Corridors of \n     Commerce'';\n       (5) the artifacts and structures associated with those eras \n     are unusually well-preserved;\n       (6) the Champlain Valley is recognized as having one of the \n     richest collections of historical resources in North America;\n       (7) the history and cultural heritage of the Champlain \n     Valley are shared with Canada and the Province of Quebec;\n       (8) there are benefits in celebrating and promoting this \n     mutual heritage;\n       (9) tourism is among the most important industries in the \n     Champlain Valley, and heritage tourism in particular plays a \n     significant role in the economy of the Champlain Valley;\n       (10) it is important to enhance heritage tourism in the \n     Champlain Valley while ensuring that increased visitation \n     will not impair the historical and cultural resources of the \n     region;\n       (11) according to the 1999 report of the National Park \n     Service entitled ``Champlain Valley Heritage Corridor \n     Project'', ``the Champlain Valley contains resources and \n     represents a theme `The Making of Nations and Corridors of \n     Commerce', that is of outstanding importance in U.S. \n     history''; and\n       (12) it is in the interest of the United States to preserve \n     and interpret the historical and cultural resources of the \n     Champlain Valley for the education and benefit of present and \n     future generations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage \n     Partnership in the States of Vermont and New York to \n     recognize the importance of the historical, cultural, and \n     recreational resources of the Champlain Valley region to the \n     United States;\n       (2) to assist the State of Vermont and New York, including \n     units of local government and nongovernmental organizations \n     in the States, in preserving, protecting, and interpreting \n     those resources for the benefit of the people of the United \n     States;\n       (3) to use those resources and the theme ``The Making of \n     Nations and Corridors of Commerce'' to--\n       (A) revitalize the economy of communities in the Champlain \n     Valley; and\n       (B) generate and sustain increased levels of tourism in the \n     Champlain Valley;\n       (4) to encourage--\n       (A) partnerships among State and local governments and \n     nongovernmental organizations in the United States; and\n       (B) collaboration with Canada and the Province of Quebec \n     to--\n       (i) interpret and promote the history of the waterways of \n     the Champlain Valley region;\n       (ii) form stronger bonds between the United States and \n     Canada; and\n       (iii) promote the international aspects of the Champlain \n     Valley region; and\n       (5) to provide financial and technical assistance for the \n     purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my Senate \ncolleagues from Vermont and New York as we reintroduce the Lake \nChamplain Heritage Act of 2003. Last year, we took a significant step \nin helping all Americans better appreciate Lake Champlain with the \npassage of Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lake Champlain Basin Program Act. \nToday, we reaffirm our commitment to the continuing preservation of \nLake Champlain's important historic sites and artifacts.\n  The role of Lake Champlain cannot be overlooked. From the earliest \nhuman habitation 10,000 years ago, to the Revolutionary War and the \nconduct of trade in the 19th and 20th centuries, this 120-mile-long \nbasin has played a pivotal role in the Course of American history.\n  It was on Lake Champlain that Benedict Arnold's motley group of 15 \nAmerican ships engaged a much larger and far superior British fleet in \nthe Battle at Valcour Island. While the battle ended in a loss for the \nAmericans, it successfully delayed the British fleet and became known \nas one of the most crucial engagements of the American Revolution.\n  This act is intended to promote and preserve these centuries of \nstruggle in the Lake Champlain Valley. It will advance the cultural \nheritage goals of ``Opportunities for Action,'' a comprehensive \npollution prevention, control, and restoration plan developed by the \nLake Champlain Basin Program. And it will also promote such things as \nlocally planned and managed heritage networks and a management strategy \nfor the lake's underwater cultural resources. With the 400th \nanniversary of Samuel De Champlain's arrival in the valley coming up in \n2009, this bill could not be more needed.\n  Vermonters and New Yorkers have a serious responsibility to preserve \nthe historical and cultural heritage of the Lake Champlain Valley for \nfuture generations. Local communities on both sides of the lake have \nhelped us develop a bold vision to enhance the conservation, \ninterpretation, and enjoyment of our shared history. We can help \nrevitalize local economies, promote heritage tourism, and improve the \nvalley's cultural legacy by making additional resources available to \ncommunities and organizations through the Lake Champlain Basin Program.\n  It is with great pride that I stand here today with my colleagues \nfrom\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\nVermont and New York to reassert our partnership for Champlain Valley \nNational Heritage Act and continue our cooperative effort to conserve, \ninterpret, and honor our common heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1119. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe eligibility of certain expenses for the low-income housing credit; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing \nlegislation that will improve the effectiveness of one of the most \nsuccessful programs we have to help Americans get affordable housing, \nthe Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. I am proud to be joined in this \neffort by my esteemed colleagues, Senators Hatch and Jeffords.\n  The need for affordable housing is as great today as ever. The \ngenerally accepted definition of affordability is for a household to \npay no more than 30 percent of annual income on housing. Today, twelve \nmillion renter and homeowner households pay more than 50 percent toward \nhousing costs. In fact, nowhere in the country can a family with one \nminimum wage worker afford the rent on a two-bedroom apartment.\n  The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit was created in 1986 to attract \nprivate sector capital to the affordable housing market. It has been \nthe major engine for financing the production of low-income multi-\nfamily housing. The program offers developers and investors in \naffordable housing credit against their federal income tax in return \nfor their investment. Since its inception, the Low-Income Housing Tax \nCredit has assisted in the development and availability of roughly \n850,000 new and rehabilitated units of affordable housing.\n  In the fall of 2000, the Internal Revenue Service isssued its first \nguidance in the program's 16-year history. That guidance was issued in \nthe form of several technical advice memoranda, or TAMs, and specified \nwhich development costs will be eligible and ineligible for the credit, \nknown as eligible basis.\n  TAMs are not official guidance, reviewed by the Treasury Department, \nbut instead, are IRS legal opinions providing direction to IRS agents \nconducting audits. They are not citable in court proceedings because \nthey are not official guidance. In the absence of official guidance, \nTAMs could be taken as the official government position. In fact, that \nis exactly what is happening.\n  The problem is that the IRS's position is contrary to common industry \npractice, and eliminates many reasonable, legitimate and necessary \ncosts from the tax credit. This has caused uncertainty among investors \nas to whether the credits for which they have paid, will be realized. \nMoreover, these guidelines could adversely affect the ability of States \nto target affordable housing to those who need it the most.\n  It is important to understand, this legislation will not increase the \npool of low-income housing tax credits. The Internal Revenue Code sets \nthe maximum amount of credits that States may allocate to developers of \naffordable housing properties. Thanks to legislation that we enacted in \n2000, the amount available to each State has increased from $1.50 to \n$1.75 times the State's population. That 40 percent increase is \nexpected to produce about 30,000 more units a year. Since the unmet \ndemand for affordable housing is many times greater than what can be \nbuilt with the help of the credit, our legislation should not affect \nrevenues. In fact, the only way for this legislation to have a revenue \nimpact is if the legislation makes it easier for the states to use the \ncredits we intend for them to have under present law.\n\n  What this legislation does do, however, is very important. To \nunderstand its importance, it may be useful to have a little background \non how the low-income housing tax credit works.\n  In economic terms, the credit is equity financing which replaces a \nportion of debt that would otherwise be necessary to finance a \nproperty. By replacing debt, credits work to reduce interest costs. \nThis allows a property owner to offer lower rents than otherwise would \nbe the case.\n  The most unique feature of the program is that state housing finance \nagencies award Federal tax credits to developers of rental housing. \nSince these agencies have considerable flexibility in how they \ndistribute the credits, developers compete for the limited number of \ntax credits by submitting project proposals. The agencies rate the \nproposals, and allocate credits to individual properties based on \ncriteria provided in the Internal Revenue Code, and on the state's \nparticular housing needs and priorities.\n  The Internal Revenue Code also limits the amount of credits a state \nmay allocate to a particular property. The limit is determined as \npercentage of the basis of a property. The basis is, generally \nspeaking, the cost of constructing a building that is part of an \naffordable housing project. Non-federally subsidized new construction \nmay receive a 9 percent credit. Existing buildings and new buildings \nreceiving other federal subsidies may get a 4 percent credit.\n  The IRS takes the position that certain construction costs should not \nbe included in basis. This position makes a large number of affordable \nhousing properties financially unfeasible, and weakens the economics of \nthose that still pass minimum underwriting requirements. The loss of \nequity would surely affect the properties that serve the lowest income \ntenants, provide higher levels of service, or operate in high cost \nareas. The reason that this is problematic is simple. Reducing the \namount of credits does not reduce the development costs. It merely \nalters the source of financing from equity to debt, forcing either \nhigher rents or lower quality construction.\n  Apparently, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service \nagree that this is an issue worthy of review, as both agencies have \nincluded it in their business plan. Last year, the IRS issued new \nguidance on one of the items addressed by the TAMs, but there does not \nappear to be a full review of the effect of the positions set forth in \nthe TAMs anytime soon.\n  This legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to specify \nthat certain associated development costs are to be included in \neligible basis. In many cases, the largest item excluded from eligible \nbasis under the TAMs is ``impact fees.'' Impact fees are fees required \nby the government ``as a condition to the development'' and considered \nineligible because they are one- time costs, unlike building permits \nthat need to be renewed each time a building is built. These fees cover \na wide range of infrastructure improvements including sewer lines, \nschools, and roads. Certainly, whether or not they are includable in \nbasis for the purpose of calculating the amount of tax credit, these \ncosts will be incurred and will impact the economics of the property. \nAs I mentioned previously, the IRS has recently addressed the inclusion \nof impact fees in eligible basis, but not other costs directly related \nto building construction.\n\n  Other items that would be severely restricted or excluded from \neligible basis under the interpretations expressed in the TAMs are site \npreparation costs, development fees, professional fees related to \ndeveloping the property, and construction financing costs. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will clarify that any cost \nincurred in preparing a site which is reasonably related to the \ndevelopment of a qualified low-income housing property, any reasonable \nfee paid to the developer, any professional fee relating to an item \nincludable in basis, and any cost of financing attributable to \nconstruction of the building is includable in basis for the purpose of \ncalculating the maximum amount of credit a state may allocate to a low-\nincome housing property.\n  The intent of these clarifications is simply to codify common \nindustry practice before the issuance of the TAMs. Not only will the \nlegislation allow the low-income tax credit program to provide better \nquality hosing at lower rental rates than would be possible if the \npositions taken in the TAMs are followed, but clarification will help \nsimplify administration of the credit by giving both taxpayers and the \nInternal Revenue Service a clearer statement of the standards that \napply in calculating credit amounts.\n  Our economy is not doing as well as we would like, and there is a \nsignificant likelihood that we are going to need even more affordable \nhousing in\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nthe not too distant future. We should be proud that we increased the \namount of low-income housing tax credits that will be available to help \nfinance this housing. What we need to do now is to make sure that these \ncredits are used as efficiently as possible to provide housing for \nthose who need it the most. The legislation we are introducing today \nwill help achieve that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXPENSES FOR LOW-INCOME \n                   HOUSING CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 42 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to low-income housing \n     credit) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(8) Associated development costs included in basis.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Solely for purposes of this section, \n     associated development costs shall be taken into account in \n     determining the basis of any building which is part of a low-\n     income housing project to the extent not otherwise so taken \n     into account.\n       ``(B) Associated development costs.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (A), the term `associated development costs' \n     means, with respect to any building, such building's \n     allocable share of--\n       ``(i) any cost incurred in preparing the site which is \n     reasonably related to the development of the qualified low-\n     income housing project of which the building is a part,\n       ``(ii) any fee imposed by a State or local government as a \n     condition to development of such project,\n       ``(iii) any reasonable fee paid to any developer of such \n     project,\n       ``(iv) any professional fee relating to any item includible \n     in the basis of the building pursuant to this paragraph, and\n       ``(v) any cost of financing attributable to construction of \n     the building (without regard to the source of such financing) \n     which is required to be capitalized.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to--\n       (1) housing credit dollar amounts allocated after December \n     31, 2002, and\n       (2) buildings placed in service after such date to the \n     extent paragraph (1) of section 42(h) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 does not apply to any building by reason of \n     paragraph (4) thereof, but only with respect to bonds issued \n     after such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Dayton, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1120. A bill to establish an Office of Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Firms Reorganization Act.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program assists hundreds of \nmostly small and medium-sized manufacturing and agricultural companies \nin Montana and nationwide when they face layoffs and lost sales due to \nimport competition. Qualifying companies develop adjustment plans and \nreceive technical assistance to become more competitive, so they can \nretain and expand employment.\n  The program is very cost effective. It requires the firms being \nhelped to match the Federal assistance with their own funds, and it \npays the government back in Federal and State tax revenues when the \nfirms succeed.\n  Currently, TAA for Firms clients receive assistance preparing \npetitions and adjustment plans from twelve Trade Adjustment Assistance \nCenters, which are Commerce Department contractors. Program and policy \ndecisions are made by a small Headquarters staff in Commerce's Economic \nDevelopment Administration. This organizational structure is efficient \nand has served the program well for many years.\n  For example, TAA for Firms is helping Montola Growers from \nCulbertson, Montana, to develop cosmetic applications for its rapeseed \noil. The program is helping Pyramid Mountain Lumber of Seeley Lake, MT \nto upgrade its production process and train employees to use new \nprocess controls. And it is helping Porterbilt Company of Hamilton to \nexpand its product line.\n  Last year, in the Trade Act of 2002, a bipartisan majority of \nCongress voted to reauthorize this important program for seven years \nand to increase its authorized funding level. The program seemed headed \ntoward some years of smooth sailing. But it turns out that is not the \ncase.\n  For reasons unrelated to TAA for Firms, EDA is about to move all its \nHeadquarters program operations to its six regional offices, with a \npolicy office in Washington. For TAA for Firms, that means clients will \nget the same local services from the TAACs, but decisions will be made \nin six regional offices and the national policy office--a net increase \nin layers of government. The likely result is more personnel needed to \nrun the program, less centralized and consistent decision making, and \nless accountability--all without any likely improvement in customer \nservice.\n  The organizational structure of TAA for Firms is not broken and it \ndoesn't need to be fixed. This bill preserves the existing efficient \nmanagement structure of the TAA for Firms program. Instead of moving \nthe program out of Commerce Headquarters entirely, it simply moves the \nprogram to a different part of the Commerce Department. That way it can \ncontinue to be centrally managed with a minimal staff.\n\n  Under this bill, administration of TAA for Firms will move from the \nEconomic Development Administration at the Department of Commerce to \nDOC's International Trade Administration.\n  Relocating the program to ITA makes a lot more sense that dividing it \nup among seven different EDA offices, for several reasons. First, ITA \nhas experience running this program, which was located there prior to \n1990. Second, relocating TAA for Firms to ITA will result in fewer \nlayers of government and more centralized and accountable program \nmanagement. It also creates synergies by allowing better coordination \nof the TAA for Firms program with other trade and trade remedy programs \nadministered by ITA. And it enhances the ability of the Finance \nCommittee to carry out its oversight responsibilities for this program \nand for trade policy in general.\n  I want to thank Senators Rockefeller, Bingaman, Dayton, and Murray \nwho have joined me in co-sponsoring this bill. This is a simple matter \nof good, sensible government and I encourage more of my colleagues to \nlend it their support. I urge Chairman Grassley to take up this bill in \nthe Finance Committee as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     for Firms Reorganization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. OFFICE OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341 et seq.) is amended by inserting after \n     section 255 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 255A. OFFICE OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       ``(a) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms \n     Reorganization Act, there shall be established in the \n     International Trade Administration of the Department of \n     Commerce an Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       ``(b) Personnel.--The Office shall be headed by a Director, \n     and shall have such staff as may be necessary to carry out \n     the responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce described \n     in this chapter.\n       ``(c) Functions.--The Office shall assist the Secretary of \n     Commerce in carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities \n     under this chapter.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for the \n     Trade Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after the item \n     relating to section 255, the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 255A. Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1121. A bill to extend certain trade benefits to countries of the \ngreater Middle East; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of my \nself and Senator McCain, the Middle East Trade and Engagement Act of \n2003.\n  For more than a thousand years, the most important trade route in the \nworld ran through the heart of the\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\nMiddle East. The Silk Road that linked the Western world with China \nwound its way through what is today Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, and a \nhost of other countries in the Middle East.\n  Merchants who traveled either direction along the Silk Road brought \nwith them not only their goods for sale, but also their ideas and \nculture. In this way, all peoples from the West through the East were \nenriched with both money and knowledge.\n  But in modern times, the countries of the Middle East have retreated \nfrom their historically critical role in world trade. Today, few \ncountries in the Middle East engage fully in the global trading system.\n  Many are not members of the World Trade Organization. Many have high \nbarriers to international trade and investment. Their economies have \nsuffered as a result. A declining share of world trade and investment \nhas led to decades of deepening poverty and slow job creation in the \ncountries of the Middle East.\n  At the same time, they have been experiencing population growth rates \namong the highest in the world. That means that a growing number of \nyoung people will be entering the workforce to look for jobs that don't \nnow exist.\n  The United States cannot stand idly by as a generation of young \npeople in the Middle East grows up to discover that there is no \nmeaningful work for them, and that they have no way to provide for a \nfamily of their own.\n  The problem will only get worse if we don't act now. As the rest of \nthe world continues to liberalize its trade, the countries of the \nMiddle East will only be left further behind.\n  That is why we're today introducing the Middle East Trade and \nEngagement ACt of 2003. Under this Act, countries in the Middle East \nwill be given preferential access to the U.S. market.\n  This is not a one-way street. Countries must meet certain conditions. \nThey must support our war on terrorism, and they must pursue economic \nreforms. Only then will they reap the benefits of this legislation.\n  Our proposal can have an immediate impact. Opening our markets to the \ncountries of the Middle East will encourage higher levels of trade and \ndirect investment in those countries. And we know it can be a success \nbecause if has worked before in other regions. Our bill is modeled on \nsuccessful programs that increased economic development in sub-Saharan \nAfrica and the Andean countries.\n  This legislation will do the same for the countries of the Middle \nEast. Increased economic development in that region means jobs for the \nyoung and the unemployed, some of whom may otherwise be recruited by \nour enemies in the war on terrorism.\n  By helping to strengthen these economies, we also increase the number \nof people who can afford to purchase American products and services. \nThat means increased export opportunities for American businesses and \nmore jobs for American farmers and workers.\n  President Bush recently announced an initiative to create a free \ntrade area for the United States and the countries of the Middle East \nby the year 2013. This is a good long-term goal. But the people in the \nMiddle East need our help now. They need jobs now, not ten years from \nnow.\n  The Middle East Trade and Engagement Act would bring the benefits of \ntrade to the people of the countries in the Middle East in a much \nshorter time. It would also help those countries make the economic \nreforms they'll need to make before a free trade area can become a \nrealistic option.\n  And just as trade in the time of the Silk Road allowed the exchange \nof ideas and culture as well as goods, increased trade now can \nstrengthen ties between the United States and the countries in the \nMiddle East.\n  Now, in the Aftermath of the war in Iraq, the whole world's attention \nis focused on the Middle East. It is the ideal time for the United \nStates to engage these countries in a comprehensive way and help bring \nthem more fully into the global trading system.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator McCain and me in \ncosponsoring this important legislation, and I hope we will have a \nchange to consider this in the Finance Committee this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Middle East Trade and \n     Engagement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     the countries of the greater Middle East to promote stable \n     and sustainable growth and development throughout the greater \n     Middle East;\n       (2) Congress views democratization and economic progress in \n     the countries of the greater Middle East as important \n     elements of a policy to address terrorism and endemic \n     instability;\n       (3) free trade relationships are not a substitute for, but \n     a complement to, necessary political and economic reforms \n     that lead to political liberalization and economic freedom;\n       (4) the countries of the greater Middle East have enormous \n     economic potential and are of enduring political significance \n     to the United States;\n       (5) despite their economic potential, the countries of the \n     greater Middle East are experiencing deepening poverty, slow \n     job creation, and a declining share of world trade and \n     investment, while at the same time experiencing population \n     growth rates among the highest in the world;\n       (6) these economic conditions are in part the result of \n     barriers to trade and investment, a failure to engage fully \n     in the global trading system, lack of participation in the \n     World Trade Organization, and, often, a lack of economic \n     diversification and over-reliance on the energy sector;\n       (7) offering the countries of the greater Middle East \n     enhanced trade preferences will encourage higher levels of \n     trade and direct investment and help bring those countries \n     more fully into the global trading system;\n       (8) higher levels of trade and investment and greater \n     involvement in the global trading system can lead to \n     increased economic development, which can in turn lead to \n     more jobs for people in the countries of the greater Middle \n     East; and\n       (9) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers in the greater Middle East will enhance \n     the benefits of trade and investment for all the countries in \n     the greater Middle East as well as enhance commercial and \n     political ties between the United States and the greater \n     Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress supports--\n       (1) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and the countries of the greater Middle East \n     and among the countries of the greater Middle East;\n       (2) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other \n     obstacles to trade between the United States and the \n     countries of the greater Middle East and among the countries \n     of the greater Middle East;\n       (3) strengthening and expanding the private sector and \n     accelerating the rate of job creation in the countries of the \n     greater Middle East;\n       (4) focusing on countries committed to the rule of law, \n     economic reform, political liberalization, respect for human \n     rights, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (5) facilitating the development of civil societies and \n     political freedom in the countries of the greater Middle \n     East;\n       (6) promoting sustainable development, and protecting and \n     preserving the environment in a manner consistent with \n     economic development; and\n       (7) encouraging the countries of the greater Middle East to \n     diversify their economies, implement domestic economic \n     reforms, open to trade, and adopt anticorruption measures, \n     including through accession to the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating \n     Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

TERMINATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\n\n       No duty-free treatment or other preferential treatment \n     extended to beneficiary countries under this Act shall remain \n     in effect after December 31, 2011.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I join Senator Baucus in introducing \nthe Middle East Trade and Engagement Act of 2003. Our legislation would \npermit eligible countries in the greater Middle East to gain greater \naccess to American markets through the duty-free treatment of certain \nexports, and ultimately to negotiate free trade agreements with the \nUnited States. It would condition broader trade relations on \nfundamental political and economic reforms, cooperation in the fight \nagainst terrorism, and support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace \nprocess, among other issues, in order to promote liberalization and \nreform across the Arab and Muslim worlds.\n  Free trade is a powerful tool for opening up closed societies, if \nleaders in the greater Middle East are willing to make necessary and \noverdue political and economic reforms. It is past time for nations in \nthe region to join the global economy, and for rulers to lead \nincreasingly restive populations in the direction of democracy and free \nmarkets.\n  Today, the countries of the Middle East account for a small \npercentage of non-energy sector trade for the United States. With the \nexception of oil, most Arab nations barely trade with each other, much \nless with the rest of the world, and many still maintain a hostile \neconomic boycott on Israel--policies that isolate the Middle East from \nthe global economy and perpetuate conflict instead of building \nprosperity. The wave of free-market reform and democratization that \nswept Europe, Latin America, Asia, and parts of Africa in the 1980s and \n1990s has left most of the Middle East untouched and unchanged.\n  America's interest in economic opening and political liberalization \nin the region requires a new level of engagement with the countries of \nthe greater Middle East, premised on the acceleration and active \nimplementation of a host of reforms without which prosperity and \ndemocracy are not possible. Our legislation would tie preferential \ntrade access to American markets to progress towards adoption of these \nreforms, as well as meaningful progress on human rights protections, \ndecisive movement towards democracy, full cooperation in the war on \nterrorism, and an end to the primary, secondary, and tertiary economic \nboycott of Israel.\n  Our bill is modeled on the success of the Andean Trade Preferences \nAct and the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Ideally, enactment of \nthe bill we are introducing today would create a regime of duty-free \ntrade in a number of goods from the greater Middle East. Such a trade \npreference program would encourage and often require eligible nations \nto undertake the kind of significant economic reforms that ultimately \nlead to free trade agreements, as President Bush has called for and \nwhich we support.\n  The Andean Trade Preferences Act was created to expand the economies \nof Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. By granting duty-free and \nreduced rate treatment to various products from these nations, we took \naction to strengthen the fragile economies of the region, expand their \nexport bases, and provide Andean farmers and workers with legitimate \nemployment outside of the drug trade. It has worked. The trade \nagreement created new industries in the region outside of the drug \ntrade and expanded the economies of the region which helped to create \nlegitimate jobs. We foresee similar effects from this legislation on \nparts of the Middle East, if leaders have the courage and vision to \ncomplement progress on trade with internal political and economic \nreforms.\n  Reform in the Arab and Muslim worlds requires not just greater trade \nbut accelerated political and economic liberalization, including \nrespect for fundamental human freedom. It is my hope that the spirit \nand effect of our legislation will help move countries of the greater \nMiddle East in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 1123. A bill to provide enhanced Federal enforcement and \nassistance in preventing and prosecuting crimes of violence against \nchildren; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Violence \nAgainst Children Act of 2003. The legislation, modeled on the \nsuccessful Violence Against Women Act, will both toughen Federal \npenalties for crimes against children and assist local communities in \ntheir efforts to fight violence against children. It has been endorsed \nby over 100 prominent individuals and organizations.\n  We were all horrified by the tragic murders of Samantha Runion and \nDanielle van Dam. We were horrified by the kidnaping of Elizabeth \nSmart, Erica Pratt, and Nichole Taylor Timmons who were snatched right \nfrom their homes. We were horrified by the kidnaping and rape of \nJacqueline Marris and Tamara Brooks.\n  But there are thousands more stories we do not hear--thousands of \nchildren who each year are victims of sexual molestation, kidnaping, \nmurder--thousands of children whose stories do not make the nightly \nnews--thousands of children and thousands of families who suffer in \nsilence and often without help.\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\n  In fact, 71 percent of all sex crime victims are under the age of \n18--and 38 percent of all kidnaping victims are under age 18. Those \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 are over two times more likely to be \nvictims of a violent crime than adults. And as alarming as those \nstatistics are, according to a study published in 1999, only 28 percent \nof all crimes against children are actually reported.\n  While we are horrified by these and other stories, we must not let \nthem paralyze us. We must do for children what we have done on behalf \nof women, by changing attitudes and changing the culture. The Violence \nAgainst Children Act would create a new Federal criminal statute for \nwillfully injuring or attempting to injure any person under the age of \n18. Those who injure a child or try to will be imprisoned for up to 10 \nyears and fined. And if the crime is kidnaping, aggravated sexual \nabuse, or murder, the maximum penalty will be life in prison.\n  In addition to enhanced penalties for crimes against children, the \nViolence Against Children Act provides Federal assistance--including \ntechnical, forensic, and prosecutorial assistance--to any State, Indian \ntribe, or local government that requests assistance with a violent \nfelony against a child. The bill also establishes a grant program to \nhelp local police and prosecutors to strengthen effective law \nenforcement and prosecution for these crimes.\n  This Act builds upon the Protect Act, recently signed into law, by \nrequiring that States have an Amber Alert system to help locate missing \nchildren in order to qualify for the local law enforcement grants. In \naddition, to cut down on the number of abused and neglected children, \nstates are required to have a Safe Haven program that would allow \nparents to leave newborn babies in hospital emergency rooms, \nanonymously and with no fear of penalty. These requirements will ensure \nthat states take action to improve systems that can protect our \nNation's children.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Biden, who I \nteamed up with over a decade ago in introducing the Violence Against \nWomen Act. And Representative Millender-McDonald is the sponsor of the \nHouse bill.\n  This is a critical issue to safeguard our children and youth \nnationwide. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill and a list of those who have endorsed it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Violence Against Children Act--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       Names the Act the ``Violence Against Children Act of \n     2003.''\n     Section 2. Findings\n       Includes findings on the extent of crimes against children \n     and the effect of those crimes against children. Also finds \n     that failure to pay child support is a form of neglect.\n\n\n       title I--enHANCED FedERAL ROle In CRIMES against CHILDREN\n\n     Section 101. Enhanced penalties\n       (1) New Criminal Statute\n       Creates a new federal criminal statute for willfully \n     injuring or attempting to injure any person under the age of \n     18. Establishes a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a \n     fine. If death of the child results from the crime or if the \n     crime is kidnapping, an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse, an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill, the maximum penalty is a fine and life in \n     prison.\n       For constitutional purposes, the criminal statute applies \n     only under certain circumstances: (1) if the defendant or the \n     victim engages in interstate or foreign commerce, including \n     crossing a state line, during the course of or as the result \n     of committing the crime; or (2) the defendant uses a firearm \n     or other weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign \n     commerce.\n       (2) Enhanced Penalties of Existing Crimes\n       Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to provide \n     enhanced penalties for existing federal crimes when the \n     victim is under the age of 18.\n       (3) Review of State Laws\n       Directs the General Accounting Office, within 6 months, to \n     review state criminal penalties for crimes against children \n     and state laws regarding enhanced penalties when the victim \n     of a crime is under the age of 18.\n     Section 102. Enhanced assistance for criminal investigations \n         and prosecutions by state and local law enforcement \n         officials\n       Requires the Attorney General to provide federal \n     assistance--including technical, forensic, and prosecutorial \n     assistance--to any state, Indian tribe, or local government \n     that requests assistance with a violent felony against a \n     child.\n       If the Attorney General determines that there are \n     insufficient resources to fulfill all such requests, priority \n     is given to (a) requests that involve offenders who have \n     committed crimes in more than one state; and (b) rural areas \n     that do not have sufficient resources to investigate and \n     prosecute the crime.\n\n\n                        TITLE II--GRANT PROGRAMS\n\n     Section 201. State and local law enforcement assistance \n         grants\n       Creates a new grant program to assist states, Indian \n     tribes, and local governments to strengthen law enforcement \n     and prosecution of crimes against children. Grants could be \n     used for a variety of purposes, including: (a) training law \n     enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges; (b) developing \n     or expanding law enforcement units or courts that \n     specifically target crimes against children; (c) developing \n     policies to prevent, identify, and respond to crimes against \n     children; (d) establishing data collection and communication \n     systems to link police, prosecutors, and courts in helping to \n     track arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of crimes \n     against children; and (e) establishing and strengthening \n     collaboration and communication between law enforcement and \n     child services agencies.\n       To be eligible for funds, a state must have in place an \n     AMBER Alert system (see section 301) and must use, or be in \n     the process of using, the National Incident-Based Reporting \n     System (see section 302).\n       Authorizes $25 million for each of the next five years. \n     Federal funds must supplement, not supplant, non-federal \n     funds.\n     Section 202. Education, prevention, and victims' assistance \n         grants\n       Creates a new grant program to assist states, Indian \n     tribes, local governments, and nongovernmental organizations \n     to provide education, prevention, intervention, and victims' \n     assistance services regarding crimes against children. Grants \n     could be used for a variety of purposes, including: (a) \n     hotlines; (b) training of professionals; (c) informational \n     and educational services and materials; (d) intervention \n     services; (e) emergency medical treatment; (f) counseling to \n     child victims and their families; and (g) increasing the \n     number of mental health professionals that specialize in \n     child victims.\n       To be eligible for funds, a state must have a Safe Haven \n     program (see section 303).\n       Authorizes $25 million for each of the next five years. \n     Federal funds must supplement, not supplant, non-federal \n     funds.\n\n\n                     TITLE III--NATIONWIDE PROGRAMS\n\n     Section 301. Nationwide AMBER Alert\n       Requires each state receiving a law enforcement assistance \n     grant (see section 201) to have in place a state-wide AMBER \n     Alert communications network for child abduction cases.\n       This system must be in place within 3 years after the date \n     of enactment of the Violence Against Children Act.\n     Section 302. Improved statistical gathering\n       Requires each state receiving a law enforcement assistance \n     grant (see section 201) to use, or to be in the process of \n     testing or developing protocols to use, the National \n     Incident-Based Reporting System. (This program provides the \n     most detailed statistical profile of crimes in the United \n     States, including by the age of the victims. However, it is a \n     voluntary program, and less than half the states currently \n     participate.)\n     Section 303. National safe haven\n       Requires each state receiving a victims' assistance grant \n     (see section 202) to have a Safe Haven program, which permits \n     a parent to leave a newborn baby with a medically-trained \n     employee of a hospital emergency room anonymously without \n     penalty. The state program must have a mechanism to \n     voluntarily collect information about the medical history of \n     the family, must require a search of the child in the state \n     and federal missing person databases, and must include a plan \n     to publicize the state program.\n       To ensure that an abused or intentionally harmed newborn is \n     not left at a hospital so a parent can escape responsibility, \n     a state may have a limited exception to the Safe Haven \n     program in those circumstances.\n     Section 304. Improved child protection services programs\n       Directs each state, within 6 months, to report to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services on its child \n     protective services program, including how the state \n     maintains records, keeps track of the children under its \n     care, and verifies the well-being of the children.\n       Directs the General Accounting Office, within 6 months, to \n     review state child protective services practices, including \n     how states keep track of the children under their care, and \n     to report to Congress on any legislative changes needed to \n     improve the program.\n\n\n                  TITLE IV--CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT\n\n     Section 401. Child support bad debt deduction\n       Expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     extend the existing federal tax law on bad debt to nonpayment \n     of child support. That is, those who do not receive the child \n     support they are owed should be able to deduct that from \n     their federal income taxes; those who fail to pay ordered\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\n     child support should be required to add the unpaid amount to \n     their income and pay federal taxes on it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Violence Against Children Act Letters of Support\n\n\n                   national organizations/individuals\n\n       KlaasKids Foundation (Marc Klaas).\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       National Children's Alliance.\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Humane Association.\n       Crimes Against Children Research Center.\n       Dr. Laura Schlessinger.\n\n\n                       California Law Enforcement\n\n       California Police Activities Leagues.\n       Auburn Chief of Police.\n       Butte County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Chico Chief of Police.\n       Colusa County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Fairfield Chief of Police.\n       Glenn County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Kern County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Lassen County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Long Beach Chief of Police.\n       Los Angeles Chief of Police.\n       Manteca Chief of Police.\n       Marin County Sheriff.\n       Marysville Chief of Police.\n       Napa Chief of Police.\n       Oxnard Chief of Police.\n       Redding Chief of Police.\n       Roseville Chief of Police.\n       Sacramento Chief of Police.\n       Sacramento County Sheriff.\n       San Diego Chief of Police.\n       San Mateo Chief of Police.\n       San Mateo County Sheriff.\n       Santa Ana Chief of Police.\n       Santa Clara Chief of Police.\n       Shasta County Sheriff.\n       Stanislaus County Sheriff-Coroner.\n       Stockton Chief of Police.\n       Woodland Chief of Police.\n       Yolo County Sheriff.\n       Yuba City Chief of Police.\n\n\n                         other law enforcement\n\n       Pierce County (WA) Sheriff.\n\n\n                      california public officials\n\n       Bill Lockyer, California Attorney General.\n       Jack O'Connell, California State Superintendent of Public \n     Instruction.\n       Steve Westly, California State Controller.\n       John L.

Mr. President, I rise today to help introduce a bill with \nmy good friend from California that will bring new and needed tools to \nthe battle to end violence against children in America, whether it \ntakes place inside the home or out on the street. Today, Senator Boxer \nand I are introducing the Violence Against Children Act, VACA, which \nprovides a comprehensive approach to prevent crimes against children, \ntreat child victims, and prosecute those who harm our Nation's \nchildren.\n  In 1994, this body passed a piece of legislation that I authored, the \nViolence Against Women Act. When we passed this landmark legislation, \nwe said as a Congress, and as a Nation as a whole, that domestic \nviolence is not a family problem to be dealt with quietly behind the \nscenes, but a national crisis in need of a coordinated response from \nlaw enforcement, the courts and the medical community. Backed by almost \none and half billion dollars of Federal funds, the Violence Against \nWomen Act spurred a sea change on the Federal, State and local levels \nin how police, prosecutors, judges, medical personnel and others, \nprocess and handle cases of domestic abuse, sexual assault and \nstalking. Most importantly, the Violence Against Women Act also made it \nclear that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault were, in \nfact, victims: Victims who deserved the full extend of this Nation's \nmedical and legal resources. The Violence Against Children Act, offered \nby Senator Boxer and myself today, is designed to bring this same type \nof concentered focus and coordinated response to end all child abuse, \nthe most heinous and incomprehensible form of violence against the most \nvulnerable people in our lives.\n  Last year in my state of Delaware there were 1,073 substantiated \ncases of child abuse and neglect--46 percent were cases of neglect, 31 \npercent were cases of abuse and 12 percent were cases of sexual abuse. \nNationally, 3.9 million of the nation's 22.3 million children between \nthe ages of 12 and 17 have been seriously physically assaulted. One in \nthree girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before the age of \n18. One study recently reported that in 2000, the homicide rate for \nU.S. infants is almost equal to the murder rate of teens. As stunning \nas these numbers are, we should be aware that these numbers are not the \ntotals. Like incidents of domestic violence, we know that violence \nagainst children is under-reported. We also know that violence against \nkids cuts across all lines--it happens to children of doctors and \nlawyers, not just to poor children. We must do more to protect our \nchildren, and with the Violence Against Children Act we can.\n  Designed to be a comprehensive measure, the Violence Against Children \nAct will fight the battle against child abuse on a number of fronts: by \nproviding states with new resources, law enforcement with additional \ntools and families with more places to turn to for help. What \nspecifically the legislation do? The Violence Against Children Act has \nthree major provisions; 1. it deters crime by toughening Federal \ncriminal penalties for crimes against children; 2. it requires the \nFederal Government to provide investigative, forensic and prosecutorial \nassistance to states working on cases of violent crimes against \nchildren; and 3. it authorizes two new grant programs--one\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\naimed at providing more resources to state and local law enforcement \nfor training, creating new courts and enforcement units focused solely \non child crimes, and a second grant program for local governments and \nnonprofit organizations to provide emergency medical treatment and \ncounseling for child victims, to increase the number of mental health \nprofessionals who specialize in child victims, and to establish child \nabuse and crime prevention programs.\n\n  The Violence Against Children Act also encourages State and \nlocalities to take affirmative steps to fight crimes against children \nby conditioning receipt of grant monies on three points: 1. creating a \nstatewide Amber Alert system to alert the public immediately after a \nchild abduction has been discovered; 2. creating Safe Haven programs \nwhich allow parents to leave newborn babies for whom they cannot care \nin hospital emergency room anonymously and without fear of penalty; and \n3. improving data gathering so that police, treatment providers and \npolicy makers get a clearer view of the circumstances surrounding child \ncrimes. We need to stop nibbling around the edges with piecemeal \nlegislation that tackles just one aspect of child abuse or child \nexploitation. The Violence Against Children Act takes into account the \nlarger landscape and provides wide-reaching tools and resources. I feel \ncertain that once my colleagues become aware of this effort, this bill \nwill gather broad and bipartisan support.\n  Recently the Nation was stunned and relieved at the return of \nElizabeth Smart to her parents Ed and Lois. As a father and grandfather \nmy heart went out to them. I don't want to read about these types of \ncases anymore. My State of Delaware has an Amber Alert system in place. \nDelaware has a Safe Haven law. Not every State has these critical tools \nat their disposal. Senator Boxer and I are introducing the Violence \nAgainst Children Act for a reason. We must do everything that we can to \nprevent crimes against children and, if God forbid they do occur, we \nmust do everything we can to treat the victims and their families and \nprosecute their perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. As one \nchild advocates succinctly said, ``a civilized society says children \nmatter.'' The Violence Against Children Act says loud and clear, kids \nmatter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 1124. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nburial benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veterans Burial \nBenefits Improvement Act.\n  During the upcoming Memorial Day holiday, we will honor our U.S. \nsoldiers who died in the name of their country. These service men and \nwomen are America's true heroes and on this day we pay tribute to their \ncourage and sacrifice. Some have given their lives for our country. All \nhave given their time and dedication to ensure our country remains the \nland of the free and the home of the brave. We owe a special debt of \ngratitude to each and every one of them.\n  This holiday serves as an important reminder that our nation has a \nsacred commitment to honor the promises made to soldiers when they \nsigned up to serve our country. As the Ranking Member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee that funds veterans programs, I fight hard \nto make sure promises made to our service men and women are promises \nkept. These promises include access to quality, affordable health care \nand a proper burial for our veterans.\n  I am deeply concerned that burial benefits for the families of our \nwounded or disabled veterans have not kept up with inflation and rising \nfuneral costs. We are losing over 1,000 World War II veterans each day, \nbut Congress has failed to increase veterans' burial benefits to keep \nup with rising costs and inflation. While these benefits were never \nintended to cover the full costs of burial, they now pay for only a \nfraction of what they covered in 1973, when the Federal Government \nfirst started paying burial benefits for our veterans.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for \nworking with me in the 107th Congress. Together, we were able to \nincrease modestly the service-connected benefit from $1,500 to $2,000, \nand the plot allowance from $150 to $300. While I believe these \nincreases are a step in the right direction, they are not a substitute \nfor the amounts included in my bill.\n  That's why I am again introducing the Veterans Burial Benefits \nImprovement Act. This bill will increase burial benefits to cover the \nsame percentage of funeral costs as they did in 1973. It will also \nprovide for these benefits to be increased annually to keep up with \ninflation.\n  In 1973, the service-connected benefit paid for 72 percent of \nveterans' funeral costs. Today, this benefit covers just 39 percent of \nfuneral costs. My bill will increase the service-connected benefit from \n$2,000 to $3,713, bringing it back up to the original 72 percent level.\n  In 1973, the non-service connected benefit paid for 22 percent of \nfuneral costs. It has not been increased since 1978, and today it \ncovers just 6 percent of funeral costs. My bill will increase the non-\nservice connected benefit from $300 to $1,135, bringing it back up to \nthe original 22 percent level.\n  In 1973, the plot allowance paid for 13 percent of veterans' funeral \ncosts. Yet it now covers just 3 percent of funeral costs. My bill will \nincrease the plot allowance from $300 to $670, bringing it back up to \nthe original 13 percent level.\n  Finally, the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act will also \nensure that these burial benefits are adjusted for inflation annually, \nso veterans won't have to fight this fight again.\n  This legislation is just one way to honor our Nation's service men \nand women. I want to thank the millions of veterans, Marylanders, and \npeople across the nation for their patriotism, devotion, and commitment \nto honoring the true meaning of Memorial Day. U.S. soldiers from every \ngeneration have shared in the duty of defending America and protecting \nour freedom. For these sacrifices, America is eternally grateful.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation, and \nletters from several veterans' advocacy groups supporting it, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: As Memorial Day 2003 approaches, the \n     co-authors of The Independent Budget would like to express \n     our strong support for your legislation which would \n     revitalize veterans' burial benefits and honor those who have \n     sacrificed for this country. This legislation would provide a \n     meaningful increase in burial benefits that is long overdue.\n       Veterans' burial benefits have seriously eroded in value \n     over the years. The proposed increase would cover the same \n     percentage of veterans' burial costs that they covered in \n     1973 when they were initiated. The annual adjustment to cover \n     the costs of inflation is also something that The Independent \n     Budget has argued in favor of in the past.\n       The Independent Budget produced by AMVETS, Disabled \n     American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars fully supports the proposed \n     adjustment of burial allowances to reflect the increases in \n     burial costs. Clearly, it is time these benefits were raised \n     to provide a more meaningful contribution to the costs of \n     burial for veterans. We applaud your efforts to responsibly \n     address this matter, and we appreciate your continued \n     commitment to the men and women who have served this country \n     and are continuing to do so even today.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Jones,\n       National Legislative Director, AMVETS.\n     Richard B. Fuller,\n       National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America.\n     Joseph A. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans.\n     Dennnis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Fleet Reserve Association,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) \n     and its 135,000 members extend its strong support for the \n     reintroduction of the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement \n     Act. FRA applauds your leadership on working on this \n     important issue.\n       As it has for more than 79 years, FRA effectively \n     represents the interests of Sea Services enlisted \n     communities, and is committed to ensuring equitable \n     compensation and benefits for active duty, reserve and \n     retired personnel.\n       The FRA stands ready to assist you and your staff on the \n     introduction of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph L. Barnes,\n     National Executive Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n         The National Association of State Directors of Veterans \n           Affairs, Inc.,\n                                                     May 20, 2003.\n     Senator Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Wasington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The National Association of State \n     Directors of Veterans Affairs (NASDVA) is in strong support \n     of the legislation you are proposing with regards to burial \n     benefits for our Nation's deceased veterans, namely, ``The \n     Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act of 2003.''\n       We recognize and thank you for your outstanding earlier \n     work with regards to veterans' burial benefits, including \n     authoring, introducing, and shepherding the Veterans Burial \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2001 through the legislative \n     process. While it is regrettable that Congress declined to \n     enact all of the much needed measures you proposed, your work \n     did lead to important increases in the authorized allowance \n     for burial and funeral expenses for deceased veterans. We \n     appreciate and thank you for your introduction of this new \n     legislation.\n       As you are aware, the 95th Congress enacted the State \n     Cemeteries Grant as part of Public Law 95-476 in order to \n     provide Federal assistance to the States to construct, \n     expand, and improve State veterans' cemeteries. State \n     veterans' cemeteries must be State-owned, and operated solely \n     for the interment of eligible veterans and their dependents \n     and/or spouses. Operational costs are paid by the States.\n       State veterans' cemeteries continue to provide a cost-\n     effective supplement to the VA's National Cemetery System. \n     However, Federal veterans' burial plot allowances currently \n     offset the costs of operation of State veterans' cemeteries \n     by only one-third of the total cost. Furthermore, the actual \n     allowances have been increased only incrementally since the \n     programs were first instituted in 1973, and the rate of \n     reimbursement has fallen far short of increases in the actual \n     costs of burial expenses and cemetery plots.\n       Your bill proposes an increase to $3,713 for the burial \n     plot allowance for veterans who die as a direct result of a \n     service-connected illness or injury. When first enacted in \n     1973, the amount of the benefit at that time covered 72 \n     percent of the average burial expense at that time. Today, \n     the current benefit of $2,000 covers just 39 percent of those \n     costs. Your earlier work helped to provide a much-needed \n     increase to the current level, and we fully endorse your \n     current efforts to ensure that the allowance is raised to \n     at least the 1973 rate.\n       Your proposed legislation would also increase the amount of \n     the burial benefit to $1,135 for the non-service-connected \n     death of veterans in receipt of or otherwise found entitled \n     to VA compensation, VA pension, and veterans who die while \n     hospitalized or domiciled in a VA facility. The original 1973 \n     benefit aided grieving families of deceased veterans by \n     offsetting the cost of burial and funeral expenses by 22 \n     percent. Today, the $300 that is provided covers just 6 \n     percent of those costs.\n       Finally, your bill addresses the amount of funding provided \n     for veterans' burial plot allowances. Your earlier work \n     helped to provide a much-needed increase in that amount from \n     $150 to $300. However, as you know, the current amount \n     provides only 5.85 of the average cost of a burial plot, \n     while the 1973 rate provided 13 percent. We are in strong \n     support of your efforts to raise the allowance to its 1973 \n     rate, at $670.\n       We are hopeful that Congress will see fit to fully enact \n     the provisions of the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement \n     Act of 2003. We also that Congress will enact legislation to \n     expand eligibility for the burial plot allowance for burial \n     in State Veterans Cemeteries to include all honorably \n     discharged veterans.\n       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of our Nation's \n     veterans. Your work is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Raymond G. Boland,\n     President, NASDVA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Funeral\n\n\n                                        Directors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: The National Funeral Directors \n     Association (NFDA) represents more than 13,000 funeral homes \n     in all 50 states. It is the leading funeral service \n     organization in the United States, providing a national voice \n     for the profession. The NPDA has been the premier \n     organization chosen by top funeral directors for more than \n     120 years. NFDA members stand for credibility, ethics, \n     excellence and trust.\n       The NFDA would like to thank you for your support of \n     legislation to increase the amount paid for veteran funeral \n     and burial expenses by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (DVA), as well as to increase the amount for veteran plot \n     allowances.\n       As you are well aware, the amount payable for veterans' \n     memorial benefits has remained constant for many years in \n     spite of inflation. Today, the average cost of a funeral, \n     including casket, vault and cemetery charges is about $7,500. \n     While funerals are still a modest expense when compared to \n     the cost of other items an individual must purchase during \n     the course of their lifetime, it is still a significant \n     expense, particularly for those least able to afford it.\n       At a time of unimaginable grief, funeral directors deal \n     with the families of service members who must plan for the \n     funeral of their loved one. This process is never easy, but \n     it is even more difficult when a family must plan a funeral \n     within the current DVA funeral and burial expense limits.\n       The NFDA strongly supports legislation that recognizes the \n     reality of the cost of a funeral and burial in 2003, and that \n     seeks to help the families of veterans manage this expense.\n       Again, thank you for your interest and action on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincercly,\n                                                William A.

A bill to establish the Office of Native American Affairs \nwithin the Small Business Administration, to create the Native American \nSmall Business Development Program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I proudly join with Senator Kerry \nand Senator Smith to reintroduce the Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act. This important legislation is designed to help \nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to overcome \nbarriers which inhibit business development and job creation. We \ngreatly appreciate the support of the distinguished Senators who join \nus in sponsoring the legislation including Senators: Akaka, Baucus, \nBingaman, Daschle, Cantwell, Murray, Stabenow.\n  The communities served this initiative represent some of the most \ntraditionally isolated, disadvantaged, and underserved populations in \nour country. Despite the unique and persistent challenges to business \ndevelopment in these areas, many of the supportive services the federal \ngovernment provides to entrepreneurs are not available in these \ndistressed regions. The\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nNative American Small Business Development Act endeavors to develop and \ndisseminate culturally tailored business assistance to assure Native \nAmerican businesses may secure and sustain long-term success.\n  Native American communities continue to struggle with the social, \neconomic, and cultural repercussions derived from persistent and \npervasive poverty and unemployment. A recent report released by the \nU.S. Census Bureau, entitled Poverty in the United States: 2000, \nindicates that the ``three year average poverty rate for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives [from 1998-2000] was 25.9 percent. Higher \nthan for any other race groups.''\n  The Native American Small Business Development Act is a deliberate \neffort to enhance the availability of technical assistance to support \nentrepreneurship in Indian Country. The communities served by this \ninitiative represent some of the most traditionally isolated, \ndisadvantaged, and underserved populations in our country.\n  Too many Native American communities are plagued by feelings of \nhopelessness and helplessness. We must work to transform this \ndisappointment and discouragement into a sensible, workable, strategy \nfor economic opportunity.\n  According to U.S. Department of Commerce census data, unemployment \nrates on Indian Lands in the continental United States range up to 80 \npercent compared to 5.6 percent for the U.S. as a whole. Census data \nalso show that the poverty rate for Native Americans during the late \n1990s was 26 percent, compared to the national average of 12 percent. \nIn fact, overall, Native American household income is only three-\nquarters of the national average.\n  This disparity is particularly evident in my home state of South \nDakota where Native Americans represent over 8 percent of the State's \npopulation. While the overall State economy is relatively strong with a \nlow 3.1 percent unemployment rate, the Native American population \ncontinues to suffer. South Dakota counties with Indian Reservations are \nranked by the U.S. Census Bureau as among the most impoverished in the \nUnited States.\n  Among the achievements included in the bill is the establishment of a \nstatutory office within the U.S. Small Business Administration to focus \non concerns specific to Native American populations. The Office of \nNative American Affairs will serve as an advocate in the SBA for the \ninterests of Native Americans. In addition to administering the Native \nAmerican Development Program, the Assistant Administrator will consult \nwith Tribal Colleges, Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations \nand Native Hawaiian Organizations to enhance the development and \nimplementation of culturally specific approaches to support the growth \nand prosperity of Native American small businesses.\n  Furthermore, the Act creates the Native American Development Program \nto provide necessary business development assistance. These services \nare vital to establish and support small businesses. The Federal \nGovernment currently invests to provide these services in communities \nthroughout the country. It is past time for these services to be \nintegrated into our efforts to promote self-sufficiency and economic \ndevelopment in Indian Country.\n\n  In addition, we recognize that in order to remain competitive, \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs must be innovative and flexible to change. \nThis legislation reflects the needs of businesses, tribes, and regional \ninterests to pursue unique approaches that will complement local needs \nand improve the overall quality of services. Two pilot programs are \nintegrated in this approach to promote new and creative solutions to \nassist American Indians to awaken economic opportunities in their \ncommunities.\n  We must strive to eliminate the impediments that stifle Native \nAmerican entrepreneurs. By providing business planning services and \ntechnical assistance to potential and existing small businesses, we can \nunlock the capacity for individuals and families to pursue their dreams \nof business ownership. Not only will these efforts combat poverty and \nunemployment, but they will bring new services and opportunities to \ncommunities that enhance the quality of life for local families.\n  We must also work to improve access to investment capital to support \neconomic and community development for Native Americans. As the \nChairman of the Senate Banking Financial Institutions Subcommittee, I \nam conducting hearings last year to identify opportunities and \ntechniques which may foster greater access to capital markets for \nTribal and Native American entities.\n  Together, these initiatives will help to turn an important corner as \nwe endeavor to enhance the livelihood of the First Americans.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Udall for his leadership in the \nU.S. House of Representatives in bringing these issues to the forefront \nand for his cooperation on this historic legislation. I would like to \nthank Senator John Kerry, the Ranking Member of the Senate Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, for his hard work on this \nlegislation and his serious commitment to these critical issues. In \naddition, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Senator \nSmith for his strong support of this effort. We are grateful to the \nmany cosponsors who join us in introducing the bill today.\n  I encourage the Senate to fully consider this historic legislation \nand to work expeditiously to enact it into law. The Native American \nSmall Business Development Act will forge a more hopeful and prosperous \nfuture for Native American families and communities. By investing in \nadequate infrastructure and by making the appropriate tools available, \nwe can empower individuals to pursue, achieve, and sustain economic \nopportunities that enrich their lives and their communities. The \nAmerican dream will never be fully realized until it becomes a reality \nfor all Americans. This legislation is critical to ensuring that \neconomic growth and economic opportunity permeate the lives of Native \nAmerican families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Johnson and Smith, as well as the cosponsors of \nour legislation, Senators Akaka, Baucus, Bingaman, Cantwell, Daschle, \nMurray, and Stabenow in introducing the Native American Small Business \nDevelopment Act.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, last Congress the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship unanimously passed nearly identical \nlegislation, S. 2335, yet the bill was not taken up by the full Senate. \nToday, Senator Johnson, Senator Smith and I are reintroducing this bill \nbecause we recognize that there is an even a greater need for this \nlegislation on tribal lands across the Nation. The economy continues to \nslump, access to capital is even more limited, and state funding for \nsmall business initiatives is being pulled back.\n  According to a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ``three \nyear average poverty rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives [from \n1998-2000] was 25.9 percent. Higher than for any other race groups.'' \nWith an unemployment rate well above the national average and household \nincome at just three-quarters of the national average, Native American \ncommunities need a commitment from the Federal government that we will \nhelp them, particularly during these difficult economic times. To \nreaffirm this commitment, the Johnson-Kerry-Smith bill provides Native \nAmericans the resources they need to take advantage of the \nopportunities of entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. President, this legislation bears the same name as legislation \nthat recently passed the House, H.R. 1166, which was reintroduced by \nCongressman Tom Udall, a recognized leader in promoting the interests \nof American Indians. I would like to thank Congressman Udall for his \nwork in stewarding the Native American Small Business Development Act \nthrough the House, this Congress and last, and for his assistance in \nworking with Senators Johnson and Smith and me in drafting the Senate \nversion of our legislation. And I would specifically like to thank \nSenator Smith for his continued support on this issue.\n  I would again like to thank the National Indian Business Association, \nthe National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development, the \nAssociation of Small Business Development Centers, the Oregon Native \nAmerican Business Entrepreneurial Network (ONABEN), Native American \nManagement Services, Inc., and all of the tribes that met with us or \nprovided information to help in the drafting of this legislation.\n  The Senate version of the Native American Small Business Development \nAct, while incorporating the heart of the Udall legislation, is more \ncomprehensive and provides greater assistance to Native American \ncommunities. Senator Johnson, who serves on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and I, as the lead Democrat on the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, were able to combine the resources and \nexperiences of our committees in developing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, our need to fashion a more comprehensive business \nassistance package for Native American small businesses stems in part \nfrom a growing lack of commitment from the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) to our Native American communities under \nthis Administration.\n\n  While I applaud the Bush Administration for responding to \ncongressional requests by including $1 million in the Administration's \nFY 2003 budget request for Native American outreach, I was disappointed \nthat it did not seek the full level of $2.5 million requested in a \nletter I sent with my colleagues Senators Daschle, Wellstone, Johnson, \nBingaman and Baucus. Our request specifically sought funding for the \nSBA's Tribal Business Information Center (TBIC) program, an initiative \nstarted and successfully operated under the Clinton Administration. The \nTBIC program was designed to address the unique conditions faced by \nAmerican Indians when they seek to start or expand small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Administration has \neliminated all funding for Native American outreach in FY2004. With an \naverage unemployment rate on reservations as high as 43 percent, it is \ninconceivable that two years of outreach is sufficient to have met our \nshared goal of building sustainable economic opportunities in those \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that anyone in this Congress would \ndispute that economic development in Indian Country has often been \ndifficult to achieve and that one important way to help American \nIndians who live on reservations is to provide them with assistance to \nopen and run their own small businesses. Helping Native Americans open \nand run small businesses not only instills a sense of pride in the \nowner and his or her community, it also provides much-needed job \nopportunities, as well as other economic benefits.\n  Although underfunded, the TBIC program has provided assistance to a \nnumber of small businesses on Indian reservations. TBICs have the \nsupport of the American Indian communities they serve because they \nprovide desperately\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nneeded, culturally tailored business development assistance in those \ncommunities. The Administration should be seeking to strengthen its \ncommitment to programs that assist Native American communities. \nUnfortunately, the SBA cut off TBIC funding on March 31, 2002, and now \n14 months later, has not met a request by a bipartisan group of \nSenators to begin the reprogramming process in order to keep the TBICs \nopen.\n  The Native American Small Business Development Act will ensure that \nthe SBA's programs to assist Native American communities cannot be \ndissolved by making the SBA's Office of Native American Affairs (ONAA) \nand its Assistant Administrator permanent. Our legislation would also \ncreate a statutory grant program, known as the Native American \nDevelopment grant program, to assist Native Americans. It would also \nestablish two pilot programs to try new means of assisting Native \nAmerican communities and require Native American communities to be \nconsulted regarding the future of SBA programs designed to assist them. \nIn short, this legislation will ensure that our Native American \ncommunities receive the adequate assistance they need to help start and \ngrow small businesses.\n  The ONAA will be responsible for helping Native Americans and Native \nAmerican communities start, operate, and grow small businesses; develop \nmanagement and technical skills; seek out Federal procurement \nopportunities; increase employment opportunities through the start and \nexpansion of small business concerns; and increase their access to \ncapital markets.\n  To be selected to serve as the Assistant Administrator for ONAA, a \ncandidate must have knowledge of Native American cultures and \nexperience providing culturally tailored small business development \nassistance to Native Americans. Under our legislation, the Assistant \nAdministrator would be statutorily required to consult with Tribal \nColleges and Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and \nNative Hawaiian Organizations (NHO) when carrying out responsibilities \nunder this legislation, which would give Native American communities a \ntrue voice within the SBA. The Assistant Administrator for ONAA would \nbe responsible for administering the Native American Development \nprogram and the pilot programs created by the Native American Small \nBusiness Development Act.\n\n  The Native American Development program is designed to be the SBA's \nprimary program for providing business development assistance to Native \nAmerican communities. To offer this support, to the SBA will provide \nfinancial assistance in establish and keep Native American Business \nCenters (NABC) in operation. Financial assistance under the Native \nAmerican Development program would be available to Tribal Governments \nand Tribal Colleges. Unlike the SBA's TBIC program, however, ANCs and \nNHOs would also be eligible for the grants.\n  NABCs would address the unique conditions faced by reservation-based \nAmerican Indians, as well as Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans, in \ntheir efforts to create, develop and expand small business concerns. \nGrant funding would be used by the NABCs to provide culturally tailored \nfinancial education assistance, management education assistance, and \nmarketing education assistance.\n  The first pilot program under the legislation establishes a Native \nAmerican development grant. This grant is modeled after the Udall \nlegislation and is designed to bring the expertise of SBA's Small \nBusiness Development Centers (SBDC) to Native American Communities. \nAdditionally, any private nonprofit organization, which has members of \nan Indian tribe comprising a majority of its board of governors or is \nan NHO or an ANC, may also apply for the grant. Nonprofits were \nincluded in the Senate version thanks to the thoughtful input of \nSenator Cantwell. Many American Indian communities in Washington state \nare served by an organization called ONABEN, which provides SBDC-like \nservices to Native American communities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, \nand California. Organizations like ONABEN, which also has the strong \nsupport of Senator Smith, should be encouraged to continue their good \nwork assisting Native American communities, and including them in the \ngrant program available to SBDCs was an important addition to the \nlegislation.\n  Finally, our legislation establishes a second pilot program to try a \nunique experiment in Indian Country. Grant funding would be made \navailable to establish American Indian Tribal Assistance Centers. These \ncenters will consist of joint entitles, such as a partnership between \nan NABC, a Native American development center (which receive grants \nfrom the Department of Commerce) and possibly an SBDC. The purpose of \nthis grant is to coordinate experts from various entities to provide \nculturally tailored business development assistance to prospective and \ncurrent owners of small business concerns on or near Tribal Lands.\n  Mr. President, I would again like to thank Senators Johnson and Smith \nand all of the cosponsors of this important legislation to assist our \nNative American communities. I would also, again like to thank \nCongressman Udall for taking the lead in the House on providing \ncritical assistance for small businesses in Native American \ncommunities. I would urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation to help us fulfill our commitment to Native American \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1127. A bill to establish administrative law judges involved in \nthe appeals process provided for under the medicare program under title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, to ensure the independence of, and preserve the role \nof, such administrative law judges, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Fair and \nImpartial Rights, FAIR, for Medicare Act and bring attention to growing \nconcerns I have heard about the possible politicization of the Medicare \nappeals process.\n  The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, has indicated that the Administration would like to alter the \ncurrent practice of requiring that Medicare beneficiaries or Medicare \nproviders be granted a hearing before an independent Administrative Law \nJudge, ALJ, when their initial claim is denied.\n  Instead of taking the side of beneficiaries and providers, this \nproposed action would seek to inject political interference in the \nMedicare appeals process to try to deny benefits to claimants. When \nMedicare beneficiaries and Medicare providers are denied payment for \nservices, the 2000 BIPA law allows them a five-step process for them to \nappeal this decision.\n  Unfortunately, the first two steps of this appeals process has been \nworking against beneficiaries and providers. In the last five years, \nALJs have reversed 53 percent of these preliminary rulings. This means \nthat 53 percent of all cases were decided incorrectly by the \npreliminary steps in the Medicare appeals process. It was only when \nbeneficiaries or providers appealed to an independent ALJ that they \nreceived the proper ruling.\n  ALJs serve an essential role in the claims review process because \nthere is often conflicting and confusing information to guide \nbeneficiaries and providers. In its 2001 report as part of its ongoing \nreview of CMS communications, the General Accounting office described \nthe information CMS's carriers gives to providers as ``often \nincomplete, confusing, out of date, or even incorrect.'' GAO found that \n``the norm'' for many carriers were documents over 50 pages that \n``often contained long articles, written in dense language and printed \nin small type.'' Documents ``were also poorly organized, making it \ndifficult for a physician to identify relevant or new information.'' \nALJs base their decisions on administrative rules, which have the \nbenefit of being open to public comment and review, as well as case law \nand statutes.\n  Unfortunately, the Administration is seeking to undermine the \nindependent role of ALJs who hear Medicare cases and replace ALJs with \nFederal employees, perhaps even political appointees,\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\nwith closer ties to the Administration's policy goals. The \nAdministration's plan is not just an abstract proposal. It would hurt \nMedicare beneficiaries and Medicare providers.\n  The FAIR for Medicare Act would stop this political attempt to weaken \nthe role of independent ALJs. Specifically, it would: Prohibit non-\nALJs, like political appointees, from performing the duties of ALJs. \nTransfer Medicare ALJs from the Social Security Administration to the \nDepartment of HHS, just like a bipartisan bill introduced in the House \nby Congresswoman Nancy Johnson. Ensure ALJs are organizationally and \nfunctionally separated from CMS and all other political appointees \nother than the Secretary of HHS.\n  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Nancy Johnson, and it received bipartisan support. I \nhope that my proposal will achieve the same result.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and several \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

They must follow the Medicare law and rules, but \n     are insulated from political pressures and sudden shifts in \n     policy made by presidential appointees.\n       President Bush is proposing both legislation and rules that \n     would limit the judges' independence and could replace them \n     in many cases.\n       The administration's draft legislation says, ``The \n     secretary of health and human services may use alternate \n     mechanisms in lieu of administrative law judge review'' to \n     resolve disputes over Medicare coverage.\n       Under the legislative proposal, cases could be decided by \n     arbitration or mediation or by lawyers or hearing officers at \n     the Department of Health and Human Services. The department \n     recently began testing the use of arbitration in Connecticut \n     under a law that permits demonstration projects.\n       Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human \n     services, said the proposed legislative changes would give \n     his agency ``flexibility to reform the appeals system'' so \n     the government could decide cases in a more ``efficient and \n     effective manner.''\n       The department said there was an ``urgent need for \n     improvements to the Medicare claim appeal system,'' in part \n     because the number of appeals was rising rapidly.\n       Consumer groups, administrative law judges and lawyers \n     denounced the proposals. Judith A. Stein, Director of the \n     Center for Medicare Advocacy in Willimantic, Conn., said, \n     ``The president's proposals would compromise the independence \n     of administrative law judges, who have protected \n     beneficiaries in case after case, year after year.''\n       Beneficiaries have a personal stake in the issue. When \n     claims are denied, a beneficiary is often required to pay \n     tens of thousands of dollars for services already received. \n     In a typical case, an administrative law judge ordered \n     Medicare to pay for 230 home care visits to a 67-year-old \n     woman with breast cancer, heart disease and arthritis. \n     Medicare officials had said the woman should pay the cost. \n     But the judge ordered Medicare to pay because the woman was \n     homebound and the services were ``reasonable and necessary.''\n       When federal agencies issue rules or decide cases; they \n     generally must follow the Administrative Procedure Act, a \n     1946 law intended to guarantee the fairness of government \n     proceedings.\n       Ronald G. Bernoski, president of the Association of \n     Administrative Law Judges, said: ``We see President Bush's \n     proposals as a serious assault on the Administrative \n     Procedure Act, a stealth attack on the rights of citizens to \n     fair, impartial hearings. These hearings guarantee due \n     process of law, as required by the Constitution.''\n       The American Bar Association and the Federal Bar \n     Association, which represents lawyers who practice in federal \n     courts and before federal agencies, have expressed similar \n     concerns.\n       Health care providers, which are involved in many of the \n     appeals, share those concerns.\n       Robert L. Roth, a Washington lawyer who has represented \n     hospitals and suppliers of medical equipment, said: ``The \n     interests of providers and beneficiaries are aligned. Access \n     to an independent decision maker, an administrative law \n     judge, is quite valuable because it's often your first \n     opportunity to get a fair review of government action.''\n       Medicare officials could adopt the proposed rules, \n     regardless of whether Congress accepts Mr. Bush's \n     recommendation for changes in the law.\n       The proposed rules would require administrative law judges \n     to ``give deference'' to policies adopted by Medicare and its \n     contractors, which review and pay claims for the government. \n     Beneficiaries would have to show why such policies should be \n     disregarded,\n       That would be a significant change. Administrative law \n     judges are now required to follow Medicare statutes and \n     regulations, but not the agency's policies. As a result, the \n     judges often grant benefits previously denied by the Medicare \n     agency or its contractors.\n       In the Connecticut experiment, arbitration will be used to \n     resolve some claims disputes, and beneficiaries may opt out. \n     If this approach produces prompt, fair decisions with less \n     paperwork, it could be a model for Congress in changing the \n     appeals process.\n       But Matthew L. Spitzer, dean of the University of Southern \n     California Law School, said that consumers ``should think \n     long and hard before they agree to binding arbitration.'' It \n     is, he said, extremely difficult for an individual to \n     overturn an arbitrator's decision.\n       Ms. Stein, who has represented Medicare patients in \n     hundreds of cases, agreed. ``The president proposes replacing \n     administrative law judges with some form of dispute \n     resolution,'' Ms. Stein said. ``This puts beneficiaries at a \n     disadvantage, with unequal bargaining power and inadequate \n     expertise to do battle with the Medicare agency.''\n       The judges are full-time government employees who typically \n     receive salaries of $95,000 to $140,000 a year.\n       To ensure that federal agency hearings would be fair, \n     Congress in 1946 protected the decision makers, providing \n     that they could be dismissed or demoted ``only for good \n     cause.'' The judges who hear Medicare cases have extra \n     protection because they are employed by the Social Security \n     Administration, an independent agency.\n       Congress revamped the appeals process in 2000, to enhance \n     the rights of beneficiaries and to expedite decisions. The \n     changes were supposed to take effect in October 2002. But \n     Medicare officials said that without more money, they could \n     not meet the new deadlines, so they have postponed many of \n     the changes.\n       Medicare officials said they wanted to end the arrangement \n     under which Social Security judges decide Medicare cases. \n     They have announced plans to transfer responsibility for \n     hearing appeals to the Medicare agency from Social Security, \n     and they hope to do so by Oct. 1.\n       A bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Nancy L. \n     Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, would make the transfer \n     in 2005. The bill requires the secretary of health and human \n     services to preserve the judge's role as independent decision \n     makers.\n       The potential for conflict seems to be inherent in the \n     relationship between agency\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\n     officials and administrative law judges, with tensions \n     flaring periodically. In 1983, the Association of \n     Administrative Law Judges filed a lawsuit, saying that Social \n     Security officials appointed by President Ronald Reagan had \n     put improper pressure on them to deny benefits to people with \n     disabilities.\n       A Federal District Court found that Social Security had \n     engaged in practices ``of dubious legality,'' which tended to \n     encroach on the judges' independence. The agency halted the \n     practices after the lawsuit was filed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, March 20, 2003]\n\n                                 Tilt!\n\n\n           medicare looks to rig appeals system in its favor\n\n       If the score's going against you, just change the rules of \n     the game.\n       That is, if you're president.\n       The Bush administration's plan to rework the appeals \n     process for Medicare recipients denied treatment appear to be \n     just that: a rules change that tilts the playing field.\n       In losing thousands of these appeal annually, the federal \n     government is being ordered to pay millions of dollars for \n     health-care services.\n       So administration officials start calling for ``flexibility \n     to reform the appeals system.'' Translation: We want to win \n     more cases and pay out less.\n       It's not as though the appeals process is a runaway train; \n     in the last year, only a little more than half the cases were \n     won by Medicare recipients. But nearly 40,000 appeals were \n     upheld; put another way, that means 40,000 elderly citizens \n     had been improperly denied care.\n       It wasn't for face lifts or tummy tucks, either. Rather, it \n     was for things that make all the difference to frail seniors, \n     things like home health assistance and skilled nursing care.\n       Independent administrative judges handle these appeals now. \n     Under proposed new rules, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services could steer the cases into arbitration or \n     mediation--both of which experts view as less likely to favor \n     the citizens.\n       The administration also wants to turn the independent \n     judges into Medicare employees--and to require them to ``give \n     deference'' to policies adopted under Medicare.\n       At this rate, why not drop all pretense and just ban \n     appeals? That way every Medicare recipient--including those \n     much-coveted Florida voters--would know exactly where they \n     stand with this White House.\n       Medicare's money troubles are real enough. But trimming \n     expenses by undercutting a fair appeals process is wrong. And \n     to pursue this policy while seeking huge tax cuts and \n     claiming to attend to seniors' health care needs is cynical.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From The Seattle Times, May 7, 2003]\n\n             Medicare Appeal Process Should not be Weakened\n\n                         (By Kathleen O'Connor)\n\n       With our focus riveted on Iraq and the state's dramatic \n     budget shortfalls, virtually no attention is being paid to \n     the proposed, ominous changes in Medicare. No, not the \n     Medicare prescription-drug benefit that hogs headlines. It's \n     something more dramatic, more important. The proposed changes \n     could essentially eliminate Medicare due process.\n       How? By removing the independence of the administrative law \n     judges who now hear Medicare appeals and by axing most of the \n     current terms and conditions under which those appeals can be \n     made. The Bush administration wants to let the secretary of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) use \n     arbitration or mediation and--get this--lawyers or hearing \n     officers inside the HHS to make decisions on Medicare \n     appeals. This means appeals would no longer be heard by \n     independent judges in a separate agency. Instead, appeals \n     would be heard in-house by Medicare employees.\n       Nothing like letting the fox guard the hen house. Where is \n     due process or equal protection in this? How can inside \n     gatekeepers be fair? How do you hear an appeal when your job \n     is to guard the treasury? How long would these Medicare \n     employee-judges keep their jobs if they keep agreeing that \n     the beneficiaries are right, as they have been in over 50 \n     percent of the appeals?\n       Even as far back as 1996, the Office of the Inspector \n     General--the internal audit arm of HHS that manages \n     Medicare--found that Medicare was dead wrong in 55 percent of \n     the claims it processed. Recent data cited in The New York \n     Times revealed that over half the appeals in the past five \n     years eventually were found to be in the beneficiaries' \n     favor. In 2002 alone, Medicare beneficiaries and their \n     providers prevailed in almost 40,000 of the 77,000 appeals \n     that were filed, or 52 percent of the time.\n       What's remarkable about this is that Medicare appeals had \n     to have been lost at two lower levels before the \n     beneficiaries even got to these judges. The 1946 \n     Administrative Procedure Act was designed to assure we have \n     fair and just recourse when we have complaints against the \n     government.\n       Since the creation of Medicare, appeals have been heard \n     before these administrative law judges and have been based on \n     Medicare laws and regulations rather than internal Medicare \n     policies that frequently change with each administration. If \n     the appeals function is brought in-house, independent appeals \n     would vanish and coverage decisions could be made by the whim \n     of an internal policy, whether written or not. Worse yet, the \n     administration says these changes don't really need \n     congressional approval and can simply be made by procedural \n     rules that would have the administrative law judges ``give \n     deference'' to Medicare's policies and those of Medicare \n     contractors.\n       What this really means is the burden of proof would be \n     placed on the harmed beneficiaries and their providers, who \n     would have to show why these policies should be ignored. Why \n     does this matter? Follow the money. Let's take a look at what \n     Medicare covers. Part A pays for inpatient hospital care, \n     skilled nursing home care, home health care and hospice \n     stays. Part B basically covers all outpatient care (doctors) \n     and outpatient hospital services, cancer screening, lab tests \n     and medical equipment, such as wheel chairs.\n       Take the case of Mrs. H in Brooklyn, N.Y. She sought \n     coverage for a prescribed transcutaneous electronic nerve \n     stimulator (TENS) to treat her fibromyalgia, a chronic \n     disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and \n     fatigue. Medicare initially denied coverage for this device, \n     noting that the information provided did not support the need \n     for the item. Mrs. H appealed and was denied at what's called \n     the fair hearing level, based on internal coverage \n     guidelines. After that denial, the appeal went to an \n     administrative law judge for an independent ruling. The judge \n     found in Mrs. H's favor, deeming the device to be ``medically \n     necessary.''\n       The finding provided on $646, but when you're poor and \n     living on Social Security, $600 is a lot of money. Other \n     findings are in the tens of thousands of dollars. How many \n     internal Medicare judge employees would be that independent? \n     Administrative law judges can be dismissed ``only for good \n     cause.'' If the appeals function is an in-house post, the \n     employee decision-maker can be transferred or reassigned. The \n     administration law judges can be dismissed ``only for good \n     cause.'' If the appeals function is an in-house post, the \n     employee decision-maker can be transferred or reassigned. The \n     administration will say it is only making ``procedural \n     changes''; that an appeals process still ``exists.'' Sure, \n     but it is one that harms rather than helps the beneficiary. \n     They may say there is still due process. But it will no \n     longer be an independent review. Not any real due process. \n     Which is the issue after all. As a friend is fond of saying: \n     ``Token due process is not due process at all.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kohl:\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code with \nrespect to the dismissal of certain involuntary cases; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Involuntary \nBankruptcy Improvement Act,'' along with Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and my colleague Senator Kohl, the \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin. This bill addresses the growing problem \nof the use of involuntary bankruptcy petitions as a means to harass \npublic officials. A similar bill has been introduced in the other body \nby the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. I believe this bill \nshould be enacted on its own as soon as possible or, if necessary, be a \npart of any bankruptcy-related legislation that goes through the \nCongress this year.\n  Involuntary bankruptcy petitions are a rarely used, but legitimate, \ncreditor tool to prevent the wasting of an asset that would otherwise \nbe available to satisfy creditor claims. Unfortunately, tax protestors \nand others with real or imagined grievances against the government have \nfiled fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petitions against government \nofficials as a way to harass and harm them. This problem came to my \nattention recently because of a case in my home State of Wisconsin.\n  In that case, a man named Steven Magritz undertook a vendetta against \nthirty-six Ozaukee County officials after the County pursued a \nforeclosure action against him for failing to pay taxes by filing \ninvoluntary bankruptcy petitions against those officials. Although the \npetitions were ultimately dismissed and Magritz was convicted of \ncriminal slander and sentenced to five years in prison, the petitions \nhad, and are still having, an impact on the credit ratings of the \nofficials.\n  Current law provides for punitive damages to be assessed against \nsomeone who files an erroneous petition of this kind. But because \nbankruptcy filings are public records and credit reporting agencies \ninclude information in their reports for ten years, erroneous or \nfraudulent filings can have a devastating impact on the credit ratings \nof the individuals involved even if the perpetrator is punished. The \nlocal government officials that were the subject of this vendetta have \nhad great difficulty in obtaining loans or refinancing their homes.\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\n  Although a comprehensive study of this problem has not been done, I \nunderstand that fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petitions have been \nfiled against federal district court judges in Ohio and Maine, a U.S. \nAttorney in Maine, and IRS agents in Ohio. A district in California \nreported that over 10 percent of the involuntary bankruptcy petitions \nfiled in recent years were likely filed in bad faith.\n  The bill I am introducing today will address this problem in two \nways. First, it requires the bankruptcy court on motion of the debtor \nto expunge from the court's file all records relating to the filing of \nan involuntary petition and any references to such petition, if 1. the \ndebtor is an individual; 2. the petition is dismissed; and 3. the \npetition is false or contains a materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement.\n  Second, the bill authorizes a bankruptcy court to prohibit credit \nreporting agencies from issuing a consumer report that contains any \ninformation relating to an involuntary bankruptcy petition or to the \ncase commenced by such petition where the debtor is an individual and \nthe court has dismissed the petition.\n  These steps will retain involuntary bankruptcy as a legitimate tool \nto preserve debtor assets, but will allow the courts to address the \nreal harm that can befall an innocent victim of harassment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this reasonable and necessary reform of the \nbankruptcy laws. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Involuntary Bankruptcy \n     Improvement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INVOLUNTARY CASES.\n\n       Section 303 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l)(1) If--\n       ``(A) the petition under this section is false or contains \n     any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement;\n       ``(B) the debtor is an individual; and\n       ``(C) the court dismisses such petition;\n\n     the court, upon motion of the debtor, shall expunge from the \n     records of the court such petition, all the records relating \n     to such petition in particular, and all references to such \n     petition.\n       ``(2) If the debtor is an individual and the court \n     dismisses a petition under this section, the court may enter \n     an order prohibiting all consumer reporting agencies (as \n     defined in section 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f))) from making any consumer report (as \n     defined in section 603(d) of that Act) that contains any \n     information relating to such petition or to the case \n     commenced by the filing of such petition.''.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators \nLeahy and Feingold in introducing the Involuntary Bankruptcy \nImprovement Act of 2003.\n  This bill responds to an unfortunate abuse of the involuntary \nbankruptcy laws which occurred in my home state of Wisconsin last year. \nThere, a tax protestor filed involuntary bankruptcy petitions against \n36 public officials. Even though none of the filings had any merit, the \nprotestor succeeded in ruining the credit ratings of many of the public \nofficials by filing what the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel described as \n``an avalanche of legal documents against them.'' Some of the victims \ndid not even know they were the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy \ncase until they tried to use their lines of credit or obtain credit.\n  Involuntary bankruptcy plays an important role in our system, but \nwhen it is abused by frivolous and fraudulent filings the victims \ndeserve the right to clear their good names.\n  Some background on involuntary bankruptcy is in order. Under current \nlaw, one or more creditors can file an involuntary bankruptcy petition \nagainst an individual or corporation. The credit problems were created \nbecause the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy case is a matter of \npublic record pursuant to bankruptcy code section 107. In addition, \ncredit reporting agencies include the filing on a person's credit \nreport for up to ten years.\n  The abuse of the involuntary bankruptcy laws is not common, but the \nWisconsin case is not unique either. The National Conference of \nBankruptcy Clerks advises that after an initial review, they found that \nfederal district judges in Ohio and Maine have been the subject of \ninvoluntary petitions, as well as a United States Attorney in Maine, \nand two IRS agents in Ohio. Finally, the bankruptcy clerk in the \nCentral District of California reported that approximately 11 percent \nof involuntary petitions were bad faith filings over a 27 month period \nending in March 2003.\n  This bill addresses the problem in two primary ways. First, it amends \nthe bankruptcy code to require that on the motion of the debtor that \nthe bankruptcy courts expunge from the courts file all records relating \nto the filing of an involuntary petition under certain conditions. \nThose conditions are: (1) the petition is false or contains a \nmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement, (2) the debtor \nis an individual; and (3) the petition is dismissed.\n  Second, the bill amends the bankruptcy code to authorize a bankruptcy \ncourt to prohibit all credit reporting agencies from issuing a consumer \nreport that contains any information relating to the involuntary \nbankruptcy petition or to the case commenced by such petition where the \ndebtor is an individual and the court has dismissed the petition.\n  So while this bill cannot prohibit someone from filing involuntary \nbankruptcy petitions like the man in Wisconsin, it can make it \nsignificantly easier for the victim to contain the impact on his or her \ncredit rating and to remove the unfortunate incident from the record.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Chairman Sensenbrenner is moving the \nsame bill on the House side. I look forward to working with him and my \nSenate cosponsors to get this important change to the bankruptcy code \ninto law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1129. A bill to provide for the protection of unaccompanied alien \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \n``Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2003,'' bipartisan \nlegislation to reform the way the Federal Government treats \nunaccompanied alien children who are in Federal immigration custody. I \nam pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Brownback, \nVoinovich, Kennedy, Cantwell, DeWine, Feingold, and Lautenberg in \nintroducing this important measure.\n  Approximately 5,000 foreign-born children under the age of 18 enter \nthe United States each year unaccompanied by parents or other legal \nguardians. These children are among the most vulnerable of the \nimmigrant population.\n  Many have often entered the country under traumatic circumstances. \nThey are young and alone, subject to abuse and exploitation. They are \noften unable to articulate their fears, their views, or testify to \ntheir needs as accurately as adults can.\n  Despite these facts, U.S. Immigration laws and policies have been \ndeveloped and implemented without regard for their effect on children, \nparticularly on unaccompanied alien children.\n  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed primarily for adults, even though they lack \nthe capacity to understand nuances legal principles and procedures. \nChildren who may very well be eligible for relief are often vulnerable \nto being deported back to the very life-threatening situations from \nwhich they fled--before they are even able to make their cases before \nthe Department of Homeland Security or an immigration judge.\n  Prior to March 1, 2003, the Immigration Naturalization Service, INS, \nhad responsibility for the care, custody, and treatment of \nunaccompanied alien children. Too often, the INS, fell short in \nfulfilling the protection side of these responsibilities.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today builds on Section 462 of \nPublic Law 107-296, the ``Homeland Security Act of 2002'', which \nprovided for the transfer of responsibility for the care\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nand placement of unaccompanied alien children from the now-abolished \nINS to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, within the Department \nof Health and Human Services. This provision was based on S. 121, \ncomprehensive legislation relating to unaccompanied alien children that \nI introduced at the beginning of the 107th Congress.\n  With the enactment of the Homeland Security Act, we set into motion \nthe centralization of responsibility for the care and custody of \nunaccompanied alien children in the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The \nfirst phase of this transfer of responsibility occurred on March 1, \n2003. Once the transition is completed, we have finally resolved the \nconflict of interest inherent in the former system.\n  I am pleased that the provision transferring responsibility for the \ncare and custody of unaccompanied alien children was contained in the \nHomeland Security Act. Its inclusion in the new law was an important \nfirst step in reforming the way unaccompanied alien children are \ntreated. It was a key provision for two reasons: First, it will help \nensure that the Secretary of Homeland Security is not burdened with \npolicy issues unrelated to the threat of terrorism. The new Department \nhas a huge and important mission and its attention should be focused on \nthat mission. Second, it recognizes that the Federal Government has a \nspecial responsibility to protect these children who are in federal \ncustody. The INS did not always live up that responsibility.\n  But, the transfer of authority to the ORR--by itself--is not enough \nto ensure that these children are properly treated. Congress now has a \nresponsibilty to go beyond the simple transfer and set the priorities \nfor ORR and its new jurisdiction over unaccompanied foreign-born \nminors.\n  A number of other important reforms that were contained in last \nyear's S. 121 were left out of the Homeland Security Act. Enactment of \nthese reforms will be crucial if we truly are to reform the manner in \nwhich these children are treated. As I mentioned, the Unaccompanied \nAlien Child Protection Act of 2003 builds on the Homeland Security Act \nin two ways: First, it would make a number of technical and conforming \nchanges in law to bring about the smooth transfer of the INS's \nunaccompanied alien child-related functions to ORR. Second, it would \nmake a number of more substantive reforms in law with respect the \nrespect to the treatment of these children--reforms that are designed \nto ensure that such children are treated with fairness and compassion.\n  Other provisions include those that would keep children who are \ncriminals or who pose a threat to national security under the custody \nof the Department of Homeland Security rather than transfer \nresponsibility of them to the ORR.\n\n  I first became involved in this issue when I heard about a young 15-\nyear old Chinese girl who stood before a U.S. immigration court facing \ndeportation proceedings. She had found her way to the United States as \na stowaway in a container ship captured off of Guam, hoping to escape \nthe repression she had experienced in her home country.\n  She had been placed on a boat bound for the United States by her very \nown parents, fleeing China's rigid family planning laws, Under these \nlaws, she was denied citizenship, education, and medical care. She came \nto this country alone and desperate.\n  And what did our immigration authorities do when they found her? The \nINS detained her in a juvenile jail in Portland, OR, for 8 months \nbefore her asylum hearing, and 4 months after she was granted asylum.\n  At her asylum hearing, the young girl stood before a judge, \nunrepresented by counsel, confused, and unable to understand the \nproceedings against her. She could not wipe away the tears from her \nface because her hands were chained to her waist. According to a lawyer \nwho later came to represent her, ``her only crime was that her parents \nhad put her on a boat so she could get a better life over here.''\n  While the young girl eventually received asylum in our country, she \nunnecessarily faced an ordeal no child should bear under our \nimmigration system. This young Chinese girl represents only one of \n5,000 foreign-born children who, without parents or legal guardians to \nprotect them, are discovered in the United States each year in need of \nprotection. This, is unacceptable treatment. We have a responsibility \nto do better than this.\n  Central throughout the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of \n2003 are two concepts: 1. The United States Government has a \nfundamental responsibility to protect unaccompanied children in its \ncustody; and 2. in all proceedings and actions, the government should \nhave as a high priority protecting the interests of these children, \nmost of whom are unable to understand the nature of the proceedings in \nwhich they are involved.\n  This bill would ensure that children who are apprehended by \nimmigration authorities are treated humanely and appropriately \nby: ensuring that eligible unaccompanied alien children are promptly \nplaced in the custody of Office of Refugee Resettlement after they are \nencountered by immigration officials; ensuring that the children have \ncounsel to represent them in immigration proceedings and matters; \nauthorizing the Director of ORR to provide guardians ad litem for the \nchildren to look after their interests; establishing clear guidelines \nand uniformity for detention alternatives such as shelter care, foster \ncare, and other child custody arrangements; establishing minimum \nstandards for detention and alternative settings that take into account \nthe special needs of children; improving such children's access to \nexisting options for permanent protection when U.S. immigration and \nchild welfare authorities believe such protection is warranted; setting \nforth procedures that immigration officers should follow when \napprehending unaccompanied alien children at the United states border \nor at United States ports of entry; establishing procedures to ensure \nthat the true age of an alien who claims to be under the age of 18 is \ndetermined; ensuring that the Department of Homeland Security, rather \nthan the Office of Refugee Resettlement, maintain custody over children \nwho are either criminals or threats to national security; and \nestablishing procedures to ensure that certain unaccompanied alien \nchildren from Mexico or Canada, encountered along the United States \nborder, are returned to their homes, subject to formal agreements \nbetween the United States and those countries providing for their safe \nreturn without undue delay.\n\n  Without enactment of my legislation, none of these important \nparameters would be placed on the Office of Refugee Resettlement or the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  This bill also includes provisions that provide for the safety of the \nsignificant number of unaccompanied alien children who are victims of \nsmuggling or trafficking rings. For example, 2 years ago, Phanupong \nKhaisri, a 2-year old Thai child, was brought to the United States by \ntwo individuals falsely claiming to be his parents, but who were \nactually part of a major alien trafficking ring.\n  The INS was prepared to deport the child back to Thailand. It was not \nuntil Members of Congress and the local Thai community had intervened, \nhowever, that the INS decided to allow the child to remain in the \nUnited States until the agency could provide proper medical attention \nand determine what course of action would be in his best interest.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act aims to prevent \nsituations like this from recurring. Moreover, the legislation would \nensure that children are released into safe and humane environments \nwhile awaiting a determination of their status when that is \nappropriate, and it would ensure that the children are protected from \nsmugglers, traffickers, or others who might exploit them.\n  Further, it would require the ORR to take steps to ensure that \nunaccompanied alien children are protected from smugglers or others who \nmay wish to do them harm, and authorizes reimbursement for State and \nlocal expenses associated with caring for unaccompanied alien children.\n  Children, even more than adults, have incredible difficulty \nunderstanding the complexities of the immigration system without the \nassistance of counsel. Despite this reality, most children in \nimmigration custody are overlooked and unrepresented. Without legal \nrepresentation, children are at risk of being returned to their home\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\ncountries where they may face further human rights abuses.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 20032 would require \nthat all unaccompanied alien children in Federal custody by reason of \ntheir immigration status have counsel to represent them in any \nimmigration proceedings involving them. It would vest in the Director \nof ORR responsibility for ensuring that the children have counsel, and \nit would provide the Director power to establish an infrastructure for \ndeveloping a system to recruit and support pro bono counsel who can \nrepresent these children without cost to them or to the government.\n  It provides, as a last resort, that counsel could be provided for the \nchildren at government expense, capping the fees that such counsel \ncould charge in the event that the government pays for such counsel.\n  This bill would authorize, but not mandate, the Director of ORR to \nput into place a system of guardians ad litem who would help the court \nin determining the best interests of children in U.S. custody.\n  The vast majority of unaccompanied alien children have been forced to \nmaneuver the immigration system without any representation or without \nany assistance. This is unacceptable. It results in many children \nparticipating in a system without any understanding of the process they \nare undergoing or the ramifications of their situation.\n\n  Under this section, the guardian ad litem would not be working ``for \nthe child.'' Nor would he or she be working for the Department of \nHomeland Security. Instead, he or she would be an impartial observer \nreporting to the court and to the Office of Refugee Resettlement on \nwhat he or she thinks is in the best interest of the child.\n  The guardians ad litem system could be modeled after any of a number \nof systems already existing in juvenile courts throughout the American \njuvenile justice system. This system is not a novel legal concept, but \none that is trusted and already in place in every state in proceedings \ninvolving juveniles.\n  Imagine the fear of a foreign-born child, in the United States alone \nwithout a parent or guardian. Imagine that child being thrust into a \nsystem she did not understand, given no legal aid, placed in jail that \nhoused juveniles with serious criminal convictions. Mr. President, I \nfind it hard to believe that our country would have allowed innocent \nchildren to be treated in such a manner.\n  That is why my colleagues and I are introducing this legislation \ntoday. The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2003 will help \nour country fulfill the special obligation to these children.\n  I am proud to have the support of the United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nthe Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the American Bar \nAssociation, the United National High Commissioner for Refugees, and \nmany other organizations with whom I have worked closely to develop \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring this important \nmeasure and ensuring that these reforms are finally enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this title shall take effect as if \n     enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \n     U.S.C. 101 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Feinstein and Voinovich, to introduce this \nimportant piece of legislation that will address an area of our \nimmigration law that is sorely neglected--unaccompanied alien children. \nCurrently, these children face a legal loophole that can leave them in \na confusing maze of technicalities, none of which actually help the \nchild or the nation. This bill will fix that problem through several \nvery straightforward remedies.\n  Last year, through the Homeland Security Act, the responsibility for \nthe care and custody of unaccompanied alien children was transferred \nfrom the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services's Office of Refugee \nResettlement. This was an important step in the right direction, but it \ndid not accomplish everything we had hoped to do last year. That is why \nI am pleased to join my colleagues in taking one more crack at \nproviding safeguards for these vulnerable children.\n  These safeguards are simple, but to the point. This legislation will \nensure that the transfer of responsibilities mandated last year \nactually occurs in an orderly manner. It will remind Federal \nauthorities to keep in mind the special needs and circumstances of \nunaccompanied children. It will ensure that these children have access \nto competent counsel and guardians ad litem when appropriate. Minimum \nstandards for the care and custody of these unaccompanied alien \nchildren will be established, and the procedures for access to \npermanent protection for abused, abandoned or neglected children will \nbe reformed. Finally, the legislation will require an annual report to \nCongress to ensure these provisions are being carried out faithfully.\n  But that is all simply the legalese surrounding this issue. What's \ntruly important are the children. That's the whole point of this \nlegislation, and why I--and all of my colleagues who are cosponsors--\ngot involved and are committed to seeing this legislation pass. It is \nthe children who suffer, through no fault of their own, if they're run \nthrough the legal system in the United States without any accounting \nfor their unique situation as children.\n  Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this \ntopic, inviting Senator Feinstein to speak--her testimony and the \ntestimony of the children who came, moved me to cosponsor the bill that \nvery day. I still remember the story the Senator told of a young girl \nfrom China, standing before a judge, unable to speak the language, her \narms shackled to her sides, crying. That sort of situation is shameful.\n  Or how about the case of Edwin Munoz, a Honduran youth who testified \nlast year during this hearing? His story was simple but appalling: \nabandoned by his parents at age 7, he was left in the care of a cousin, \nwho beat him mercilessly. At 13, he finally escaped, and hitchhiked \nalone to the United States. I can only imagine how frightening that \nexperience was--but unfortunately it was only the start: once he \narrived in the U.S., he was thrown into a San Diego juvenile facility \nfilled with violent offenders. Without a lawyer or court-appointed \nguardian for weeks, this became a nightmare of taunts from the other \ninmates and being shackled each time he had to appear in court.\n  These are children--not common criminals--and they should not be \ntreated as such. They should be treated as children.\n  The main purpose of our legislation is to ensure just that--that \nchildren who come to the United States are still treated as children. \nThat does not mean that they will escape a proper and appropriate \naccounting and ruling on whether they may stay or not--it simply means \nthat their age and circumstances will be considered at all times.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this critically important \nlegislation. We are still the Nation described upon the Statue of \nLiberty--let's ensure our legal system remembers this point as well.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nFeinstein in the introduction of the Unaccompanied Alien Child \nProtection Act, and I commend her long-standing commitment to this \nissue.\n  In recent years, increasing numbers of foreign-born children have \ncome to the United States, unaccompanied by their parents or their \nguardians. Last year, more than 5,000 arrived, and the numbers have \ncontinued to rise this year. Some are fleeing from armed conflict or \nother dangerous conditions in their home countries. Others are fleeing \nfrom human rights abuses, including forced recruitment as soldiers, \nslavery, child labor, prostitution, or forced marriage. Still others \nescape to the United States because they have been abused or abandoned \nby their parents or care givers. Additional numbers are brought to the \nUnited States by a family friend or relative, by paid smugglers, or by \ntraffickers involved in organized crime.\n  Regardless of how they arrive, these children often enter our country \nafter traumatic experiences, speaking little to no English, and unaware \nof their rights under U.S. law. They may well be good candidates for \nasylum, but they have no way to apply for it, and they are left to \nrepresent themselves in an immigration court against experienced trial \nlawyers for INS.\n  Their plight is exacerbated by the fact that when they arrive, they \nare frequently detained. Many of them languish for long periods in \nshelters designed for short-term use, without access to translators, \ntelephones, or medical care and other vital services. But these are the \n``fortunate'' ones, compared to many others detained, with dangerous \ncriminals, put in handcuffs, shackles, strip-searched, and required to \nwear prison uniforms.\n  Shamefully, this is happening every day in the United States of \nAmerica. It's no wonder other countries criticize us for hypocrisy on \nhuman rights.\n  Last year, in the Homeland Security Act, we took the important first \nstep of transferring responsibility for the care and custody of these \nchildren to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. This office has decades of experience \nworking with foreign-born children and can easily include the care of \nthese unaccompanied children in its existing functions.\n  That Act, however, left out critical safeguards for these children. \nThe legislation we are introducing corrects these omissions. It \naddresses many of the problems facing unaccompanied children and will \nhelp bring our treatment of them in line with international standards.\n  Essential to these efforts is providing an appointed counsel and a \nspecial guardian to assist them. Statistics demonstrate that \napplications for asylum are four times more likely to be granted when \nrepresented by counsel. Yet, less than half of the children in INS \ncustody are represented by an attorney.\n  Children are given appointed counsel in important non-immigration \ncases, and they should be afforded the same right in immigration cases. \nIn addition, a special guardian can be indispensable in identifying the \nneeds of a child when language and cultural barriers prevent an \nattorney from communicating effectively with the child.\n  Our bill will require that these vulnerable children receive the \nrepresentation they need to see that their rights are protected, and \nthe care they deserve to see their needs are properly considered as \nthey go through complicated immigration proceedings.\n  The vast majority of these children are not criminals, and they \nshould not be treated as criminals. We must prevent the use of \ndetention in these cases. Children who are not a danger to others or a \nflight risk should be released to their families or appropriate care-\ngivers. Our bill requires the release of children whenever possible, \nand supports the expanded use of shelters and foster care for children \nwho do not have such care givers. Other needed protections in the bill \nwill establish standards for detention, better training for immigration \npersonnel on these issues, and more effective opportunities for \npermanent protection.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues to enact these long \noverdue\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nsafeguards. It is time to end the gross abuses in our current \nimmigration system and to ensure that the best interests of these \nchildren are fully protected and respected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1130. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael Arreola; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, \nMaria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael \nArreola, Mexican nationals who live in the Fresno area of California.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in he United States for nearly 20 \nyears. They are the parents of Nayely and Cindy, who also stand to \nbenefit from this legislation. The Arreolas also have three United \nStates citizens children: Roberto, who is 11 year old; Daniel, who is \n8; and Saray, their youngest daughter, who is six-years old. Today, Mr. \nand Mrs. Arreola, and her children face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is quite compelling and I believe \nthey merit Congress' special consideration for humanitarian relief. The \nArreolas are in uncertain situation in part because of grievous errors \ncommitted by their previous counsel, who has since been disbarred. \nIn fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it compelled an \nimmigration judge to write the Executive Office of Immigration Review \nseeking his disbarment for the legal detriment he caused his immigrant \nclients.\n\n  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an \nagricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several \nyears, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence \nthrough the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SAW, program had he known \nthat he could apply for it. Mrs. Arreola was living in the United \nStates at the time she became pregnant with her daughter Cindy, but \nreturned to Mexico to give birth to Cindy to avoid any problems with \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service. It is quite likely that the \nfamily would have qualified for cancellation of removal but for the \nconduct of their previous attorney.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the devastating impact their \ndeportation would have on their children: three of whom are U.S. \ncitizens; the other two have lived in the United States virtually all \nof their lives. This country is the only the country they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest child, is a junior in high school. She is an \noutstanding student with a 3.91 Grade Point Average who ranks fourth in \nher class of approximately 300 students. At her relatively young age, \nNayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals of \ncitizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to achieve her \nfull potential both in her academic endeavors and through the service \nshe provides her community.\n  Nayely is a member of Advancement Via Individual Determination, AVID, \na college preparatory program in which students commit to determining \ntheir own futures through achieving a college degree. Nayely is also \nPresident of the key Club, a community service organization. She helps \nmentor freshmen and participates in several other student organizations \nin her school. Perhaps the greatest hardship to this family if she is \nforced to return to Mexico will be her lost opportunity to realize here \ndreams and further contribute to her community and to this country.\n  As the principal of her high school wrote, ``[s]he epitomizes what we \nseek to instill in all of our students. She has accepted the challenges \nand has made a commitment to better her future, to better her life, and \nto better herself through education.''\n  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility \nfor her community and country. By all indication, this is the case as \nwell for all of the members of her fine family.\n  I understand that the Arreolas also have other family who are lawful \npermanent residents here in the United States. Mrs. Arreola also has \nthree brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who \nis a U.S. citizen. It is my understanding that they do not have any \nfamily to whom they might return in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was \npreviously employed as a farmworker, but now has his own business \nrepairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to \nenable him to purchase a home for his family.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have \nintroduced today will enable the Arreolas to continue to make \nsignificant contributions to their community and to the United States \nas well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Xavier De La Torre, \nPrincipal of Granite Hills High School, as well as the numerous letters \nof support our office has received from members of the Porterville \ncommunity be entered into the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that \nNayely's essay entitled ``If I Could Change the World,'' which she \nwrote at age 15, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with a sense of urgency that \n     I write this letter in support of Nayely Arreola, a student \n     at Granite Hills High School. I have known Nayely for the \n     past three years and have found her to be an outstanding \n     student and a fine young lady with many of the personal \n     attributes I would want for my own daughters.\n       Nayely is a leader and a pioneer. She is among a very small \n     cadre of second language learners that have overcome \n     seemingly insurmountable conditions and adversities many of \n     us will never know and emerged as a respected scholar. She is \n     a classic success story. Nayely, with her spirit and drive, \n     has helped open and establish Granite Hills High School, the \n     newest high school in our community. She epitomizes what we \n     seek to instill in all of our students. She has accepted the \n     challenges and has made a commitment to better her future, to \n     better her life, and to better herself, through education. \n     Her leadership qualities were evident immediately, as she \n     became very involved in the Link Crew program, the American \n     Cancer Society's Relay for Life, the Porterville Celebrates \n     Reading program, and the Key Club.\n       As a first time principal of a new high school, I rely on \n     students like Nayely to establish a strong foundation for our \n     school. She and others like her have been instrumental in all \n     the success that we have had as a school in a relatively \n     short period of time. Much of this success has come on the \n     heels of adverse conditions. She is resilient and sees life \n     from an optimistic lens, something very difficult to teach.\n       As a student, Nayely is well liked by her peers, teachers, \n     and our learning community in general. A top student in her \n     class, Nayely is studious, polite, possesses a staunch work \n     ethic, and is determined to succeed in any endeavor she \n     pursues. I attribute this attitude to her parental \n     upbringing, her sense of moral obligation and a strong value \n     system. I have all the confidence in the world that Nayely \n     will be successful in life.\n       If there are any further questions, or if elaboration is \n     required, please contact me at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Xavier De La Torre,\n     Principal, Granite Hills High School.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Nayely Arreola is one of the most \n     conscientious students I have even had in school. When I \n     first met her last year, she introduced herself and said she \n     would be the top student in my advanced Placement U.S. \n     History class. As it turned out, schedule conflicts forced \n     her into a college prep class, but her intentions and \n     performance remained the same. She has been one of the very \n     top academic students. She also has demonstrated a deep sense \n     of patriotism and commitment to our country. Often times in \n     discussion, she has been the first to voice her support of \n     government policies and has an understanding of the complex \n     reasoning behind difficult decisions legislators and other \n     elected government people must make. In all the process of \n     having to return to Mexico, she has never once been negative \n     or derogatory towards the laws and procedures. Of all the \n     people who should be given residency, Nayely and her family \n     should be at the top of the list. They have demonstrated \n     their dependability, loyalty, hard work and individual \n     responsibility in their lives in this country. There is the \n     ``letter of the law'' and there is then the ``spirit of the \n     law.'' The Arreolas are a family that truly deserve the \n     ``spirit of the law'' in allowing them to stay and become \n     officially\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n     citizens. They have consistently demonstrated their \n     intentions to be such for the last decade or more.\n\n                                                  Sally Howen,\n\n                                                    Social Science\n     Chair, Granite Hills High School.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                     Porterville, CA, May 7, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Nayely Arreola is an outstanding \n     person. Having taught 30 years, I've met few students who are \n     as dedicated to working to improve themselves as Nayely. Not \n     only is she hard working, she is very intelligent. Nayely was \n     in my Geometry class two years ago and she not only worked \n     hard but she also has a wonderful understanding of the \n     connectedness of mathematics. She was always ready and \n     willing to help others who might not understand.\n       Nayely is more than just a shining example of a student, \n     she is also one of the nicest students I've ever had. She is \n     always courteous and respectful to everyone. I have never \n     seen her act unkindly to anyone around campus. She is the \n     type of person of intelligence, character and integrity that \n     this country desperately needs.\n       Nayely has the qualities that will make her a leader and a \n     peacekeeper in whatever situation she finds herself. If she \n     is deported to Mexico, she will do well there and enrich that \n     country. My hope and prayer is that she can stay and enrich \n     this country.\n       If there is anything I can do to help in her family's need, \n     please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Carol Bentz,\n     Teacher, Granite Hills High School.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                                  Porterville, CA.\n       Senator Diane Feinstein: My name is Filomena Lewis and I \n     serve as the chairperson for the World Language Department \n     here at Granite Hills High School. I am pleased to be writing \n     this letter on behalf of Nayely Arreola.\n       It has been a pleasure having Nayely as my student. She is \n     among the top students in my Advance Placement Spanish \n     Language class. Nayely functions effectively in both \n     leadership and group roles. Her properly developed social \n     skills are well received by her peers.\n       Nayely is a terrific young lady. I have no doubt in my mind \n     that she will be a contributing asset to our society. I \n     highly recommend, with utmost regard, that Nayely be extended \n     every possible consideration to allow her to complete this \n     portion of her education at Granite Hills High School.\n           Respectfully,\n     Filomena Rocha Lewis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Granite Hills High School,\n\n                                    Porterville, CA, May 13, 2003.\n       To Whom It May Concern: It is a great pleasure to write \n     this letter for Nayely Arreola. One of Granite Hills High \n     School's most distinguished high academic students, Nayely is \n     a junior, the daughter of Esidronio and Maria Elena Arreola, \n     1384 E. Success Dr., Porterville, CA (559) 782-3278.\n       Nayely is currently earning a total grade point average of \n     3.9. She is enrolled in a college preparatory program called \n     AVID and is taking Advanced Placement Spanish Literature 3 \n     and Advanced Placement English 3P. She also has nearly \n     perfect attendance.\n       Not only is Nayely excelling in academics, she also excels \n     and participates in various curricular and extracurricular \n     activities on and off campus. Including Grizzly basketball \n     and clubs. She also participates in her church youth group \n     activities at her church.\n       Nayely hopes to attend University of California upon \n     graduating from Granite Hills High School, where she will \n     major in medicine. Nayely also hopes to see how far she can \n     go with an honors program.\n       When asked what she liked about school, especially Granite \n     Hills, she said the instructors, classes and the academic \n     programs, especially AVID. She is our top AVID student in the \n     program.\n       Nayely across the years has also received many honors and \n     awards. Some of those being for leadership and the \n     Renaissance Academic Program here at Granite Hills. She has \n     also been on the Honor Roll for three years.\n       I know this student has all the tools to be successful in \n     life. She will definitely be a very successful individual.\n       I know Nayely on a personal basis. She has done so much to \n     be where she's at. She has achieved so many things because of \n     her efforts and motivation. She deserves so much in life. I \n     feel very proud of her.\n                                                 Raul B.

It has been my extreme pleasure to work with \n     Nayely at Granite Hills High for the past three years. Nayely \n     is by far one of the hardest working students I have met in \n     my twenty years of teaching. She is currently ranked fourth \n     in a class of three hundred students and has received honors \n     here at Granite Hills High. Recently she was selected as the \n     runner-up to Girls State. She is the President of the Key \n     Club where she has assisted in food, coat and toy drives for \n     the needy of our community. She is a LINK leader, which works \n     with freshmen, and I have known her as one of my prized \n     speech students. Last year she won the Club and Zone levels \n     of the Optimist Speech Contest and this year she was a Club \n     winner in the Lions Club Speech Contest.\n       It has surprised many that I, a conservative Republican, \n     would try to assist Nayely and her family with their problem \n     of gaining residency her in the United States. I believe our \n     country was founded with people just like the Arreola family \n     who came here with a dream to improve their lives and the \n     lives of their family. The Arreola family has proved that \n     they are honest, hard working, tax paying people. It is \n     unfortunate that they received poor advice from their first \n     attorney that caused them to have their case sent to the \n     deportation court. I truly believe if they had received \n     proper representation they would have received residency long \n     ago.\n       Nayely Arreola is more than a remarkable student, she is a \n     remarkable person. Everything she has done has been to \n     prepare here to go to a University here in the United States. \n     I spent almost a year teaching in Mexico and I beg our \n     Congress not to send her there. She is America's dream--her \n     contribution to our country will be great. I have watched \n     with great pride as she has grown into a wonderful young \n     lady, ready to take on the world.\n       Once again, I thank you for all your help.\n                                               Christine L.

She has \n     proven herself to be a conscientious, intelligent, hard-\n     working young lady. She consistently has the highest grade in \n     her class and often goes ``above and beyond'' on her \n     assignments.\n       I strongly support Nayely and her family in their quest for \n     legal residence in this country. I have no doubt Nayely will \n     one day be a successful, contributing member of our society. \n     She has the drive and determination to achieve any goal she \n     desires.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Sara E.

This student is basically a model student. She is \n     the kind of student that teachers dream about. She is self-\n     motivated, intelligent, has a good heart, sincere, involved, \n     etc. etc. etc. Every teacher should get an opportunity to \n     have such a student.\n       It is truly sad that our government doesn't allow such \n     students to remain in the U.S. These kinds of students are \n     the ones that will help our country grow stronger. Students \n     like Nayely are the kind of resources this country needs. I \n     am in disbelief that other students that have no respect for \n     authority, do not care for education, and eventually, we will \n     have to pay for their existence in one way or another, are \n     allowed to stay. Yet great hard working people like the \n     Arreola family are obligated to leave this country.\n       The qualities that Nayely possesses are indeed rare. If our \n     students possessed half of her qualities we would be second \n     to no nation in terms of education. We can not afford to lose \n     these precious resources. If our country is to grow stronger \n     we must change our way of thinking. We must change our laws. \n     We must attract people like Nayely and abolish those that \n     harm our country. We are hurting ourselves by forcing Nayely \n     Arreola to leave this country. Howe can politics be so blind?\n           Truly,\n\n                                               Jose Velazquez,\n\n                                         Granite Hills High School\n     Trigonometry teacher.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   If I Could Change the World . . .\n\n                         (By Nayely B. Arreola)\n\n       The world has changed dramatically throughout the years. \n     Disrespect, abuse, and quick judgment are major factors that \n     have caused human suffering. They are my main concern because \n     we need to value individuality. In my speech today I am going \n     to talk about three ways I feel we could change the world.\n       If I could change our interactions with elderly people, the \n     world would be a better place. I disagree with the \n     pessimistic attitude that some young Americans take towards \n     the elderly. Our country should honor and respect our senior \n     citizens. For example, in other countries convalescent homes \n     do not exist, because family members take care of their older \n     family members. They demonstrate an appreciation, and respect \n     by giving their elderly person a special significance in \n     their own life. The children take care of the parents when \n     they grow older and cannot do it themselves. The sons or \n     daughters give their loved ones a special value and view age \n     as a wonderful experience because they can learn from the \n     elderly family members. If this were not possible, then I \n     would change the convalescent homes from a hospital \n     environment to more of a home environment. In order to ensure \n     better treatment of the elderly the main focus should be on \n     their dignity, comfort, and well-being.\n       By keeping the elderly at home, the children can receive \n     love and attention from\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\n     someone other than their parents. Some kids come home to \n     empty houses when their parents are working hard to maintain \n     their career. Instead of watching TV, they can actually learn \n     something about themselves and the origin of their family \n     history. In order to change the world, we should appreciate \n     our elderly people because they have a lot to offer us.\n       Elderly people have a lot to teach us about the world, \n     society, and culture because they have grown wise throughout \n     the years. They can help us learn from their mistakes so that \n     we won't have to go through it again and learn the hard way. \n     It is an honor to sit by them and hear so many things that \n     they have encountered during their lifetime. We have \n     degraded the value of age in America drastically by \n     placing so much emphasis on youth and looking youthful.\n       Second, we have degraded the beauty of other races. I would \n     make people colorblind, so that they would not care about a \n     person's color or race. Prejudice ignores a person's \n     character, causing one person to feel superior over another \n     person. Racism has caused conflicts and problems throughout \n     history. A person who is racist does not know the big mistake \n     that he or she is making. They fail to truly meet the \n     wonderful people who they neglect.\n       Furthermore, another thing that I would change in the world \n     is the suffering and abuse of an innocent child. Children are \n     gifts from heaven, but when they go through a life of torment \n     or anguish, they reflect that later in their lives. These \n     children have low self-esteem.\n       Most of them repeat the same type of abuse toward their \n     children, causing the chain to repeat itself, again and again \n     throughout generations. The life of an abused child is a sad \n     life. If child suffering were eliminated, we would have \n     happier children, thus healthier adults. They would be \n     prepared to succeed in the light of success and would not be \n     left in the darkness of despair. It would make them view the \n     world as a wonderful place.\n       In conclusion, I cannot change the world into a wonderful \n     place or impact it without changing myself. If I were able to \n     change the world, I would begin with myself and erase all \n     evil within my heart, in hopes of setting an example for \n     others to follow. I can only change one life at a time in \n     order to change the world into honoring the life of an \n     individual. We cannot disrespect the elderly, judge a person \n     by their color or abuse a child who in its innocence didn't \n     ask to be born. We should show respect and dignity without \n     caring the size, age or color. We should get past the \n     fashion, clothes, and looking good in order for us to truly \n     be compassionate to see what lies in the depths of a person's \n     heart. In order to change our world the answer is definitely \n     in changing the hearts of our people. We must all do our \n     part. Today I have accepted this challenge--I ask you can \n     you?\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1131. A bill to increase, effective December 1, 2003, the rates of \ncompensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the \nrates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of \ncertain disabled veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I am introducing today to provide a cost-of-living, COLA, \nadjustment for certain veterans' benefits programs. This COLA \nadjustment would affect payments made to nearly 3 million Department of \nVeterans Affairs, VA, beneficiaries, and would be reflected in \nbeneficiary checks that are received in January 2004, and thereafter.\n  An annual cost-of-living adjustment in veterans benefits is an \nimportant tool which protects veterans' cash-transfer benefits against \nthe corrosive effects of inflation. The principal programs affected by \nthe adjustment would be compensation paid to disabled veterans, and \ndependency and indemnity compensation, DIC, payments made to the \nsurviving spouses, minor children and other dependents of persons who \ndied in service, or who died after service as a result of service-\nconnected injuries or diseases.\n  The President's budget anticipates inflation to be at a two percent \nlevel at the close of this year as measured by the consumer price \nindex, CPI, published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. If inflation is held to the 2 percent level, that will be \nthe level of COLA adjustment under this legislation since it ties the \nincrease directly to the CPI increase as measured by the Department of \nLabor. Whatever the CPI increase eventually turns out to be, however, \nveterans' and survivors' benefits payments must be protected by being \nincreased by a like amount. The Congress already concurred with that \njudgment with the recent passage of the budget resolution; that \nresolution sets aside the funds necessary to finance the COLA increase \nenvisioned by this legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and \nenhance certain benefits for survivors of veterans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation I have introduced today to further honor the sacrifices \nmade by the family members of those who were killed or injured in \nservice to our country. As we celebrate the victory won on the \nbattlefield in Iraq, we must remember that the loss of American lives--\neven a relative few--was a sobering price to pay.\n  The loss of life in service is most acutely felt by the spouses and \nchildren left behind. For them, we must make every effort--however \ninadequate that effort might be in comparison to the enormity of their \nloss--to recognize their needs. This bill attempts to do so by \nincreasing educational assistance benefits for survivors, by providing \nadditional dependency and indemnity compensation payments for\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\nbereaved families, by authorizing a remarried spouse to be buried in a \nnational cemetery with his or her deceased veteran-spouse, and by \nproviding health, training and compensation benefits to children of \ncertain veterans who served in or near the Korean demilitarized zone, \nDMZ, in the late 1960s, and who were born with Agent Orange-induced \nspina bifida.\n  The legislation I introduce today would increase the rate of monthly \nSurvivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance, DEA, benefits from \n$680 to $985. DEA benefits are provided to the spouses and children of \nveterans who were killed, or profoundly wounded, in service. The \nincrease I propose today would create parity between DEA benefits and \nveterans' educational assistance, Montgomery GI Bill, benefits. Such \nparity was recommended by a recent Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nprogram evaluation and is dictated by the common sense observation that \ncollege tuition is no less expensive for widows and orphans than it is \nfor veterans.\n  Under this legislation, DEA-eligible survivors, like Montgomery GI \nBill beneficiaries, would receive an aggregate of $35,460 worth of \neducation benefits--$985 monthly for a total of 36 months. Thus, both \nveterans and survivors would have the resources necessary to meet the \naverage cost of tuition, fees, and room and board at four-year, public \ninstitutions of higher learning. As was stated by VA's Deputy \nSecretary, Dr. Leo Mackay, at a Committee on Veterans Affairs hearing \non June 28, 2001, VA ``believe[s] it is only fair that these benefits \nshould be at the same level as those provided to veterans.'' VA \nestimates that a monthly benefit at that level will entice 90% of \neligible persons to use the benefit.\n  This legislation would also put into effect a key policy \nrecommendation made by a VA-contracted study examining the adequacy of \nsurvivors' Dependency and Indemnification Compensation, DIC, benefit. \nThe 2001 study called for the DIC benefit--the basic rate of which is \nnow set at $948 per month--to be increased by $250 per month during the \n5-year period following the death of a veteran to further ease the \ntransition of surviving spouses with dependent children. The contractor \nstudy based its recommendations on the reported income needs and \nexpenses of DIC recipients; it found that spouses with children \nreported higher levels of unmet need than spouses without children--\neven though spouses with dependent children already receive an \nadditional $237 in monthly DIC benefits per child. In short, the \ncontractor found that while widows with children are already afforded \nadditional DIC benefits, they need more.\n  In July 2001, VA estimated that there were approximately 14,500 \nsurviving spouses with dependent children. Reading the profiles of some \nof the young men and women who lost their lives in Iraq, I know that \nseveral spouses will, sadly, be added to that number. This provision of \nmy bill is a small way to further recognize the needs of families based \non an objective assessment of what those needs are.\n  Section four of this bill would codify a practice that VA routinely \nallows through a waiver process. Under current practice, when the \nremarried widow of a deceased veteran dies, her second husband must \ngrant VA permission before VA will allow, under a waiver process, the \nwidow to be buried in a national cemetery with her deceased veteran-\nhusband. A woman, for example, who was married for 50 years to a World \nWar II veteran and who remarries late in life after her first husband \ndies should not have to depend on a waiver process to ensure burial \nwith her first husband. Remarried spouses whose second marriages end \ndue to death or divorce have a statutory right to burial with their \ndeceased veteran-spouse. The same statutory right should be afforded to \nremarried spouses who, though married at death, never lost their desire \nto be united with a prior spouse already at rest in a national \ncemetery.\n  Finally, my legislation would provide benefits to spina bifida \nchildren of veterans who served in or near the Korean DMZ between 1967 \nand 1969. Benefits would be provided on the same basis, and under the \nsame rationale, as they are to children of Vietnam veterans who are \nborn with spina bifida. In 1996, Congress authorized benefits for \nVietnam children born with spina bifida based on evidence reported by \nthe Institute of Medicine of an association between exposure to Agent \nOrange and the appearance of the birth defect spina bifida in a \nveteran's offspring. The same contaminant found in Agent Orange--\ndioxin--was also used to clear brush in and near the Korean DMZ during \nthe late 1960s. Indeed, veterans who served near the Korean DMZ during \nthat time are already presumed by VA to have been exposed to \nherbicides, unless military records demonstrate otherwise, and they \nare, accordingly, already awarded compensation on a presumptive basis \nif they fall ill from conditions presumed by law to be presumptively \nservice-connected for Vietnam veterans. VA, however, exercises no such \nlatitude in addressing the needs of the children of Korean DMZ veterans \nborn with spina bifida. It should--and this bill would direct VA to do \nso.\n  I first learned of this inequity from Mr. John Ruzalski, a resident \nof Hawley, PA. Mr. Ruzalski is a Korean DMZ veteran whose 27-year-old \nson suffers from spina bifida. I am grateful to Mr. Ruzalski for his \nservice in Korea, and for bringing this matter to light, and am hopeful \nthat the Congress can reward his vigilance on behalf of his son. \nClearly, it makes no sense for VA to presume that Korean DMZ veterans \nshould be treated like Vietnam veterans for purposes of compensating \nthe veteran's service-related illnesses and yet treat their spina \nbifida children differently.\n  In summary, the provisions of this legislation will make a difference \nin the lives of those who fallen servicemembers loved even more than \ncountry--their families. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am transmitting a draft bill, the \n     ``Veterans Programs Improvement Act of 2003'. I request that \n     this draft bill be referred to the appropriate committee for \n     prompt consideration and enactment.\n\n\n    Increase in Rates of Disability compensation and Dependency and \n                         Indemnity Compensation\n\n       Section 2 of the draft bill would direct the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to increase administratively the rates of \n     disability compensation for veterans with service-connected \n     disability and of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) \n     for the survivors of veterans whose deaths are service \n     related, effective December 1, 2003. As provided in the \n     Presidents fiscal year (FY) 2004 budget request, the rate of \n     increase would be the same as the cost-of-living adjustment \n     (COLA) that will be provided under current law to Social \n     Security recipients, which is currently estimated to be 2 \n     percent. We believe this proposed COLA is necessary and \n     appropriate to protect the affected benefits from the eroding \n     effects of inflation.\n       We estimate that enactment of this section would cost $355 \n     million during FY 2004 and $4.3 billion over the period FY \n     2004 through FY 2013. However, this cost is already assumed \n     in the Budget baseline and, therefore, would not have any \n     effect on direct spending.\n\n\nREPEAL OF 45-DAY RULE FOR EFFECTIVE DATE OF AWARD OF DEATH PENSION AND \nEXCLUSION OF LUMP-SUM INSURANCE PROCEEDS FROM DETERMINATIONS OF ANNUAL \n                      INCOME FOR PENSION PURPOSES\n\n       Section 3 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5110(d) to make an award of death pension effective the \n     first day of the month in which the death occurred if the \n     claim is received within one year from the date of death. \n     Section 4 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1503(a) to add lump-sum proceeds of life insurance \n     policies to the list of payments that do not count as income \n     for purposes of determining eligibility for death pension \n     benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) under chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code.\n       Under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5110(a), an award based on a death \n     pension claim received more than 45 days after the veterans \n     death can be effective no earlier than the date of the claim. \n     Pursuant to current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5110(d)(2), however, if VA \n     receives an application for death pension within 45 days of \n     the veteran's death, then the effective date of a death \n     pension award is the first day of the month in which the \n     death occurred. Section 5110(d)(2)'s original one-year period \n     was reduced to the current 45 days by the Deficit Reduction \n     Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, 98 Stat. 494, 854-901, as a \n     cost-saving measure. Unfortunately, the ``45-day rule'' \n     created a situation that has led to unfair and unequal \n     treatment of applications for VA death pension.\n       The practical effect of the ``45-day rule'' in many cases \n     has been to exclude lump-sum life insurance proceeds received \n     within 45 days of the veteran's death from the countable \n     income for pension claimants who file their claims more than \n     45 days after the date of the veteran's death. In contrast, \n     claimants who both receive insurance proceeds and file \n     pension claims within 45 days of the veteran's death have \n     insurance proceeds counted as annual income, often reducing \n     or precluding pension benefits during their first year of \n     potential eligibility. In other words, claimants who receive \n     insurance proceeds within 45 days of death, but who wait 45 \n     days or longer to file pension claims, can receive pension \n     effective from the date of claim without regard to recently-\n     received insurance proceeds. In essence, claimants receiving \n     lump-sum insurance proceeds under the current law are \n     encouraged to forego entitlement from the date of death in \n     exchange for the exclusion of the insurance payment in \n     determining countable income for the following 12 months.\n       While many veterans' advocates are aware of this situation \n     and advise claimants who receive life insurance proceeds \n     within 45 days of death to postpone filing their claims, the \n     current law unfairly penalizes claimants who are not well \n     versed in such technical details. Fairness dictates that VA \n     rules and\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\n     procedures be straightforward, particularly for claimants who \n     are coping with the losses of loved ones. Consequently, we \n     believe the ``45-day rule'' should be eliminated in favor of \n     a rule making death pension benefits effective from the first \n     day of the month of the veterans death if the claim is \n     received within one year of that date.\n       However, we believe that this change must go hand in hand \n     with an amendment, provided in section 4 of the draft bill, \n     excluding lump-sum life insurance proceeds from the \n     computation of income for death pension purposes. Lump-sum \n     life insurance proceeds of genuine consequence are more \n     appropriately address in terms of net worth, as provided in \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 1543, than in terms of income. Pursuant of \n     section 1543, a claimant is ineligible to receive death \n     pension benefits if his or her net worth is such that it is \n     reasonable that some portion of it should be consumed for his \n     or her maintenance. In our view, a surviving spouse whose \n     income, excluding lump-sum life insurance proceeds, and net \n     worth do not constitute a bar to pension deserves help \n     from VA.\n       We believe these proposed amendments are necessary and \n     appropriate to eliminate unequal treatment of death pension \n     applicants and to uphold one of the fundamental principles of \n     the pension program, which is to ensure that those with the \n     greatest need receive the greatest benefit.\n       We estimate that the net effect of enactment of both \n     section 3 and section 4 would cost $649 thousand for FY 2004 \n     and $12.8 million for the ten-year period FY 2004 through FY \n     2013.\n\n\nclarification of prohibition on payment of compensation for alcohol or \n                        drug-related disability\n\n       Section 5(a) of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1110 and 1131 to clarify that the prohibition on \n     payment of compensation for a disability that is a result of \n     the veteran's own abuse of alcohol or drugs applies even if \n     the abuse is secondary to a service-connected disability. \n     Section 5(b) would make that amendment applicable to claims \n     filed on or after the date of enactment and to claims filed \n     before then but not finally decided as of that date.\n       Section 1110 and 1131 of title 38, United States Code, \n     authorize the payment of compensation for disability \n     resulting from injury or disease incurred or aggravated in \n     line of duty in active service, during a period of war or \n     during other than a period of war, respectively. Sections \n     1110 also currently provide, ``but on compensation shall be \n     paid if the disability is a result of the veterans own \n     willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.'' Before \n     their amendment in 1990, the provisions currently codified in \n     sections 1110 and 1131 prohibited compensation ``if the \n     disability is the result of the veteran's own willful \n     misconduct.'' In 1990, they were amended to also prohibit \n     compensation if the disability is a result of the veteran's \n     own alcohol or drug abuse.\n       VA has long interpreted those provisions to authorize \n     compensation not only for disability immediately resulting \n     from injury or disease incurred or aggravated in service, but \n     also for disability more remotely resulting from such injury \n     or disease. That interpretation is embodied in 38 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 3.310(a), which provides that, generally, disability \n     which is proximately due to or the result of a service-\n     connected disease or injury shall be service connected. Thus, \n     VA pays compensation for primary service-connected disability \n     and for secondary service-connected disability. However, \n     consistent with the plain meaning of sections 1110 and 1131, \n     if a disability, whether primary or secondary, is a result of \n     the veteran's own alcohol or drug abuse, VA did not pay \n     compensation.\n       This has changed. On February 2, 2001, a three-judge panel \n     of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \n     interpreted section 1110 as not precluding compensation for \n     an alcohol or drug-abuse-related disability arising \n     secondarily from a service-connected disability. Allen v. \n     Prncipi, 237 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2001). More \n     specifically, the panel held that section 1110 ``does not \n     preclude compensation for an alcohol or drug abuse disability \n     secondary to a service-connected disability or use of an \n     alcohol or drug abuse disability as evidence of the increased \n     severity of a service-connected disability.'' Id. at 1381. \n     The Government filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing \n     en banc, which the panel and full court denied on October 16, \n     2001. Allen v. Pincipi, 268 F.3d 1340, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \n     However, five of the eleven judges who considered the \n     petition for rehearing en banc dissented from the order \n     denying rehearing, opening that that court's interpretation \n     is wrong. 268 F.3d at 1341-42.\n       We are concerned that payment of additional compensation \n     based on the abuse of alcohol or drugs is contrary to \n     congressional intent and is not in veterans' best interests \n     because it removes an incentive to refrain from debilitating \n     and self-destructive behavior.\n       The Federal Circuit's interpretation in Allen could also \n     greatly increase the amount of compensation VA pays for \n     service-connected disabilities. Under the court's \n     interpretation, any veteran with a service-connected \n     disability who abuses alcohol or drugs is potentially \n     eligible for an increased amount of compensation if he or she \n     can offer evidence that the substance abuse is a way of \n     coping with the pain or loss the disability causes. Under \n     this interpretation, alcohol or drug abuse disabilities that \n     are secondary to either physical or mental disorders are \n     compensable.\n       The potential for increased costs is illustrated by mental \n     disorders, which are frequently associated with alcohol and \n     drug abuse. Almost 421,000 veterans are currently receiving \n     compensation for a service-connected mental disability. All \n     but 97,000 of those disabilities are currently rated less \n     than 100 percent disabling and could potentially be rated \n     totally disabling on the basis of secondary alcohol or drug \n     abuse. Even if the service connection of disability from \n     alcohol or drug abuse does not result in an increased \n     schedular evaluation, temporary total evaluations could be \n     assigned whenever a veteran is hospitalized for more than \n     twenty-one days for treatment or observation related to the \n     abuse. Even the 97,000 cases of a service-connected mental \n     disability evaluated at 100 percent disabling have potential \n     for increased compensation for secondary alcohol or drug \n     abuse if the statutory criteria for special monthly \n     compensation are met.\n       The potential increase in compensation does not end there. \n     Under the Federal Circuit's interpretation, VA is required to \n     pay compensation for the secondary effects of the abuse of \n     alcohol or drugs. Once alcohol or drug abuse is service \n     connected as being secondary to another service-connected \n     disability, then service connection can be established for \n     any disability that is a result of the service-connected \n     abuse of alcohol or drugs. If alcohol or drug abuse results \n     in a disease, such as cirrhosis of the liver, then that \n     disease would also be service connected and provide a basis \n     for compensation under the court's interpretation.\n       Of course, an increase in the amount of compensation VA \n     pays for service-connected disabilities will increase the \n     benefit cost of the compensation program. Section 5 of this \n     draft would avoid those increased costs. Our estimate of \n     savings that would result from enactment of the draft bill is \n     based on the payment of only basic compensation for alcohol \n     or drug abuse disabilities secondary to service-connected \n     disabilities (i.e., it does not consider temporary total \n     evaluations, special monthly compensation, or compensation \n     for the secondary effects of alcohol or drug abuse). We \n     estimate that this provision would result in benefit cost \n     savings of $127 million and administrative cost savings of \n     $44 million in FY 2004 and benefit cost savings of $4.6 \n     billion and administrative cost savings of $97 million for \n     the ten-month period FY 2004 through FY 2013.\n\n\n   alternative beneficiaries for national service life insurance and \n                united states government life insurance\n\n       Section 6 would authorize the payment of unclaimed National \n     Service Life Insurance (NSLI) and United States Government \n     Life Insurance (USGLI) proceeds to an alternative \n     beneficiary.\n       Under current law, there is no time limit under which a \n     named beneficiary of an NSLI or USGLI policy is required to \n     claim the proceeds. Consequently, when the insured dies and \n     the beneficiary does not file a claim for the proceeds, VA is \n     required to hold the unclaimed funds indefinitely in order to \n     honor any possible future claims by the beneficiary. VA holds \n     the proceeds as a liability. While extensive efforts are made \n     to locate and pay these individuals, there are cases where \n     the beneficiary simply cannot be found. Under current law, we \n     are not permitted to pay the proceeds to a contingent or \n     alternative beneficiary unless we can determine that the \n     principal beneficiary predeceased the insured. Consequently, \n     payment of the proceeds to other beneficiaries is withheld.\n       A majority of the existing liabilities of unclaimed \n     proceeds were established over ten years ago. As time passes, \n     the likelihood of locating and paying a principal beneficiary \n     becomes more remote. In fact, the older a liability becomes, \n     the more unlikely it is that it will ever be paid even though \n     other legitimate heirs of the insured have been located.\n       Section 6 would authorize the Secretary to pay NSLI and \n     USGLI proceeds to an alternative beneficiary when the \n     proceeds have not been claimed by the named beneficiary \n     within two years following the death of the insured or within \n     two years of this bill's enactment, whichever is later. The \n     principal beneficiary would have two years following the \n     insured's death to file a claim. Afterward, a contingent \n     beneficiary would have two additional years within which to \n     file a claim. Payment would be made as if the principal \n     beneficiary had predeceased the insured. If there is no \n     contingent beneficiary to receive the proceeds, payment would \n     be made to those equitably entitled, as determined by the \n     Secretary. As occurs under current law, no payment would be \n     made if payment would escheat to a State. Such payment would \n     bar recovery of the proceeds by any other individual.\n       Section 6 of the bill would apply retroactively as well as \n     prospectively, and is similar to the time-limitation \n     provisions of the Servicemember's and Veterans' Group Life \n     Insurance programs and the Federal Employees Group Life \n     Insurance program.\n       Insofar as payment to beneficiaries is made from the \n     insurance trust funds, there are no direct appropriated \n     benefit costs associated with this section of the bill. The \n     liabilities are already set aside and would eventually be \n     paid, either as payment to beneficiaries that eventually \n     claim the proceeds, or released from liability reserves and \n     paid as dividends.\n       There are approximately 4,000 existing policies in which \n     payment has not been made due to the fact that we cannot \n     locate the primary beneficiary, despite extensive efforts.\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\n     Over the years, the sum of moneys had as aggregated to \n     approximately $23 million. Each year, about 200 additional \n     policies (with an average face value of $9600, or \n     approximately $1.9 million annually) are placed into this \n     liability because the law prohibits payment to a contingent \n     beneficiary or to the veteran's heirs. It is estimated that \n     approximately two-thirds of the 4,000 policies would \n     eventually be paid as a result of this legislation. \n     Additionally, in anticipation of the fact that VA will not be \n     able to pay about one-third of these policies, nearly $7 \n     million has already been released to surplus and made \n     available for dividend distribution.\n       VA estimates that the enactment of this section would \n     result in costs of $15 million during the five-year period FY \n     2004 through FY 2008 and a total of $17 million during the \n     ten-year period FY 2004 through FY 2013.\n\n\ntime limitation on receipt of claim information pursuant to request by \n                     department of veterans affairs\n\n       Section 7(a) and (b) of the draft bill would make a \n     technical correction to the statutory provisions created by \n     the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \n     No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096. Section 7(c) would make that \n     correction effective as if enacted immediately after the \n     VCAA.\n       Before the enactment of the VCAA, 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5103(a) \n     required VA, if a claimant's application for benefits was \n     incomplete, to notify the claimant of the evidence necessary \n     to complete the application. Section 5103(a) further \n     provided: ``If such evidence is not received within one year \n     from the date of such notification, no benefits may be paid \n     or furnished by reason of such application.''\n       In accordance with former section 5103(a), VA regulations \n     provide that, if evidence requested in connection with a \n     claim is not furnished within one year after the date of \n     request, the claim will be considered abandoned. After the \n     expiration of one year, VA will take no further action unless \n     it receives a new claim. Furthermore, should the right to \n     benefits be finally established, benefits based on such \n     evidence would commence no earlier than the date the new \n     claim was filed. 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.158(a).\n       Before the enactment of the VCAA, title 38, United States \n     Code, contained no provision requiring VA to notify a \n     claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.\n       Section 3(a) of the VCAA struck former 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 5102 and 5103 and added new sections 5102 and 5103. \n     114 Stat. at 2096-97. Now section 5102(b) requires VA, if a \n     claimant's application for a benefit is incomplete, to notify \n     the claimant (and his or her representative, if any) of the \n     information necessary to complete the application. Section \n     5102 contains no provision concerning a time limitation for \n     the submission of information necessary to complete an \n     application.\n       Now section 5103(a) requires VA, upon receipt of a complete \n     or substantially complete application for benefits, to notify \n     the claimant (and his or her representative, if any) of any \n     information and evidence not previously provided to VA that \n     is necessary to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, that \n     notice must indicate which portion of that information and \n     evidence, if any, is to be provided by the claimant and which \n     portion, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on the claimant's \n     behalf. Section 5103(b)(1) provides, in the case of \n     information or evidence that the claimant is notified is to \n     be provided by him or her, if VA does not receive such \n     information or evidence within one year from the date of such \n     notification, no benefit may be paid or furnished by reason \n     of the claimant's application.\n       As a result of the amendments made by the VCAA, the \n     statutory provision imposing a one-year limitation now \n     relates to the substantiation of claims rather than to the \n     completion of applications. We do not believe Congress \n     intended this change from prior law. This change raises \n     several potential problems.\n       Without a statutory limitation of one year to complete an \n     application, VA no longer has a statutory basis for closing \n     an application as abandoned. Thus, if a claimant were to \n     submit an incomplete application for benefits, but not \n     respond to VA's notice of the information necessary to \n     complete it until many years later, the award of any benefit \n     granted on the basis of that application would have to be \n     effective from the date of the application, even though the \n     claimant took no action to complete it for many years. \n     Further, it appears that VA would be authorized to close or \n     deny the claim based on the claimant's failure to respond. We \n     do not believe Congress intended this result. Rather, we \n     believe that the former one-year statutory limitation on the \n     time available to complete an application should be restored.\n       The statutory limitation of one year to substantiate a \n     claim also raises potential problems. One such problem is the \n     possibility that courts will interpret the provision to \n     preclude VA from deciding a claim until one year has expired \n     from the date VA gives notice of the information and evidence \n     necessary to substantiate the claim. Exactly that \n     interpretation was offered by several veterans service \n     organizations challenging VA's regulations implementing the \n     VCAA. Under those regulations, as part of VA's notice under \n     section 5103(a), VA will request the claimant to provide any \n     evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the \n     claim. We ask for the evidence within 30 days, but tell the \n     claimant that one year is available to respond. If the \n     claimant has not responded to the request within 30 days, VA \n     may decide the claim before expiration of the one year, based \n     on all the information and evidence contained in the file, \n     including information and evidence it has obtained on the \n     claimant's behalf. However, VA will have to readjudicate the \n     claim if the claimant subsequently provides the information \n     and evidence within one year of the date of the request. 38 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 3.159(b)(1).\n       VA issued those rules ``to allow for the timely processing \n     of claims.'' 66 Fed. Reg. 17,834, 17,835 (2001). Once an \n     application had been substantially completed, VA does not \n     want to have to wait one year to decide the claim, given the \n     large backlog of claims awaiting adjudication by VA and the \n     Secretary's commitment to reducing the backlog and shortening \n     the time VA takes to adjudicate claims. What VA considers to \n     be Congress' inadvertent moving of the one-year limitation \n     from the provision relating to completion of applications to \n     the provision relating to the substantiation of claims could \n     impede VA's efforts to improve service to veterans. VA doubts \n     that Congress intended to require VA, after requesting \n     evidence from a claimant, to keep the claim open and pending \n     for a full year if the claimant has not responded.\n       Furthermore, section 5103(b)(1)'s clear and unambiguous \n     language appears to prohibit the payment of benefits even \n     though VA could allow a claim. For example, VA might be able \n     to allow a claim on the basis of evidence VA obtained on the \n     claimant's behalf, even though the claimant has not \n     provided the evidence requested of him or her. Or VA might \n     find clear and unmistakable error in a prior denial and \n     need to grant benefits on the claim that was erroneously \n     denied. Yet section 5103(b)(1) prohibits the payment or \n     furnishing of any benefit if VA does not receive within \n     one year the information or evidence the claimant is to \n     provide according to VA's notice. Surely, Congress did not \n     intend such a results.\n       Finally, some of VA's pro-veteran regulations will have to \n     be changed unless the one-year time limitation is removed \n     from section 5103. For example, 38 C.F.R. Sec. 20.1304(a) \n     permits an appellant to submit additional evidence during the \n     90 days following notice that an appeal has been certified to \n     the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the appellate record has \n     been transferred to the Board. That 90-day period may extend \n     beyond the one-year period following notice of the \n     information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claims \n     given under section 5103(a), in which case it would conflict \n     with the statutory mandate that ``no benefit may be paid or \n     furnished by reason of the claimant's application'' if VA \n     does not receive the evidence within one year from the date \n     of the section 5103(a) notice. Another potentially \n     conflicting regulation is 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.156(b), which \n     deems new and material evidence received before expiration of \n     the one-year appeal period (beginning when notice of the \n     decision on a claim is sent) or before an appellate decision \n     is made if a timely appeal is filed to have been filed in \n     connection with the claim pending at the beginning of the \n     appeal period. Because the one-year appeal period necessarily \n     extends beyond the one-year substantiation period, the \n     regulation authorizes the grant of benefits based on evidence \n     not timely received under section 5103(b), contrary to the \n     statutory mandate.\n       Accordingly, we propose a technical amendment to sections \n     5102 and 5103 that would prevent these problems. Section 7 \n     would restore the one-year limitation to section 5102 and \n     remove it from section 5103. It would make these technical \n     amendments effective as if enacted immediately after the \n     VCAA.\n       No costs are associated with this proposal. These \n     amendments would allow VA to close inactive or abandoned \n     claims and would prevent unjustified retroactive awards.\n\n\n                         burial plot allowance\n\n       Section 8 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2303(b) and 2307 to authorize payment of the burial \n     plot allowance to states for each veteran interred in a state \n     veterans cemetery at not cost to the veteran's estate or \n     survivors.\n       Current section 2302(b)(1) authorizes VA to pay to a state \n     a $300 plot or interment allowance for each eligible veteran \n     buried in qualifying state veterans' cemetery. Such allowance \n     authorized only if the veteran: (1) was a veteran of any war; \n     (2) was discharged from active service for a service-\n     connected disability; (3) was receiving VA compensation or \n     pension at the time of death; or (4) died in a VA facility. \n     Under current section 2307, survivors of veterans who die as \n     a result of service-connected disabilities may seek \n     reimbursement of burial and funeral expenses not exceeding \n     $2,000. If, however, a burial and funeral allowance is paid \n     to a veteran's survivors under section 2307, states cannot \n     also receive a plot allowance for burial of the veteran. The \n     proposed amendment would expand VA's authority to pay the \n     plot allowance to states for burial in State veterans' \n     cemeteries of all eligible peacetime veterans and all wartime \n     veterans who die of service-connected disabilities.\n       This amendment would encourage state participation in the \n     State Cemetery Grants Program. In 1978, Congress established \n     the State Cemetery Grants Program to complement VA's national \n     cemetery system by assisting states in providing burial plots \n     for veterans in areas where existing national cemeteries \n     cannot satisfy veterans' burial needs. State officials have \n     indicated to VA that they consider future maintenance costs\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\n     when deciding whether to pursue a state cemetery grant. To \n     the extent that the amendment would help defray those \n     maintenance costs and encourage states to establish veterans' \n     cemeteries, it would make the benefit of burial in such a \n     cemetery an accessible option for more veterans.\n       The proposed amendment would allow states to receive plot \n     allowance payments for approximately 1,200 additional \n     interments annually. We estimate the costs associated with \n     the enactment of this amendment would be $360,000 for FY 2004 \n     and $3.6 million for the ten-year period from FY 2004 through \n     FY 2013.\n\n\n            PROVISION OF MARKERS FOR PRIVATELY MARKED GRAVES\n\n       Section 9 would change the applicability date of VA's \n     current authority to provide a marker for the private-\n     cemetery grave of a veteran, regardless of whether the grave \n     has been marked at private expense. Section 2306(a) of title \n     38, United States Code, has long authorized VA to provide a \n     Government headstone or marker for the unmarked grave of an \n     eligible individual. Section 502 of the Veterans Education \n     and Benefits Expansion Act of 3001, Pub. L. No. 107-103, \n     Sec. 502, 115 Stat. 976, 994, which was signed into law on \n     December 27, 2001, authorized VA to furnish appropriate \n     marker for the grave of an eligible veteran buried in a \n     private cemetery, regardless of whether the grave was already \n     marked with a non-Government marker. This authorization was \n     made applicable to veterans who died on or after that Act's \n     enactment date. Public Law 107-440 extended this authority to \n     include deaths.\n       Under current law, if a veteran died before September 11, \n     2001, provision of a Government headstone or market is \n     authorized only if the veterans' grave is unmarked. If a \n     veteran died after September 11, 2001, provision of a \n     Government headstone or market is authorized regardless of \n     whether the grave is already marked at private expense. While \n     recent changes in the law have allowed VA to begin to meet \n     the needs of families who view the government-furnished \n     market as a means of honoring and publicly recognizing a \n     veteran's military service, VA is now in the difficult \n     position of having to deny a benefit based solely on when a \n     veteran died.\n       Moreover, the law has never precluded the addition of a \n     privately purchased headstone to a grave after place of a \n     government-furnished marker, resulting in double marking. \n     However, when a private marker had been placed in the first \n     instance, a Government marker may not be provided if the \n     veteran died before September 11, 2001. We believe this \n     creates an arbitrary distinction disadvantaging families who \n     promptly obtained a private marker.\n       From October 18, 1979, until November 1, 1990, with the \n     enactment of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of \n     1990, VA paid a headstone or marker allowance to those \n     families who purchased a private headstone or marker in lieu \n     of a Government headstone or marker. Those families all had \n     the opportunity to benefit from the VA-marker program. Our \n     proposal would benefit families of those veterans who died \n     between November 1, 1990, and September 11, 2001.\n       We estimate that the mandatory cost of this proposal would \n     be $4.9 million if FY 2004 and $12.4 million during the \n     period FY 2004 through FY 2013.\n\n\n         expansion of burial eligibility for remarried spouses\n\n       Section 10 would allow a veteran's surviving spouse who \n     marries a non-veteran after the veteran's death to be \n     eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery based on his or \n     her marriage to the veteran. Over the last several years, the \n     National Cemetery Administration has seen an increase in the \n     number of requests for burial of a veteran's widow or widower \n     who has married a non-veteran after the veteran has died. \n     These cases involve spouses of veterans who have been married \n     for many years and have raised a family with the veteran. \n     Typically, the veteran's children and grandchildren, and of \n     the current spouse, support the burial of the decedent with \n     the original veteran-spouse in a VA national cemetery. \n     However, current law does not permit it if the remarriage \n     remained in effect when the veteran's survivor predeceased \n     the new spouse.\n       Public Law 103-446 revised eligibility criteria for burial \n     in a national cemetery to reinstate burial eligibility for a \n     surviving spouse of an eligible veteran whose subsequent \n     remarriage to a non-veteran has been terminated by death or \n     dissolved by divorce. The current proposal would be \n     consistent with that amendment in further acknowledging the \n     importance of the first marriage to the veteran's family. \n     This proposal would allow the deceased veteran to be buried \n     with a spouse with whom he or she always expected to be \n     buried with a spouse with whom he or she always expected to \n     be buried. It would also allow the veteran's children to \n     visit a single gravesite to pay their respects to their \n     parents.\n       We estimate that the cost associated with this proposal \n     would be minimal. The average number of requests for burials \n     for individuals previously married to an eligible veteran who \n     subsequently married a non-veteran is estimated to be 200 per \n     year; the majority of these burials would be second \n     interments. The cost of a second interment (including a \n     headstone or marker) in a VA national cemetery ranges from \n     just over $400 to nearly $800, depending on the type of \n     burial and placement of the remains, with an average cost of \n     approximately $550. For FY 2004, we anticipate the cost of \n     the proposal would be $110,000. Our ten-year cost estimate \n     (FY 2004 through FY 2013) is $1.1 million.\n\n\n       make permanent authority for state cemetery grants program\n\n       Section 2408 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA \n     to make grants to states to assist them in establishing, \n     expanding, or improving state veterans' cemeteries. Section \n     2408(a)(2) currently authorizes appropriations for making \n     those grants through fiscal year 2004. Section 11 of our \n     proposed bill would permanently authorize such \n     appropriations.\n       VA's State Cemetery Grants Program is an important \n     component in meeting the burial needs of our Nation's \n     veterans. State veterans' cemeteries supplement VA's national \n     cemetery system in providing burial options to veterans \n     throughout the Nation. VA's State Cemetery Grants Program has \n     already helped to fund 49 operational state veterans' \n     cemeteries, and six more are under construction. VA has \n     received over 30 additional pre-applications from states \n     requesting grants. There is a tremendous, on-going demand for \n     grants to improve or expand existing state veterans' \n     cemeteries, and VA's proposal would assist long-term planning \n     for this important program.\n       Appropriations for VA's State Home Grants Program \n     (authorized by subchapter III of chapter 81, title 38, United \n     States Code) are permanently authorized under 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7133(a). The amendment made by section 11 of this bill \n     would improve the consistency in the operation of the two \n     programs.\n       The costs associated with this proposal would be those \n     included in VA's annual budget request for use in providing \n     grants to states. The President's budget submission to \n     Congress for FY 2004 includes a request for $32 million for \n     the State Cemetery Grants Program.\n\n\n            forfeiture of benefits for subversive activities\n\n       Section 12 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 6105 to supplement \n     the list of offenses conviction of which would result in a \n     bar to all gratuitous VA benefits. Section 6105 provides that \n     an individual convicted after September 1, 1959, of any of \n     several specified offenses involving subversive activities \n     shall have no right to gratuitous benefits, including \n     national cemetery burial, under laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs and that no other person shall \n     be entitled to such benefits on account of such individual. \n     Congress' primary concern in enacting this provision was to \n     prevent VA benefits from being provided based on military \n     service of persons found guilty of offenses involving \n     national security. This proposal would amend section 6105 to \n     supplement the list of offenses conviction of which would \n     result in a bar to all gratuitous VA benefits to include \n     additional offenses that have come into being since enactment \n     of section 6105.\n       This proposal would extend the current prohibition on \n     payments of gratuitous benefits to persons convicted of \n     subversive activities to include six additional classes of \n     activities. The following offenses from title 18, United \n     States Code, would be added: sections 175 (Prohibitions with \n     respect to biological weapons); 229 (Prohibited activities \n     with respect to chemical weapons); 831 (Prohibited \n     transactions involving nuclear materials); 1091 (Genocide); \n     2332a (Use of certain weapons of mass destruction); and 2332b \n     (Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries). All of \n     these offenses, which involve serious threats to national \n     security, were added to title 18, United States Code, after \n     the enactment of section 6105.\n       There is no cost associated with this proposal. Cost \n     savings would be insignificant.\n\n\n               veterans' advisory committee on education\n\n       Section 13 would extend to the year 2013 the expiration \n     date of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education. It \n     would also amend the language requiring that veterans from \n     specific wartime and post-wartime periods be members of the \n     Committee to state that Committee positions must be filled \n     with such individuals as far as practicable. Finally, this \n     section would make a technical amendment to reflect that, \n     under title 10, United States Code, as reorganized, chapter \n     106 is now designated chapter 1606.\n       Under current law, the authority for the Committee will \n     expire on December 31, 2003. VA favors extending the \n     existence of the Education Advisory Committee. The Committee \n     has been useful for the Secretary in keeping in touch with \n     the education community, as well as the veterans' service \n     organizations. Over the last several years, the Committee has \n     made a number of recommendations that have, in turn, become \n     legislative proposals. We believe the Committee's discussions \n     and recommendations are an invaluable aid to our efforts in \n     administering the education program.\n       The amendment that would require that veterans from certain \n     periods, e.g. World War II, the Korean conflict era, or post-\n     Korean conflict era, be included as members of the Committee \n     only as far as practicable allows for flexibility in filling \n     Committee positions if finding members of specific \n     populations who wish to serve on the Committee might be \n     problematic.\n       We estimate the costs associated with the extension of the \n     Committee would be $25,400 for FY 2004 and $200,000 for the \n     ten-year period from FY 2004 through FY 2013.\n\n\n                    repeal of education loan program\n\n       Section 14 would repeal the VA education loan program and \n     waive any existing repayment obligations, to include \n     overpayments\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\n     due to default on such loans. The program, in effect since \n     January 1, 1975, currently is available to issue loans up to \n     a maximum of $2,500 per academic year to spouses and \n     surviving spouses who are past their delimiting dates with \n     remaining entitlement to chapter 35 benefits. The population \n     for this program is very limited, and with other options in \n     the public and private sectors, there is no longer a demand \n     for these loans. In fact, VA has not issued a loan under this \n     program in several years, but the government has paid an \n     estimated $70,000 a year to administer it. VA's October 2002 \n     monthly loans statistics show 20 current education loans in \n     the amount of $14,987.08 and 116 defaulted education loans \n     totaling $105,908.10. As is apparent, it costs VA more to \n     administer the loan program than to forgive the debts \n     currently outstanding.\n\n\n  restoration of chapter 35 education benefits of certain individuals\n\n       Section 15 would amend the law to provide that individuals \n     who qualify for chapter 35 benefits and are involuntarily \n     ordered to full-time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 502(f) after September 11, 2001, would have their \n     individual delimiting dates (the ending date of the \n     individual's eligibility) extended by an amount of time equal \n     to that period of full-time duty plus 4 months.\n       Public Law 107-103 restored entitlement to National Guard \n     personnel who qualified for chapter 35 benefits who had to \n     discontinue course pursuit as a result of being called to \n     active duty under specific sections of title 10, United \n     States Code. Our proposal would provide the same delimiting \n     date extension to National Guard members who are activated \n     under title 32.\n       We estimate the costs associated with the enactment of \n     section 15 would be $150,000 for FY 2004 and approximately $5 \n     million for the ten-year period from FY 2004 through FY 2013.\n\n\n  EXPANSION OF MONTGOMERY GI BILL EDUCATION BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN SELF-\n                          EMPLOYMENT TRAINING\n\n       Section 16 would expand the Montgomery GI Bill chapter 30 \n     program by authorizing education assistance benefits for \n     veterans under that program for on-job training in certain \n     self-employment training programs. Such training might, for \n     example, include that necessary for operation of a franchise \n     or to gain a commercial drivers' license to become an \n     independent trucker.\n       The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business \n     Development Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 106-50) requires that all \n     Federal agencies aggressively support self-employment for \n     veterans and service-disabled veterans, directly and through \n     public-private partnerships. This amendment will provide \n     veterans considering self-employment with improved access to \n     capital for training. Thus, more veterans will be encouraged \n     to initiate steps towards self-employment and sustainable \n     self-sufficiency.\n       We estimate the costs associated with the enactment of \n     section 16 would be $357,000 for FY 2004 and approximately \n     $3.9 million for the ten-year period from FY 2004 through FY \n     2013.\n       The Budget Enforcement Act's pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \n     requirements and discretionary spending caps expired on \n     September 30, 2002. The attached proposals affect revenues \n     and direct spending. This bill is currently estimated to \n     produce cost savings of $116.1 million for FY 2004 and $4.52 \n     billion for FY 2004 through FY 2013. These proposals were \n     included in the President's FY 2004 Budget and should be \n     considered in conjunction with all other proposals in the \n     Budget. The Administration supports the extension of budget \n     enforcement mechanisms in a manner that ensures fiscal \n     discipline and is consistent with the President's Budget.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the transmission of this bill and that its \n     enactment would be in accord with the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Anthony J. Principi\n       Enclosure.\n\n     Section-by-Section Analysis of Draft Bill--Veterans Programs \n                        Improvement Act of 2003\n\n\n   section 1. short title; references to title 38, united states code\n\n       Section 1(a) would provide a short title for the Act: the \n     ``Veterans Programs Improvement Act of 2003.'' Section 1(b) \n     would provide that all amendments made by the Act, unless \n     otherwise specified, are to a section or other provision of \n     title 38, United States Code.\n\n\nsection 2. increase in rates of disability compensation and dependency \n                       and indemnity compensation\n\n       Section 2 would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \n     administratively increase the rates of disability \n     compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \n     and of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) for the \n     survivors of veterans whose deaths are service related, \n     effective December 1, 2003. As provided in the President's \n     fiscal year 2004 budget request, the rate of increase would \n     be the same as the cost of living adjustment that will be \n     provided under current law to Social Security recipients, \n     which is currently estimated to be 2 percent.\n\n\n section 3. repeal of 45-day rule for effective date of award of death \n                                pension\n\n       Section 3 would amend 38 U.s.C. Sec. 5110(d) to make an \n     award of death pension effective the first day of the month \n     in which the death occurred if the claim is received within \n     one year from the date of death.\n\n\n     section 4. exclusion of lump-sum life insurance proceeds from \n          determinations of annual income for pension purposes\n\n       Section 4 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1503(a) to add lump-\n     sum proceeds of life insurance policies to the list of \n     payments that do not count as income for purposes of \n     determining eligibility for death pension benefits \n     administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under \n     chapter 15 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n\nsection 5. clarification of prohibition on payment of compensation for \n                   alcohol or drug-related disability\n\n       Section 5(a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1110 and 1131 \n     to clarify that the prohibition on payment of compensation \n     for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own abuse \n     of alcohol or drugs applies even if the abuse is secondary to \n     a service-connected disability. Section 5(b) would make that \n     amendment applicable to claims filed on or after the date of \n     enactment and to claims filed before then but not finally \n     decided as of that date.\n\n\n    section 6. alternative beneficiaries for national service life \n         insurance and united states government life insurance\n\n       Section 6 would authorize the payment of unclaimed National \n     Service Life Insurance and United States Government Life \n     Insurance proceeds to an alternative beneficiary.\n\n\nsection 7. time limitation on receipt of claim information pursuant to \n               request by department of veterans affairs\n\n       Section 7(a) and (b) would make a technical correction to \n     the statutory provisions created by the Veterans Claims \n     Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. \n     2096. It would change the applicability of a one-year time \n     limit from the substantiation of a claim to the completion of \n     an application. Section 7(c) would make that correction \n     effective as if enacted immediately after the VCAA.\n\n\n                    section 8. burial plot allowance\n\n       Section 8 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2302(b) and 2307 \n     to authorize payment of the burial plot allowance to states \n     for each veteran interred in a state veterans' cemetery at no \n     cost to the veteran's estate or survivors.\n\n\n      section 9. provision of markers for privately marked graves\n\n       Section 9 would change the applicability date (to deaths \n     occurring on or after November 1, 1990) of VA's current \n     authority to provide a marker for the private-cemetery grave \n     of a veteran, regardless of whether the grave has been marked \n     at private expense.\n\n\n   Section 10. Expansion of Burial eligibility for Remarried Spouses\n\n       Section 10 would allow a veteran's surviving spouse who \n     marries a non-veteran after the veteran's death to be \n     eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery based on his or \n     her marriage to the veteran.\n\n\n Section 11. Make Permanent authority for state cemetery grants program\n\n       Section 11 would permanently authorize appropriations for \n     the State Cemetery Grants Program under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 2408, \n     which authorizes VA to make grants to states to assist them \n     in establishing, expanding, or improving state veterans' \n     cemeteries.\n\n\n      Section 12. Forfeiture of benefits for subversive activities\n\n       Section 12 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 6105 to supplement \n     the list of offenses conviction of which bars entitlement to \n     all gratuitous VA benefits.\n\n\n         section 13. veterans' advisory committee on education\n\n       Section 13 would extend to the year 2013 the expiration \n     date of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education. It \n     would also amend the language requiring that veterans from \n     specific wartime and post-wartime periods be members of the \n     Committee to state that Committee positions must be filled \n     with such individuals when practicable. Finally, this section \n     would make a technical amendment to reflect that, under title \n     10, United States Code, as reorganized, chapter 106 is now \n     designated chapter 1606.\n\n\n             Section 14. Repeal of Educational Loan Program\n\n       Section 14 would repeal the VA education loan program and \n     waive any existing repayment obligations, to include \n     overpayments due to default on such loans.\n\n\n  Section 15. Restoration of chapter 35 education benefits of certain \n                              individuals\n\n       Section 15 would provide that individuals who qualify for \n     chapter 35 benefits and are involuntarily ordered to full-\n     time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. Sec. 502(f) after \n     September 11, 2001, would have their individual delimiting \n     dates (the ending date of the individual's eligibility) \n     extended by an amount of time equal to that period of full-\n     time duty plus 4 months.\n\n\n  Section 16. Expansion of Montgomery GI bill education benefits for \n                    certain self-employment training\n\n       Section 16 would expand the Montgomery GI Bill chapter 30 \n     program by authorizing education assistance benefits for \n     veterans under that program for on-job training in certain \n     self-employment training programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) (by request):\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\n  S. 1134. A bill to reauthorize and improve the programs authorized by \nthe Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in these times of economic distress and \nhardship we must focus our efforts to assist the more impoverished \nregions of our country. With this in mind, it is my pleasure to rise \ntoday to introduce, on behalf of President Bush, the Economic \nDevelopment Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003.\n  This bill will allow the Economic Development Administration, \ncommonly known as the EDA, to assist communities in the development of \ntheir local economy. Simply put, it will help to bring jobs to our \ncities and towns by reauthorizing the mission of the EDA, while \nfocusing the Administration's efforts on localized economic growth.\n  EDA was established under the Public Works and Economic Development \nAct of 1965. Throughout the near forty years of its existence, EDA has \nhelped to generate employment, retain existing jobs, and stimulate \nindustrial and commercial growth in rural and urban areas of the nation \nthat experience high unemployment, low income or other severe economic \ndistress.\n  EDA has consistently been guided by the basic principle that \n`distressed communities must be empowered to develop and implement \ntheir own economic development and revitalization strategies'. To \nachieve these goals, EDA works in partnership with State and local \ngovernments by providing Federal grants to public and private nonprofit \norganizations, regional economic development agencies and Indian \ntribes.\n  This bill seeks to improve the coordination, flexibility, and \nperformance of EDA. It focuses on methods to ensure that EDA can more \neasily work in coordination with other agencies involved in economic \ndevelopment, such as the Army Corps of Engineers or the Department of \nLabor. It attempts to improve EDA's ability to respond to rapidly \nchanging economic conditions within regions and it highlights the need \nto focus on the performance of grantees--whether grantees actually \nincrease jobs and economic growth.\n  During the last decade, in my home State of Missouri, EDA has \nimplemented over 300 projects and invested more than $115 million into \nmy state's economy. These projects have included improvements to the \nCornerstone Industrial Park in St. Louis, the renovation of a blighted \nneighborhood outside Kansas City, and construction assistance for the \nCenter for Emerging Technologies in St. Louis. EDA assistance in \nMissouri has truly been a boon to local investment and economic growth. \nReauthorization of EDA will enable future projects like these \nthroughout our country for years to come.\n  In this time of economic difficulty, strong partnership between \nfederal and local governments are crucial. My hope is that through a \nsustained focus on spurring growth in our economy through continued \nsupport of the EDA, we can surmount the economic challenges of today \nand prepare the way for a more prosperous future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Economic \n     Development Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       Section 2 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act \n     of 1965, as amended (``PWEDA'') (42 U.S.C. Sec. 3121), is \n     revised to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) while the fundamentals for growth in the American \n     economy remain strong, there continue to be areas \n     experiencing chronic high unemployment, underemployment, low \n     per capita incomes, and outmigration as well as areas facing \n     sudden and severe economic dislocations due to structural \n     economic changes, changing trade patterns, certain Federal \n     actions (including environmental requirements that result in \n     the removal of economic activities from a locality), and \n     natural disasters;\n       ``(2) sustained economic growth in our Nation, States, \n     cities and rural areas is produced by expanding free \n     enterprise through trade and enhanced competitiveness of \n     regions;\n       ``(3) the goal of Federal economic development programs is \n     to raise the standard of living for all citizens and increase \n     the wealth and overall rate of growth of the economy by \n     encouraging local and regional communities to develop a more \n     competitive and diversified economic base by--\n       ``(A) promoting job creation through increased innovation, \n     productivity, and entrepreneurship; and\n       ``(B) empowering local and regional communities \n     experiencing chronic high unemployment and low per capita \n     income to attract substantially increased private-sector \n     capital investment;\n       ``(4) while economic development is an inherently local \n     process, the Federal Government should work in partnership \n     with public and private local, regional, Tribal and State \n     organizations to maximize the impact of existing resources \n     and enable regions, communities, and citizens to participate \n     more fully in the American dream and national prosperity;\n       ``(5) in order to avoid wasteful duplication of effort and \n     achieve meaningful, long-lasting results, Federal, State, \n     Tribal and local economic development activities should have \n     a clear focus, improved coordination, a comprehensive \n     approach, common measures of success, and simplified and \n     consistent requirements; and\n       ``(6) Federal economic development efforts will be more \n     effective if they are coordinated with, and build upon, the \n     trade, workforce investment, and technology programs of the \n     United States.\n       ``(b) Declarations.--Congress declares that, in order to \n     promote a strong and growing economy throughout the United \n     States:\n       ``(1) assistance under this Act should be made available to \n     both rural and urban distressed communities;\n       ``(2) local communities should work in partnership with \n     neighboring communities, Indian Tribes, the States, and the \n     Federal Government to increase their capacity to develop and \n     implement comprehensive economic development strategies to \n     enhance regional competitiveness in the global economy and \n     support long-term development of regional economies; and\n       ``(3) whether suffering from long-term distress or a sudden \n     dislocation, distressed communities should be encouraged to \n     focus on strengthening entrepreneurship and competitiveness, \n     and to take advantage of the development opportunities \n     afforded by technological innovation and expanding and newly \n     opened global markets.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, in introducing by request a bill to reauthorize the \nEconomic Development Administration.\n  EDA works with partners in local communities to create wealth and \nminimize poverty by promoting favorable business environments to \nattract private investment. Studies show that EDA uses Federal dollars \nefficiently and effectively. EDA's average cost of creating and \nretaining long-term jobs is among the lowest in government.\n  In my home State of Oklahoma, we have some communities that struggle \nwith economic distress, and EDA has worked long and hard with those \ncommunities to bring in private capital investment and jobs. In fact, \nover the last ten years, EDA projects have resulted in more than 15,000 \njobs being created or saved. With an investment of about $53 million, \nwe have leveraged another 50 million in State and local dollars and \nmore than 1.1 billion in private sector dollars. I would call that a \nwonderful success story.\n  I am pleased that the President has chosen to send to Congress a \nreauthorization bill for this agency. His bill promotes coordination, \nflexibility and performance--all excellent goals. The EDA's \nauthorization is set to expire on September 30, 2003, and I look \nforward to working with the Administration, as well as my colleagues \nhere in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, to try to \nreauthorize it before then.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1135. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a uniform national medicare physician fee schedule; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2003,'' a bill that corrects \na long-standing inequity in Medicare reimbursement to rural physicians. \nI am delighted that my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Grassley, \nLincoln, and Bingaman have joined me in addressing this issue and \nintroducing this bill.\n  Although many Americans are not aware of it, Medicare currently \nreimburses physicians practicing in many\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nrural areas at a lower rate than those practicing in more densely \npopulated areas. A complicated formula, the geographic physician cost \nindex, reimburses physicians according to presumed regional differences \nin the costs of their work, practice expenses, and medical liability \ninsurance premiums. But in almost every case, this formula penalizes \nphysicians who practice in rural settings.\n  As a result, the unfortunate effect of the current formula is that it \nmay contribute to regional disparities in access to health care. Rural \nareas tend to have fewer physicians, fewer hospitals and patients often \nhave less access to subspecialty care. Penalizing doctors who practice \nin rural settings by paying them substantially less than their urban \ncolleagues may contribute to this inequity in access to care.\n  According to the Rural Policy Research Institute, the Medicare \npayment for an intermediate office outpatient visit in 2003 is 30 \npercent higher in New York City, $59.33, than it is in St. George, UT, \n$45.75, and the reimbursement for an emergency room visit is 22 percent \nhigher in New York City, $161.82, than it is in St. George, UT, \n$131.96.\n  Proponents of this system that pays doctors differently for the same \nwork claim that the purchasing power of physician compensation should \nbe similar regardless of where the work is performed. But others, and I \nam one of them, believe that doctors should be compensated equally and \nappropriately for their work regardless of where that work is \nperformed. I believe that it is time that we provide physicians with \nequal pay for equal work. Physicians deserve it and their patients do \nalso. After all, the citizen in Utah pays Federal taxes at the same \nrate as the citizen in New York. Why should the citizen in Utah receive \ncheaper service?\n  The practice expense component of the geographic physician cost index \nalso penalizes rural physicians and their patients. Proponents of the \ncurrent system claim that it is more expensive for doctors to practice \nmedicine in urban areas where the cost of living is higher and the cost \nof paying employees is thought to be higher. The practice expense \ngeographic physician cost index rewards physicians in these ``high \npractice expense'' areas by reimbursing physician services at a higher \nrate.\n  While it might be tempting to think that practice expenses in urban \nareas are higher than those in rural areas, this is not necessarily the \ncase. Rural physicians sometimes must offer higher wages to attract \nnurses and technicians to work in their communities. Furthermore, the \nformula that is used to calculate the geographic practice expense does \nnot take certain key elements into consideration. Volume discounts can \nresult in lower costs for capital goods and supplies in densely \npopulated areas. Furthermore, a physician in a rural area who purchases \nan expensive, but necessary piece of equipment, such as an ultrasound \nmachine, may use that equipment less frequently than a physician from a \ndensely populated area. As a result, the rural doctor may not be able \nto pay for the capital investment as quickly as the urban physician. \nThe practice expense for the rural physician in such a case is higher.\n  In fact, we have known for years that additional resources are \nsometimes necessary to attract doctors to practice in rural settings. \nPhysicians, nurses and allied health professionals are less prevalent \nand hospitals are fewer and farther between in rural settings. In some \ncases, certain services and subspecialty care are not available at all. \nFor this reason, Federal and State programs have offered tuition \npayment and loan forgiveness programs to student physicians who agree \nto practice in underserved areas, many of which are rural.\n  Federal payment policy with respect to physician services delivered \nin rural and underserved areas has been described as contradictory--\npaying bonuses to physicians for practicing in rural and underserved \nareas on the one hand while devaluing physician clinical decision-\nmaking and patient services in rural areas less, on the other. The \nbottom line is this: For many years we have found it difficult in this \ncountry to increase access to health care and improve the quality of \nhealth care in rural communities. Penalizing physicians for practicing \nin rural settings just does not make sense.\n  All Medicare beneficiaries, whether they live in an urban or rural \narea, deserve excellent health care and access to outstanding doctors. \nThe bill I am introducing today, the Medicare Physician Payment Act, \naddresses current disparities by creating a system that reimburses \nphysicians equitably regardless of where they practice. The bill \naddresses all three components of the geographic physician cost index, \nwork, practice expense, and medical liability costs, by increasing \nreimbursement for physicians in disadvantaged areas over a three-year \nperiod and by eliminating disparities in reimbursement altogether in \nthe year four. If we pass this bill, doctors will no longer be \ndiscouraged from practicing in the rural communities that desperately \nneed their services. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe 108th Congress to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Hatch, Grassley, Lincoln, and Bingaman in introducing the \nMedicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2003. This bill corrects a \nlongstanding inequity in the Medicare Part B reimbursement methodology \nthat pays rural physicians less than what is received by physicians for \nmore densely populated areas who provide the same exact service. I am \npleased that we are able to offer a legislative solution to this \npayment inequity.\n  Establishing Medicare reimbursement for physician services is a \ncomplex process and many factors go into setting rates. Without going \ninto all of the intricacies of how fees are set, let me note that, for \nany specific service, the physician fee schedule has three components--\nphysician work, practice expenses, and the cost of malpractice \ninsurance. Each of these components is further subjected to a \ngeographic adjustment, which is lower for rural areas than for urban \nareas.\n  In my own State of Vermont, we face a chronic shortage of doctors in \nour rural areas. Yet, when we need to find a physician for a rural \nclinic, we compete in a national market to find providers. The \ninequities in payments these physicians receive, however, makes it all \nthe more difficult to recruit and retain physicians. Rural physicians \nhave the same training, spend the same time with patients, and manage \nthe same office pressures as their urban counterparts. Their work \nshould be valued equally, and that is what this bill accomplishes.\n  I've heard from many people in Vermont about this issue. Tim \nThompson, M.D., President of the Vermont Medical Society, expressed his \nconcern that while Vermonters pay the same premiums as other Americans \nto support the Medicare program, our doctors are paid less. This occurs \nwithout regard to the quality or efficiency of health care services \nthey provide. In fact, according to the Center for Medicare Services, \nVermont physicians provide the second highest quality care in the \ncountry, but the State is ranked forty-fourth in payments per Medicare \nbeneficiary. We should do more to reward quality health care regardless \nof whether it is provided in an urban or rural setting. The Vermont \nMedical Society has told me that they strongly support the Medicare \nPhysician Payment Equity Act of 2003 as an important first step in \nreducing the existing inequities in payment levels.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Medicare \nPhysician Payment Equity Act of 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1136. A bill to restate, clarify, and revise the Soldiers' and \nSailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation that \nwould restate, revise and update the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil \nRelief Act of 1940, SSCRA.\n  The SSCRA, in summary, suspends some of the legal obligations \nincurred by military personnel prior to entry into the service so that \nthey might give their full attention to military duty. As was stated by \nthe Supreme Court in LeMaistre v. Leffers, 333 U.S. 1, 6, 1948, SSCRA \nis to be read ``with an eye friendly to those who dropped their\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\naffairs to answer their country's call.'' With operations in Iraq now \nwrapping up, it is an appropriate time for a review of this World War \nII-vintage legislation to see how it might be modified to better \naddress the needs of 21st Century servicemen and women.\n  I should mention at this point that I am aware that a bill to revise \nthe SSCRA, H.R. 100, is currently pending in the House, and that my \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Zell Miller, has introduced companion \nlegislation in the Senate as S. 792. My legislation is similar to H.R. \n100 and S. 792, but it contains modifications and additions to those \nbills as suggested by reservists and their families, the Department of \nDefense, and by other groups. It is my intention to work with Senator \nMiller to craft legislation that incorporates the best features of the \ntwo bills.\n  This legislation would rename SSCRA the ``Servicemembers' Civil \nRelief Act'' to reflect that the Armed Forces are made up now of more \nthan just soldiers and sailors, and keep in place the core protections \nthat have been features of SSCRA for decades: stays of civil \nproceedings during a person's period of military service; an interest \nrate cap of 6 percent on debts incurred before active duty; protection \nfrom eviction and termination of pre-service residential leases; and \nlegal residency protection. But it would also add several new \nprovisions to this core.\n  Currently, the Higher Education Act of 1965 prohibits the SSCRA's 6 \npercent interest cap from applying to Federally-insured student loans. \nThis bill would remove that prohibition. It would also require \ninstitutions of higher education to permit students who are called to \nactive duty to return and complete classes at no additional cost.\n  In addition, SSCRA now precludes evictions from premises occupied by \nservicemembers having a monthly rent $1200 or less. This $1200 ceiling \nwas set in 1991; it has not been adjusted since. This legislation would \nraise the rent ceiling to $1950 or the amount of a servicemember's \nbasic allowance for housing, whichever is higher. It would thereby take \npost-1991 inflation into account, and avoid the need for frequent \namendments to the law since housing allowances are adjusted annually \nbased on housing costs in the area where the servicemember is assigned.\n  When the SSCRA was originally enacted in 1940, automobiles were not \ncommonly leased. That, of course, has changed; many people now choose \nleasing as a way to finance their personal transportation needs. This \nlegislation would protect servicemembers who have leased cars--just as \nit does those who had chosen the more traditional form of auto \nfinancing--in two ways. First, it would prohibit lessors, like purchase \nfinancers, from repossessing personal property for nonpayment or breach \nwithout court action. Second, it would allow servicemembers called to \nactive duty to terminate automobile leases just as they can real \nproperty leases.\n  This bill also takes steps to offer some protection to professionals \nand small business owners who are called to active duty. It would \ninclude the practice of law among the ``professional services'' for \nwhich professional liability insurance obligations could be suspended \nsubject to mandatory reinstatement. It would also authorize the \nSecretary of Defense to designate other professional callings that \nwould be subject to these protections. And it would protect the assets \nof small business owners during military service if the servicemember \nis personally liable for trade or business debts.\n  Since 1940, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act has provided \nimportant protections to the men and women who wear the uniform. But \n60-plus years later, it is time for Congress to take a critical look at \nthis law and revise it to reflect changes in our society since it was \noriginally enacted. With the assistance of the Department of Defense, \nthe National Guard Bureau, the Enlisted Association of the National \nGuard, and the Small Business Administration, the staff of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, most notably Mr. David Goetz, the \nCommittee's Associate Counsel, has undertaken the painstaking review \nthat has yielded this rather extensive bill. It is my intention to seek \nfurther comment and then guide this important reform legislation to \nenactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration to establish and carry out traffic safety law \nenforcement and compliance campaigns, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, to introduce a bi-partisan bill aimed \nat reducing the number of vehicle incidents associated with drinking \nand driving.\n  Last year, the Nation experienced an increase in alcohol-related \ntraffic fatalities for the third year in a row. This increase resulted \nin 17,970 deaths or 42 percent of the 42,850 people killed in traffic \nincidents. Statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration show that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of \ndeath for Americans ages 1 to 35 years of age. In fact, on average, 117 \npeople die each day from motor vehicle crashes in the United States.\n  Our bill--the Traffic Safety Law Enforcement Campaign Act--would \nrequire States to conduct a combined media/law enforcement campaign \naimed at reducing these traffic fatalities. Specifically, the law \nenforcement portion consists of sobriety checkpoints in the District of \nColumbia and in the 39 States that allow them and saturation patrols in \nthose States that do not. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that \nthe sobriety checkpoints proposed in the underlying bill may reduce \nalcohol related crashes by as much as 20 percent. More than 75 percent \nof the public has indicated in NHTSA polls support for sobriety \ncheckpoints. In fact, NHTSA has concluded that 62 percent of Americans \nwant sobriety checkpoints to be used more often.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to join this bi-partisan effort to save \nlives and promote highway safety.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 23 and 49, United States Code, \nconcerning length and weight limitations for vehicles operating on \nFederal-aid highways, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce, along \nwith my colleagues Senator DeWine and Senator Feinstein, legislation \nwhich will make our roads safer and last longer. Anyone who has ever \nshared the road with a large tractor trailer truck has wondered whether \nthe truck driver is aware of the smaller vehicles around the truck. \nAnyone who has seen the third trailer on a triple-trailer truck \nswinging around like the tail end of a snake knows that these trucks \nare to be avoided.\n  The State of New Jersey sees its share of the Nation's truck traffic, \nbut, incidentally, not its share of federal highway dollars. We are \nconcerned about these 53-foot, 80,000-pound vehicles on our highways \nand the pressure from other states to increase weight and length \nlimitations to allow bigger trucks to come through our State. This\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nmakes truck safety even more important to New Jersey drivers.\n  Twelve years ago, I got a provision into the highway reauthorization \nbill we call ``ICE-TEA'' to ban triple-trailer trucks and other so-\ncalled ``longer combination vehicles'', LCVs, from New Jersey and most \nother States. At that time and ever since, the trucking industry has \nfought to defeat and repeal this ban, under the guise of arguments for \n``states' rights'' and ``unfair re-distribution of business to \nrailroads.'' But these are not rational arguments for allowing bigger \nand heavier trucks as well as triple-trailer trucks on our roads. \nAdditionally, the trucking industry's proclaimed hardships have not \nmaterialized. In fact, the trucking companies have survived the current \nlaws quite well, and trucks have refined their role in our national \nfreight transportation system.\n  Our bill, the ``Safe Highways and Infrastructure Preservation Act, \nwill extend the current limited ban which only applies to our 44,000-\nmile Interstate Highway System to the entire 156,000-mile National \nHighway System, NHS. This extension will make more roads safer and will \nfurther reduce the wear and tear of our highways and bridges.\n  Bigger trucks are not safe. The U.S. Department of Transportation has \ndetermined that multi-trailer trucks are likely to be involved in more \nfatal crashes--11 percent more--than today's single-trailer trucks. By \nexpanding the limits on triples and other longer combination vehicles \nto the entire NHS--including more than 2,000 miles of highway in New \nJersey--the Safe Highways and Infrastructure Protection Act will save \nlives and prevent further deterioration of our roads and bridges.\n  Triple-trailers and other LCVs do more damage to our roads and \nbridges but don't come close to paying associated maintenance and \nrepair costs. The fees, tolls and gasoline taxes paid by the operator \nof a 100,000-pound truck only covers 40 percent of the cost of the \ndamage that truck does to our roads and bridges. The rest of the \ntaxpayers make up the difference. I believe that motorists should not \nhave to share the road with these dangerous behemoths and pay for the \nextra damage they cause.\n  I thank my colleagues Senator DeWine and Senator Feinstein for \njoining me in sponsoring this important legislation, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Congress to improve the highway \nsafety and increase the remaining life of our country's roads and \nbridges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1141. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to increase \npenalties for individuals who operate motor vehicles while intoxicated \nor under the influence of alcohol; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio and \nI are helping to make a big stride in re-arming our country in the war \nagainst drunk driving. Together, we have introduced two pieces of \nlegislation which will help reduce the number of civilian casualties in \nthis war by arming our government safety officials with the weapons \nthey need to keep drunk drivers off of our roads.\n  First, I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator DeWine's legislation \non improving enforcement of drunk driving laws. There are some good \ndrunk driving laws on the books and they should not be ignored. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, much of our country's law enforcement focus has \nbeen on ensuring the security of citizens from terrorist attack. This \nlegislation will ensure that efforts to reduce drunk driving are not \ngiven short shrift. Almost 18,000 people died last year in alcohol-\nrelated motor vehicle traffic crashes, and we must not neglect the \nsafety of our highways. This bill provides needed resources for law \nenforcement and will deter people from drinking and driving to begin \nwith.\n  Second, I am proud to introduce, along with Senator DeWine, \nlegislation targeting higher-risk drivers. This includes repeat \noffenders and drivers with blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.15 \npercent or higher. Once these offenders are caught, we need to make \nsure they don't fall through the cracks in the legal system. These \ncriminals should not be behind the wheel--I believe they are a menace \nto our society, and we should not tolerate their existence.\n  I have long been interested in making our roads and highways safer. \nDuring my previous tenure, I saw to it that the Federal government took \nresponsibility for reducing the number of fatalities due to drunk \ndriving. I authored laws to increase the minimum drinking age for \nalcoholic beverages from 18 to 21, and to encourage States to establish \n.08 percent as the blood alcohol concentration standard for drunk \ndriving nationwide. These laws have made our roads and highways safer \nand my hope is that they have saved many precious lives.\n  I feel that the Federal Government needs to take a strong leadership \nrole to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. States cannot deal with these \nproblems in a comprehensive manner. We have passed legislation \nencouraging states to establish tougher standards for highways safety \nand drunk driving, but: 32 States still don't have a primary \nenforcement safety belt law; 11 States still have not adopted the .08 \npercent Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) standard; 24 States still don't \nhave an open container law; and 27 States still don't have a repeat \noffender law for drunk driving offenses.\n  I am particularly disappointed that my home State of New Jersey has \nnot yet adopted the .08 percent BAC standard. At risk are millions of \ndollars in Federal highway funding that our State desperately needs to \nrepair and improve our roads and bridges. Here in Congress, I fight \ndesperately for this funding. But the State puts this funding at risk \nrather than make a sensible safety choice and adopt a .08 percent BAC \nstandard. This is why I feel that the Federal Government needs to take \na leadership role in setting policies that will save lives by reducing \ndrunk driving.\n  I feel that States need stronger ``encouragement'' to address these \nimportant highway safety issues. We have already tried threatening \nwithholding highway construction funds, but if we allow a loophole for \nStates to recover the funds within 4 years; maybe that still is not \nenough encouragement.\n  Now it is time to take the next step in getting drunk drivers off our \nroads. I look forward to working with Senator DeWine and the rest of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to reduce the 18,000 alcohol-related traffic \nfatalities that occur each year. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nSenator DeWine in supporting both of these important pieces of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S7054-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7054-S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 153--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CHANGES \nTO ATHLETICS POLICIES ISSUED UNDER TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS \nOF 1972 WOULD CONTRADICT THE SPIRIT OF ATHLETIC EQUALITY AND THE INTENT \n  TO PROHIBIT SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES \n                 RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 153\n\n       Whereas title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), also known as the ``Patsy Takemoto Mink \n     Equal Opportunity in Education Act'' (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``title IX''), prohibits education programs or \n     activities, including athletic programs or activities, that \n     receive Federal financial assistance from discriminating on \n     the basis of sex;\n       Whereas prior to 1972 and the enactment of title IX, \n     virtually no college offered athletic scholarships to women, \n     fewer than 32,000 women participated in collegiate sports, \n     and women's sports received only 2 percent of college \n     athletic dollars;\n       Whereas the regulation implementing title IX was submitted \n     to Congress, multiple hearings were held, and the regulation \n     became effective July 21, 1975, with specific provisions \n     governing athletic programs and the awarding of athletic \n     scholarships;\n       Whereas according to the Department of Education's 1979 \n     Policy Interpretation, which interprets the application of \n     title IX\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n     and its implementing regulations to athletics, an educational \n     institution may demonstrate compliance with title IX's \n     requirement that it allocate athletic participation \n     opportunities on a nondiscriminatory basis to male and female \n     athletes by meeting 1 of the criteria in a 3-part test, by \n     demonstrating--\n       (1) that intercollegiate level participation opportunities \n     for male and female students are provided in numbers \n     substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments \n     at the institution;\n       (2) a history and continuing practice of program expansion \n     responsive to the developing interests and abilities of \n     members of the underrepresented athletes' sex; or\n       (3) that the interests and abilities of the members of the \n     underrepresented athletes' sex have been fully and \n     effectively accommodated by the present program;\n       Whereas the 1979 Policy Interpretation and its 3-part test \n     have been in place for over 2 decades and have been supported \n     by both Republican and Democratic administrations;\n       Whereas 2 out of 3 educational institutions comply with the \n     second or third criterion of the 3-part test;\n       Whereas the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of \n     Education issued a Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics \n     Policy Guidance in 1996 regarding the 3-part test--\n       (1) confirming that educational institutions can comply \n     with title IX's requirement of nondiscriminatory allocation \n     of athletic participation opportunities by meeting any single \n     part of the 3-part test;\n       (2) setting out specific examples for compliance to guide \n     the institutions; and\n       (3) confirming that there are no strict numerical formulas \n     for determining title IX compliance;\n       Whereas the 1979 Policy Interpretation and the 1996 \n     clarification provide educational institutions with ample and \n     fair guidance on compliance with title IX and provide \n     flexibility to the institutions so that they may determine \n     for themselves how best to comply with the law;\n       Whereas the enforcement mechanism of title IX, the 3-part \n     test, has been upheld as legal and valid by each of the 8 \n     United States Courts of Appeals to consider it;\n       Whereas since the beginning of title IX implementation, \n     men's participation in intercollegiate sports has increased \n     from 220,178 to 231,866, and women's participation in those \n     sports has increased from 31,852 to 162,783, an increase of \n     more than 400 percent;\n       Whereas the number of girls participating in athletics at \n     the high school varsity level has increased from 294,015 in \n     1972 to 2,784,154 in 2001, an 847 percent increase;\n       Whereas sex discrimination in athletics persists, despite \n     the strides made under title IX, with, for example, female \n     athletes receiving only 42 percent of the college athletic \n     participation opportunities nationwide, even though female \n     students make up 56 percent of the college population, and \n     female athletes receiving $133,000,000 fewer athletic \n     scholarship dollars per year than their male counterparts;\n       Whereas nothing in title IX or its policies requires \n     educational institutions to reduce men's athletic \n     participation opportunities to come into compliance with \n     participation requirements and 72 percent of colleges and \n     universities that have added women's teams have done so \n     without cutting any teams for men;\n       Whereas recommendations made by the Commission on \n     Opportunity in Athletics for changes to the athletics \n     policies issued under title IX would seriously weaken title \n     IX's protections and result in significant losses in athletic \n     participation opportunities and scholarships to which women \n     and girls are entitled under current law; and\n       Whereas those recommended changes to the title IX athletics \n     policies would allow an educational institution that fails to \n     equally accommodate its male and female students to be in \n     compliance with title IX without having to fully demonstrate \n     that discrimination does not exist in the institution's \n     athletic programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) changes to athletics policies issued under title IX \n     would contradict the spirit and intent of title IX's mandate \n     to provide equal opportunities in athletics;\n       (2) the current title IX athletics policies, namely, the \n     1975 regulations issued under title IX, and the 1979 Policy \n     Interpretation, as clarified in the 1996 Clarification of \n     Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance, should remain \n     unchanged and be enforced vigorously to eliminate the \n     continuing discrimination against women and girls in \n     athletics; and\n       (3) if the Department of Education changes the current \n     title IX athletics policies, Congress will respond with \n     legislation to restore the policies and preserve the right to \n     equal opportunities in athletics, as mandated by title IX.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today is opening day for the seventh \nseason of the Women's National Basketball Association. The league's \nincredible success demonstrates the enormous influence that title IX \nhas had on women in sports, and in society.\n  Since the WNBA's inception, the number of players and teams in the \nleague have doubled, and its popularity has skyrocketed throughout the \nNation, and all over the world. It is fitting, therefore, that the WNBA \nhas helped lead the way in support of maintaining title IX and its \nenforcement. The league has circulated a petition and collected over \n25,000 signatures, including those of current and former NBA and WNBA \nplayers, as well as of an impressive array of other prominent \nAmericans, to voice concern over the proposed changes.\n  It is in the spirit of this overwhelming support for the effort to \nprovide equal opportunities for all of America's students that I join \nmy Senate colleagues in offering a bipartisan resolution on title IX.\n  Specifically, our resolution would express the sense of the Senate \nthat the changes to title IX policies recommended by the Commission on \nOpportunity in Athletics would run contrary to the spirit and purpose \nof the original law, and that the current mechanisms for enforcement \nare both fair and reasonable. Our resolution would also state that \nCongress will respond to any changes in title IX policy with \nlegislation to restore these protections, and to preserve the right to \nequal opportunities in athletics.\n  The enactment of title IX in 1972 was a landmark moment in this \nhistory of American education policy. For the first time ever, women \nand girls in schools across the Nation could be sure they would receive \nthe same educational opportunities as their male counterparts--\nopportunities to learn, grow, and compete.\n  But this issue is about more than equality under the law; it is about \ndemonstrating to our children that confidence and success in our \nsociety, in our workplaces, and on our athletic fields know no gender. \nIt is about teaching our girls and boys the skills they need to \nparticipate in our society.\n  Studies have shown that girls who play sports are less likely to \nbecome depressed, fall victim to an eating disorder, take drugs, get \npregnant, and contract breast cancer later in life. Thus, as a result \nof title IX and the doors that it has opened, our Nation has produced a \nstronger, healthier, happier generation of girls than ever before.\n  Title IX's successes have been overwhelming. Prior to 1972 and the \nenactment of title IX, virtually no college offered athletic \nscholarships to women, fewer than 32,000 women participated in \ncollegiate sports, and women's sports received only 2 percent of \nschools' athletic funds.\n  Since the implementation of title IX, men's participation in \ncollegiate sports has increased, and women's participation has \nincreased more than 400 percent. At the high school level, the increase \nin athletic opportunities for women and girls has been even more \nstaggering; since 1972, female participation in high school varsity \nathletics has increased from 294,015 to 2,784,154, an increase of 847 \npercent.\n  While title IX has already enjoyed many successes, the fact remains \nthat sex discrimination in athletics persists. Unfortunately, the \nSecretary's Commission on Opportunity in Athletics has proposed changes \nto title IX enforcement that are deeply troubling.\n  The Commission's report ignores clear evidence showing that our \ndaughters' new opportunities have not come at the expense of our sons. \nNothing in title IX or its policies requires schools to reduce men's \nopportunities to comply with participation requirements, and 72 percent \nof colleges and universities that have added women's athletic teams \nhave done so without cutting any teams for men. In fact, evidence \nsuggests that we must do more to strengthen title IX enforcement, not \nweaken it.\n  Currently, despite the fact that women comprise 56 percent of the \ncollege population, female athletes receive only 42 percent of the \ncollege participation opportunities nationwide. In addition, women and \ngirls receive $133 million fewer scholarship dollars annually than \ntheir male counterparts.\n  The changes being proposed would significantly weaken the existing \nmechanisms for enforcing title IX's provisions--mechanisums that have \nbeen in place for decades and have provided adequate flexibility to \neducational institutions seeking to demonstrate compliance.\n  Moreover, the current enforcement mechanism has been repeatedly \naffirmed--by the regulations issued by the Department of Education in \n1975,\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nby the Department's 1979 policy review, and by the 1996 Clarification \nof Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance.\n  These policies have remained unchanged for 20 years, thanks to the \naffirmation of both Republican and Democratic administrations. Instead \nof evaluating proposals that could weaken title IX, the administration \nshould focus on efforts to continue to build on its history of success.\n  The argument used by detractors of title IX in favor of the \nCommission's recommendations is that title IX has increased athletic \nopportunities for women to the detriment of those available to men. \nThis is simply not true.\n  Today, the Senate must take a strong stand in favor of title IX as it \nis currently written and enforced. Title IX is an integral part of the \neffort to provide America's students with the opportunities they need \nand deserve to achieve their full potential, and we must not retreat \nfrom this goal. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in all education \nprograms and activities that receive Federal funding, including sports. \nWhen Congress passed this important civil rights law, it intended to \ngive girls and women opportunities equal to those of boys and men in \nall education programs receiving taxpayer dollars. Today, on opening \nday of the Women's National Basketball Association's seventh season, we \nsee again the enormous impact of Title IX on women's sports. Since its \nfirst season in 1997, the WNBA has doubled its number of teams from 8 \nto 16. Last year, millions of fans from countries throughout the world \ntuned to see 176 women play professional basketball in 256 regular-\nseason WNBA games.\n  Over the past 31 years, Title IX has expanded athletic opportunities \nat all levels for all women. Fewer than 32,000 women participated in \ncollege sports before Title IX. Today, the number is 163,000. \nOpportunities for girls in high school have grown even more incredibly, \nfrom 294,000 to almost 2.8 million.\n  Athletic opportunities contribute to better health for women, and \nthey also translate into better outcomes in many other areas as well. \nParticipation in sports builds confidence, improves self-esteem, \nreduces stress, teaches teamwork, and improves achievement in \neducation.\n  The female athletes of the past 31 years who have reaped the benefits \nof Title IX are a tribute to its success. Countless women have taken \nthe lessons they learned on the playing field and applied them to the \nrest of their lives. They serve as role models for us all. And one of \nthe things they have proved so clearly is that when the opportunities \nare there, women will show up to play.\n  But it's never clear sailing for Title IX. Despite all the progress \nin athletic opportunities under the current law, women continue to lag \nbehind men in playing time and funding. Women in Division I colleges \ncomprise 53 percent of the student body, but they receive only 41 \npercent of the opportunities to play in intercollegiate sports, 43 \npercent of athletic scholarship dollars, 36 percent of athletic \nbudgets, and 32 percent of the dollars spent to recruit new athletes.\n  Even though parity is not yet achieved, a movement is under way to \nundermine Title IX. The Bush Administration's Commission on Opportunity \nin Athletics has issued recommendations that would drastically reduce \nits enforcement and put women and girls at a disadvantage by permitting \nschools to reduce athletic opportunities and scholarships for women. \nThe Women's Sports Foundation estimates that college women would lose \n50,000 slots and $122 million in scholarships under one of the \nCommission proposals. High school girls would lose 305,000 \nopportunities. What is needed is even stronger enforcement of Title IX, \nnot weakening or modifying it. The Department of Education should \nconcentrate its efforts on fully and fairly enforcing the existing law \nthrough existing mechanisms.\n  Current law on Title IX is fair, and it provides schools with \nflexibility in meeting its requirements. They can comply in any one of \nthree ways: by showing that the percentages of male and female athletes \nare substantially proportionate to the percentage of male and female \nstudent enrolled full-time; by demonstrating a history and continuing \npractice of program expansion to meet the needs of the under-\nrepresented athletes; or by demonstrating that their interests and \nabilities have been fully and effectively accommodated.\n  This three-part test has been in place for over two decades, and has \nbeen supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations. It \nhas been upheld by all eight Federal Courts of Appeals who have \nconsidered it.\n  Some critics claim that the first prongs of the three prong test, \ncalled the proportionality text, has become the de facto test of \ncompliance. But in fact, 2 out of 3 schools comply with Title IX \nthrough the second and third options, not through proportionality.\n  The major complaint is that Title IX has hurt men's sports. Yet, \nsince the beginning of Title IX implementation, men's participation in \nintercollegiate sports has actually increased, and so has the total \nnumber of teams for men. Nothing in Title IX or its policies requires \nschools to reduce men's opportunities. 72 percent of colleges and \nuniversities that had added women's teams have done so without cutting \nany teams for men. When schools have discontinued men's or women's \nteams, a lack of student interest was cited as the most important \nfactor in the decision. Schools also discontinue men's and women's \nteams because of choices about how to allocate their resources. These \ndecisions are not the product of a Title IX mandate.\n  Unfortunately, the President's Commission was not representative of \nthe whole Title IX community. Two-thirds of the Commissioners \nrepresented Division I-A colleges, which have the largest men's \nbasketball and football budgets and therefore the most to gain from \nweakening Title IX. No Division II or III colleges, no community \ncolleges, and no high schools were represented, even though they tend \nto have the most successful record of implementation of Title IX. Twice \nas many opponents of Title IX were asked to testify before the \nCommission, compared to proponents of the law. Institutions that had \nbeen sued for non-compliance and lost their cases were invited to \ntestify, but the women who were discriminated against and who brought \nthese suits and the schools that have complied with the law \nsuccessfully were not invited.\n  In response to the unfairness of the process and resulting findings, \ntwo of the Commissioners issued a minority report summarizing the \nproblems with the Commission and its recommendations. Secretary of \nEducation Paige has refused to consider the concerns raised in the \nminority report. Needless to say, the Commission was not fair and \nimpartial, and it should not be the basis by which Congress judges \nTitle IX. The Commission's proposals contradict the spirit of athletic \nequality and the intent to prohibit discrimination against girls and \nwomen in education.\n  Today, we submit a bipartisan resolution to maintain Title IX and \nstrengthen its enforcement. Only then will full promise be achieved. We \nmust retreat from the Nation's commitment to equal opportunity for \nwomen and girls in education and athletics. Girls and boys, women and \nmen, need education opportunities such as athletics to allow them to \nbuild character, self-esteem and motivation. The past 31 years \ndemonstrate the amazing advances that women and girls have made in \nathletics when they are given the opportunities to play, and it would \nbe shameful for Congress or the Administration to misuse that \nextraordinary success as an excuse to retreat now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S7056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7056-S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 799.

Mr. President, I support the nominations of Ricardo \nHinojosa and Michael Horowitz to the United States Sentencing \nCommission. The Sentencing Commission is responsible for developing \nguidelines for sentencing in Federal courts; collecting data about \ncrime and sentencing; and serving as a resource to Congress, the White \nHouse, the Justice Department, and the judiciary on crime and \nsentencing policy. It is therefore critical that nominations to this \ncommission continue to be made in a fair, cooperative, and bipartisan \nmanner.\n  When Mr. Hinojosa's and Mr. Horowitz's nominations came up in the \nJudiciary Committee in March 2003, I voted ``present'' because I was \nconcerned about the process by which the White House had selected them. \nIn particular, I was concerned that instead of the bipartisan selection \nprocess by which previous nominees had been named, the White House had \nselected Mr. Horowitz as an ostensible ``Democratic'' nominee without \nany consultation with Senate Democrats.\n  Since that vote in committee, I have been informed that White House \nCounsel Alberto Gonzales has assured the ranking member of our \ncommittee, Senator Leahy, that the White House is treating both Mr. \nHinojosa and Mr. Horowitz as Republican nominees to the commission. I \nfurther understand that when the next three vacancies arise on the \ncommission in October, the President will either reappoint all three \ncommissioners now holding those seats--Ruben Castillo, William \nSessions, and Michael O'Neill--or will consult in the traditional and \nappropriate manner with the Democratic leadership before announcing a \nreplacement nominee for a current Democratic commissioner. Based on \nthat understanding, I have decided to support these important \nnominations to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S7065-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 105, S. Con. Res. 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) expressing the \n     sense of Congress that the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic \n     violence within many participating States of the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is a profound \n     concern and effort that should be undertaken to prevent \n     future occurrences.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the broad bipartisan \nsupport given to Senate Concurrent Resolution 7, and the prompt action \nby the Committee on Foreign Relations, allowing for timely \nconsideration of this resolution by the full Senate. Anti-Semitism is \nan evil that has bedeviled previous generations, formed a black spot on \nhuman history, and remains a problem to this day. As Co-Chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I have been particularly concerned over the \ndisturbing rise\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\nin anti-Semitism and related violence in many participating States of \nthe 55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nOSCE, including the United States.\n  The anti-Semitic violence we witnessed in 2002, which stretched the \nbreadth of the OSCE region, is a wake-up call that this evil still \nlives today, often coupled with a resurgence of aggressive nationalism \nand an increase in neo-Nazi ``skin head'' activity. Together with \ncolleagues on the Helsinki Commission, we have diligently urged the \nleaders of OSCE participating States to confront and combat the plague \nof anti-Semitism. Through concerted efforts by the State Department and \nthe U.S. Mission to the OSCE, a conference focused on anti-Semitism--\ncalled for in the pending resolution--will be convened in Vienna, \nAustria, June 19-20.\n  Meanwhile, the Helsinki Commission has undertaken a number of \ninitiatives aimed at further elevating the attention given to rising \nanti-Semitism. In the year since the Commission's hearing on this \nissue, Commissioners have pursued it within the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly as well as in contacts with officials from countries of \nparticular concern. I would point to France as a country that has \nrecognized the problem and acted to confront anti-Semitism and related \nviolence with tougher laws and more vigorous law enforcement. I urge \nFrench officials to remain vigilant, while recognizing that none of our \ncountries is immune.\n  A recent opinion survey of adults in five European countries \nconducted by the Anti-Defamation League, ADL, found that 21 percent \nharbor ``strong anti-Semitic views.'' At the same time, the survey \nrevealed that 61 percent of the individuals polled stated they are \n``very concerned'' or ``fairly concerned'' about violence directed \nagainst European Jews. An ADL national poll of 1000 American adults \nfound that 17 percent of Americans holds views about Jews that are \n``unquestionably anti-Semitic,'' an increase of 5 percent from the \nprevious survey conducted four years earlier. According to ADL there \nwere 1,559 reported anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. in 2002, with \nattacks on campuses rising by 24 percent over the previous year.\n  Mr. President, if anti-Semitism is ignored and allowed to fester and \ngrow, our societies and civilization will suffer. A particularly \ndisturbing element we have observed is the growth of anti-Semitic acts \nand attitudes among young people ranging from a rise in incidents on \nU.S. college campuses to violent attacks perpetrated on Jews by young \nmembers of immigrant communities in Western Europe. Education is \nessential to reversing the rise in anti-Semitism. Our young people must \nbe taught about the Holocaust and other acts of genocide. Institutions \nsuch as the Holocaust Memorial Museum are making valuable contributions \nto promote the sharing of this experience at home and abroad. Such \nactivity should have our strong support as a vital tool in confronting \nand combating anti-Semitism.\n  Mr. President, passage of the Senate Concurrent Resolution 7 will put \nthe United States Senate on record and send an unequivocal message that \nanti-Semitism must be confronted, and it must be confronted now.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas the expressions of anti-Semitism experienced \n     throughout the region encompassing the participating States \n     of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     (OSCE) have included physical assaults, with some instances \n     involving weapons or stones, arson of synagogues, and \n     desecration of Jewish cultural sites, such as cemeteries and \n     statues;\n       Whereas vicious propaganda and violence in many OSCE States \n     against Jews, foreigners, and others portrayed as alien have \n     reached alarming levels, in part due to the dangerous \n     promotion of aggressive nationalism by political figures and \n     others;\n       Whereas violence and other manifestations of xenophobia and \n     discrimination can never be justified by political issues or \n     international developments;\n       Whereas the Copenhagen Concluding Document adopted by the \n     OSCE in 1990 was the first international agreement to condemn \n     anti-Semitic acts, and the OSCE participating States pledged \n     to ``clearly and unequivocally condemn totalitarianism, \n     racial and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and \n     discrimination against anyone as well as persecution on \n     religious and ideological grounds'';\n       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly at its meeting in \n     Berlin in July 2002, unanimously adopted a resolution that, \n     among other things, called upon participating States to \n     ensure aggressive law enforcement by local and national \n     authorities, including thorough investigation of anti-Semitic \n     criminal acts, apprehension of perpetrators, initiation of \n     appropriate criminal prosecutions, and judicial proceedings;\n       Whereas Decision No. 6 adopted by the OSCE Ministerial \n     Council at its Tenth Meeting held in Porto, Portugal in \n     December 2002 (the ``Porto Ministerial Declaration'') \n     condemned ``the recent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in \n     the OSCE area, recognizing the role that the existence of \n     anti-Semitism has played throughout history as a major threat \n     to freedom'';\n       Whereas the Porto Ministerial Declaration also urged ``the \n     convening of separately designated human dimension events on \n     issues addressed in this decision, including on the topics of \n     anti-Semitism, discrimination and racism, and xenophobia''; \n     and\n       Whereas on December 10, 2002, at the Washington \n     Parliamentary Forum on Confronting and Combating anti-\n     Semitism in the OSCE Region, representatives of the United \n     States Congress and the German Parliament agreed to denounce \n     all forms of anti-Semitism and agreed that ``anti-Semitic \n     bigotry must have no place in our democratic societies'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) officials of the executive branch and Members of \n     Congress should raise the issue of anti-Semitism in their \n     bilateral contacts with other countries and at multilateral \n     fora, including meetings of the Permanent Council of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and the Twelfth Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary \n     Assembly to be convened in July 2003;\n       (2) participating States of the OSCE should unequivocally \n     condemn anti-Semitism (including violence against Jews and \n     Jewish cultural sites), racial and ethnic hatred, xenophobia, \n     and discrimination, as well as persecution on religious \n     grounds whenever it occurs;\n       (3) participating States of the OSCE should ensure \n     effective law enforcement by local and national authorities \n     to prevent and counter criminal acts stemming from anti-\n     Semitism, xenophobia, or racial or ethnic hatred, whether \n     directed at individuals, communities, or property, including \n     maintaining mechanisms for the thorough investigation and \n     prosecution of such acts;\n       (4) participating States of the OSCE should promote the \n     creation of educational efforts throughout the region \n     encompassing the participating States of the OSCE to counter \n     anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among younger people, \n     increase Holocaust awareness programs, and help identify the \n     necessary resources to accomplish this goal;\n       (5) legislators in all OSCE participating States should \n     play a leading role in combating anti-Semitism and ensure \n     that the resolution adopted at the 2002 meeting of the OSCE \n     Parliamentary Assembly in Berlin is followed up by a series \n     of concrete actions at the national level; and\n       (6) the OSCE should organize a separately designated human \n     dimension event on anti-Semitism as early as possible in \n     2003, consistent with the Porto Ministerial Declaration \n     adopted by the OSCE at the Tenth Meeting of the OSCE \n     Ministerial Council in December 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/22/senate-section/article/S7069-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7069-S7070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONDEMNING BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 133) condemning bigotry and violence \n     against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South Asian-\n     Americans, and Sikh Americans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I support S. Res. 133, a resolution \nexpressing the Senate's condemnation of acts of bigotry and violence \nagainst Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South-Asian Americans, and \nSikh Americans.\n  I am pleased to join the Senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nand the\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, in sponsoring this resolution in \nthe Senate. I would like to thank them for their leadership on this \nissue, along with the other Senators from both sides of the aisle who \nhave joined us as cosponsors. And I would also like to thank Chairman \nHatch, Ranking Member Leahy, and the members of the Judiciary Committee \nfor their favorable action on the resolution.\n  Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South-Asian Americans, and Sikh \nAmericans contribute greatly to American society. Many serve honorably \nin the armed services and as law enforcement officials. Like all law-\nabiding Americans, they deserve respect for their civil rights and \ncivil liberties. This resolution condemns bias-motivated acts against \nmembers of these communities and calls upon Federal and local law \nenforcement to prosecute any criminal violations.\n  Regrettably, after the September 11 attacks and more recently after \nthe start of military action in Iraq, acts of bigotry and violence \nagainst Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South-Asian Americans, and \nSikh Americans have increased. President Bush has condemned such \nincidents on more than one occasion, and it is appropriate for the \nSenate to join him and citizens across the country in expressing \noutrage over these acts.\n  I applaud the Senate's passage of this resolution, and I again thank \nthe Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and the Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold, for working with me on this important issue.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 92\n\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States of America \n     was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 delegates from 12 \n     States;\n       Whereas the Constitution was subsequently ratified by each \n     of the original 13 States;\n       Whereas the Constitution was drafted in order to form a \n     more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic \n     tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for the \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas the Constitution has provided the means and \n     structure for this Nation and its citizens to achieve a level \n     of prosperity, liberty, security, and justice that is \n     unparalleled among nations;\n       Whereas the Constitution's contributions to the welfare of \n     the human race reach far beyond the borders of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Senate continues to strive to preserve and \n     strengthen the values and rights bestowed by the Constitution \n     upon the United States of America and its citizens; and\n       Whereas the preservation of such values and rights in the \n     hearts and minds of American citizens would be advanced by \n     official recognition of the signing of the Constitution: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate:\n       (1) designates September 17, 2003, as ``Constitution Day''; \n     and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n                              S. Res. 145\n\n       Whereas the mission of the National Safety Council is to \n     educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \n     environmental policies, practices, and procedures that \n     prevent and mitigate human suffering and economic losses \n     arising from preventable causes;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council works to protect lives \n     and promote health with innovative programs;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council, founded in 1913, is \n     celebrating its 90th anniversary in 2003 as the premier \n     source of safety and health information, education, and \n     training in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council was congressionally \n     chartered in 1953, and is celebrating its 50th anniversary in \n     2003 as a congressionally chartered organization;\n       Whereas, even with advancements in safety that create a \n     safer environment for Americans, such as improvements in \n     technology and new legislation, the unintentional-injury \n     death toll is still unacceptable;\n       Whereas citizens deserve a solution to nationwide safety \n     and health threats;\n       Whereas such a solution requires the cooperation of all \n     levels of government, as well as the general public; and\n       Whereas the summer season, traditionally a time of \n     increased unintentional-injury fatalities, is an appropriate \n     time to focus attention on both the problem and the solution: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2003, as ``National Safety Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote \n     acknowledgement, gratitude, and respect for the advances of \n     the National Safety Council and its mission.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}]
