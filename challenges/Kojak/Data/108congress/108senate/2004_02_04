The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                   thanking president aznar of spain\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning the Senate and House were \nprivileged to conduct a joint meeting--a wonderful meeting--to hear a \npowerful address by President Aznar of Spain. I again thank President \nAznar, who left here just moments ago, for his visit and for his \nremarks today.\n  Spain, through this President, has been a true ally in every sense of \nthe word. He did a wonderful job in articulating the great friendship \nthat our two countries have demonstrated, as he said, over the last two \nadministrations of this country.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon we have resumed consideration of S. \n1072, the highway bill. We notified Senators last night that it is our \nintention to work to complete action on this bill before the February \nrecess. We have made some progress on the bill thus far this week. The \nchairman modified the committee substitute yesterday and is ready to \nwork with Senators on their amendments today. Rollcall votes should be \nanticipated during today's session as we begin the amendment process. \nI, once again, encourage Senators to come to the floor and to work with \nthe bill managers to schedule floor time.\n  In addition to the highway bill amendments, the Senate may act on \navailable judicial nominations today. We will alert all Members of \nthese votes as they are scheduled.\n\n\n            unanimous consent agreement--committee meetings\n\n  Mr. President, I have three unanimous consent requests for committees \nto meet during today's session of the Senate. They all have been \napproved by the majority and minority leadership. I ask unanimous \nconsent that these requests be agreed to, en bloc, and that these \nrequests be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Reserving the right to object, I would like to \nask a question. I was under the impression that I had an opportunity \ntoday to complete a series of statements I was making on intelligence \nreform, and that was to begin at 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the managers are here. I know we had not \nlocked in any time. I would like to defer to the managers for that \nbecause, as we had said before, we would like to proceed with the \nconsideration of the bill itself.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. If I could add to your unanimous consent \nrequest a time certain that I could present my third statement on \nintelligence reform; and Senator Feinstein also wishes to make a \nstatement on the same subject.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yesterday, we had several occasions where we were trying \nto stay on the bill, and we kept saying: All right, one more person, \none more person, one more person.\n  As manager of the bill, I am going to do everything I can \nparliamentarily to stay on the bill and not get into other subjects.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Well then, I would have to object to the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we will proceed with the regular order here \nthen.\n\n\n                              ricin update\n\n  Mr. President, let me just say, in reference to the incident, the \ncriminal investigation that is underway because of the attack here with \nricin now 2\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\ndays ago, I will, sometime in the next hour, be coming back to the \nfloor for a very brief announcement so our colleagues will know of a \nproposed schedule for the reopening of the Senate office buildings. I \nwill be working on that over the course of the next 40 minutes or so. I \nmentioned to the Democratic leader that I will plan to come back.\n  I know there is a lot of concern and anticipation, and some \nfrustration, not knowing exactly when Senators will have access to \ntheir offices and to their records. We are working on that. We have \nbeen working on it over the course of the morning. We made real \nprogress yesterday. It was a very successful day in terms of laboratory \ntesting.\n  But again, let me come back and say that it is the safety and welfare \nof our employees and our staff that is fundamental. The science of this \nparticular agent is uncertain and new, but we have a lot of certainty \nthat we are gaining with each minute. So I plan on coming back to the \nfloor in about 30 minutes.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think we could \nprobably work this out. Why don't we go ahead and get rid of the Bond \namendment--all they want is a time certain--and have them come and talk \nafter that?\n  I say to Senator Inhofe, through the majority leader--we are anxious \nto have an amendment on this bill--maybe Senator Bond could lay down \nhis amendment. We could finish the debate on that, and I assume the \nleader wants a vote on it today. When that vote is completed, they \ncould be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding Senator Warner is not going to be \nhere today.\n  Mr. INHOFE. At 2:30.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe we could lay the amendment down and vote on it at \nsome subsequent time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. To do everything to accommodate the Senator from Florida, \nwhat I would like to do is stay on the bill until later on this \nafternoon, and at that time I am sure we are going to come to a point \nwhere, because of other things that are happening, there are not going \nto be Senators who want to speak on the bill, and then we could go to \nthis so the Senator would have the time he requested.\n  Mr. REID. How much time would the Senator from Florida need?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Thirty minutes. I would like to have it \ncommence no later than 3:30 because I have previous commitments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like a half hour.\n  Mr. REID. So there is an hour here being requested. I have an idea \nwhat they are going to talk about, and that means there will be time \nrequested on the other side to respond to it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection if he changes his 3:30 to 5 o'clock. \nThere are some things happening that affect every Senator in here \ntonight having to do with the National Prayer Breakfast, and I would \nlike to accommodate them as well.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I wish I could do that, but I have a request \nthat it be no later than 3:30. Frankly, if I had started when we began \nthis debate over parliamentary procedure, I would have been a third of \nthe way through the speech.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if we have an impasse about scheduling \nthis afternoon, I wonder if it would be appropriate to ask consent that \nwe have morning business tomorrow immediately after we commence Senate \nbusiness to accommodate the request made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida and the Senator from California. Could we do that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. If I may ask, when will we commence the \nsession tomorrow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is a matter to be determined by the majority \nleader, but I would suggest that normally we have Senate business in \nthe morning. We could either come in a little bit earlier or figure out \nour schedule. But it would not then interfere with the understandable \ndesire on the part of the manager to stay on the bill once we are on \nthe bill. Technically we are on the highway bill right now. Tomorrow \nmorning we could certainly accommodate the Senator's request with the \ntime allotted for his comments and those of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. Leader, may I make one request, that \nmorning business begin no later than 9:30 in the morning?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That would be up to the majority leader.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The majority leader will have to get in on this, but I \nwould say even earlier than that. We are going to have amendments. In \nfact, we have some amendments that will be ready today. We need to get \nto those and get this bill moving.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Florida \nthat I will talk to the majority leader. I would be surprised if he \nwould have any difficulty coming in prior to 9:30.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator withdraw his request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time prior to the time we move to \nthe bill itself. I wish to comment on a couple of things this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, if I could interrupt, I wonder if the majority \nleader's request could now be granted, the committees meeting and all \nthat.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator withdraw his objection to \nthe request for committees to meet?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader had made a unanimous consent \nrequest. On his behalf, I make it again. I don't think there will be an \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, the request of the majority leader is granted. The \nDemocratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        Conference on H.R. 3108\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was criticized by some Members of the \nHouse yesterday or today with regard to the pension bill. Their \ncriticism was that I was holding the bill. Let me make sure people \nunderstand: I have not held the bill. I have no desire to hold the \npension bill. I would like to get on with it. I would like to complete \nour work on the pension bill.\n  It is, of course, the prerogative of the majority leader and the \nmajority to send the bill to the House once we have completed our work. \nThat has not been done. They are certainly within their rights to make \ndecisions with regard to the disposition of the bill, but it would be \nin error to say that in any way I am holding the bill.\n  I am withholding our consent to go to conference on the bill, which \nis a different matter. I will talk about that in a moment. Obviously, \nSenator Frist and I have had some conversations about how we proceed \nwith regard to conferences this year.\n  We are unwilling to commit to a process that brought about the \nunacceptable circumstances in conference last year, especially on the \nenergy bill as well as the Medicare bill. But there are three \napproaches.\n  First, of course, on any bill, we are certainly within our rights to \nask for a conference with the House. What we have simply asked is that \nif there is a conference, all the conferees be present when \ndeliberations take place. That isn't too much to ask. That is all we \nare asking--our presence at conference meetings once those conference \nmeetings have been called. We don't think a conference can truly be a \nconference if only one party is represented. That is my simple request. \nUntil I have the assurance that that request is be granted, we are \nunable to provide consent to go to conference.\n  We are not asking for any predetermined outcome. We are not asking \nfor a certain set of expectations with regard to the legislation \nitself. We are simply saying: If you are going to have a conference, \ndon't call it a conference unless you have the conferees present.\n  There are two other approaches. I have just alluded to the second \napproach, which is to send the bill to the House. We have done that on \na number of occasions. There is nothing that precludes us from sending \nthe pension bill to the House, allowing them to work their will. \nPerhaps they will accept the changes made by the Senate. That certainly \nis within their right.\n  There is a third option. This is a tested, tried and true option that \nI can say with some authority has happened on countless occasions in \npast years and conferences. Last year we preconferenced the forest \nhealth bill. And once successfully preconferenced,\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\nwe agreed in conference to the provisions and the bill passed almost \nunanimously. In the 108th Congress, we passed 19 bills by \npreconferencing them first, including the AIDS Assistance Act, the \nMilitary Family Relief Act, the Veterans Benefits Act. And in the 107th \nCongress, we passed 51 bills by preconferencing the agreements: \nRailroad Retirement Survivors Improvement Act, the Veterans Benefit \nAct, Nurses Reinvestment Act, the Homeland Security Act, the Native \nAmerican Settlements and Indian Financing Act Amendments. Those and 40-\nplus more bills were preconferenced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of bills preconferenced and \nagreed to successfully in the 108th Congress to date and the 107th \nCongress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Bills Enacted Into Law Without Using a Conference To Negotiate \n          Differences in Language Between the House and Senate\n\n     108th Congress (as of February 2, 2004--19 bills)\n     H.R. 1584, Clean Diamond Trade Act\n     H.R. 1298, AIDS Assistance\n     H.R. 733, McLoughlin House National Historic Site Act\n     H.R. 13, Museum and Library Services Act\n     H.R. 3146, TANF Extension\n     H.R. 659, Hospital Mortgage Insurance Act\n     H.R. 1516, National Cemetery Expansion Act\n     H.R. 3365, Military Family Tax Relief Act\n     S. 313, Animal Drug User Fee Act\n     S. 1768, National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act\n     H.R. 1828, Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty \n         Restoration Act\n     S. 459, Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act\n     H.R. 2297, Veterans Benefits Act\n     S. 877, CAN-SPAM Act\n     H.R. 100, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act\n     H.R. 1006, Captive Wildlife Safety Act\n     H.R. 1012, Carter G.

Mr. President, we have three options. First, whether it \nis the pension bill or any bill, we can go to conference and do what \nthe institution requires, and that is have Members of the Senate and \nHouse, Republicans and Democrats, present at conferences and resolve \nour differences in the traditional manner.\n  Second, we can certainly pass the bill over to the House, send it \nover to the House at any time. We can do that on the pension bill this \nafternoon.\n  The third thing we can do is what I have just suggested has been done \nsuccessfully on 19 occasions so far in the 108th Congress and 51 \noccasions in the 107th Congress; that is, to preconference and \nultimately then to confirm our agreements in a formal conference once \nthe negotiations have been completed.\n  We stand ready, once again, to do whatever it takes to pass the \npension bill and ultimately put it on the President's desk. There is an \nurgency to this legislation. We will not, on any legislation this year, \ntolerate the unacceptable experience we had on several occasions in the \nfirst session of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to talk further about the \ntransportation bill. As I said yesterday, getting this bill to the \nfloor has been too long a process. I won't dwell on that other than to \nsay the Congress and the administration have not been successful in \nbringing this bill to conclusion, and because of that we have already \nlost 90,000 jobs.\n  For too long our economy has been slowed by outdated and inadequate \ntransportation infrastructure. Nothing expresses the urgency of this \nbill better than the fact that we have lost 3 million private sector \njobs over the last 3 years. It is time to get this bill done.\n  Make no mistake, not only will this bill create jobs all across the \ncountry but it will address our Nation's infrastructure deficit as \nwell.\n  If passed, this bill will improve the more than 30 percent of our \nroads and highways that are in poor and substandard condition today. It \nwill help improve the more than 30 percent of our Nation's bridges that \nare functionally obsolete or structurally deficient.\n  As I said yesterday, the managers of the bill, Chairman Inhofe and \nSenators Jeffords, Bond, and Reid, have done a remarkable job in \nbringing us a fine product to the Senate floor. This is a difficult, \ncomplicated issue, with an extraordinary number of different interests \nto balance.\n  The Finance Committee, led by Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, \nhas also done a fine job of ensuring that there is symmetry in how we \ndeal with highways and transit.\n  Senator Frist and I met on Monday to discuss the bill and we had a \nvery productive conversation. In essence, we both agreed that now the \nSenate has begun debate on the transportation bill, we need to ensure \nit goes forward in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion. That is how the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee has approached this bill, and we \nhave a fine work product because of that bipartisan, cooperative \napproach. That is how the Finance Committee has approached this bill, \nand we have a fine work product because of the bipartisan, cooperative \napproach there as well.\n  That is how the Banking Committee has approached the bill as it \nrelates to transit issues, and this morning the Banking Committee \nreported, by a voice vote, a fine work product because of the work \nChairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes have demonstrated in their \ncooperative approach.\n  That is why I find it so troubling that the administration appears to \nbe lagging behind--why they seem to be putting up roadblocks to the \nhighway bill instead of paving the way for improved infrastructure and \nmore jobs.\n  As I said, the Finance Committee reported a bill on Monday. Then \nTuesday, yesterday, Transportation Secretary Mineta and Treasury \nSecretary Snow sent a letter about those very same financing \nprovisions.\n  First of all, it would have been helpful to have had such a letter \nbefore the Finance Committee met, not a day\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\nafter. Second, based on the letter, many have claimed the Finance \nCommittee does not meet the administration's test with regard to the \nfinancing provision and have suggested the President may even veto the \nbill.\n  Now some of my colleagues disagree. They say the Finance Committee \nbill does meet the administration's test, and I hope they are correct. \nBut at this point, we simply don't know the administration's position \non the bill we are now considering on the floor.\n  It is important that the administration make its position clear. This \nbill deserves their unequivocal support. Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus and the other committee members put together an excellent and \nbalanced package and showed courage in taking on corporate tax \nloopholes. Most importantly, this bill makes real investments in our \nfuture in a fiscally responsible way. Every dollar in this bill is paid \nfor with a crackdown on corporate tax shelters, which has been a \nbipartisan priority in the Senate for years.\n  The package is a rare accomplishment--a bipartisan, fiscally \nresponsible one that invests in our future and creates jobs today. It \nis a win for highways, a win for transit, a win for fiscal \nresponsibility, and a win for honest taxpayers. The only losers are tax \ncheaters.\n  It is inexplicable to me why there is even discussion about the \nadministration threatening to veto this bipartisan package. Opposing \nthe financing provisions would raise troubling questions about the \nadministration's priorities.\n\n  Would they rather protect corporate tax cheaters than repair our \nroads and bridges and provide jobs?\n  Would they rather help wealthy people renounce their citizenship and \navoid paying their fair share of taxes than cut down on the traffic and \ncongestion that puts a drag on our economy and inconveniences our \ncitizens?\n  Would they rather protect corporations that engage in shady \nmanipulations than create a modern transportation system for America's \nfuture?\n  I hope those who say yesterday's administration letter is a veto \nthreat are wrong. The Finance Committee has done an exceptional job of \nproviding for the needs of our economy, while cracking down on tax \ncheats.\n  With a $521 billion deficit this year, we cannot afford to let \ncorporate tax cheaters continue to pass along their bills to the rest \nof us. We have an opportunity to bring new life to our economy, and \nold-fashioned accountability to our Tax Code. I urge the President to \nmake their position clear on this bill soon.\n  If we do what the Environment and Public Works Committee has done, if \nwe do what the Finance Committee has done, if we do what the Banking \nCommittee has done, if we do what Leader Frist and I have agreed to do \nand go forward in a bipartisan, cooperative fashion, if we go forward \nas soon as possible to get this long overdue bill done, we will make \nprogress not only for our Nation's infrastructure, but for our Nation \nas a whole.\n  This legislation will impact people all across our country every day. \nIt will provide jobs. It will make us more competitive in the world. \nLet's get on with passing the bill, and let's do it as thoroughly, as \ncompletely, but as much in keeping with the bipartisan spirit already \nestablished in three committees, as has been demonstrated thus far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the statement of the \nDemocratic leader. We have worked hard on this bill. As I have said \nbefore, it is an imperfect piece of legislation, but we have done the \nbest we can and we have been as fair to everybody as we could. We will \ncertainly be responsive to requests people have that will improve the \nbill.\n  I hope people who want to offer amendments will do so. We are going \nto have a mad rush next week. We are going to either finish this bill \nnext week or go off the bill next week. It would be a terrible \ndisservice to the country if we don't finish the bill next week. I hope \npeople, even though it is inconvenient and they are not in their \noffices, would do what they can to offer amendments if they want to \nchange the bill.\n  Also, I direct this to Senator Inhofe. It is my understanding the \nstatements from the administration yesterday regarding highways did not \ndeal with our bill but, rather, what is contemplated in the House. I \nbelieve everyone should understand that the administration has signed \noff on the bill reported out of the committee. They support what they \nhave done in financing this bill. The tax provisions that make up about \n$30 billion of the $255 billion have been supported by the \nadministration. My personal feeling--and I have said this before--is I \nwish we had more money. We are not going to get more. The President \nsaid if there is a bigger bill than what we have, he is going to veto \nit. The reason I asked the chairman to yield is to say it is my \nunderstanding the President supports our legislation.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I have a letter I read yesterday. It is dated \nFebruary 2, 2004. I have not heard anything either way about whether or \nnot they are supporting this legislation. But they outlined a set of \nprinciples yesterday to which our bill complies. I think the minority \nleader covered the three criteria that were used that would keep them \nfrom opposing the bill, and I believe they have been met. We talked \nabout it yesterday. One is to not increase gas taxes. Second, it would \nnot have any kind of bonding arrangement. Third, that it would not get \nin the general fund.\n  The third one is where there is some debate. I trust the Senate \nFinance Committee. I talked to both sides, Democrats and Republicans, \nand they came up with something I think meets the criteria. I am \nsatisfied it does.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the other thing I wanted to say is, there \nhas been a statement made, and at least two statements made on this \nfloor, about the ``pork'' in this bill. First of all, pork is not a bad \nterm with me. I think the things we do for our States, whether a new \nbridge or repairing a road, has nothing to do with anything that \nconnotes being bad when it needs to be done in the State. If they are \nreferring to that, there is no pork in a negative sense in this bill.\n  The vast majority of money in this bill comes from the highway trust \nfund. People, when they buy gas for their car, pay into a trust fund we \nuse every 5 or 6 years to fund highway projects around the country. \nThat is what we are doing today. People who talk about this bloated \nbill with too much money--this bill is paid for. There are no new \ntaxes, and the vast majority of the moneys coming out of the highway \ntrust fund is to fund the most important projects around the country.\n  I hope people understand this bill, as the Democratic leader said, is \nnot a bill for Democrats or Republicans; it is a bipartisan bill that \nhas the foundation of the programs of President Dwight D. \nEisenhower. He, with a Democratic Congress, passed this legislation. We \nhave to work together to pass this bill. This is important legislation.\n\n  I repeat to everyone within the sound of my voice, the majority \nleader said we are going to finish this bill a week from Friday. \nFinishing doesn't mean we complete this bill. I hope we do that. It \nwould be a disservice to the people of this country if we did not \nfinish this bill.\n  We are here waiting to do business. If anyone doesn't like the bill, \nlet them come and try to change it. If they change it, more power to \nthem. But waiting around is not going to help whatever concerns people \nhave with this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Will my friend from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate very much my distinguished \ncopartner on the Transportation Subcommittee talking about the need to \nget this bill through quickly. He was discussing the difference between \nthe bill we have now and the original bill.\n  I was wondering if it is correct that the original highway bill \nreally didn't have any formulas; it was what one would have to call \npork because it had various projects in it. It was an effort by the \nCongress to outline where money is needed. Is that not basically the \nform of the original highway bill?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I outlined, as the Senator knows, when we took this \nmatter\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nup Monday, the history of the last 20 years with these highway bills. \nThis bill is so much more fair to all 50 States than the bill in 1982, \nand the three subsequent bills. Some States prior to 1982 didn't even \nget 80 cents of every dollar they paid into the trust fund. This bill \ntook a gigantic step, and now every State gets a minimum of 95 cents on \nevery dollar they pay into the fund. This is a very fair program. It is \nimperfect, as I said before, but we are doing much better.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if the Senator from Nevada will yield for \nanother question, isn't it true that the scope of this bill, the size \nof it, reflects programs that Congresses in previous years decided are \ngood for the national transportation policy? In other words, we are not \ncreating a new formula; we have taken the formula, the apportionment \nthat existed. Is it not true that we have attempted to construct this \nbill so that, working with the formula, every State gets up to 95 \ncents?\n  My State of Missouri was one of those States, when I got here in \n1987, that was only getting back 77 cents. Every State will get up to \n95 cents on the dollar. Every State, at a minimum, will get a 10-\npercent increase. Some States that would be getting much more money \nwill only get a 40-percent or 40-plus-percent increase, which some may \nobject to and say is not enough. But in this day and age, with a tight \nbudget, it seems to me a 40-percent increase is not bad to take home \nfrom a compromise bill. Is that a fair assessment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respond to my friend, he is exactly right. \nThis bill is not some new invention. We have worked over the last \nseveral years to develop different programs. One is interstate \nmaintenance, which is self-explanatory. We have an interstate system \nthat has been completed, and we want to make sure that system is in a \ngood state of repair. It is a never-ending job to keep it up the best \nwe can. A large amount of this $255 billion goes to interstate \nmaintenance. We also have something called the National Highway System. \nWe have to make sure there is funding in the bill to take care of that \nprogram. It is what we have done in the past.\n\n  We also have other programs, such as the Bridge Maintenance Program, \nwhich is so important. One Senator came to the floor and said that 29 \npercent of the bridges are in a state of disrepair. We know that. That \nis why we are working in this bill to try to keep up with this never-\nending system.\n  Also in this bill, rather than just building roads and pouring more \nasphalt--and this is something we focus too much attention on, but \ncertainly everyone in the country is concerned about the environment \nand the air we breathe--we have a program dealing with congestion \nmitigation and air quality. This is basically the brainchild of Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Chafee. Those are programs in this bill that we \nhave found work well.\n  The directors of the transportation departments in every State like \nthe program we have. We are not, as I said before, sending a new set of \nblueprints to all the Governors saying: Try to figure this out. They \nalready figured this out, and we are trying the best we can to fund \nthese programs.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, let me make an \nobservation. We talked about this bill for several hours. Almost \neveryone who came down was objecting to what their State would get from \nthis formula. When you compare this, starting with the same basic \nstructure of a formula as we did in TEA-21--and remember, in TEA-21, we \nhad the minimum guarantee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 90.5 percent.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What that did was take arbitrary political percentages \nand apply them in order to get votes. We have done far more. This takes \ninto consideration the streamlining provisions about which we haven't \neven talked. We spent months on this in the committee, as our committee \nmembers know.\n  Safety and freight areas have not really been addressed before. This \nis something of which we can be proud. I have to say, when we put \ntogether the charts of all 50 States, there isn't one State that is not \ntreated fairly, doesn't have an increase and doesn't have some kind of \nlogic balancing the donee-donor, balancing the fast-growing States and \nthe low-population States.\n  All these points are considered, and I think it is a very good bill. \nI agree with all on the committee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, I don't carry \nwith me a card that includes what happens to the States that are all \nRepublican, but I am carrying with me during consideration of this bill \na card that lists every State that has a Democratic Senator \nrepresenting it and what they get. It is right here. It is hard to find \nanything that is wrong with it.\n  I recognize there are some States that for many years have been \ngetting--I want to say this in a way that I will still be a gentleman--\nfar more than what they are entitled to under the formula. When you go \nto the gas pump and you fill your tank, so much money goes into \nthe fund. There are some States getting far more than they are putting \nin. There are a few States still getting more than they are putting in. \nWe are balancing this out. As the Senator from Oklahoma said, when we \ndid this in the past--this is my fourth highway bill--we put the \nnumbers together, found out where the votes were, and jammed it \nthrough. We have not done that this time.\n\n  This is a fair bill. You could take this to a high school civics \nclass and explain what we have done and they would say this is fair. We \nhave been as fair as possible. There are some people, who were driving \naround in a Lincoln they couldn't afford, who are upset because maybe \nthey are going to have to drop back to a Lexus or something such as \nthat.\n  The point is, we have tried to be fair. You can't have the program \ngoing on the way it was in the past and still recognize basic fairness. \nI repeat, what happened in decades past was we would find out where the \nvotes were and just jam the bill through: If Missouri was getting 77 \npercent, there are only two Senators from Missouri, we don't need their \nvotes. We haven't done that this time.\n  I think the American public will see this legislation is fair and \nreasonable. I am dumbfounded by some of the people who have come to \nthis floor and complained about what they have gotten in the bill \nbecause they have really done extremely well.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday we started through this bill. It \nis a rather lengthy bill. It covers a lot of provisions that haven't \neven been discussed, and I think a lot of Members are not really aware \nof some parts of this bill.\n  As the chairman of the committee, I thought it an obligation to go \nthrough this section by section, and I did go through sections 1104 \nthrough 1204, where we talked about how this was put together, how the \nformulas were put together. I also spent about an hour talking about \nthe environmental improvements that are made in this bill.\n  I confess there are many things in this bill that I would rather have \ndone in a different way, and I am sure Senator Reid and Senator \nJeffords would say the same thing. In fact, they have said the same \nthing. Since we will have to get through this today at some point, I \nwould like to go ahead and start with section 1205 and finish what we \nstarted yesterday. I hope any Members who are interested in making \ncomments or offering amendments will come and do so, because I will be \ndoing this in order to get through the bill.\n  Section 1205 is one in which I was particularly interested. Senator \nReid yesterday talked about Daniel Patrick Moynihan and the \ncontributions he made over the years. I felt compelled to stand up and \nremind him that Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a Tulsa boy. He was from \nTulsa, OK, and was one of my very favorite people.\n  I think it is very appropriate that section 1205 is the designation \nof the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway as a part of the \nbill. Interstate Highway 86 in the State of New York is specifically \ndesignated as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway in memory \nof our late colleague.\n  There are several others who have said good things about him. In \nfact, in the years I have been in the Senate, Senator Moynihan is the \nonly Senator\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nabout whom I have never heard one negative thing.\n  Section 1301 is the Federal share section. It continues the statutory \nprovisions that lay out what the Federal share for the highway project \nwill be for different States based on the amount of Federal land within \ntheir State. The Federal share provisions of current law use a sliding \nscale. This scale permits States with large portions of Federal land to \nmatch Federal funds with fewer State dollars. That is only reasonable \nbecause they are not collecting taxes off of these lands and they \nshould not have to pay the same match.\n  Due to the decreased taxing ability of the States with a higher \npercentage of Federal lands, these States are given access to a higher \nFederal contribution for highway projects within their State. The bill \nbefore us today modifies this provision slightly to simplify the \ncalculation used to determine the Federal share rates that apply to \neach individual State.\n  I might add that in this bill there are certain things my colleagues \nwill see consistently throughout. One is simplification. One is to put \nit in language that we can all understand, that the public can \nunderstand, that our people back home can understand, and so that the \ndepartments of transportation in the various States will have a clear \nunderstanding as well, and they will take all of these complicated \ninterpretations.\n  Another thing my colleagues will find all the way through is a \nstreamlining effort to try to get more roads for the dollar. I think we \nhave successfully done that, reaching a lot of compromises. So this is \nwhat my colleagues will see as we go through the bill section by \nsection.\n  Section 1302 is the transfer of highway and transit funds. There is a \ntechnical fix that was requested by the Federal Highway Administration \nthat clarifies that title 23 funds, that is the highway dollars, can be \ntransferred to the transit administration from State to State or from \nState to another Federal agency as long as the project to be funded is \neligible under title 23. I think that is a very reasonable approach.\n\n  An example of when this authority could be used is a State that has a \ncongestion problem at or near a border crossing. They may determine \nthat the problem is caused in part by inadequate parking facilities for \nthe Customs Service to conduct truck inspections. To solve their larger \ncongestion problem, it makes sense to provide money to the Customs \nService to build parking lot facilities for truck inspections. This has \nbeen done administratively in the past, but section 1302 provides very \nclear guidance so they do not have to sit around and guess what in fact \nis going to come up.\n  Section 1303, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Act, which is referred to as TIFIA, was established for the \nfirst time in TEA-21 to provide Federal credit assistance to major \ntransportation investments. The TIFIA program has proven to be an \ninnovative and successful addition to the conventional grant and \nreimbursement highway program.\n  After watching the TIFIA program succeed as a funding device for a \nfew large projects during TEA-21 and after receiving input from \nstakeholders and recommendations from the administration, the committee \nbill has made a few changes to the TIFIA program to expand its scope \nand increase its usability.\n  The amount of the Federal credit assistance cannot exceed 33 percent \nof a total project cost. TIFIA offers three different types of \nfinancial assistance to the large projects: One, direct loans; two, \nloan guarantees; and, three, standby lines of credit. The bill also \nlowers the threshold cost for eligible projects from the TEA-21 level \nof $100 million down to $50 million to make it available to more people \nand more projects, making TIFIA accessible to a greater number of large \nhighway projects.\n  Projects are also eligible for TIFIA assistance when costs are \nanticipated to equal or exceed 20 percent of Federal highway funds \napportioned to that particular State. With the increased emphasis this \nbill places on freight mobility, the definition of eligible freight-\nrelated projects is expanded.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask my colleague to yield about a matter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. We have a number of technical amendments. There is a \nquestion about whether we want to move to that. We are preparing a \ntechnical amendment. I have discussed this with both sides. Basically, \nthis is a technical amendment that accomplishes a number of things. In \nessence, it achieves the original goal of an amendment offered by \nSenator Warner, which was to increase the metropolitan planning share \nor takedown from 1 percent to 1.5 percent. We are getting a technical \namendment copied, and as soon as we get the copies, if there is no \nobjection from the managers, I thought we would do that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think the Senator was out of the Chamber when I said I \neventually wanted to get through this section by section, but I can do \nthis at any time. As soon as the Senator has anything ready, certainly \nI am interested in taking that up.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, might we inquire of the managers on the \nDemocratic side if they are ready to take this up?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would withhold offering that for just a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to withhold on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, I think he had stated he was not \nprepared to do that right now, but perhaps one will be coming along in \na short while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I think probably the best thing to do is to have the \nSenator lay down the amendment. It is my understanding from the \nmajority and minority that there are a couple of Senators with whom we \nhave to clear it, and we should be able to do that shortly.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection to that. I think it is a good idea, \nand we will so inform Senator Bond.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2265\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce there is an \namendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2265.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.''\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senators \nInhofe, Jeffords, and Reid. This is one small step for mankind toward a \nhighway bill.\n  There had been some concern about offering amendments. This is a \ntechnical amendment. This changes a number of items that, when crafting \nthe bill, were erroneous. Normally we would adopt these technical \namendments without objection. But there may be some discussion on it. I \nwish to explain the one perhaps significant change in this technical \namendment so everybody knows what we are doing.\n  In the previous bill, TEA-21, the metropolitan planning organizations \nreceived 1 percent from the Surface Transportation Program to do the \nwork that these agencies are required to do in approving transportation \nplans, conforming them to air quality plans. This 1 percent takedown, \nas it is called, amounted to about $1.7 billion over the life of the \nbill.\n  In drafting the underlying bill, we increased spending on planning \nfor metropolitan planning organizations by $800 million, almost a 50 \npercent increase.\n  When Senator Warner proposed making the takedown of the share for the \nmetropolitan planning organizations 1.5 percent rather than 1 percent,\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nit was on the assumption that the total of the previous amount plus \nwhat we did in committee would amount to 1.5 percent. But as it was \ndrafted and printed in the committee report, it wound up adding what we \nhad previously put in the equity bonus on top of the 1.5 percent.\n  I believe this amendment restores the MPO portion to that originally \nproposed and adopted, i.e., a 1.5 percent share, which is what we have \nall agreed is needed for metropolitan planning organizations.\n\n  We have a letter that I will submit, signed by the executive director \nof the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, the president and chief executive officer of the American \nHighway Users Alliance, the chief executive officer of Associated \nGeneral Contractors of America, the executive director of American Road \nand Transportation Builders Association, and the executive director of \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures.\n  The letter says, in substance--and I will submit the full letter--\nthat we write on behalf of the organizations to express concerns over \nthe size of the total, the 1.5 percent-plus, the additional equity \nbonus. Their point is that the large increase results from a \ncombination of adjustments, growth in the overall highway program, an \nincrease in the percentage set-aside, and broadening of the program \nbase subject to the metropolitan planning set-aside.\n  They believed that adding an additional $2.2 billion for planning \nwould make that much less available for improving, constructing, \nmaintaining, and operating a safe and efficient highway system.\n  They come out strongly in support--as we all are--of increasing the \nmetropolitan planning funds. The number of MPOs has increased 340 to \n378, and many more are looking at the prospect of being designated as \nnonattainment for the new ozone and fine particulate standards. They \nrecommend an increase more comparable to the growth in MPOs, but they \ndo not think tripling it is wise. So they have asked us to reconsider.\n  The purpose of this technical amendment, among other things, is to \nbring it back to the 1.5 percent increase, upon which we have \npreviously agreed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 28, 2004.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We are writing on behalf of the national \n     organizations listed below to share our concerns about the \n     size of the increase in metropolitan transportation planning \n     funds agreed to by the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee--from $1.121 billion over six years in TEA 21 to at \n     least $3.3 billion and possibly as much as $3.9 billion if \n     the set aside of planning funds is applied to the new equity \n     bonus program.\n       This large increase is a result of a combination of \n     adjustments--(1) growth in the overall highway program; (2) \n     an increase in the percentage set aside for metropolitan \n     planning from 1 percent to 1.5 percent; and (3) a broadening \n     of the program base subject to the metropolitan planning set \n     aside. The combination of the adjustment produces an increase \n     of at least $2.2 billion additional for metropolitan planning \n     and that much less available for improving, constructing, \n     maintaining and operating a safe and efficient highway \n     system.\n       Some increase in metropolitan planning funds is justified. \n     The number of MPOs increased from 340 to 378--an 11 percent \n     increase, and more metropolitan areas will be designated as \n     non-attainment for the new ozone and fine particulate matter \n     standards. An increase more comparable to the growth in MPOs \n     is understandable, but tripling the set aside for \n     metropolitan planning funds is excessive when our highway \n     needs are so great.\n       We, therefore, urge you to reconsider the manner in which \n     the MPO set aside is calculated.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     John Horsley,\n       Executive Director, American Association of State Highway \n     and Transportation Officials.\n     Diane Steed,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer, The American Highway \n     Users Alliance.\n     Stephen Sandherr,\n       Chief Executive Officer, Associated General Contractors of \n     America.\n     Peter Ruane,\n       Executive Director, American Road and Transportation \n     Builders Association.\n     William T. Pound,\n       Executive Director, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I see the majority leader is in the Chamber. \nWe will not act on this amendment at this time. If somebody wishes to \nobject to it after the majority leader speaks, we would ask that they \ncome to the floor and make an objection. Otherwise, I propose that at 3 \no'clock we ask that the amendment be adopted or, if we need a recorded \nvote, we will be happy to do that. One way or another, I hope we can \nhave action on this by 3 o'clock.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senate majority leader.\n\n\n                   Reopening Senate Office Buildings\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for several minutes I want to give our \ncolleagues an update and make several announcements which will have a \ndirect impact on their schedules for the next several days. I begin by \nthanking my colleagues for their patience as we work through these \nuncertain times. I assure them, we are progressing as rapidly as we \ncan, as rapidly as is humanly possible. We are on course to be back in \ncomplete functioning operation here. That plan I will lay out shortly.\n  I do want to make a couple of quick points though. First, everybody \nis doing well. There are a number of people who have been in very close \ncontact to the poisonous substance which was identified in my office. \nThey are all doing well. The emergency responders are all doing well. \nThat is my primary focus; that is, the safety and well-being of our \nextended Senate family here. We are continuing to monitor the health of \nall people who were potentially exposed and we have identified and \nspoken with each of those. They have had the appropriate counseling. \nEverybody is doing well.\n  As the world knows by now, the impact of inhaled ricin, to the best \nof our knowledge, is over a very short period of time and we are well \nbeyond that window, now 48 hours after the time of exposure. I do \ncommend and applaud my staff because they were astute in noting the \npowder and responded appropriately and quickly, and that could have, \nand in fact I am sure did, avert a serious and potentially life-\nthreatening matter for others.\n  The incident, as I mentioned, is 48 hours old. We were able to move \naggressively and rapidly to isolate that affected area in my mailroom. \nThe monitoring of health effects has gone very smoothly. I appreciate \nthe Capitol Physician's Office, as I mentioned this morning and last \nnight, being with all people exposed and have counseled people since \nthat point in time.\n  We were able to implement plans which had been carefully laid out and \ncoordinated among many different groups, agencies here on the Capitol \nGrounds, and that results in protection of Members and protection of \nstaff and the reaction in a very sophisticated way to this discovery.\n  After consultation with appropriate officials and reflecting upon the \nexcellent coordination with the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Hill \npolice, I have made a decision this morning, in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader and others, that we can accelerate our efforts to \nopen our Senate office buildings. It is still not going to be as \nquickly as most people would like, but we can accelerate the initial \nproposal and plans. This proposal is consistent with safely removing \nmail and continuing to review data, which literally comes back every 30 \nminutes to an hour, as teams move through the complex, the very large \ncomplex of the Senate office buildings, but also a response on the \nHouse side and in the Capitol itself.\n  Thus, barring any unforeseen discoveries--and I put that provision in \nthere because you don't know an hour later that something may be \ndiscovered. But barring any unforeseen discoveries, the time schedule \nfor opening the buildings will be the following:\n  The Russell Senate Office Building, tomorrow, Thursday, at noon, \nFebruary 5. We will be able to open that office building at 12 \nnoon. Again, Thursday noon, February 5, Russell Senate\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\noffice building. Friday at 9 a.m., February 6, we will reopen the Hart \nSenate office building. The Dirksen Senate office building, which is \nthe crime scene itself, will open on Monday at 7 a.m., February 9.\n\n  A lot of people thought it would be days and days to reopen. \nInitially we did not know how long. People pointed out with the \nanthrax, the buildings were closed for weeks and weeks. We made a \ndecision to accelerate this schedule based on increased manpower that \nhas been offered by various agencies, our continued understanding about \nthe exposure to ricin, the understanding and information that has \nplaced this in one room at this juncture based on the findings to date, \nand that in all of the monitoring equipment, the HEPA filters \nthroughout the area that have been examined, and we continue to examine \nthem throughout the complex, of all the monitoring and filtering \nequipment employed, the filters have all been demonstrated to be clean \nand therefore there has not been aerosolization of this agent.\n  I do also want to tell Members they can have access to their \noffices--they, themselves--after assessing the risk, and our counseling \nwill be directly to them. If they want to go to their office and remove \nessential papers or documents--not mail; mail should not be touched--\nthey can do that. We do ask that they talk to the Secretary of the \nSenate's office where the control room is--they have that telephone \nnumber--if they plan on going into their office building to access \nimportant information to allow them to carry out the essential \nfunctions of their office.\n  We will continue to work with all the Members to ensure a smooth and \nsafe reopening of the Senate complex consistent with this schedule.\n  Again, Thursday noon, February 5, the Russell Senate office building \nwill open. Friday, 9 a.m., February 6, the Hart Senate office building \nwill reopen. Monday, 7 a.m., February 9, the Dirksen Senate office \nbuilding will reopen.\n  Let me close and simply again thank the Capitol police, Chief Gainer, \nwho has done a tremendous job, the EPA, the United States Marines, the \nFBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Attending Physician's \noffice, the CDC, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, and \nso many others involved in response to this incident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nreport and for the announcement regarding the opening of offices. He \nalso ought to be commended for his work and leadership in expediting \nthe opening of the offices themselves. This has been a difficult matter \nbecause his office has been directly affected, but this is a very good \npiece of news that we should be back and up and running with all \ncylinders by the early part of next week.\n  I share, as well, his expressions of gratitude for all of those who \nhave been involved in this effort to date, having recalled very vividly \nthe nightmares of 2 years ago. It is fair to say we have come a long \nway in our ability to deal effectively with matters such as these. \nWhile this one is different, it is also indicative of the progress we \nhave made in allowing the institution to respond more quickly and \nsuccessfully and, hopefully, that will be in evidence as we continue \nour work.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for his report. I know this will \nbe good news for all Members.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic leader's \ncomments and will turn the floor back to the managers. We will have \ncontinued announcements. One of the real efforts we have tried to \nfulfill and missions we put forward is to stay in touch and communicate \nas best we can. We will continue to do that. There will be a press \nconference by the Capitol police with an update later this afternoon \nand they will sit down and announce more about that to give a technical \nupdate in terms of the progress that has been made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise again as we proceed on the bill to \npresent my concerns about where we are in the process relative to the \nhighway bill and relative to the management of the Federal budget.\n  The bill before the Senate with the proposed amendment which I \nbelieve has been offered, the substitute, creates a significant \nincrease in funding and spending in the area of highways. Many Members \nsupport transportation improvements. I have always supported having a \nstrong transportation program because it is critical to our \ninfrastructure. But in doing that, we have to do it within the context \nof managing the budget correctly. We cannot simply put money into \nprograms because we like them without doing it in the context of what \nthe budget limitations are and what the various income is in the trust \nfund that would pay for these activities.\n  The highway bill has always been a trust fund--not always--a trust \nfund-generated event, where the gas tax and other taxes that are \nhighway related and transportation related are collected and spent for \nthe purposes of building infrastructure. That is the way it should be. \nThat is the way most States do it, too, by the way. I don't think any \nStates use general fund revenues for the purposes of managing their \nhighways, although I am not aware of that. As Governor of New \nHampshire, when I had the honor and privilege to serve in that \nposition, this was a very big issue that we not use the general funds \nfor the purposes of managing our highways.\n  However, what is happening in this bill, unfortunately, is that we \nare, through a series of accounting mechanisms which are, in my \nopinion, illusory in some ways and inappropriate in other ways, \nbasically raiding the general fund for the purposes of funding highway \nconstruction activity and at the same time we are dramatically \nexpanding the spending levels above what the levels are that are part \nof the budget process for the highway fund. That is inappropriate. It \nis inappropriate that we should be going outside the highway fund for \nthe purposes of funding highways and that we should be exceeding the \nbudget levels for the purposes of funding highways. Rather, we should \nhave the fiscal discipline to recognize when you are in a difficult \nfiscal situation, as we are as a country, when you are running \ndeficits, which we are, unfortunately, as a country, you must, in all \naccounts, including those which you are strongly committed to, have \nfiscal discipline. That involves staying within the budget and that \ninvolves being sure that in something where you are using a trust fund, \nyou have the funds in place in that trust fund before you spend it.\n  That is why I am concerned about this bill. It is my opinion if we \nallow this bill to go forward in its present form we will be \nsignificantly aggravating the deficit, we will be dramatically adding \nto the deficit, and we will be creating a precedent of using the \ngeneral fund for the purposes of funding the highway accounts. That is \nbad policy. The underlying policy and having a strong transportation \nprogram can still be accomplished, but we should do it within the \ncontext of staying within the budget and staying within the highway \nbill. I have spoken on this before. This is not one item that stands \nalone on this issue. I suppose if we were running a surplus, or a \ndeficit which was not so large or was not growing, I would probably \ntolerate this type of spending. This is, rather, an additional straw on \nthe camel's back, and specifically our children. Our children have to \npay the debt which we run up in the Government. It is passed on to the \nnext generation. If we are going to be fair to our children and our \nchildren's children so they can have the quality of life we have, then \nwe have to give them a government and a fiscal house that is in order.\n\n  Unfortunately, within the last 2 years we have not necessarily \nfollowed that course of action as a Congress. We have passed a series \nof bills which have dramatically aggravated the situation relative to \nthe budget, deficit spending, and long-term structural deficits--mostly \non the entitlement side, and mostly in the area of programmatic \nactivity that has to be spent, or programmatic activity that is locked \nin place on a flight path of expenditure. It occurs in the Medicare \naccounts and it occurs in the agricultural accounts. There is an \nattempt to do it in the energy accounts. It could potentially\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\noccur in this account, if it passes in its present form.\n  That is why I have such reservations about this bill. I especially \nhave reservations about the substance of it. I am not absolutely sure \nhow it is structured because I haven't had time to look at it yet. But \nit appears to me that in its present form it does take money out of the \ngeneral fund and move it into the highway fund through a variety of \nmechanisms which at best would be called playing fast and loose with \nthe budget rules of this Congress. It is probably, therefore, subject \nto a budget point of order and is, therefore, inappropriate.\n  In addition, if we are going to take up this bill, it is our first \nopportunity to have a bill which could address a variety of other \nissues we have concerns about as a government.\n  There is a bill that was passed out of my committee which I had the \ngood fortune to chair, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, which deals with the rights of public safety officers, \nspecifically firemen and police officers, who work in one of the most \ndangerous jobs in our country. It deals with fair treatment of them in \nthe area of how they protect their rights in employment. It is a bill \nwhich has passed my committee a couple of times. It was being brought \nto the floor last year, and regrettably it didn't come through the \nentire process. But it does create an opportunity for fire and police \npersonnel, and public safety personnel--who are very important, and who \nobviously use our transportation system rather aggressively--to protect \nthe transportation system when there are violations of law relative to \nthe operation on roads, or protecting it when there are hazardous \nevents on the road, or when people are injured and fire rescue \npersonnel respond, or even if there are fires involving transportation \nvehicles. So it is tied into this whole bill--the protection of police \nand fire personnel and their rights to have a reasonable workplace and \na workplace where they feel they are getting what they need.\n  It is something which I have been greatly involved in and committed \nto for many years.\n  Thus, it is my intention at this time to send an amendment to the \ndesk in the nature of a second degree to the amendment which is the \npending substitute.\n  I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2266 to Amendment No. 2265\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2266 to amendment numbered 2265.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n        At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n        This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n        The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n        (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n        (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage \n     conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and \n     encourage employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS AND AGREEMENTS.\n\n        A certification, recognition, election-held, collective \n     bargaining agreement or memorandum of understanding which has \n     been issued, approved, or ratified by any public employee \n     relations board or commission or by any State or \n     political subdivision or its agents (management officials) \n     in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act shall not be invalidated by the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 8. CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n       (1) to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and \n     procedures of any law of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State or jurisdiction that provides collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal \n     to or greater than the rights provided under this Act;\n       (2) to prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law \n     that prohibits employers and labor organizations from \n     negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require \n     union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of \n     employment;\n       (3) to invalidate any State law in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act that substantially provides for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in section 4(b) solely \n     because such State law permits an employee to appear on his \n     or her own behalf with respect to his or her employment \n     relations with the public safety agency involved; or\n       (4) to permit parties subject to the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and the regulations \n     under such Act to negotiate provisions that would prohibit an \n     employee from engaging in part-time employment or volunteer \n     activities during off-duty hours; or\n       (5) to prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under \n     this Act a political subdivision of the State that has a \n     population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 \n     full time employees.\n       For purposes of paragraph (5), the term ``employee'' \n     includes each and every individual employed by the political \n     subdivision except any individual elected by popular vote or \n     appointed to serve on a board or commission.\n       (b) Compliance.--No State shall preempt laws or ordinances \n     of any of its political subdivisions if such laws provide \n     collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that \n     are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from New Hampshire \nwhat his substitute does?\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment deals with the rights of police officers to \nhave the right to collective bargaining and firemen to have the right \nto collective bargaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this obviously is a very important issue the \nSenator has raised. Having this as an amendment to a technical \namendment raises questions that I think perhaps should be answered.\n  First, I point out to my friends who are concerned about it that the \nnumber we have chosen for the highway portion of the bill was a number \nadopted by a 79-21 vote on the floor of this body. In addition, we \nunderstand the need to provide funding for highways. The Finance \nCommittee has worked very hard to come up with the funding measures. I \ndon't serve on the Finance Committee, but they have adopted fuel tax \ncompliance measures. They have reformed the provisions for the ethanol \nexemption. It is a very valuable agricultural fuel that improves the \nenvironment. They will not charge the highway trust fund with that. \nThey will pay down the existing interest owed to the highway trust fund \nand spend down the balance. They will clarify mobile machinery \nexemptions and transportation taxes, and discontinue refunds going from \nthe trust fund into the general revenue fund for fuel tax exemptions. \nThese are generally related to the highway trust fund.\n  Further, I will point out for those of us who said we want the trust \nfund used for highways, the trust fund right now is being used for \nother things that are not highway related, such as automobile, bus, and \ntruck drivers. Some $36 billion will go to mass transit, a very \nvaluable adjunct to the transportation system but not something that\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\npeople who pay highway trust fund taxes are using because they are \nputting the gas and diesel in their own vehicles.\n  There are also valuable environmental benefits in there such as \nCMAQ--congestion mitigation for air quality. There are also rails and \ntrails and other easements in there that are a significant diversion of \nhighway trust fund dollars from the direct highway trust fund purposes.\n  I hope my colleagues who have problems with strict application of \nhighway funds being raised on highway uses deal with that in an \namendment that is directly related to the highway bill transportation \nwhich is before us.\n  Obviously, one of the things one can do in the Senate is to offer \namendments that are more properly the jurisdiction of other committees, \nwhich certainly collective bargaining is, I would say, such an effort. \nBut this bill is so important to the United States, to our economy, and \nthe safety and well-being of the people who use our highways and use \nour bridges in the United States that I hope we can get back to the \nmain purpose of this measure, which is to continue the highway program, \nwhich builds better roads, better bridges, and provides jobs--47,000 \njobs for each $1 billion of highway contracts--and provides the future \nfor economic growth in our States.\n  As I have said on many occasions on this floor, I can tell you jobs \nare going to be located in the States where they have good \ntransportation systems, and good highways are essential for that.\n  Finally, in my State it is a matter of saving lives. So I hope we can \nget back to dealing with the important measures in this bill. I hope we \ncan deal with the specific needs, make the technical amendments that \nare normally permitted on such a bill, and debate the major provisions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been trying to get through the \nexplanation of this bill section by section. We have done so now all \nthe way up to section 1304. It seems most people were concerned \nyesterday about the formula. Now we are addressing another problem. But \nwe have not gotten into the full explanation of the bill. We have gone \nfrom section 1104 through section 1303.\n  I am going to go ahead and proceed. If anyone either has an amendment \nor wants to be heard on the bill, of course, I will give them that \nopportunity.\n  Section 1304 is in regard to the facilitation of international \nregistration plans and international fuel tax agreements.\n  In response to issues surrounding commerce from Mexico, S. 1072 gives \nthe Secretary of Transportation discretion to provide financial \nassistance to States participating in the International Registration \nPlan and the International Fuel Tax Agreement. These States incur \ncertain administrative costs resulting from their service as a home \njurisdiction for motor carriers from Mexico.\n  The International Fuel Tax Agreement and the International Regional \nPlan are agreements among various U.S. States and Canadian Provinces \nthat facilitate the efficient collection and distribution of fuel taxes \nand apportioned registration fees among each member jurisdiction.\n  Under both programs, each motor carrier designates its home State or \nProvince as the jurisdiction responsible for collecting fuel use taxes \nand fees. Since the implementation of NAFTA, the Mexican Government \nimposes and collects fuel taxes and registration fees differently from \nthe United States and Canada. The National Governors Association is \ncurrently evaluating Mexico and its participation in the IFTA and IRP \nprograms. In the interim, Mexican motor carriers may use individual \nU.S. States or Canadian Provinces as their home jurisdiction. So we are \ntalking about something that is in the interim until the problem is \nresolved but is necessary.\n  Section 1305 is in regard to the National Commission on Future \nRevenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund and finance the needs \nof the surface transportation system.\n  As many of you know, I am personally not one to support expansions of \nbureaucracy or the creation of innumerable review boards, committees, \nand commissions. However, this bill creates, and I have found good \nreason to support, a new temporary--temporary--national commission on \nfuture revenue sources to support the highway trust fund and finance \nthe needs of the surface transportation system.\n  Funding the highway program has already become increasingly more \nchallenging. Even as we debate the funding of this bill, we are \nconfronted with the task of finding innovative and efficient funding \nmethods to capture user fees lost to the fuel tax evasion and a host of \nother issues that the Finance Committee has done a great job in \naddressing.\n  However, one issue that has not been addressed, but must be before \nthe next reauthorization cycle, is Federal incentives for the purchase \nof hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles. Fuel efficiency is a goal \nI support, but I do not believe it should come at the expense of the \nhighway trust fund. So we have these exemptions, which has the result \nof reducing the revenues that would otherwise come in, even though the \ngoal or the policy we are trying to establish is, perhaps, an \ninevitable policy.\n\n  We run the risk of making economic and environmental advances at the \ncost of jeopardizing our primary funding source for the highway trust \nfund--gas taxes. In recent years, the highway trust fund has seen a \ndecrease in revenues. Constant changes in the automotive industry and \nthe economy as a whole impact user fee revenues. We must continue to \nidentify new and reliable revenue sources to sustain the program.\n  Most recently, we have seen the increase in the cost of fuel and the \nspiking that has been going on. That has a direct effect on the amount \nof revenues that are generated from fuel taxes.\n  In response to these changing and growing challenges, the new \ncommission created in this bill is established to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of the alternatives available to replace or \nsupplement the existing fuel tax as the principal source of supporting \nthe highway trust fund. We may find that this is going to still remain \nthe principal source, but we do not know because we have never had any \ncentral place where we were trying to put together something this \ncreative to replace it.\n  Specific factors which the commission will examine include, one, the \neffects of each major tax that goes into the highway trust fund; two, \nthe ability to increase taxes if there are future revenue shortfalls; \nand, three, potential new sources of revenue to support highway, \ntransit, and other surface transportation programs.\n  In regard to the scope of the study, the commission is charged with \nsuggesting new or alternative revenue sources to fund the needs of the \nsurface transportation system over the next 30 years or the next 40 \nyears--the next long period of time. It is something we should have \ndone before. This bill might have been easier if we had addressed this \nin TEA-21.\n  Now we have, in section 1306, the State infrastructure banks. TEA-21 \nestablished a State infrastructure bank pilot program that authorized \nparticipation among the States of Missouri, Rhode Island, California, \nand Florida. This bill reauthorizes the program to allow all States to \nenter into cooperative agreements with the Secretary of Transportation \nto set up infrastructure-revolving funds eligible for capitalization \nwith Federal transportation dollars.\n  The SIB program gives States the capacity to increase the efficiency \nof their transportation investment and to significantly leverage \nFederal resources by attracting non-Federal public and private \ninvestment.\n  The program provides greater flexibility to the States by allowing \nother types of project assistance in addition to the traditional \nreimbursement grant. States utilizing SIBs are able to provide various \nforms of nongrant assistance to eligible projects, including at or \nbelow market rate subordinate\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nloans, interest rate buydowns on third party loans, and guarantees and \nother forms of credit enhancements. Any debt that the SIB issues or \nguarantees must be of investment grade caliber. The SIB program \nrepresents one more innovative financing option. We believe, after \nhaving done this with three or four States, that it is something that \nshould be expanded to other States. This is a very positive thing.\n  Section 1401 is the Highway Safety Improvement Program.\n  Along with the new equity bonus program, the bill's new core Safety \nprogram is one of the crowning pillars of this legislation. It is both \ndevastating and deplorable that motor vehicle crashes are the leading \ncause of death among American's between the age of 1 and 34-years-old. \nIn 2002 alone, nearly 43,000 people died on our Nation's highways. \nAlthough the fatality rate has decreased when compared to the growing \nnumber of vehicle miles traveled, the total number of fatal crashes has \ngradually increased over the life of TEA-21. Through a reorganization \nof existing safety programs and a significantly increased Federal \ninvestment, S. 1072, appropriately referred to as SAFETEA, strives to \ncombat one of the greatest threats faced on our roads today. Not only \nis the loss of life to unsafe roads and conditions tragic, but vehicle \ncrashes have a huge economic effect manifested in medical costs, \nproperty damage, insurance, and the effects of congestion.\n  In response to the need for safer roads and road conditions, this \nbill gives heightened attention to improving traffic safety by creating \na new core Highway Safety Improvement Program. Under TEA-21 States were \nrequired to set-aside 10 percent of their funds apportioned under the \nSurface Transportation Program for safety projects to eliminate \nhazardous locations and improve safety at highway-railway crossings. \nThe new Highway Safety Improvement Program preserves the ability of \nStates to continue funding these important projects, while giving the \nStates even greater flexibility to identify and address other traffic \nsafety issues such as work zone safety, traffic enforcement activities, \nlane and shoulder widening, use of safety warning devices, safety-\nconscious planning, and improved traffic data collection.\n  This is just one more effort to recognize that the States are all \ndifferent. The same shoe does not fit all. We are giving them an \nexpanded role to determine the best way to handle the problems in \nVermont as opposed to Oklahoma or any other State.\n  Recognizing the various and changing safety needs in each State, the \nbill provides significant flexibility to the States in order to \ndetermine how the Federal safety dollars can best be spent to address \nthe areas of greatest need. These are not always the same in each \nState.\n  Section 1402 is Operation Lifesaver. Among the existing safety \nprograms that this bill reauthorizes is Operation Lifesaver. This \nprogram has proven effective as a national education and awareness \ncampaign dedicated to reducing fatalities and injuries at highway-\nrailway crossings. Operation Lifesaver has utilized various means to \neducate both drivers and pedestrians about making safe decisions at \nrailroad crossings and has encouraged better engineering to improve \nsafety at rail crossings. Due to the valuable service this program \nrenders and the cost-benefit effectiveness it has sustained, this bill \nincreases funding for the program from $500,000 per year to $600,000 \nper year and moves the source of funding for Operation Lifesaver from \nthe Surface Transportation Program, STP, to the new Highway Safety \nImprovement Program.\n   Section 1403 is license suspension. Another area of concern in \nregards to highway safety is the intoxicated driver and especial repeat \noffenders. Current law imposes penalties on States that have not \nenacted statutes punishing repeat intoxicated drivers with a hard one-\nyear driver's license suspension. However, as the States have reviewed \ndata and adapted their sentencing structures for repeat offenders in \nthis area, they have found that habitual drunk drivers whose license \nhas already been suspended frequently choose to drive without a \nlicense, minimizing the effectiveness of the current State of the law. \nIn the interest of public safety, some States have actually accepted \nthe consequences of the Federal sanction and foregoing available \nFederal funding in order to impose more effective sentencing of these \nrepeat offenders. This bill recognizes the reality of repeat drunk \ndrivers driving on roads with a suspended license and the wisdom of \nmore effective alternative sentencing schemes. Thus, the bill updates \nthe ``repeat offender'' sanction in title 23 of the code to allow \nStates to incorporate ignition interlock or similar devices when \nsentencing repeat intoxicated drivers.\n  At this point we have come through all the way to section 1404. I \nwould like to see if the minority leader of the committee, who has been \nso great to work with, the ranking minority member, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, has any comments to make about these sections.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman. As has been pointed out already \nby one of our members, the bill we are talking about is rather \nextensive. But it was not done quickly or without the tremendous work \nof staff and many people who have contributed outside of the staff in \nlistening to people from all over the country before we put the final \ntouch on the bill.\n  The highway bill provides us with an opportunity every 6 years to \ngive our communities, our businesses and our citizens a real boost by \nrenewing our commitment to the world's most extensive transportation \nsystem. I am proud to be a leader in that effort this year.\n  Through the bill before us today, we will improve the condition and \nthe performance of our roads and bridges, thousands and millions of \nthem. That means both safer travel today and lower maintenance costs \ntomorrow.\n  I am particularly pleased that our work continues the transportation \npartnership established under President Eisenhower during the \nInterstate period and expanded with passage of ISTEA 12 years ago. That \nmeans that local leaders, stakeholders and citizens will continue to \nwork with State and Federal officials to set spending priorities and \ndefine project scope.\n  I am also proud that we have maintained the linkage between \ntransportation and the environment in our bill. Investments in \ntransportation must build strong, healthy communities. Through advanced \nplanning and early coordination we can ensure better results.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with those of us responsible for this \nbill so that we may complete our work in a timely way. America's \ncommunities are relying on us. The States are relying upon us. All \npeople using the transportation system are depending upon us. I am sure \nwe will produce this document in a way that will make us all very \nproud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, I agree with the ranking member of the committee. \nWe have come a long way. We are ready shortly and will be prepared to \ndeal with some amendments. In the meantime, let's wade through this \nthing a little bit more.\n  Section 1404. Bus axle weight exemption. SAFETEA holds over-the-road \nbuses and intrastate public transit buses to the same standards that \ninner-city transit buses must meet with regard to axle weight, air \nquality, and requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nSpecifically, the bill exempts any over-the-road buses or intrastate \npublic transit bus from the maximum gross weight limitations imposed by \nthe State.\n  Section 1405 is the Safe Routes to School Act. This was a provision \nthat handled a number of compromises. It is one we are all concerned \nabout. It has a continuing emphasis on safety. The bill introduces a \nnew program that directly deals with safe routes to school, a safety \nimprovement program established in SAFETEA. Projects eligible under the \nSafe Routes to School Program are already eligible under the larger \nHighway Safety Improvement Program.\n  However, Safe Routes to School provides a dedicated and protected \nfunding source for pedestrian and bicycle safety projects near schools. \nThe program is limited to projects and activities that will impose \nsafety within 2 miles of primary and secondary schools. It sets aside \n$70 million per year for infrastructure and behavioral activities, such \nas sidewalk improvements, traffic-calming measures, speed reduction,\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\nbicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, traffic signal improvements, \npublic awareness campaigns, and traffic education and enforcement.\n  I think that is significant. We have noticed, between the time we \nhave been dealing with ISTEA and TEA-21, there have been increased \nfatalities in our young kids. We expanded this program during the \ncourse of our committee consideration. I think it was a good compromise \nto make on the purchase of equipment.\n  When conducting projects under the Federal program's authorization \nunder this bill, some States will occasionally find the equipment \nnecessary to complete the project may be cheaper to purchase than it \nwould be to rent for the duration of the project. In such cases, this \nbill instructs them to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for the purchase \nof expensive equipment above specified levels in order to evaluate the \nsavings associated with purchasing the equipment compared to renting \nthe equipment for the duration of the project.\n  Everything we are doing here is trying to get the very most out of \nthe dollars we are spending in terms of safety and equipment and road \nconstruction and the other things we are dealing with in S. 1072.\n  Section 1407 is work zone safety. Over a thousand deaths occurred in \nwork zones during 2002 due to traffic crashes alone. There has been a \nlot of awareness in the public about this fact and States are trying to \ndeal with it. We felt it appropriate to have some language in this \nbill. Although work zones represent a critical component of \ninfrastructure development, they also pose a unique safety challenge \nfor those on the road, and to road workers in particular.\n  S. 1072 attempts to minimize the injuries and fatalities in work \nzones by imposing insurance requirements, requiring the use of ITS \ntechnologies and safety budgeting in construction and contracting. The \nSecretary of Transportation is directed to encourage States to choose \ncontractors that carry general liability insurance of at least $15 \nmillion. Transportation projects costing more than $15 million are \nencouraged to include continuously monitored work zone intelligent \ntransportation systems, or ITS systems.\n  Section 1408. Worker injury prevention and free flow of vehicular \ntraffic. In addition to the provision relating to the safety of workers \nin work zones just mentioned, SAFETEA also directs the Secretary to \npromulgate regulations requiring road workers to wear high-visibility \nclothing, with the goal of decreasing worker injury and maintaining a \nfree flow of traffic.\n  In section 1501, regarding the integration of natural resource \nconcerns into State and metropolitan transportation planning, my \ncounterpart, the ranking minority member, was very interested in a lot \nof the parts of the bill that deal with natural resource concerns and \nState and metropolitan transportation planning. If the Senator from \nVermont would like to go over some of these sections, starting with \nsection 1501, it might be appropriate since he had a lot to do with \nthese particular areas.\n  (Mr. SUNUNU assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am most pleased to assist in this \nregard.\n  The environmental provisions contained in this bill reflect a \nbipartisan compromise reached among the members of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. Although there are a number of additional \nchanges I would like to have made in these provisions, I believe the \nbill deals fairly in regard to these sections, given the variety of \nstrong opinions on environmental subjects.\n  Several stakeholders have argued any early identification of \npotential environmental concerns may help reduce or avoid delays during \nthe environmental review. Therefore, this bill specifies factors that \nmay be considered during the transportation planning process.\n  Current law already requires transportation planners to consider \nprojects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment \nand improve quality of life.\n  The items added by this bill simply provide more direction as to what \nthese concepts mean. These items do not constitute a checklist of \nitems, whereby every item listed must be considered by each State and \nmetropolitan planning organization, or MPO.\n  Section 1502. As another means of providing for early consideration \nof environmental concerns, this bill requires transportation planners \nto consult with appropriate resource agencies.\n  Interagency consultation should facilitate comparison of \ntransportation plans to conservation plans or maps and inventories of \nnatural or historic resources, where those plans or maps and \ninventories already exist and are in use.\n  The long-range transportation plan will also include a discussion of \npotential mitigation activities and sites that may help compensation \nfor issues due to the transportation plan. This requirement is intended \nto get States to think strategically about mitigation. It is not to add \nnew mitigation requirements or to require a level of detail better \nhandled at the individual project review stage.\n  Section 1503. Integration of natural resource concerns into \ntransportation project planning. Additionally, the highway bill \ncontains provisions to incorporate the principles of context-sensitive \ndesign into current design standards. These principles involve \nconsideration of the environmental context of a project and \nencouragement of design that minimizes impact on the project's \nsurroundings. These provisions aim to integrate natural resource \nconcerns into the transportation project planning process.\n  Section 1504. Public investment in transportation planning and \nprojects. Current law provides an opportunity for the public to be \ninvolved to some degree in the development of transportation plans. \nThis bill includes specific ideas for making public involvement \nopportunities more meaningful, such as making publicly available \ndocuments available on the Internet.\n  Section 1506. Federal and State laws often require habitat, stream, \nor wetland mitigation to compensate for direct adverse environmental \nimpact caused by transportation projects. To provide additional \nflexibility and certainty in meeting these requirements, this bill \nauthorizes the establishment of State mitigation funds, using moneys \nreceived from the Surface Transportation Program and National Highway \nSystem programs.\n  The State mitigation fund operates as a planning and project \nmanagement tool available to the States. States can even use the \nmitigation funds to undertake larger mitigation efforts based on the \ntotal impact of a multitude of projects combined rather than project-\nby-project mitigation. This enables the States to more effectively plan \nfor and provide the mitigation that is or likely will be required for \ntransportation projects under other environmental laws.\n  The next section, 1511, transportation project development process. \nTEA-21 directed the Department of Transportation, DOT to ``develop and \nimplement a coordinated environmental review process for highway \nconstruction and mass transit projects.'' Unfortunately, this was never \nachieved. It took almost 2 years for DOT to even propose rules, and \nthose proposed rules were roundly criticized by many interested \nstakeholders and many in this Chamber.\n  That proposal has since been withdrawn. So it was necessary for us, \nobviously, to take the next step legislatively.\n  This bill sets up a process for complying with current environmental \nlaws. In establishing a process for compliance, the bill does not \nventure to amend any current environmental laws. It does not venture to \namend any current environmental laws.\n  Under this process, DOT is the lead agency with authority to set work \nplans and schedules, determine the purpose and need for a project, and \ndetermine which alternatives must be considered. This process also \nincludes more public participation than currently required and \ncontinues to authorize DOT to provide funds to resource agencies to \nassist them in expediting project environmental reviews.\n  Section 1512. Assumption of responsibility for categorical \nexclusions. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, some \ntypes of projects can be categorically excluded from lengthy analysis. \nQualifying projects are those projects that ``do not individually or \ncumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment.''\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\n  Approximately 90 percent of all surface transportation projects are \nprocessed as categorical exclusions, or CEs, under NEPA. Since this is \nsuch an overwhelming percentage of the projects, even a small \nimprovement in processing time for each CE can result in a large \nimprovement systemwide.\n  The bill before us today attempts to make that improvement by \nallowing States to assume the Secretary's responsibility for completing \nthe environmental review process for projects classified as CE under \ncurrent regulations.\n  This assumption of responsibility will be limited to those States \nthat have adequate capabilities and would remain subject to Federal \noversight to maintain proper accountability.\n  Section 1513. Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program. \nOften a State will do much of the work involved with the preparing and \nenvironmental review of a surface transportation project. Then the \nFederal Department of Transportation must review and approve the \nState's work, the applicable documentation. Some stakeholders have \nargued that allowing States to complete the NEPA review, regardless of \nwhether the project requires a categorical exclusion, environmental \nassessment, or even an environmental impact statement, could result in \nsignificant time savings and speed up project delivery.\n  The highway bill sets out to explore this idea by establishing a \npilot program that allows up to five States to assume the Secretary's \nresponsibility for the environmental review of a transportation \nproject.\n\n  Under this pilot program, States will have to meet several criteria \nbefore and after selection to participate. These requirements include \nsoliciting public comment prior to applying for participation, \nverifying adequate capabilities to carry out the responsibilities to be \nassumed, entering into a written agreement with the Secretary, \nsubmitting to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, submitting to \nperiodic compliance audits, and complying with the same procedural and \nsubsequent requirements under Federal environmental law as would apply \nif the Secretary were conducting reviews.\n  Section 1514. In keeping with the new environmental changes, the bill \ndirects the Department of Transportation to promulgate new regulations \nwithin 1 year to implement the planning and project delivery sections \nof the bill.\n  Section 1521. Critical real property acquisition. The committee bill \nenables States to use Federal funds to expeditiously acquire a limited \nnumber of parcels of land that may be needed for future transportation \ndevelopment but are threatened by imminent economic development.\n  The early acquisition of property keeps future transportation options \nopen and provides States with an important opportunity to reserve \nfuture alignment alternatives while allowing timely and cost-saving \nacquisitions.\n  In limited circumstances and with the Secretary's approval, States \ncan use the Federal funds to cover the cost incurred in acquiring \nparcels of land that are considered to be critical for any \ntransportation project under title 23. Federal land may be used to \nacquire property prior to the completion of the environmental reviews \nfor proper acquisition. Environmental reviews and approvals are still \nrequired before physical construction, demolition, or clearing is \ncommenced. If a parcel is later sold or leased, States cannot retain \nthe Federal share of the proceeds.\n  Section 1522. Planning capacity building initiative. Focusing on the \nimportance of comprehensive and integrated planning, S. 1072 \nestablishes a planning capacity building initiative to strengthen \nmetropolitan and statewide transportation planning and to enhance \ntribal capacity to conduct joint transportation planning.\n  The bill gives priority to planning practices that support the \ntransportation elements of homeland security planning, performance-\nbased planning, safety planning, operations planning, freight planning, \nand the integration of environment and planning. The planning capacity \nbuilding initiative will be administered by the DOT's Federal Highway \nAdministration in cooperation with the Federal Transit Administration.\n  Section 1601. Environmental restoration and pollution abatement \ncontrol of invasive plant species and establishment of native species. \nStorm water runoff from highways has a direct impact on the Nation's \nwaterways, carrying with it pollutions such as brake linings, oils, \nheavy metals, road salts, nutrients, et cetera. To address these \nwaterborne pollutants, current law already allows States to use STP \nfunds to address water pollution or environmental degradation caused or \ncontributed to by transportation facilities currently undergoing \nreconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, or restoration so long as \nthe environmental project does not exceed 20 percent of the overall \nproject cost.\n  This bill extends eligibility for those types of mitigation projects \nfrom the States' STP funds to include their funds under the NHS program \nas well. It further allows the funds to be used for environmental \nrestoration projects not associated with an active construction \nproject.\n  The stormwater project must address runoff from an existing Federal-\naid highway but not necessarily one undergoing reconstruction, \nrehabilitation, resurfacing, or restoration.\n  Invasive species are a growing problem both economically and \nenvironmentally. These harmful plants plague thousands of areas of \nrangelands and croplands and have been cited as a staggering problem by \nsuch organizations such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association \nand the American Farm Bureau Federation. By making both NHS and STP \nfunds available to mitigate invasive species along roadways, we provide \nStates with the flexibility to minimize the impact of vehicles as \nvectors of these problematic plants.\n  Section 1602 relates to the National Scenic Byways Program. TEA-21 \ncontinues the National Scenic Byways Program authorizing the Secretary \nof Transportation to designate roads that have outstanding scenic, \nhistoric, cultural, natural, recreational, and architectural qualities \nas all-American roads, or national scenic highways.\n  This bill amends the current program to recognize that the Secretary \nalready is promoting the collection of ``national scenic byways'' and \n``all-American roads'' under the designation of ``America's byways.'' \nIf State and Federal representatives reach consensus on establishing a \nsingle designation category, then these amendments will provide the \nSecretary with the authority to use any of the three terms, national \nscenic byways, all-American roads, or America's byways, as the single \ndesignation.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary for the first time to form \npublic/private partnerships to carry out technical assistance, \nmarketing, market research, and promotion with respect to national \nscenic byways.\n  Section 1603 is the Recreational Trails Program. This bill continues \nthe Recreational Trails Program allowing Federal funds to be used to \nprovide and maintain recreational trails for motorized and nonmotorized \nrecreational trail uses. New eligible uses of funds permit trail \nassessment for accessibility and maintenance, and to hire trail crews \nor youth conservation or service corps to perform recreational trails \nactivities. Current activities eligible under the program educational \nfunding already include nonlaw enforcement trail safety, trail use \nmonitoring patrols, and trail-related training.\n  Since projects under the Recreational Trails Program are much smaller \nthan typical highway projects, this program is relieved of several \nnormal requirements which, although appropriate for large highway \nprojects, would be excessively burdensome for small trail projects.\n  Section 1604 covers exemption of interstate systems. SAFETEA \nestablishes an exemption for the interstate system from consideration \nas a ``historic site'' regardless of whether the interstate system or \nportions of the interstate system may be eligible for listing on the \nNational Registry of Historic Places. However, a portion of the \ninterstate system that possesses an independent feature of historic \nsignificance, such as a bridge or a uniquely significant architectural \nfeature, may still be considered a historic site individually.\n\n  Section 1605 of this bill changes current law to place greater \nemphasis on the need to consider the preservation of human and natural \nresources in the\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\ndecisionmaking process of developing highway projects. Consideration of \na variety of highway project impacts has been part of the design \nprocess for many years. However, the transportation community has \ndemanded improvements in project delivery and in the makeup of the \nproduct that is delivered. Compatibility with the surrounding \nenvironment and improved safety for the motorist and the pedestrian are \ncritical.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary to ensure that the plans and \nspecifications for proposed highway projects have considered \npreservation, historic, scenic, natural environment, and community \nvalues. However, States can use existing processes for demonstrating \nthat they have considered these subject factors.\n  Section 1606 covers use of high-occupancy vehicle lanes which has \nbeen a topic of great interest to both States and stakeholders. This \nreauthorization bill clarifies existing law and provides more \nflexibility to State and local agencies for effective management of \nhigh-occupancy vehicle, or HOV, facilities. Certain types of vehicles \nare exempt from meeting the general occupancy requirements for HOV \nfacilities. The bill further identifies the possible operational \nstrategies that responsible agencies may select from to maximize the \nuse of HOV facilities, manage highway capacity, mitigate congestion, \nand reduce fuel consumption.\n  Motorcycles continue to be allowed use of HOV facilities. Responsible \nGovernment agencies choosing to meet additional requirements may also \nallow low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles, such as hybrid \nvehicles, to use HOV facilities. These agencies are also given the \nauthority to toll the use of an HOV facility by vehicles that do not \notherwise meet the normal minimum capacity or other exemption \nrequirements.\n  Section 1607 relates to bicycle transportation and pedestrian \nwalkways. The highway authorization bill makes minor changes regarding \npedestrian walkways, specifically allowing the use of the Surface \nTransportation Program, STP, funds and congestion mitigation and air \nquality improvement programs, CMAQs, funds for the nonconstruction \npedestrian safety programs where current law only mentions bicycle \nsafety.\n  We also explicitly mention the pedestrian use on bridges, whereas \ncurrent law only mentions safety programs for bicycle use. The practice \nof charging user fees for shared-use paths is also permitted so long as \nthe fees collected by a State are used for maintaining and operating \nthe shared-use paths within the State.\n  User fees may not be collected on shared-use paths that are not \nwithin a highway right-of-way nor make user fees be charged for the use \nof sidewalks or bicycle paths.\n  I would like to stop at this point and pass the description to my \ngood friend, Senator Bond. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, picking up with the description of this \nbill, which we think is extremely important, I am going to share some \nother views. But I want to continue with this description of the bill.\n  Under the current law, there is a general prohibition against placing \ncommercial establishments in recreation and safety rest areas on \ninterstate rights-of-way. This bill creates a small exception to this \nprohibition by allowing States to place either electrification or other \nidling facilities that can be used for heating, air-conditioning, \nelectricity, and communication. This will enable truck operators to \nreceive services without continuing to run their engines, thereby \nreducing vehicle emissions. States, other public agencies, and private \nentities are already allowed to operate on the interstate system and \nmay charge for the services provided under this new authority.\n  Why is this important? This is tremendously important. If you travel \nin your State along an interstate, you will find now that the new \nhours-of-service regulations require truckers to take more frequent \nbreaks. There are rest areas in my State which are crowded with trucks. \nThere are entrances to and exits from interstate highways where \nsignificant numbers of trucks are parked. This is to make sure that the \ndrivers get the rest they need. There has been some controversy over \nit, but this is the rule and they are abiding by that rule. But when \nthey are shut down and idling, particularly in bitter cold weather so \nthey can get heat in their cab while they get the necessary rest, No. \n1, it is causing dangerous situations along the roadway, on the exit \nand entrance ramps to interstate highways, and they are needlessly \nburning fuel, polluting the atmosphere, and causing excessive use of \nimported petroleum at a time when we face a real energy crisis.\n  So while this is a small part of the bill, it is one which responds \nto very significant needs to maintain safety for the traveling public, \nespecially the truckers, and also to eliminate air pollution that comes \nfrom idling trucks.\n  Another program that I think is vitally important to empower the \nimprovements in tolling, section 1609, deals with tools for toll \nprograms. One of the effective things that has been used in many \nhighway locations for raising revenue and regulating the flow of \ntraffic is tolling. This bill modifies the Interstate System \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Program, the ISRRP, and establishes a \nnew variable toll pricing program. This variable pricing program \nreplaces the pilot program which was authorized in the previous TEA-21.\n  The new variable toll pricing program enables the use of variable \ntoll pricing on congested facilities in order to increase mobility and \nimprove air quality. This says that the Secretary can permit a State or \npublic authority to toll any highway, bridge, or tunnel, including \nfacilities on the interstate system, to manage high levels of \ncongestion or reduce emissions in a nonattainment area or maintenance \narea.\n  This is extremely important when you look at the kinds of congestion \nwe have in many areas during high traffic time. If there are tolls \nimposed when there would otherwise be heavy congestion, then those who \nmust necessarily travel at that time can continue to do so by paying a \ntoll. This is the ultimate market-based system for assuring that people \nwho do not have to travel at high congestion times will not. Obviously, \nthis means better traffic flow, this means less congestion, and \ntherefore less pollution. So I think this is extremely important.\n  The Secretary may permit a State or public authority to manage the \nlevels. The States must provide the Secretary with a description of the \ncongestion and air quality problems, and the goals. Any State or public \nauthority already operating under a cooperative agreement under the \nexisting pricing pilot program of TEA-21 can continue under the \nexisting laws.\n\n  We also have included some changes in the tolling requirements \nbecause in some States there are interstates which are badly out of \ndate and in need of substantial rehabilitation. In the current laws, \nthe provision for establishing tolls on existing interstates has been \nlimited to replacement. If you have ever traveled I-70 in the State of \nMissouri, which is the lifeline for our State and for much of the \nNation for east-west traffic going from coast to coast, certainly \ntraveling between Kansas City and St. Louis, you will find that there \nare tremendous delays occasioned because the roads are inadequate. They \nare two-lane roads that are like driving in city traffic, they are so \nfilled with cars and congestion.\n  In addition, when there are accidents on these roads, it is not \nuncommon for us to experience an hour or 2-hour delay. In one instance, \nI managed to miss a 7-hour delay by taking some back roads which I knew \nabout to get around a major disaster.\n  This measure expands the ability to say if it is substantial \nrehabilitation or reconstruction, the State, if it chooses, could use \ntolls to improve an interstate.\n  Right now, Interstate 70 has the distinction of being the first toll \nroad in the United States. But it also means it is a half a century old \nand it is at least 20 years out of date. The total cost for repairing \nit and replacing it is about $3 billion.\n  Some of my colleagues will be surprised to know that I have not asked \nin this bill for $3 billion to replace this vital national link. But I \ndo believe we need to provide options for States to deal with problems \nsuch as this one. Whether they do it is going to be up to them. In the \nState of Missouri, there would have to be a vote of the people.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\nThey would have to authorize the issuance of bonds and a tolling \nauthority. This does not by any means say we are going to put tolls on \nit. It provides an option for the legislature, the Governor, the \nDepartment of Transportation to consider as they look at how they want \nto deal with one of these very significant highway corridors, which has \nbecome far too often a parking lot rather than a means of facilitating \ntransportation between our two major cities and for people traveling \nfrom far beyond, going east to west through the heartland of the \nNation, through the State of Missouri.\n  I think this is a very important provision and one which will provide \nStates reasonable flexibility, not allowing them, willy-nilly, to take \nroads already financed through the interstate program, to impose tolls \non them to finance other activities, but to make sure that we continue \nto realize the dream of those who initially formulated the interstate \nhighway program to make sure that we can see traffic continue to \nproceed.\n  Let me move to another provision in the bill. It is section 1610, \nwhich merely directs the EPA to study the ability to monitor \ndifferentiation between fine and coarse particulate matter.\n  As we find out more about the dangers of pollutants, we find they are \ngreater risks in the fine particulates in many instances which can \ncause far more significant harm than a coarse particulate because of \nthe impact on the lungs.\n  Section 1611 adds particulate matter areas to the Congestion, \nMitigation, and Air Quality Program. The funds under this provision are \napportioned on the basis of a ratio of total weighted population of a \nState's nonattainment or maintenance areas to the total weighted \npopulation of all nonattainment or maintenance areas in the Nation.\n  If you didn't follow me on that, if a State has air quality problems \nin an area which is one-twentieth of all of the areas in the Nation, \nthen they would get one-twentieth of the total funds available.\n  It sounds convoluted, but it really targets the CMAQ funds to the \nareas with greatest needs. Since many areas will need assistance to \nmeet the new 8-hour ozone standard and the new fine particulate matter \nstandard, the CMAQ formula is modified to include those areas. \nAdjustment factors are used to account for the number of pollutants for \nareas in nonattainment or maintenance. Section 1611 says CMAQ funds can \nbe used for alternative fuel infrastructure under TEA-21. This bill \ngoes further and encourages the use of CMAQ funds by listing the \npurchase of alternative fuel and the purchase of biodiesel fuel as \neligible activities under CMAQ.\n  Due to some confusion in some DOT and EPA field and regional offices, \nwe have also clarified that projects to control the extended idling of \nvehicles are indeed eligible for funding under the CMAQ program.\n  The bill also fixes oversight under current law that prevents States \nthat do not have any nonattainment or maintenance areas from using CMAQ \nfunds for CMAQ projects. Frankly, this allows us to get more homegrown \nclean fuels used with the assistance of CMAQ funds.\n  I happen to know something about soy diesel and about biodiesel. I am \na great champion of it, because if you have followed a bus or a truck \ndown the road that is burning straight diesel, you know what an \nunpleasant smell that can cause and what damage that can do to the \nenvironment. Biodiesel is a soybean-based or other biomass-based fuel \nwhich operates in a much cleaner burning environment. Several years ago \nwe started a pilot project at the great training facility at Fort \nLeonard Wood, MO that needed to train soldiers to fight in smoke \nconditions on the battlefield. They had been burning diesel to provide \nthat smoke. We felt that was not necessarily a good idea to be burning \ndiesel and exposing our finest troops to the diesel pollution and the \nsmoke that was caused. We worked with the Department of Defense to \nswitch that to soy diesel. There was smoke. I asked them after they \nimplemented what the byproducts were. They said, Obviously, we are not \npolluting the environment with petroleum-based diesel. We are burning a \nmuch cleaner soy-based fuel. It is much less harmful to the soldiers. \nThe only problem is it smells like French fries and they get hungry. \nBut given the alternative, that seems to be a good idea.\n  To the extent we get more buses and trucks using biodiesel, we are \ngoing to have greater benefits.\n\n  Let me give you two areas where soy diesel or any biodiesel can be a \ngreat improvement.\n  No. 1, firehouses: The fire men and women who live and stay in \nfirehouses have complained for years. When they fire up the firetrucks, \nthey get the diesel fumes coming up into the rest area. Sometimes, our \nvaliant firefighters have to live and sleep in heavily polluted diesel-\nfuel-soaked areas. This is not only unhealthy, but it is very \nunpleasant. Fire stations have been some of the first places where we \nhave used biodiesel. It has been extremely popular. Certainly when we \nare trying to talk about taking care of our first responders and the \nvaliant firefighters who are on the line making sure the engines and \nthe firetrucks below them are burning a clean-burning feel, it is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  Another important area we have talked a lot about is school bus \nsafety. When you have kids on school buses, the fumes from petroleum-\nbased diesel come into that school bus. Do you know where they are the \nmost dangerous? They are most dangerous when they are at low levels--\nwhere the small children are. The smallest children are likely to be \nexposed to petroleum-based diesel fumes.\n  We are working to encourage more and more school buses to use soy \ndiesel, and put aside the fact that kids are going to get hungry when \nthey smell something that smells like french fries. But it is vitally \nimportant that we lessen the danger to our schoolchildren as well as \nlessening the use of diesel fuel and providing a significant benefit to \nthose who produce soybean and other biomass.\n  I see a couple of our colleagues are here. Senator Thomas wishes to \nspeak. We have lots more to talk about, but I will discontinue at this \npoint and thank the Chair and thank my colleagues for coming to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Missouri. I am glad \nthis conversation is going on. Certainly there isn't anything before us \nthat is more immediate in need and more important than this highway \nbill. Not only is it a matter of infrastructure, of course, that we \nnecessarily need, but it is also a matter of providing more jobs more \nquickly than anything we can possibly do.\n  Someone said this morning at one of our meetings that they will wait \nuntil next year to use the money. Not at all. I think many of the \nhighway departments similar to Wyoming where I am from are ready to go. \nThey are ready to contract. They can move very quickly.\n  I think it is terribly important that we move forward on this. I hope \nbefore we are through that we have a thorough discussion of the bill. \nBut I hope we don't get off into a bunch of irrelevant amendments that \nreally do not belong in here but are simply trying to be used as a \ncarrot and a stick. That is not the way it ought to be.\n  In any event, this is a very large bill and it is very detailed. We \nhave talked a lot about the details. I want to talk a little more \ngenerally about it.\n  This bill, of course, has gone through several committees. The EPW \nCommittee, of which I am a member, is the basic committee where a great \ndeal of work was done. This is the same committee that dealt with the \nprevious bill 6 years ago, a bill, as it turned out, that worked very \nwell. There is a great deal of detail here, but the detail has to be \ndone in committee, and we need to now talk about the principles and to \nmove forward with it.\n  The bill as reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwould authorize $255 billion over 6 years beginning in 2004 to fund the \nFederal aid for highways, highway safety programs, and other \ntransportation projects. The last surface transportation authorization \nwas the Transportation Equity Act, called ISTEA. We are moving forward \none more time. As I said, it replaces an older one, and indeed actually \neven before that in the early 1990s, we had this same kind of approach \nwith a gas tax. Each of us pays 18.5 cents a gallon of Federal gas tax \nwhen we buy gas. That goes into\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nthe fund for the purpose of upkeep of the infrastructure.\n  This bill makes significant progress in streamlining the \nenvironmental review and delivery process which, as always, is part of \nthe problem.\n  It encourages communities and project sponsors to consider \nenvironmental concerns earlier so things can go together and it comes \nout as a manageable package.\n  It increases the oversight on the expenditure side. There is a great \ndeal of money here. The highway funds are spent by requiring project \nmanagement plans and annual financial plans of Federal programs. That \nis as it should be. Accountability is necessary.\n  Actually, when the Finance Committee then received the bill, the \nfunding from the gas tax was not complete enough to cover what we hoped \nto do. It happened to be about a 6 percent reduction that had to be \nfilled after it came to the Finance Committee. So we have heard a great \ndeal about that, and I understand most want to fund the highway bill \nwith funds that come from related sources instead of the general fund.\n  I will say a few words about how we are paying with that in the \nhighway bill. The Finance Committee reported out a mechanism for paying \nfor this bill. This mechanism retains the integrity of the highway \ntrust fund. These are truly transportation-related taxes that are now \ndeposited in the highway trust fund. Some of the taxes were previously \ndeposited in the general fund. In other words, the general fund was \ngetting support for transportation-oriented taxes. The Finance \nCommittee finally righted the wrongs. The taxes should have been \nfunding this trust fund for years. Now they will be.\n  In addition, there are exemptions enjoyed by certain taxpayers that \ndiminish the taxes that would otherwise be deposited in the trust fund. \nThese are exemptions that are subsidies that have nothing to do with \nhighway policy. The impetus behind the exemptions was energy policy and \ntax policy. Since they are not highway policy, why should they have the \ntrust fund bear the burden?\n  No one is taking issue with these exemptions of subsidies but rather \nthe funding structure behind them and who pays. The Finance Committee \nmade changes that the exemptions are allowed, allowing for the highway \ntrust fund to legitimately receive the taxes that have been due for a \nvery long time. The exemptions of subsidies will stay in place but now \nappropriately become the burden of the general fund.\n  In addition, the Finance Committee went a step further to authorize \nnew taxes to take up the slack in the general fund. The result is that \nthe tax necessary for the highway fund is there and those funds are \nreplaced by new ones in the general fund so there is an equity.\n  I heard several Senators talk about funny money and shell games when \ndescribing this mechanism. The fact is that all highway tax money will \nbe paid in full into the highway trust fund--no exemptions; no \ngimmicks.\n  Any subsidy that certain taxpayers enjoy will stay in place but will \nbe paid from the general fund. Any losses to the general fund will be \ncovered by new offsets that have been identified by the Finance \nCommittee. We are taking some things that should have been going for \nyears into the highway fund--gasohol, gas guzzlers, interest on the \ntrust fund balance, these kind of things that should have been going \nthere--now we put those in the highway trust fund. The general fund \ndoes not receive them.\n  To make up for that, we have certain other changes, including the \ncorporation governances, Enron tax shelters, that have been going into \nthe general fund will now be an offset. We are still, then, as a matter \nof fact, funding this highway fund from those kinds of taxes that were \nset in to do the job for highways.\n\n  Certainly nothing is more important than highway and transportation \ninfrastructure in this country. It is very important to everyone. Each \nState has a little different approach to it. Smaller population States, \nsuch as mine, that have large areas, have fewer people per mile and \ntherefore the cost per person is higher to keep up the infrastructure. \nBut it is a Federal and national system so it needs to go across to \nWyoming, Nevada, as well as across Pennsylvania and any other State.\n  These are the kinds of tasks that we have undertaken and that have \nbeen resolved in a reasonable manner. Obviously, not everyone has the \nsame view.\n  I mention again, certainly in terms of jobs inspiring more \ndevelopment in States and having the jobs come about quickly, nothing \ncould happen more quickly than in the highway fund.\n  These are some of the details that will be talked about here. The \nfact is, as I mentioned, they have gone through three committees and \nhave been given a great deal of attention. Now we should take a look at \nwhere we want to be when this highway bill is through to see if we can \nmove forward in our States to strengthen this infrastructure.\n  I yield to my friend from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nstatement. I have worked with him on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on this important piece of legislation. The fact is there are \na lot of committees involved in this legislation. I am thankful the \nmajority leader brought it to the floor.\n  We had a cloture vote to move forward with the bill. This bill has \nbeen before the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, with \nChairman Shelby, and also before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, with Chairman Inhofe. Senators Bond, Jeffords, and Reid have \nall had input into this particular piece of legislation. I appreciate \nall of them for the work they put into this bill. It is not easy with \ninput from the Budget Committee, from Don Nickles, chairman of the \nBudget Committee. We had input from the Finance Committee, Chairman \nGrassley, and also input from the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, which has a small section involving transportation.\n  This is a transportation bill, not just a highway bill. It is a \ntransportation bill. It takes a good deal of cooperation, working \ntogether, to put together any piece of legislation like this. It is not \nsimple.\n  Most Members experienced the same thing I have experienced in the \nState of Colorado. The demand and the transportation needs have \nincreased in each of our States. Over time, the demand for \ntransportation mechanisms has grown throughout the country. The States \nhave had to work harder to make their dollars stretch further every \nyear. Transportation projects, whether they are building roads or \nlaying rail, are simply not cheap. They are getting more expensive with \neach passing year, and the funds required for transportation projects \nare simply staggering.\n  The Finance Committee has produced funding mechanisms they believe \nwill be able to fund this bill. We must use the moneys intended for use \nin building roads and mass transit projects. That is the money in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Some time ago, this Congress decided we need to dedicate a stream of \nrevenue into the construction of highways. We need to make sure we \nmaintain the integrity of that process because it is important. It \nsends a message that highways and this type of infrastructure are \nimportant in America. We have told the American people we will use the \ntax they pay on each gallon of gas they buy directly for funding \ntransportation projects. We must do that. However, it is not \nappropriate to use moneys from the general fund. We have to stay true \nto the fiscally conservative obligations we have made for ourselves. We \nmust not add to our country's deficit as we have an increased demand \nfor transportation projects.\n  That is why I am excited about the potential of an amendment on which \nI am working. This amendment will allow States to build additional \ncapacity. It is called Fast Lanes. On roads that currently experience \nproblems with congestion, you toll only those lanes. It brings forth a \nuser-pay concept. In other words, if you use these lanes, you will pay \nfor them. I worked hard to get this amendment adopted in committee. It \njust barely lost by one vote. I hope we can go ahead and get it adopted \nin the Senate. It gives another mechanism to provide infrastructure in \nthis country, badly needed infrastructure, and has a user-pay concept.\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\n  We say on interstate highways you can build additional lanes on to \nexisting highways and toll the highways, toll them with a mechanism. We \nuse our high technology so there are no toll booths. As the trucks and \ncars go down the toll lanes, commonly referred to as fast lanes, they \nwill receive a bill later for the use they put on the highway. That \nhelps pay for those fast lanes. It is intended to relieve much of the \ncongestion problem we are seeing throughout the United States.\n  The toll would be paid with electronic technology. There would be no \nneed for a toll booth. The process can happen quickly, without \nrequiring a decrease in speed.\n  If you wish to use the ``fast lane,'' you pay the toll and do so. \nHowever, if you do not wish to pay the toll, you simply drive in the \nregular lanes, and that means just sit over in the regular lanes for an \nhour or two on some highly congested roads. It is your choice. But if \nyou decide it is worth your time to go over and pay a toll to go on the \ntoll lanes, then you can do that.\n  So this is the advantage of having toll lanes. I emphasize that when \nwe talk about ``fast lanes,'' we are not taking existing Federal \nhighway lanes and putting a toll on them. These are new lanes we are \nputting on the side of some of our interstate highways.\n  One study found that if every State participates, this ability for \nStates to put in these kinds of lanes could raise close to $50 billion \nto go toward increasing road capacity.\n  I realize that it is unlikely all States will use this funding \nmechanism, but if a tiny fraction of that is raised, that is still \nadditional funding for road capacity that does not put an additional \nfinancial burden on those who are not willing and able to pay it.\n  I see this ability as simply another tool in the ``toolbox'' that \nState departments of transportation can carry around. My staff \ncontinues to work with Senator Bond's staff to see that these \nprovisions are included in the bill, and I appreciate the assistance \nthey have given and their willingness to work with us on this \nparticular provision.\n  Because this is a transportation bill, and not just a highways bill, \nas so many incorrectly term it, I would also like to make a few remarks \non the mass transit title of the bill. I went through the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I served on that committee, so I had some \ninput there. I serve on the Banking Committee. In fact, I am chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, so I had some input \nthere. I am also on the Budget Committee. So I want to make a few \ncomments about the mass transit side.\n  Before I turn to the specifics of the Banking Committee's bill, I \nwould like to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Shelby. As chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, he has worked diligently to make sure the \ncommittee's jurisdiction was protected, while moving forward as quickly \nas possible with a positive bill. I also thank him for his willingness \nto work closely with me as chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and \nTransportation.\n  Finally, I also thank Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, and Senator Reed, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee of which I chair, for their work on this particular piece \nof legislation. Along with their staff members, they have spent a \nconsiderable number of hours working to achieve consensus on many \nissues in the bill, and I appreciate their efforts.\n  I was pleased to support the Banking Committee's bill during our \nmarkup earlier today. I believe it makes important progress in a number \nof areas.\n  First, I am especially supportive of the new growing States formula. \nFor far too long, the transit formulas have sent the lion's share of \ntransit dollars to a small number of cities, primarily located in the \nNortheast. While we can all agree that transit is important to larger, \neast coast cities, there is no denying the need for transit services in \na number of rapidly growing cities in the South and the West.\n\n  While I believe we still need further adjustments to the formula to \neven better address the growing States, I believe this new formula will \nfinally help growing States begin to address their transportation \nneeds.\n  I am also extremely pleased to see that the bill places a strong \nemphasis on rural transit. While many would consider ``rural transit'' \nto be an oxymoron, in fact, rural areas can often face even more acute \ntransportation needs than large cities.\n  Last year, one of my constituents, Larry Worth, testified before the \nHousing and Transportation Subcommittee regarding the need for transit \nin rural areas. He described how rural citizens may not have any other \nalternatives to access medical care, jobs, and vital services. With 40 \npercent of American counties having no public transportation, this \ninvestment is long overdue.\n  There are a number of other very good provisions in the transit \ntitle, but I will not take the considerable time that would be \nnecessary to enumerate them all. Suffice it to say that I believe the \ntransit provisions will be of great benefit to public transportation in \nAmerica. I am pleased to support the transit title, and I look forward \nto passage of the bill, preserving the provisions, and staying within \nour budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are checking with our colleagues on the \npossibility of setting a judicial nomination. As soon as we find out \nwhether that is acceptable, we will ask consent.\n  Mr. President, we have heard lots of reasons why this bill is not a \ngood bill, why we don't want to go to this bill, why we shouldn't be \nmoving a highway bill. I have talked about some of those reasons, but \nlet me share with you some information that indicates how the people of \nAmerica think.\n  The Zogby International Survey Group did a broad-based survey of \nAmerican voters. Nearly 70 percent of the voters contacted, in February \n2003, said they believe America is facing a transportation capacity \ncrisis, that our Nation's roads, airports, and mass transit systems are \nstruggling to handle a growing population and economy.\n  Fifty-six percent overall and 79 percent of young women with children \nsaid traffic congestion is depriving them of more time with their \nfamilies or for leisure activities today than just 5 years ago.\n  I don't think these answers should surprise any of us.\n  Since 1982, the U.S. population has grown by almost 19 percent, the \nnumber of registered motor vehicles has increased by 36 percent, and \nthe vehicle miles traveled has ballooned by 72 percent. And--surprise--\nover the past 20 years we have added less than 5 percent to road \ncapacity, and even less than that to public transit.\n  What are the conditions of roads in local communities?\n  Forty-eight percent of those surveyed by Zogby said they were either \nfair or poor. When you move to Hispanic Americans, 75 percent said \ntheir communities have either fair or poor road conditions.\n  This is a problem in communities. This is a problem particularly for \ncitizens who are maybe at a disadvantage in their community.\n  This survey's results come from a poll of over 1,000 voters \nnationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent.\n  I think some of the other findings are pretty important.\n  Eighty percent of the people polled think the Nation's highways and \npublic transit networks are extremely important or very important to \nthe U.S. economy. That is why we are here. Eighty percent of our \nconstituents think highways and transportation networks are important. \nThat is what this bill is all about. That is why we want to get \neverybody together to move this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues, if you have problems with particular portions \nof the bill, offer amendments. That is how this body functions. We \nwould like to have good-faith amendments that seek to make changes \nwhich are necessary so we can move forward in a reasonable manner.\n  I think the people of America, particularly the 80 percent who say it \nis important, deserve to see us vote on issues that are of importance \nto them.\n  Eight in 10 of the people surveyed agree that an investment in \nhighways, bridges, and public transit should be considered an important \nelement in homeland security and national defense.\n  Ninety percent believe it is important that their representatives in \nCongress fight to ensure sufficient Federal\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\nfunding for transportation improvement projects in their local areas. I \nthink some States must be lower than that because I think in my State \nit is higher than 90 percent. So some may have only 80 percent who \nthink it is important.\n  Two-thirds of Americans say roads and public transit play a vitally \nimportant role in their life.\n  These are scientific surveys that merely confirm what I and many of \nmy colleagues already know: If you go back to your home State and have \na meeting about highway and transportation funding, you better get a \nbig hall. I have had people come out to fill any hall that I have \nscheduled a meeting in to talk about it because they want to know more. \nThey know it is important. I think this is vitally important.\n\n  I know there are some who may take a different view. Some people \nclaim building more roads just causes more traffic. They even say you \ncan't build your way out of traffic congestion. They are the zero sum \ngame people, the ones who say there will just be more congestion.\n  Well, congestion is getting worse at a frightening pace in America. I \nbelieve the primary reason is a lack of adequate highway and public \ntransportation capacity, not only in our major urban and suburban areas \nbut in rural areas as well. As I have said several times, that is why \nwe are killing people in Missouri. We don't have adequate highway \ntransportation, particularly in rural areas.\n  Even as we spend more wasted time sitting in gridlocked traffic, many \nwell-intentioned Americans, spurred on by the rhetoric of some of the \nextreme advocacy groups who want us all to ride bicycles--and I love to \nride bicycles, but those won't get me to work and back, particularly \nwhen we have icy roads, as we do here, or when we have to take more \npeople with us--are convinced that adding road capacity only causes \nmore traffic congestion, more air pollution, more waste of precious \nfuels.\n  I think the answer to that is very clear: Research data from the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Transportation, and \nthe Texas Transportation Institute and common sense, if you and I just \nsit back and think about it, proves just about the opposite. The real \nproblem is our lack of resolve to provide meaningful solutions to \ntraffic congestion through new capital and operational investments. The \nfailure to do so actually results in tons of unnecessary air pollution \nand billions of gallons of wasted motor fuel.\n  The Zogby poll found that 70 percent of America is facing a \ntransportation capacity crisis, and all of these people realize we \nneed, as a nation, the investment in transportation.\n  Talk about a drag on the economy, according to the Texas \nTransportation Urban Mobility Report, absent substantial new \ninvestments in highway and public transportation capacity, \ntransportation operations across the Nation, the economic cost of \ntraffic congestion in the Nation, lost productivity, wasted motor fuel \nwill grow from about $67.5 billion in 2000 to almost $100 billion by \n2009. That is one of the reasons we seek to have the investment. Yes, \n$255 billion is a large amount. It is not all going to highways. It \ncomes from highway user taxes, but it goes to mass transit; it goes to \ncongestion mitigation; it goes to scenic easements, to other things \nthat improve the environment in which we live.\n  If we don't make these investments, the Texas Transportation \nInstitute forecasts that over this period the average road speed in \nAmerica's 675 largest urban communities will fall from about 42.3 miles \nper hour to 40.3 miles per hour. If you believe, as I do, that time is \nmoney, that reduction will continue to grow what is really a hidden tax \nlevied on American consumers as transportation labor productivity \ndecreases and costs increase.\n  Another one of the problems we have with congestion is pollution. The \ngood news, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data, \nis that motor vehicle emissions have declined dramatically since the \n1970s, thanks in part to the developments in new automotive and motor \nfuels technology. Emissions of carbon monoxide are down 45 percent \nsince 1970, volatile organic compound emissions are down 60 percent, \nparticulate matter emissions are down 47 percent, nitrogen oxide \nemissions are down 5 percent, and lead emissions have been eliminated.\n  The bad stuff is being reduced. We are getting the bad stuff out. \nThis remarkable environmental achievement, which is responsible for \nmost of the air quality improvement in the United States over the past \nthree decades, was accomplished at the same time the number of licensed \nmotor vehicles in the United States grew 87 percent and total vehicle \nmiles traveled soared by 125 percent. Unfortunately, traffic congestion \nis retarding clean air progress just as it is retarding American \nproductivity and economic growth.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 3:55 today, the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nomination on today's Executive Calendar: \nCalendar No. 457, the nomination of Mark Filip to be U.S. District \nJudge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following 5 minutes for debate \nequally divided between the chairman and ranking member or their \ndesignees, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination; further, that following the vote, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then return \nto legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask my \nfriend if he would be willing to modify this. We have been asking \npeople to come over and offer amendments. Senator Dorgan is here to \noffer a germane amendment. He only wants 8 minutes to speak to offer \nhis amendment. I ask that the consent request be modified to have the \npending amendment set aside and that Senator Dorgan be allowed to offer \nhis amendment and speak for up to 8 minutes, and then we adopt the \nSenator's consent as indicated.\n  I would also say that I am not sure anybody is going to use any time \non our side on the nomination anyway. I think adequate time will be \npreserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would ask what the Durbin amendment does and does not \ndo.\n  Mr. REID. The Dorgan amendment deals with farmers' transportation of \nhazardous products. I have just glanced at it. It appears there is an \ninordinate burden placed upon farmers to transfer a load of gas to \ntheir farms.\n  Mr. GREGG. What would the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota \nbe to? Mine was a second-degree amendment, I believe.\n  Mr. REID. We are just laying what is pending aside. His would be a \nseparate, independent amendment to the substitute that is now pending.\n  Mr. GREGG. And after his was disposed of, mine would be properly in \norder; is that not correct, Mr. President?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Missouri agree to the \nmodification?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, there is some question on \nthis side about the amendment being an amendment to the commerce title, \nand at this point we are not prepared to give consent to that. We want \nto work with the Senator who has been working in good faith, but I have \nbeen asked, since this is a matter that relates to a different section \nof the bill, to hold off. We can work through this if we can go with \nthe original consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification. Is \nthere objection to the original consent request?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, if I might be recognized \nfollowing the vote to offer the amendment, that is fine. You may want \nto work on this amendment some. It is not an amendment of great moment \nexcept to family farmers who are concerned about this. I would like to \nbe able to offer the amendment. I have been down in the capital office \nhearing the Senator talk about the need for people to come up and offer \namendments. This is a germane amendment. I would love to offer it and \nbe able to debate it. In any event, if we go ahead\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nwith this vote, which is fine with me, if I could be recognized \nfollowing this vote to offer my amendment, I would very much appreciate \nthat.\n  I would ask the Senator from Missouri whether I might be recognized \nfollowing the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on this side I am not authorized to enter \ninto that type of UC. I assure the Senator and my colleagues on the \nother side we will work with them. There is a concern about moving into \nthe commerce title. We will work with him if we can move forward on the \nconsent for the judge vote; then we will work on this, if we can get \nconsent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I will go along with what \nthe Senator from Missouri requests. It is kind of unfair to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. We have been begging people to offer amendments. He \nshows up to offer one and now we cannot do it. It doesn't seem very \nfair. We may be waiting a long time based upon statements by the \nchairman in the Chamber. I am happy--\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--if you want Members to come to the floor with germane \namendments, I am here. I have been hearing that a lot today. I have one \nand it is not a big amendment. What I hear being said at the moment is \nperhaps you want to go through this bill by title, which is something I \nhave not heard before. It should be open to amendment at any point. \nThat is the reason that, for the last hour or so, I put this amendment \ntogether.\n  My hope is that the Senator from Missouri and those managing will \nunderstand, when we are ready to offer an amendment, you ought to \nwelcome it. I hope when I seek recognition, you will allow me to offer \nit. I expect to speak 8 or 10 minutes. If you want to lay it aside then \nand work on it, I am happy to do that. I shall not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Missouri?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when are we going to have the vote? It is \npast 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe at this point it is necessary to revise the \nunanimous consent. First, I say to my friend from North Dakota that the \ntitle he wants to amend has not been offered. That is a problem on \nwhich we are going to have to work. We have only offered the EPW \nportion.\n  I asked unanimous consent that there be 5 minutes equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member and, thereafter, there be a \nvote on the nomination of Mark R. Filip, of Illinois, to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  I renew my request. Following the 5 minutes, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation and, following \nthe vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action \nand the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S568-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S568-S571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF MARK R. FILIP TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN \n                          DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of the Mark R. Filip, of \nIllinois, to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I take just a few moments to introduce \nto my colleagues the nominee on whom we are going to be voting in a \ncouple of minutes. I recommended Mark Filip to President Bush. \nPresident Bush nominated him. Senator Durbin concurred in my \nrecommendation to President Bush. I thank Senator Durbin for his \nsupport in this effort. I also thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy \non the Judiciary Committee, and all members of the Judiciary Committee, \nfor helping to move this nomination forward to the floor.\n  I think one of the most difficult tasks most of us have in the Senate \nis finding outstanding nominees to the Federal judicial branch of \nGovernment. In many cases, at least from my perspective, the choice has \nbeen very difficult. Oftentimes, we will get 80 applicants for a single \ndistrict court judgeship opening in Chicago and you have to pick just \none person. That one person, obviously, is very happy and you have many \nothers who are disappointed that they did not get chosen.\n  In this case, I was elated to find a person of such outstanding \ncredentials that I could wholeheartedly recommend him to the President. \nI think in the case of this nominee, Mark R. Filip, we are in fact \nlucky to have someone of his caliber who is willing to leave a very \nlucrative practice in the private sector. He is now a partner at \nSkadden Arps' Chicago office. He is willing to leave that very \nprestigious position to move into public service and become a district \ncourt judge in the Northern District of Illinois.\n  Mark Filip lives in Winnetka, IL, with his wife Beth. They have four \nsons.\n\n  Mark grew up in Chicago and attended the University of Illinois at \nChampaign. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of \nIllinois. While there, he received many academic fellowships, including \nthe prestigious Phi Beta Kappa fellowship. After graduating from U of \nI, he won the highly sought after Marshall Scholarship to attend \nOxford. While there, he received a B.A. and M.A. in jurisprudence and \nwon first class honors at Oxford. Returning from his Marshall \nscholarship to the United States, he matriculated at the Harvard Law \nSchool. He did similarly well at Harvard. He became an editor of the \nHarvard Law Review.\n  In Mark Filip's second year at Harvard, he won the Sears Prize, which \nis given annually to the two students of the second year class who \nachieved the highest grades. Ultimately, in the early 1990s, Mark Filip \ngraduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School.\n  He began his professional career in Chicago, serving as an associate \nat Kirkland & Ellis, one of the best and oldest firms in Chicago. After \na couple of years in the Kirkland & Ellis Chicago office, he moved to \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office and became an assistant U.S. attorney in the \nNorthern District of Illinois, where he gained a lot of experience in a \nwide variety of criminal cases that he prosecuted successfully, \nincluding racketeering, white-collar crime, public corruption, tax \nfraud cases; and he successfully defended the U.S. Attorney's Office on \nappeal in many of those cases.\n  Mark Filip returned to the private sector. After leaving the U.S. \nAttorney's Office, he became an associate at Skadden Arps in 1999, and \nin 2001 he became a partner at Skadden Arps.\n  In recent years, he has been an adjunct professor of law at \nNorthwestern University and the University of Chicago Law School, both \noutstanding institutions.\n  Now, again, I emphasize how delighted I am to be able to present to \nmy colleagues in the Senate such a well-qualified nominee, Mark Filip, \nwho is a very young man. He has four children, who range in age from 8 \nmonths to 6 years. He is in his late thirties, and I expect that if he \ngoes on the district court in Chicago at this early age, he may well \nhave the opportunity to rise to the circuit court of appeals.\n  I neglected to mention that between law school and his professional \ncareer, he had two very prized judicial clerkships. He served as a law \nclerk to Steven Williams on the DC Court of Appeals and then as a law \nclerk for Supreme Court Justice Scalia.\n  I am confident, having researched and talked to all those he has \nworked with over the years, that there is no question he will make a \nsuperior district court judge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are considering the nomination of \nMark filip to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois. The vote today on Mr. Filip is the second vote on a judicial \nnominee this year, and demonstrates the Democrats'\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\nremarkable cooperation on judicial nominations despite years of \nintensified Republican partisanship and unilateralism.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, I have shared with the Senate several \ndisappointing developments regarding judicial nominations: The \nPickering recess appointment, the renomination of Claude Allen, and the \ntheft of Democratic offices' computer files by Republican staff. In \nspite of all those affronts, Senate Democrats cooperated to confirm a \nnominee last week and are cooperating to confirm another district court \nnominee today. We do so without the kinds of delays and obstruction \nthat Republicans used with President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n  Last week, I discussed the recess appointment of Judge Charles \nPickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which was \nPresident Bush's most cynical and divisive appointment to date. That \nappointment is without the consent of the United States Senate and is a \nparticular affront to the many individuals and membership organizations \nrepresenting African-Americans in the Fifth Circuit who have strongly \nopposed this nomination. Never before had a judicial nomination \nrejected by the Judiciary Committee after a vote been resubmitted to \nthe Senate, but this President took that unprecedented step last year. \nNever before has a judicial nomination debated at such length by the \nSenate, and to which the Senate has withheld its consent, been the \nsubject of a presidential appointment to the Federal bench. The \nPickering recess appointment is another dangerous step down the \nRepublican's chosen path to erode judicial independence for the sake of \npartisanship and their ideological court-packing efforts.\n  The second disappointing development I spoke about last week was the \nrenomination of Claude Allen as a nominee to the fourth Circuit. Two \nweeks ago, the President sent the nomination of Claude Allen back to \nthe Senate. From the time this nomination was originally made to the \ntime it was returned to the President last year, the Maryland Senators \nhave made their position crystal clear. This Fourth Circuit vacancy is \na Maryland seat and ought to be filled by an experienced, qualified \nMarylander. Over the Senate recess, the White House had ample time to \nfind such a nominee. This refusal to compromise is just another example \nof the White House engaging in partisan politics to the detriment of an \nindependent judiciary\n  Third, last week, I also mentioned with disappointment the ongoing \nfallout from the cyber theft of confidential memoranda from Democratic \nSenate staff. This invasion was perpetrated by Republican employees \nboth on and off the committee. As revealed by the chairman, computer \nsecurity was compromised and, simply put, members of the Republican \nstaff took things that did not belong to them and passed them around \nand to people outside of the Senate. This is no small mistake. It is a \nserious breach of trust, morals, the standards that govern Senate \nconduct and possibly, criminal laws. We do not yet know the full extent \nof these violations. But we do need to repair the loss of trust brought \non by this breach of confidentiality and privacy if we are ever to be \nable to resume our work in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect \nthat is so necessary to make progress.\n\n  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people \nbut that has chosen time and again to act with respect to judicial \nnominations in a way that divides us. This is an administration that \nsquandered the goodwill and good faith that Democrats showed in the \naftermath of September 11, 2001. This is an administration that refused \nto acknowledge the strides we made in filling 100 judicial vacancies \nunder Democratic Senate leadership in 2001 and 2002 while overcoming \nanthrax attacks and in spite of Republican mistreatment of scores of \nqualified, moderate judicial nominees of President Clinton.\n  Democratic cooperation with the President's slate of judicial \nnominees has been remarkable in these circumstances. With the overall \ncooperation of Senate Democrats, which partisan Republicans are loath \nto concede, this President has achieved record numbers of judicial \nconfirmations. Despite the attacks of September 11 and their aftermath, \nas of today, the Senate will have confirmed 171 of President Bush' \nnominees to the Federal bench. This is more judges than were confirmed \nduring President Reagan's entire first 4-year term. Thus, President \nBush's 3-year totals rival those achieved by other Presidents in 4 \nyears. That is also true with respect to the nearly 4 years it took for \nPresident Clinton to achieve these results following the Republicans' \ntaking majority control of the Senate in 1994.\n  The 69 judges confirmed last year exceeds the number of judges \nconfirmed during any of the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate during the Clinton Presidency, years in which \nthere were far more vacant Federal judgeships than exist today. Among \nthose 69 judges confirmed in 2003 were 13 circuit court judges. That \nexceeds the number of circuit judges confirmed during any of 1995, \n1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, when a Democrat was President.\n  The Senate has already confirmed 30 circuit court judges nominated by \nPresident Bush. This is a greater number than were confirmed at this \npoint in the presidencies of his father, President Clinton, or the \nfirst term of President Reagan. Vacancies on the Federal judiciary have \nbeen reduced to the lowest point in two decades and are lower than \nRepublicans allowed at any time during the Clinton Presidency. In \naddition, there are more Federal judges serving on the bench today than \nat any time in American history.\n  This week, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a \nthird hearing for circuit court nominees. Traditionally, the number of \nnominees who have received hearings and who are confirmed in a \nPresidential election year has been lower than in other years. In 1996, \nonly four circuit court nominees by President Clinton received a \nhearing from the Republican Senate majority all year, and it took until \nJuly 31 to have a hearing for the third circuit court nominee. By that \nstandard, Chairman Hatch has now moved seven times more quickly than he \ndid for President Clinton's nominees in 1996.\n\n  In 2000, only five circuit court nominees by President Clinton \nreceived a hearing from the Republican Senate majority. Of course, two \nof those outstanding and well-qualified nominees in 2000 were never \nallowed to be considered by the committee or the Senate. By contrast, \nas of tomorrow we will have held hearings for three circuit court \nnominees. By the standard Republicans set in 1996 and 2000, we would be \ndone for the entire year.\n  I congratulate the Democratic Senators on the committee for showing a \nspirit of cooperation and restraint in the face of a White House and \nRepublican majority that so often has refused to consult, compromise or \nconciliate. I regret that our efforts have not been fairly acknowledged \nby partisan Republicans and that this administration continues down the \npath of confrontation. While there have been controversial nominees \nwhom we have opposed as we exercise our constitutional duty of advice \nand consent to lifetime appointments on the Federal bench, we have done \nso openly and on the merits.\n  For the last 3 years I have urged the President to work with us. It \nis with deep sadness that I see that this administration still refuses \nto accept the Senate's shared responsibility under the Constitution and \nrefuses to appreciate our level of cooperation and achievement.\n  That we are proceeding to confirm Mark Filip today is another example \nof extraordinary Democractic cooperation to fill vacancies in the \nFederal judiciary, despite the Republicans' consistent and \nunprecedented attacks. Unfortunately, Mark Filip is another young, \nFederalist Society member whose record raises concerns, just as the \nrecord of far too many of President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  First, Mr. Filip is only 37 years old. He has been out of law school \nless than 12 years and just a decade ago he was clerking across the \nstreet for Justice Scalia. Second, his record demonstrates a partisan, \npolitical background. Mr. Filip worked as a volunteer Republican \nelection monitor in Broward County, Florida during the manual recount \nof ballots in the contentious 2000 election. Mr. Filip has also made \nseveral contributions to Republican candidates and political action \ncommittees. While in law school,\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\nhe was vice president of the Harvard Law School Federalist Society and \nhe authored an article entitled ``Why Learned Hand Would Never Consult \nLegislative History Today.'' In this article, Mr. Filip argues that \nlegislative history should be rejected by judges because it reflects \nnothing more than the desires of congressional staff and lobbyists, and \nbecause it does not reflect the majority will of Congress. More \nimportant, Mr. Filip wrote that, when confronted with statutory \nlanguage that would lead to an absurd result, a judge should apply his \nor her own reasoning rather than legislative history.\n  The senior Senator from Illinois met with Mr. Filip to address his \nbackground and suitability to be a Federal judge.\n   Senator Durbin is a thoughtful man and I respect his judgment. \nSenator Durbin's willingness to supply this nomination says alot. I am \nhopeful that Mr. Filip will be a person of his word; that he will \nfollow the law and not seek out opportunities to overturn precedent or \ndecide cases in accord with his private beliefs rather than his \nobligations as a judge. I also sincerely hope that Mr. Filip will treat \nall those who appear before him with respect, and will not abuse the \npower and trust of his position. Sometimes, we take a risk allowing a \nnominee to be confirmed. This is, frankly, one of those times.\n   Unfortunately, the Senate has taken a risk and confirmed other \nnominees of this President who assured the committee that they would \nfollow precedent and would not be results-oriented. In their brief time \non the bench, they have already proven to be judicial activities eager \nto roll back individual rights and limit the authority of Congress to \nprotect civil rights. A number of President Bush's 30 circuit court \nnominees already confirmed by the Senate have written significant \nopinions that show their bias in favor of powerful business interests \nover individual Americans.\n   For example, Jeffrey Sutton was one of Bush's most controversial \nappellate court nominees to be confirmed. At the time of his \nnomination, his record raised serious concerns. He had aggressively \npursued a national role as the leading advocate of States' rights and \npushed extreme positions in order to limit the ability of Congress to \nact to prevent discrimination and protect civil rights. His answers to \nquestions posed by Judiciary Committee members did not show that he \nwould be able to put aside his years of passionate advocacy in favor of \nStates' rights and against civil rights. After a lengthy floor debate, \nhe was confirmed by a vote of 52-41, which was the fewest votes in \nfavor of any judicial nominee in the last 20 years and more than enough \nnegative votes to have sustained a filibuster.\n   In less than 1 year on the bench, he has already issued a dissenting \nopinion essentially in favor of States' rights and that would have \nlimited Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. In this case, \ndecided in December, the question was whether a core function of \nmunicipal government--the provision of firefighting services--impacts \ninterstate commerce such that an individual can be indicted under a \nFederal antiarson statute for destroying a fire station. The majority \nSixth Circuit panel held that the fire station was used in an activity \naffecting interstate commerce, relying on the express language of the \nstatute.\n   Judge Sutton's dissent is a remarkable opinion whose beginning \nevidences that he has turned his passionate advocacy into judicial \nactivism. His opinion begins, ``Some say the world will end in fire, \nSome say in ice.'' Judge Sutton concludes that the Federal arson law \nonly applies to buildings with an ``active employment for commercial \npurposes,'' thereby seeking to narrow the law significantly. His \nopinion forcefully states that to ``conclude otherwise is to embrace \nthe view that even the most attenuated connections to commerce will \nsuffice in prosecuting individuals under this statute.'' In Judge \nSutton's view, arson is a local crime and the ``National Legislature'' \nhad not clearly conveyed its purpose to regulate an area traditionally \nregulated by the States.\n  Ironically, his dissent cautions that ``Federal courts should not \ncasually read a statute in a way that alters the Federal-State \nbalance.'' However, he himself ignores the plain language of the statue \nand legislative history in his attempts to do just that--to alter the \nbalance in a way that favors his own personal and ideological view of \nStates' rights.\n  John Roberts is a second controversial nominee who, in his few months \non the bench, has already displayed a preference for pursuing political \nand ideological goals above following precedent. Judge Roberts recently \nissued a troubling dissent from a decision by the full D.C. Circuit \nthat would have indulged another request by the Bush administration to \nkeep secret the records of Vice President Cheney's energy task force.\n  The case was part of a continuing effort on behalf of the Vice \nPresident to avoid compliance with numerous court orders requiring him \nto provide records of his meetings with the National Energy Policy \nDevelopment Group. Two nonprofit organizations brought litigation \nclaiming that the Vice President's task force had violated Federal law \nby not making its records public. In order to maintain the secrecy of \nthese records, the Vice President had filed an emergency petition for a \nremedy that the majority noted ``is a drastic one, to be invoked only \nin extraordinary situations.'' The majority in the case stated that, \nwere they to accept the Vice President's arguments, they would in \neffect ``have transformed executive privilege from a doctrine designed \nto protect Presidential communications into virtual immunity from \nsuit'' and noted that ``the President is not `above the law,' he is \nsubject to judicial process.''\n  The full D.C. Court of Appeals denied Vice President Cheney's \npetition for rehearing en banc. Judge Roberts dissented. He would have \nindulged the Vice President's desperate attempts to avoid compliance \nwith court orders by granting a motion for rehearing, despite the fact \nthat the D.C. Circuit's five judge majority was the fourth panel of \njudges to hold that these records must be made available.\n  A third example of a recently confirmed Bush nominee who has \ncontinued to pursue his ideological and political agenda on the bench--\nas many of us feared at the time of his nonimation--is Judge Dennis \nShedd. Judge Shedd wrote the opinion in a ruling so hostile to \norganized labor that one of the most conservative judges on that court \nharshly stated that Shedd's opinion ``overstepped [the] boundaries of a \nreviewing court.''\n  In this case, the National Labor Relations Board and an \nadministrative law judge found that an employer had unlawfully \nsolicited nine of its employees to sign antiunion statements and had \nunlawfully withdrawn recognition of the union. Judge Shedd ignored the \napplicable standard of review and asserted his own view of the facts to \nconclude that the NLRB had erred in its determination. Approaching the \ncase from a position hostile to organized labor, Judge Shedd \n``reconstructed'' the facts of the case, and allowed an employer, who \nhad previously been found to have used illegal tactics in order to \ndecertify a union, to escape any responsibility. Judge Wilkinson's \nstrong dissent highlighted the expertise of the NLRB in examining an \nemployer's conduct and that the reviewing court's role was limited to \ndetermining whether the NLRB had taken a permissible view of the \nevidence.\n\n  In other cases, as many of us had feared, President Bush's circuit \ncourt nominees are already handing down decisions to roll back \nindividual rights, civil rights and Congress' authority. Among these \nare:\n  A majority opinion by Judge Gibbons, on the Sixth Circuit, which \nfails to provide accommodation to a person with multiple sclerosis \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n  A dissent by Judge Shedd in a bankruptcy case, which would have led \nto foreclosure on a family farm--a decision which the majority said \n``misses the mark''; and\n  A dissent by Judge Rogers in a Title VII case involving illegal \nretaliation against an African-American employee which would have made \nit difficult for any employee to present their retaliation claims to a \njury.\n  The President has claimed time and again that he seeks only to fill \nthe bench with judges who will follow the rule of law. He claims that \nhe ``has no litmus test'' for determining who will\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nand will not be appointed--that he makes his decisions based on the \nqualifications of the candidates. Despite these statements, the \nPresident's nominees seem to have certain striking similarities. They \nseem to favor powerful interests over individuals. They favor States' \nrights over civil rights. And many of them are all loyal Federalist \nSociety members and committed to the political agenda of the most \nconservative wing of the Republican Party. The Senate's constitutional \nduty to provide advice and consent on judicial nominations is vital in \nthese circumstances--Federal judges must be devoted first and foremost, \nnot to a political platform or certain parties, but to the rule of law, \nthe Constitution, and the basic principles of fairness and justice.\n  If we are to allow the President to pack the courts with political \nparty loyalists and radical right-wing ideologues, we will cease to \nhave a Government of laws and will end up with a Government controlled \nby the views of a few. We would risk having a judiciary that functions \nas a rubber stamp for any right wing argument, policy, or political \ngoal sought to be achieved via the courts.\n  Yet, despite the troubling records of so many of Bush's confirmed \njudges and the other disappointing developments this year, Senate \nDemocrats have confirmed vast members of nominees who have come to the \nSenate floor and are today again making sure that the process of \njudicial appointments moves forward. Democrats have not obstructed the \nconfirmation process for judicial and executive branch nominations as \nRepublicans did when President Clinton was in office. Today, we proceed \nto confirm a judicial nominee in spite of the President's recent \nactions, those of Senate Republicans, and serious reservations about \nthis nominee.\n  Mr. Filip's nomination was reported favorably to the Senate last \nOctober. Had the Republican leadership wanted to proceed on it, this \nnomination could easily have been confirmed in October, November, or \nDecember last year before the Senate adjourned. Instead, partisans \nchose to devote 40 hours to a talkathon on the President's most \ncontroversial and divisive nominees rather than proceed to vote on \nthose judicial nominees with the support of the Senate. The delay in \nconsidering this nomination is the responsibility of the Republican \nleadership.\n  I congratulate Mark Filip and his family on his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Mark R. Filip, of Illinois, to be a U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I withdraw amendment 2265.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2267\n\n    (Purpose: To exempt certain agricultural producers from certain \n            hazardous materials transportation requirements)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, prior to the vote I indicated I had an \namendment. I want to begin the discussion very briefly of the \namendment. The amendment is one I have worked on for some while. It \ndeals with a relatively small issue with respect to the context of this \nbill, but a rather large issue for family farmers. Let me describe what \nit is.\n  There was a justifiable effort to address issues dealing with \nhomeland security by the Department of Transportation. They issued \nregulations that would regulate the shipment and transport of hazardous \nmaterial in commerce in amounts that require the shipment to be \nplacarded and also to implement security plans for that shipment.\n  The difficulty and the problem is this. The way the Department of \nTransportation developed this rule, the rule will apply to family \nfarmers, for example, who have a 120-gallon fuel service tank in the \nback of their pickup truck. Those farmers are not going to have a \nsecurity plan for that pickup truck and for that service tank.\n  It is perfectly logical to want to regulate for safety purposes the \nshipment of hazardous materials.\n  Let me give you an example of where this goes when the definitions \nare not carefully crafted. I was a senior in high school when myself \nand two of my best friends decided to go to the Black Hills of South \nDakota for a weekend. It was a pretty big deal for us. We took a pickup \ntruck and we had a 120-gallon service tank full of gasoline. We had a \nfew dollars, and we bought 120 gallons of gasoline and a relatively new \npickup, for three seniors in high school. We were prepared to have a \npretty good time. If that happened today, we would under the current \nrules be required to have a security plan in place prior to taking our \npickup truck and 120 gallons of regular gasoline on our trip to the \nBlack Hills of South Dakota. Three high school seniors are not going to \nhave a security plan to get enough gasoline to go to the Black Hills \nand have a good time. Why would we need a security plan? Because \nanything over 110 gallons of fuel, propane, chemicals, or hazardous \nmaterials will be required to have a security plan. Forget about three \nseniors who went to the Black Hills.\n  How about a farmer who has that 120-gallon service tank in the back \nof his pickup truck who stops at a local cafe and goes in to buy a \ncheeseburger? He is in violation of this rule by the Department of \nTransportation unless he can physically see his pickup truck through \nthe window because he will be required to have a ``security plan'' and \nhave a placard.\n  Again, when I was a young boy, my dad sent me to Dickinson, ND to get \n5\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nor 6 30-gallon drums of spray pesticides and herbicides. It is done all \nthe time. That would, of course, violate the rule these days unless I \nhad a security plan for my trip to Dickinson to pick up 4 or 5 30-\ngallon drums of chemicals to spray on the crops in the field near \nRegent, ND.\n  That is what this rule now would provide. It is a bad rule. It does \nnot mean, in my judgment, to include family farmers. It doesn't mean to \nput them in handcuffs with respect to the way they handle chemicals and \npropane and gasoline. But in fact it does. I don't want farmers to be \nin violation of the rule or in violation of the law. I don't think the \nDepartment of Transportation or the Congress, in implementing this \nrule, anticipated this kind of burden with respect to family farms.\n  In fact, the University of Illinois Extension Service put out an \nextension agriculture update. Let me describe what it says. It states \nthe rule by DOT says persons, including farmers, who ship or transport \nhazardous materials in commerce in amounts that require the shipment to \nbe placarded, must develop and implement security plans by September \n25, 2003. Examples of materials to which the security plan apply \ninclude explosives such as dynamite, detonators, pesticides, \nfertilizer, hydrous ammonia, ammonia nitrate, and fuels such as \ngasoline and propane. If you ship or transport fertilizers, pesticides, \ngasoline, propane and packages or containers that are larger than 119 \ngallons, or the total quantity you ship or transport at any one time is \nmore than 1,000 pounds, then you must have a security plan. If you are \na supplier who delivers the pesticides, fertilizers, and fuels you use \nto your farm, then you don't need that security plan. And if you only \ntransport fertilizers, pesticides, and fuels between the fields of \nyour farm, then you don't need to have a security plan. But if you \ndrive to town to get the chemicals, fertilizers, or fuel, then you have \nto have a security plan.\n\n  Incidentally, the text I have just read from is part of a U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation fact sheet, and it was entitled \n``Hazardous Materials Transportation Security Requirements, \nApplicability to Farmers and Farming Operations.'' That was available \nfrom the Department of Transportation's Web site earlier this fall. But \nit now has been removed. It is gone. You now can't find it. If you ask \nwhere did this come from, what happened to it, why is it gone, I don't \nhave the foggiest idea. All I know is what it said, and it doesn't say \nit anymore. Now we are told the Department of Transportation is putting \nthis security plan on hold despite the fact it is the rule, and they \nare now beginning to discuss the issue with the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. They are discussing it with State departments of \ntransportation, and the American Farm Bureau.\n  That is also in the piece of information from the University of \nIllinois Extension Service.\n  First of all, when the Department of Transportation does a rule, you \nwould expect they would do it right side up. You do the consultation \nfirst. Then you develop the rule having knowledge of how people react \nto it and what their notion is of how it should work and how it would \napply. In this case, apparently they wrote a rule dealing with \nhazardous material transportation, including basic fuels and chemicals, \nand now are beginning to consult with others about how this would \nimpact family farmers.\n  I am offering an amendment that clarifies using the definition of \nfamily farmers in the farm bill, and that this does not apply to family \nfarmers in the routine business of family farming. Somebody with a \npickup truck and a service tank in the back full of gasoline that is \nmoving around is not going to have to have a security plan to do that. \nSomeone who is hauling a few 30-gallon drums of chemicals from the shop \nin town out to their farm doesn't need a security plan to do that. If \nwe are going to have every family farm developing security plans, who \nis going to enforce that? Who is going to inspect it? Who is going to \ndetermine whether it meets DOT inspections and requirements and \nspecifications?\n  I just think this is a circumstance where it is a template that is \nput over everything that doesn't fit at all for family farmers. Family \nfarmers do a pretty good job out on the farm. They work hard and try \nhard. They are the Americans who live with hope. They put a seed in the \nground and they hope. They hope it rains, they hope it grows, they hope \nit doesn't hail, and they hope the insects don't come. They hope they \ndon't get drought or too much moisture, and they hope, finally, if they \nare able to get it harvested they can haul it to the elevator and get a \ndecent price. They don't ask for a lot. They certainly ask us to stay \nout of their way with respect to rules and regulations that don't make \nbasic common sense and that do not meet the test of common sense.\n  This attempt by the Department of Transportation, laudable as it \nmight be, to try to require the development of security plans for the \nmovement of large quantities of hazardous material--certainly dynamite, \ndetonators, and so on, I understand that. But when you talk about \ngasoline and farm chemicals, we must understand there is a difference \nbetween substantial movement from commercial operators and the ordinary \ntransportation of farm chemicals and farm fuel by family farmers around \nthis country.\n\n  For that reason, I have offered an amendment that I hope will meet \nthe test of changing this regulation in a manner that represents some \nbasic common sense and relieve the burden from family farmers. As a \nmatter of fact, family farmers are not complying with this. They really \neffectively cannot comply with it. The Department of Transportation has \nindicated to some that they would probably not enforce it. You have the \nAgriculture Extension Service telling farmers, here is what you have to \ndo to comply with the rule that is virtually unenforceable and really \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  When we see things here that do not meet a test of common sense, what \nwe ought to do is legislate and change it. That is what I propose to do \nwith respect to the hazardous materials transportation requirements.\n  Let me again say I believe there is a requirement for us to be \nconcerned about the movement of hazardous materials in our country. I \nfully support the Department of Transportation. They have a difficult \nand vexing job to try to respond to all of these things. But this \nparticular rule does not meet the requirements, and does not meet the \ntest of common sense dealing with family farmers.\n  I have not yet offered the amendment. I would like to send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2267.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 880, after the item following line 6, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1621. EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS \n                   TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Eligible Person.--In this section, the \n     term ``eligible person'' means an individual or entity that \n     is eligible to receive benefits in accordance with section \n     1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308-3a).\n       (b) Exemption.--Subject to subsection (c), part 172 of \n     title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, shall not apply to an \n     eligible person that transports or offers for transport a \n     fertilizer, pesticide, or fuel for agricultural purposes, to \n     the extent determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Applicability.--Subsection (b) applies to--\n       (1) security plan requirements under subpart I of part 172 \n     of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor \n     regulation); and\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have described the amendment in some \ndetail. I say to my colleague from Oklahoma I would be happy if he \nwould like to have the amendment approved now. But, if not, if there \nare some issues with respect to language or some discussions we should \nhave with you and your staff about the breadth of this, I would be \nhappy to do that as well. This bill will be on the floor for a number \nof days. I am only anxious to make certain we dispose of this and \napprove it before we complete this bill. My attempt is, of course, to \ncooperate with those who are managing the bill.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. It is \nprobably a good idea to set it aside at this time. We will have ample \ntime later to discuss it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection to it being set aside when others \nwish to offer amendments. I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is the objection to? There is no unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't believe there was a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no unanimous consent request \npropounded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So there can be no objection to a unanimous consent \nrequest never made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was under the impression there was a unanimous consent \nrequest to set the amendment aside. I take it that did not occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request was not propounded. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota indicated he would not object if such a request were \nmade.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then obviously I do not object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, that is not set aside by unanimous \nconsent.\n  There may be others in the Chamber who want to be heard concerning \nthe highway bill. If that is not the case, I will go ahead and continue \ndiscussing this. It is our hope to go through it section by section. We \nare quite a ways along in doing that.\n  First, I will restate some of the comments I made in the past about \nthis bill. We have spent in the committee an entire year working on \nthis legislation. We have had numerous hearings on various \nenvironmental concerns, procedural concerns. We had State \nrepresentation at hearings about many of the parts of the bill that \nwill end up giving the States more responsibility to take care of some \nof their needs. We had a chance to talk about some of the problems \nvoiced in the Senate.\n  As far as the position of the administration, I do not know what more \nwe can do. We have gone through the objections they had, or the three \nstatements they made, in terms of finding it not to be acceptable. \nThese have been met.\n  We have serious infrastructure needs now. The State system is 50 \nyears old; 32 percent of our major roads are in poor or remedial \ncondition; 29 percent of the bridges are structurally deficient. I am \nmore emotional regarding the 29 percent bridge figure because Oklahoma \nranks No. 1. Missouri is No. 2 in percentage of bridges that are \nstructurally deficient.\n  We have 36 percent of the Nation's urban rail vehicles and \nmaintenance facilities in substandard or poor condition. And 29 percent \nof the Nation's bus fleet and maintenance facilities are in substandard \ncondition. The list goes on.\n  I am particularly sensitive to this, having served for 8 years in the \nother body on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where we \ntalked about this and watched this as the reauthorizations took place. \nI participated in both ISTEA and in TEA-21, in both cases, serving at \nthat time in the other body.\n\n  I know the way things were done were a little distasteful for me, but \nwe came up with three authorization bills. It is our hope to be \ndeliberate and spend, as we have, a year in looking at all the \nproblems, seeing what would be better than the system used before.\n  In the past, we had section 1104, minimum guarantees. That has been \nreplaced by the Equity Bonus Program. The minimum guarantees were \narbitrary, politically driven percentages each State had. It was the \nthought that when you get to the point where you have enough votes to \npass it, you did not care. We did not want to do that. So we took into \nconsideration the donor status of States, we took into consideration \nthe rapid growing States, States such as Texas, California, Nevada, and \nFlorida, and we actually have ceilings as well as floors to try to \nsatisfy as many people as possible.\n  Yesterday, we had a number of people come to the floor saying the \nformula was unfair. We took each State, State by State, which I am \nhappy to do. We have the capability of doing it, again, to show that it \nis not unfair. We have a formula now and everyone benefits. There is no \nState that gets less than 10 percent more than they had before and it \ntakes care of the problems.\n  The donor States have always been a problem. My State has been a \ndonor State since the program began. So the fact that we will all end \nup with a 95-percent status is very significant.\n  We have never adequately handled the safety problems. We know about \nthe deaths on the highway: 43,000 people each year dying on the \nhighway. While the percentage has not gone up, the numbers have. We are \naddressing that.\n  The intermodal connections and freight movement were never adequately \naddressed by the previous bills. These are addressed.\n  Streamlining, so that many of the problems we have--some \nenvironmental, some other types of problems--can be dealt with more \nrapidly and in advance so we can keep the construction going.\n  We have the IPAM program that will take these programs that are ready \nto go and get them moving right away. If we are going to do it, do it \nnow and get the people employed. A lot of people are concerned about \njobs. Certainly there is no bigger job anywhere.\n  It has been a long process. I know some Members just do not want a \nbill, but we will get through the process. We will get a bill and get \npeople back to work and rebuild the infrastructure.\n  We left off on section 1612. I will handle a couple of sections. The \nSenator from Missouri will arrive in about 5 minutes with some subjects \nto address.\n  Section 1613 is the improved interagency consultation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator mind, after he finishes his statement, \nthat I be allowed to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Anyone who wants to speak so long as it is on the highway \nbill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that after the completion of the \nstatement of the Senator from Oklahoma, I have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have completed my remarks and there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2268 To Amendment No. 2267\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send an amendment to the desk which second degrees the \namendment of Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2268 to amendment No. 2267.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\n     of local communities, the health and well-being of public \n     safety officers, and the morale of the fire and police \n     departments. Additionally these factors could have \n     significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing \n     minimal standards for collective bargaining negotiations in \n     the public safety sector can prevent industrial strife \n     between labor and management that interferes with the normal \n     flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS AND AGREEMENTS.\n\n       A certification, recognition, election-held, collective \n     bargaining agreement or memorandum of understanding which has \n     been issued, approved, or ratified by any public employee \n     relations board or commission or by any State or political \n     subdivision or its agents (management officials) in effect on \n     the day before the date of enactment of this Act shall not be \n     invalidated by the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 8. CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n       (1) to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and \n     procedures of any law of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State or jurisdiction that provides collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal \n     to or greater than the rights provided under this Act;\n       (2) to prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law \n     that prohibits employers and labor organizations from \n     negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require \n     union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of \n     employment;\n       (3) to invalidate any State law in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act that substantially provides for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in section 4(b) solely \n     because such State law permits an employee to appear on his \n     or her own behalf with respect to his or her employment \n     relations with the public safety agency involved; or\n       (4) to permit parties subject to the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and the regulations \n     under such Act to negotiate provisions that would prohibit an \n     employee from engaging in part-time employment or volunteer \n     activities during off-duty hours; or\n       (5) to prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under \n     this Act a political subdivision of the State that has a \n     population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 \n     full time employees.\n       For purposes of paragraph (5), the term ``employee'' \n     includes each and every individual employed by the political \n     subdivision except any individual elected by popular vote or \n     appointed to serve on a board or commission.\n       (b) Compliance.--No State shall preempt laws or ordinances \n     of any of its political subdivisions if such laws provide \n     collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that \n     are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This is the same amendment I offered before. Obviously, it \nwas removed from being in order because the underlying amendment was \nwithdrawn, so I have reoffered it to keep it in the batting order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was happy to do that. I will continue going through \nsection by section.\n  When we talk about improved interagency consultation, this is another \narea where this bill is different from the reauthorizations we had in \nthe past. We had intra-agency consultation as well as consultation at \nthe various levels of Government. The States have a much larger voice \nin the recognition that they are more aware of the problems that exist \nthan we are in Washington. It is very positive. Therefore, the States \nand MPOs are encouraged to consult with State and local air quality \nagencies in developing criteria from CMAQ projects and when making \ndecisions as to which projects and programs to fund.\n  Section 1614 is the evaluation assessment of the CMAQ projects. To \nensure that information on successful CMAQ projects is widely \navailable, the Department of Transportation is directed to consult with \nthe EPA to evaluate and assess a representative sample of CMAQ projects \nto maintain and disseminate a database of these projects.\n  Section 1615 is synchronized planning and conformity timelines, \nrequirements, and horizon. Currently, the schedules for demonstrating \nconformity are not the same as the schedules for adopting long-range \ntransportation plans and transportation improvement programs. That is \nTIPS. This disconnect has caused some areas to be in a continuous \nplanning and conformity cycle.\n  In response to this inconsistency, the bill aligns the long-range \nplan updates, TIP updates, and conformity determinations for \nmetropolitan areas on consistent 4-year cycles. Heretofore, there were \nvarious cycles and this conforms them to each other.\n  The bill also changes how far into the future the conformity \ndetermination must look to more closely match the length of time \ncovered by the State's air quality plan referred to as a State \nimplementation plan, or SIP plan.\n  Currently, conformity determinations take a 20-year outlook on the \ntransportation planning side, even though most SIPs cover no more than \n10 years. Obviously, we are trying to conform them with each other.\n  Section 1616 is in regard to the transition to new air quality \nstandards. EPA plans to designate nonattainment areas for the new 8-\nhour ozone standard, that we have gone through just a few years ago, \nand the new fine particulate standard, at PM2.5, this year. Areas that \nhave not previously been designated as nonattainment for the same \npollutant will have 3 years to submit SIPs which include the motor \nvehicle emissions budget used to determine conformity. However, only a \n1-year grace period is allowed before having to demonstrate conformity. \nBecause of this, an area may have 2 years during which it must use some \nother means of demonstrating conformity.\n  Nonattainment areas are given the option of using the motor vehicle \nemissions budget from an approved SIP for the most recent prior \nstandard for that pollutant. For example, an area that is in \nnonattainment for the 1-hour ozone standard and is designated as being \nin nonattainment for the new 8-hour ozone standard may use its 1-hour \nbudget to determine conformity until it has an approved budget for the \n8-hour standard.\n  Nonattainment areas are also given the option of using other \ncurrently available tests for demonstrating conformity without an \napproved air quality SIP.\n  Section 1617 is in regard to reduced barriers to air quality \nimprovements. Nonattainment areas can use transportation control \nmeasures, such as HOV lanes, transit projects, park-and-ride lots, \nride-share programs, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities to improve \nair quality. These TCMs are often included in the State's air quality \nSIP. Currently, if a State determines it would be better served by \nsubstituting one type of TCM for another, the State must already have a \nsubstitution mechanism in its approved State implementation plan or it \nmust revise its plan.\n  This bill provides a substitution mechanism for all States, provided \nthat the TCM to be substituted achieves the same or greater emission \nreductions as the TCM being replaced, based on analysis using the \nlatest planning assumptions and current models.\n  Now, it has been our intention, as we announced before, that the \nchairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Bond, would be \nrecognized at this time for the purpose of----\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Gregg \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma does have the floor. \nI apologize.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Section 1618 is in regard to the air quality monitoring data \ninfluenced by exceptional events.\n  This bill directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing the \nhandling of air quality-monitoring data influenced by exceptional \nevents, such as forest fires or volcanic eruptions, certainly something \nof great interest to the Senator from Arizona. These types of natural \nactivities should not influence whether a region is meeting its Federal \nair quality goals.\n  The EPA is also required to reevaluate its approach to modeling \ncarbon monoxide emissions from motor vehicles to ensure that it is \nappropriate for cold-weather States, such as Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S575-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S575-S576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, I join my friend from Wisconsin on the \nfloor to discuss the entire issue of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nand also at a time when the Federal Election Commission is about to \nmake some decisions regarding implementation of this legislation.\n  I think it is very important that as the Federal Election Commission \nis considering making these rules, that it be made very clear what the \nintent of the authors of the legislation was. Because as I will go into \nin my statement, it was the Federal Election Commission that created \nthe loopholes that caused the explosion of soft money in American \npolitics. It was not court decisions.\n  It is not accidental that the Senator from Wisconsin and I have \nproposed legislation to fundamentally restructure the Federal Election \nCommission. In the meantime, the Federal Election Commission must \nunderstand and read the U.S. Supreme Court decision--I quote from the \nCourt's ruling--stating:\n\n       The main goal of [the national party soft money ban] is \n     modest. In large part, it simply effects a return to the \n     scheme that was approved in Buckley and that was subverted--\n\n  Madam President, the words the U.S. Supreme Court used:\n\n     subverted by the federal electioneering efforts with a \n     combination of hard and soft money. . . . Under that \n     allocation regime--\n\n  That was a decision by the Federal Election Commission--\n\n     national parties were able to use vast amounts of soft money \n     in their efforts to elect federal candidates.\n\n  Now, I hope the Federal Election Commission gets our message. We do \nnot, and will not, stand for the creation of new loopholes to violate \nthis law.\n  Senator Feingold and I began, in 1995, with our first effort to \nreform this system. It took us 8 years until the final decision by the \nU.S. Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality, in a historically \nironic decision entitled McConnell v. FEC. I hope the irony of those \nwords is not lost on my colleagues. We will not stand for the Federal \nElection Commission--which they already have--subverting this law. We \nwill not stand for it. We will use every method available to us to be \nsure that the law is enforced as it is written and intended and \ndeclared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is time for the Federal Election Commission, rather than being an \nenabler to those who want to subvert the laws, to be a true enforcer of \nthe law, a role which they will find strange and intriguing and \ncertainly unusual for that Commission.\n  I might add, too, we still have two members of the Federal Election \nCommission who declared their firm conviction that this law was \nunconstitutional. If they still hold that belief, as at least one of \nthem has stated recently, they should recuse themselves from further \ninvolvement in a law they believe is unconstitutional. In fact, \nresignation would probably be in order so someone who believes in the \nconstitutionality of this law, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, \nwould be empowered to enforce it.\n\n  In 1995, my dear friend Senator Feingold and I first introduced \nlegislation designed to limit the influence of special interests on \nFederal campaigns. We began our fight because it had become clear to us \nthat our campaign finance system was broken and this breakdown was \nhaving a detrimental effect on our democracy. Seven years, four \nCongresses, several rewrites, countless hours of debate, amendments, \nand much hard work by dedicated grassroots activists later, the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act became law on March 27, 2002.\n  I know my friend from Wisconsin agrees with me. We could not have \ndone it without the thousands of Americans who made our cause their \ncause. We could never have achieved this goal. They will have our \nundying gratitude.\n  Last month, following an illegal challenge, the Supreme Court ended \nthe 7-year-long battle when it upheld the act, or BCRA, in the case of \nMcConnell v. FEC. For me it was one of the Court's most needed and \nwelcomed opinions. In light of this landmark victory, I want to \ncongratulate those who worked so hard to secure it and to talk about \nthe work that remains to be done to strengthen our democracy and to \nempower all Americans through civic participation.\n  We can already see some benefits from these years of hard work. No \nlonger can a Member of Congress call the CEO of a corporation or the \nhead of a labor union or a trial lawyer and ask them for a huge soft \nmoney donation in exchange for access to high-level Government \nofficials. That cannot happen today. Just last week, Roll Call reported \nthat for the first time in many years, the two parties did not hold any \nhigh-donor fundraisers at the Super Bowl. The article stated:\n\n       With soft money banned, the parties have come to the \n     conclusion that the yield at a Super Bowl fundraiser doesn't \n     justify the expense.\n\n  However, let me be clear, this in no way means reform is complete. \nOur work and the work of thousands of Americans engaged at the \ngrassroots level, the efforts of numerous reform groups, is far from \nover. While the basis for BCRA, that large, unregulated political \ncontributions cause both the appearance and reality of corruption by \nelected officials, is self-evident, mustering the evidence needed to \nprove this to the Court was an extraordinary feat. The mountain of \nevidence that was compiled, however, provided a solid foundation for \nthe Supreme Court's decision to close loopholes through which were \nflowing hundreds of millions of dollars in soft money.\n  The evidence collected included sworn statements from elected \nofficials acknowledging they had been forced to raise large \ncontributions for the political parties, internal memos from political \nparty leaders to elected officials reminding them who gave big \ncontributions prior to key votes, and testimony from business leaders \nwho were provided a ``menu of access'' by party officials showing how \n$50,000 gets you a meeting with an elected official, $100,000 gets you \na 15-minute meeting with another elected official.\n  The strength of the evidence on the extent of corruption and the \nappearance of corruption as well as the creativity with which the \ncampaign finance laws were being evaded led the Supreme Court to uphold \nBCRA, which sought to close the loopholes that had been opened in the \nFederal Election Campaign Act.\n\n  Significantly, the evidence also led the Supreme Court to find that \nCongress needed and possessed broad authority to enact laws to reduce \nthe corrupting influence of unregulated money in politics. The Court \nalso made a powerful statement about the so-called regulators of the \ncorrupting soft money system, the Federal Election Commission. \nAccording to the Court, the soft money system was the result of a \nseries of loopholes opened by the FEC and exploited by the party \ncommittees. I also quoted what Justices Stevens and O'Connor wrote.\n  While the Supreme Court in the McConnell case recognized the role the \nFEC had played over the years in eroding the campaign finance laws, it \nwas not asked to consider the rules the commission adopted just last \nyear to implement BCRA--rules that, true to the FEC's history, \nundermined the integrity of campaign finance law. The\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\nCourt, however, may soon be asked to do this. Shortly after the FEC \ntook a big bite out of BCRA through its rulemaking process, \nRepresentatives Shays and Meehan filed a lawsuit challenging the \nregulations. This action is on a fast track in Federal District Court.\n  Since its inception, BCRA has been reviled by the political party \nestablishments that decried the eminent demise of our two-party system. \nYet in the midst of a hotly contested Presidential campaign, evidence \nsuggests the opposite is true. Under BCRA, both the Democratic and \nRepublican national parties are reporting a resurgence of grassroots \nsupport and significant increases in new hard money donors. In fact, \nrecent figures show there have been 600,000 new hard money donors to \nthe Democratic Party and 1 million new Republican hard money donors. \nThat is what we intended.\n  The Court was right to uphold the new reform law. Implemented \ncorrectly, it will go a long way to restoring people's faith in our \ndemocratic system. That said, reform is not a one-time fight. We must \ncontinue the work to strengthen our democracy and reconnect the people \nto the political process. The adoption and Court sanction of BCRA \nenables Congress to push forward with important reforms that help \nimprove our system of Government and reduce barriers to political \nparticipation.\n  It is critical that we ensure BCRA is not negated by widespread \ncircumvention of the new law by the FEC and by outside political \ncommittees. While we are challenging FEC's implementing regulations, we \nmust also act to restructure the commission so it will not only \nimplement campaign finance laws effectively but actively enforce them.\n  The American political system needs an agency that will give effect \nto our campaign laws fairly and free from the partisan influence that \ncurrently dominates the commission structure. Without this key reform, \nno campaign finance reform law can work well.\n  We must fix the ailing Presidential public funding system. For many \nyears, the system gave Americans a viable opportunity to run for our \nhighest office and increased competition in our Presidential elections, \nbut the system is now outdated and bankrupt. Senator Feingold and I \nhave introduced a proposal to fix it, and we are committed to educating \nthe public about the importance of doing this and to building the \ncoalition needed to make it happen.\n\n  Ongoing reform efforts are needed not only at the Federal level but \nalso at the State level. Working at the State level, we can help to \nrestore faith in the political process by improving contribution \ndisclosure laws, promoting clean election programs, and encouraging an \nindependent and noncorrupt campaign finance system.\n  To break down the barriers to political participation, we must \nimprove ballot access, promote open primaries, and fix the \nredistricting process.\n  This is not a partisan issue. It should not advantage one party over \nthe other. What reform does is create transparency, equality, and \nparticipation, and inspire confidence in those we represent. The \nstrength and real muscle in this fight lies with the American people. \nDuring the long battle in the Senate to pass campaign finance reform, \nwe called on the American public to make their voices heard on Capitol \nHill. They answered, and the impact was astounding. The phone calls, e-\nmails, and letters that flooded into Members' offices had a tremendous \nimpact. Constituent communications translated into votes for reform.\n  Reform is an ongoing process. It didn't end with Teddy Roosevelt in \n1907, and it will not end with John McCain and Russ Feingold in the \nSenate. I am very much a realist. From the beginning of this fight, I \nhave said that as soon as the soft money loopholes addressed in BCRA \nwere closed, there would be very smart people all over Washington \ntrying to find ways around the law. I am sad to report these folks \nwasted no time in attempting to circumvent it again.\n  The recent creation of certain new organizations under section 527 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code is the first broad-scale attempt to undermine \nBCRA.\n  Let me be clear on one thing. There are many legitimate 527 \norganizations whose method of operation is not in question here. They \nare nonpartisan. They work to do the things we want to further the \ngoals of democracy. There are, however, some groups that have recently \nbeen set up for the sole purpose of raising or spending tens of \nmillions of dollars in soft money to influence the 2004 Presidential \nand congressional elections.\n  Madam President, various groups have been created expressly to spend \nlarge sums of soft money on partisan voter mobilization drives and sham \n``issue advocacy'' to influence Federal elections. These groups have as \ntheir overriding, if not sole purpose, the influencing of Federal \nelections.\n  Federal election law requires such groups to register as political \ncommittees with the FEC. Federal political committees may only accept \nand spend hard money--that is, money limited in amount and source. I \nwill repeat that if a 527 is nonpartisan in nature, we have no problem. \nIf a 527 is engaged in partisan activity, they then fall under the same \nrestrictions that any other political committee does that is engaged in \npartisan activity. That should be obvious to the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  These new groups, however, which have made clear that their purpose \nis to influence Federal elections--they have not made any bones about \nit--have purportedly set up ``non-Federal'' accounts to accept \ncorporate and labor union funds and large contributions from \nindividuals. They plan to use these moneys, we are told, to finance \npartisan voter drives and run sham issue ads aimed at influencing the \n2004 Federal elections. This blatant end run around the campaign \nfinance laws should not be tolerated.\n  When a political committee has an overriding purpose to influence \nFederal elections, it cannot be allowed to circumvent campaign finance \nlaws by establishing a ``non-Federal account'' and claiming that the \nmoney being raised and spent to influence Federal elections is not for \nthat purpose. These committees cannot be permitted to transform \ncontributions that are clearly for the purpose of influencing Federal \nelections into ``allowable soft money'' simply by depositing those \nfunds into ``non-Federal accounts.'' These groups are clearly political \ncommittees that should be registered as such with the FEC and must \noperate accordingly within the hard money amount and source \nlimitations.\n  After the success of McConnell v. FEC, we cannot sit idly by and \nallow this potentially massive circumvention of campaign finance laws. \nBCRA finally closed soft money loopholes and, again, new ones should \nnot and cannot be tolerated. I am pleased to see that the FEC has \nrecognized the immediate need to examine these soft money problems. I \nhope the Commission will not make the mistakes it has made in the past \nand will act swiftly and comprehensively to protect the integrity of \nour campaign finance laws.\n  Madam President, I also wish to comment on one of the things that \nhappened. We have seen, in the last Presidential campaign, a dramatic \nreduction in negative campaign ads run by the various candidates. Why \nis that? It is because of an amendment that was added by the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, which \nwas called ``stand by your ad,'' I believe. Guess what. Every time \nthere is a message, the candidate says, I am so and so and I approve of \nthis ad. They would not approve a lot of the trash put in and negative \nattacks, which has one effect, we all know, and that is drive down \nvoter turnout. It has a very salutary effect.\n  I have to admit that I never thought of that in the 8 years Senator \nFeingold and I looked at every aspect of campaign finance reform; we \nhad not thought of that amendment. It has a marvelous positive affect, \nhaving the candidate say: I am so and so and I approve of this ad.\n  I also say there was a marvelous team that argued our case before the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I ask unanimous consent to have a list of names \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Lawrence H. Norton, Richard B. Bader, Stephen E. \n     Hershkowitz, David Kolker, Theodore B. Olson, Peter D. \n     Keisler, Paul D. Clement, Malcolm L.

Madam President, I particularly thank Mr. Ted Olson, the \nSolicitor General, who entered into this situation as one who did not \nagree with campaign finance reform and became a strong advocate. He \nmade compelling arguments to the U.S. Supreme Court. I also thank Seth \nWaxman and his team of lawyers, who did a marvelous job. There are so \nmany people and so many organizations that continue to work on our \nbehalf.\n  Finally, I wish to make two closing points. One, the Federal Election \nCommission cannot be allowed to undermine this law. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt is very clear about the role of the Federal Election Commission. \nSo we cannot let these 8 years of hard work--not because of Senator \nFeingold and me but because of the thousands and thousands of Americans \nwho worked so hard to clean up this system that has either corruption \nor the appearance of corruption associated with it.\n  Finally, one of the great pleasures of my life in public service is \nto have the opportunity to know and appreciate and have the undying and \neverlasting friendship of my dear friend from Wisconsin, who is one of \nthe most honest and decent Americans with whom I have ever had the \nprivilege of knowing and serving. I would be honored to serve with him \nunder any circumstance.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, let me say how fitting it is that the \nSenator from Maine is presiding at this point, who has made a \ntremendous contribution to our efforts on campaign finance reform. It \nis a tremendous privilege to come to the floor with my good friend and \nlongtime partner in campaign finance reform, the senior Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain. Everybody knows we fought side by side for nearly \n7 years to see our bill enacted into law.\n  Finally, on December 10, nearly 2 years after President Bush signed \nthe bill, the Supreme Court upheld our work against a constitutional \nchallenge. It has been a long and hard struggle, and, frankly, we could \nnot possibly be happier with the result. The Court's decision in \nMcConnell v. FEC is a complete vindication of our effort to help rid \npolitics of the corruption of soft money. We are very proud of and also \nhumbled by the Court's ruling.\n  We are not here to gloat. It is not polite or useful to do so. But if \nI had a dollar for every time someone said on this floor or in the \nmedia that our bill would never stand up in court, I would actually be \na wealthy man. Rather, we are here to thank our colleagues who joined \nwith us to pass this historic reform, to review the Supreme Court \nlandmark decision, and briefly take a look forward, as Senator McCain \nhas already done. As we often noted during the debate, the McCain-\nFeingold bill was not intended to be the last word on the topic of \ncampaign finance reform. The Court's decision will serve as a guidepost \nfor future reform initiatives.\n  First, I thank all of the Members of this body who worked so hard \nwith us to pass the bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  For many, this was a labor of love. For others, it was a difficult \nfight because of resistance from their own party or from political or \ncampaign advisers. In the end, as Senator McCain said it so well, this \nbill passed because the American people demanded it and because \ncourageous Senators and Members of the House were willing to stand up \nto the defenders of the status quo.\n  I particularly thank the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, and \nhis counterpart at the time in the House, Representative Dick Gephardt. \nTheir leadership and strong support made it possible to get the bill \nthrough all the complicated legislative obstacles we faced and onto the \nPresident's desk.\n  Also deserving of special thanks is the core bipartisan group of \nsupporters of reform who worked closely with us to pass the bill. \nSenators Levin, Collins, Lieberman, Thompson, Snowe, Schumer, Jeffords, \nCochran, Cantwell, Edwards, and Kerry all made major contributions to \nthe law that the Supreme Court upheld.\n  I think it is actually hard to imagine a more clear statement from \nthe Supreme Court than the one delivered in December in McConnell v. \nFEC. The margin of the Court was narrow, as it often is in complicated \nand highly contested cases. But the majority could not have been more \nemphatic that what we did in McCain-Feingold was a constitutional \napproach to the problems of soft money and also phony issue advocacy \nthat Congress identified and we tried to address.\n  I have to tell you, that was enormously gratifying after the hard \nwork we did in this body to pay attention to the Court's previous \ndecisions. It meant a great deal to me personally that we looked at \nwhat the Court had said about the first amendment of the Constitution \nand crafted our legislation with respect to that. That is exactly what \nwe did.\n  We drafted this bill specifically to be consistent with what the \nCourt had said in the past in analyzing the first amendment implication \nof campaign finance legislation. We worked hard to shape a legislative \nrecord demonstrating the need for the reforms we proposed.\n  In upholding the law, the Court recognized the difficult and \npainstaking work we did to stay within the constitutional framework set \nout in previous cases.\n  The Court said:\n\n       We are mindful that in its lengthy deliberations leading to \n     the enactment of BCRA, Congress properly relied on the \n     recognition of its authority contained in Buckley and its \n     progeny.\n\n  I was particularly pleased at the deference the Court showed to \ncongressional judgments about the problems with the system and the best \nway to address them. That deference has often been lacking in recent \nopinions in other areas, but this time the Court realized that Congress \nhas special expertise in this area and needs to have the authority to \nactually address real world problems in the way that it believes will \nbe most effective.\n  This is enormously important for the future of reform. It shows that \nthe Court understands that under our Constitution, Congress is not \npowerless to address threats to the health of our democratic or \npolitical processes.\n  In no way, of course, did the Court give to Congress unbridled power. \nIt simply upheld a reasonable and measured response to the soft money \nproblem that many on both sides of the aisle had come to believe was \nextremely harmful.\n  One aspect of the Court's opinion is worth noting as we look forward \nto future reform efforts. The Court laid responsibility for the soft \nmoney problem squarely where it belongs, and as Senator McCain just did \nagain--with the Federal Election Commission. As Senator McCain noted, \nthe Court specifically stated that the FEC ``subverted'' the law by \nallowing soft money to be used to aid Federal candidates.\n  The Court said:\n\n       [T]he FEC's allocation regime has invited widespread \n     circumvention of FECA's limits on contributions to parties \n     for the purpose of influencing Federal elections.\n\n  The Supreme Court agreed with us that soft money was a loophole that \nCongress could legitimately try to plug, and that the loophole was \nimproperly created by the FEC. With this validation of the position \ntaken by reformers for many years, the Court underlined a cautionary \nnote that we have sounded many times before on this floor. No law in \nthis area can be self-executing. To be successful, campaign finance \nreform must be implemented and enforced by an agency that is dedicated \nto carrying out the will of Congress, not to frustrate it.\n  The new law instructed--instructed--the FEC to act quickly to develop \nregulations to explain and implement BCRA. Time after time, instead the \nFEC adopted rules that weakened the law. Senator McCain and I \nparticipated in those rulemaking proceedings, but our advice on many \nimportant issues was ignored.\n  As currently structured, the FEC seems simply incapable of properly \napplying the law that this Congress enacted. Virtually every \ncomplicated\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nissue is approached from a political perspective, and the political \nparties have extraordinary sway over the Commission's actions.\n  Senator McCain and I viewed the BCRA rulemaking process as a test, if \nyou will, a final chance for the FEC to change its approach and to \nfinally begin to faithfully enforce the law in a nonpartisan fashion. \nWe were very disappointed in the result. We have, therefore, concluded \nthat the FEC, as currently constituted, cannot provide the strong and \nconsistent enforcement of the Federal election laws that this country \nneeds. So together we have proposed to replace the agency with a new \nbody, the Federal Election Administration.\n  We need to have an agency led by people who are respected by both \nsides of the aisle and will carry out their responsibilities in a \nnonpartisan manner rather than simply having representatives from each \nof the parties canceling each other out with a partisan approach to \ntheir jobs. Our bill makes individuals who have worked for or served as \ncounsel to parties or candidates ineligible to serve as administrators.\n  We have no illusions that this reform will be easy to pass. Those who \nopposed our bill will undoubtedly oppose replacing the agency that is \nresponsible for the rulings that made our bill necessary and that \ncontinue to undermine the new law. But reform of the FEC is essential \nif the will of Congress and BCRA is to be carried out.\n  I am also pleased to join Senator McCain in introducing a bill to \nreform the Presidential public funding system. That system did actually \nwork well for seven consecutive Presidential elections from 1976 to \n2000. In those elections, Republicans were elected four times and \nDemocrats three times and challengers actually defeated incumbents in \nthree out of the five races where an incumbent was a candidate.\n  This year, unfortunately, candidates from both parties have opted out \nof the public funding system for the primaries. Everyone knows the \nsystem needs to be updated to keep it functioning in future elections.\n  I happen to come from a State that had a very good public funding \nsystem for State elections for many years. In fact, I won my first race \nfor the Wisconsin Senate, frankly, only because of that system. But the \nlegislature in my State failed to update and revise that system to keep \npace with the changing realities and costs of political campaigns, and \nnow hardly anyone uses it. We can't let that happen to the Presidential \npublic funding system.\n  Again, when I look at the Presiding Officer, I know these kinds of \nsystems can work because they have made them work in her State of \nMaine. The bill we have introduced is a starting point only, much like \nthe first McCain-Feingold bill in 1995. We want to work with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to come up with a bill that this \nSenate can support to preserve the public funding system that has \nserved the country so well since the excesses of the Watergate era \ndemonstrated that private financing of Presidential elections is really \nnot a very good thing for our democracy.\n  I hope our colleagues will work with us over this year to perfect a \nbill that can be quickly passed in the next Congress after this \nPresidential election has been held.\n  Senator McCain and I have also introduced a bill to provide free air \ntime to congressional candidates. The cost of television advertising \nhas skyrocketed, and we believe the Nation's broadcasters, who make \ngreat profits from a public resource--the airwaves--should contribute \nto improving the democratic process. I look forward to continuing to \ndiscuss this bill with our colleagues as well.\n  We do not expect any one of these three major reform bills will be \nconsidered on the Senate floor this year. But there is one bill that \ncan and should be enacted very quickly. That is a bill we have \nintroduced to require electronic filing of Senate campaign finance \nreports. Right now, the Senate lags way behind the House in providing \ncurrent and complete disclosure of contributions to and expenditures on \nour campaigns. This is really an embarrassment. It is possible the \nRules Committee can quickly correct this problem, but if not, Senator \nMcCain and I have introduced a bill to bring the Senate into the 21st \ncentury, and we should enact it promptly.\n\n  Again, I thank all my colleagues who supported the McCain-Feingold \nbill. I hope they are as proud of their accomplishment as I am of them. \nI am convinced we have begun to change this system for the better. \nSenator McCain discussed there is already evidence of that. I think as \nthe 2004 campaign heats up, we will see plenty more examples of how the \nsystem has improved, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We saw what \nhappened when Congress essentially left the field for 20 years after \npassing the post-Watergate reforms. We must be vigilant to protect what \nwe did in BCRA, and we must look ahead and continue to fight for a \ncampaign finance system that enhances, rather than suffocates, the \npower of individual citizens and voters in our democracy.\n  Finally, I again express my admiration and appreciation for all \nSenator McCain has done on this issue. For one final time I thank him \nfor calling me in late 1994 and saying he wanted to work with me on \nthis project. Next time tell me it is going to take 8 years. I am more \nthan grateful for this terrific opportunity to not only work with a \ngreat American hero, but to have my name associated with him to the \npoint where Senator McCain has said that some people think my first \nname is McCain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S579-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S579-S581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CHURCHILL AND THE GREAT REPUBLIC EXHIBIT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I was privileged today to go to the \nLibrary of Congress where, under the auspices of Mr. Billington, the \nLibrarian of Congress, a very wonderful exhibit is opening entitled--\nand I hold up the volume: ``Churchill and the Great Republic.'' The \nexhibit formally opens tonight.\n  In attendance today were one of Churchill's daughters, his grandson, \nand other members of the Churchill family. It was a very moving \nexperience. I encourage my colleagues to find time in the next week or \n10 days to avail themselves of this very historical exhibit put \ntogether by Dr. Billington.\n  The ceremony today, marking the opening, was attended by the \nPresident of the United States, and I, together with my good friend \nSenator Lugar, Senator Bob Bennett, and a number of Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, were privileged to be in attendance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the full text of \nthe President's speech at this auspicious occasion be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think we are at a remarkable \ncrossroads of history. In terms of the survival of republics, this is \nabout the great republic, about freedom, and about all of those things \nwe hold very dear.\n  I do not intend to make a political speech, but I say without \nreservation I think President Bush has given remarkable leadership, \ncertainly in the aftermath of 9/11, an unprecedented attack on our \nsovereignty, the people of the United States of America, parallel in \nmany respects to Pearl Harbor but indeed more awesome than Pearl Harbor \nin some respects. We are fortunate to have at the helm in the United \nStates a strong President, a man of courage and of wisdom. I try in my \nmodest way to support his leadership and that of those he has selected \nas his principal team.\n  I found this speech very remarkable today, and I would like to read \njust a paragraph:\n\n       When World War II ended, Winston Churchill immediately \n     understood that the victory was incomplete. Half of Europe \n     was occupied by an aggressive empire. And one of Churchill's \n     own finest hours came after the war ended in a speech he \n     delivered in Fulton, Missouri. Churchill warned of the new \n     danger facing free peoples. In stark but measured tones, he \n     spoke of the need for free nations to unite against the \n     communist expansion. Marshal Stalin denounced the speech as a \n     ``call to war.'' A prominent American journalist called the \n     speech an ``almost catastrophic blunder.'' In fact, Churchill \n     had set a simple truth before the world: that tyranny would \n     not be ignored or appeased without great risk. And he boldly \n     asserted that freedom--freedom was the right of men and women \n     on both sides of the Iron Curtain.\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n       Churchill understood that the Cold War was not just a \n     standoff of armies, but a conflict of visions--a clear divide \n     between those who put their faith in ideologies of power, and \n     those who put their faith in the choices of free people. The \n     successors of Churchill and Roosevelt--leaders like Truman, \n     and Reagan and Thatcher--led a confident alliance that held \n     firm as communism collapsed under the weight of its own \n     contradictions.\n       Today, we are engaged in a different struggle. Instead of \n     an armed empire, we face stateless networks. Instead of \n     massed armies, we face deadly technologies that must be kept \n     out of the hands of terrorists and outlaw regimes.\n       Yet in some ways, our current struggles or challenges are \n     similar to those Churchill knew. The outcome of the war on \n     terror depends on our ability to see danger and to answer it \n     with strength and purpose. One by one, we are finding and \n     dealing with the terrorists, drawing tight what Winston \n     Churchill called a ``closing net of doom.'' This war also is \n     a conflict of visions. In their worship of power, their deep \n     hatreds, their blindness to innocence, the terrorists are \n     successors to the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. \n     And we are the heirs of the tradition of liberty, defenders \n     of the freedom, the conscience and the dignity of every \n     person. Others before us have shown bravery and moral clarity \n     in this cause. The same is now asked of us, and we accept the \n     responsibilities of history.\n\n  I find those words very moving, and with a deep sense of humility I \ncommend this President.\n  This is a picture of Churchill and Roosevelt. Years hence, there will \nbe a picture of President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. If I may say, \nagain with a sense of humility, historians will eventually parallel the \nChurchill-Roosevelt era with the Bush-Blair era, when two individuals \nof somewhat contradictory ideologies and, if we may say, party \nbackground, nevertheless came together in this hour in the aftermath of \n9/11 and formed an alliance, brought together other nations that valued \nfreedom, and formed a coalition that has now deposed a tyrant who, by \nany fair standards, was indeed a danger to the free world.\n  I say to the President with complete respect, I think historians \nsomeday may call this speech today a runner-up to the Fulton, MO, \nspeech.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Remarks by the President on Winston Churchill and the War on Terror\n\n       The President: Thank you all very much. I'm honored to join \n     you as we welcome a magnificent collection to the Library of \n     Congress. I've always been a great admirer of Sir Winston \n     Churchill, admirer of his career, admirer of his strength, \n     admirer of his character--so much so that I keep a stern-\n     looking bust of Sir Winston in the Oval Office. He watches my \n     every move. (Laughter.)\n       Like few other men in this or any other age, Churchill is \n     admired throughout the world. And through the writings and \n     his personal effects, we feel the presence of the great man, \n     himself. As people tour this exhibit, I'm sure they'll be \n     able to smell the whiskey and the cigars. (Laugher.)\n       I appreciate Jim Billington for hosting this exhibit, and \n     for hosting me. It's good to see Marjorie. I appreciate the \n     members of Winston Churchill's family who have come: Lady \n     Mary Soames, who is a daughter; Winston Churchill III, the \n     man bears a mighty name, and his wife, Luce; Celia Sandys, \n     who is a granddaughter. Thank you all for coming. We're \n     honored to have you here in America.\n       I'm pleased to see my friend, the Ambassador from the \n     United Kingdom to America, Sir David Manning and Lady Manning \n     here, as well. I appreciate the members of Congress who have \n     come--the Chairman. We've got a couple of mighty powerful \n     people here, Winston, with us today--Chairmen Lugar and \n     Warner, Senator Bennett, Congressmen Bill Young, Doug \n     Bereuter, Jerry Lewis, Tom Petri, Vern Ehlers and Jane \n     Harman. I'm glad you all are here, thanks for taking time to \n     come.\n       This exhibit bears witness to one of the most varied and \n     consequential lives of modern history. Churchill's 90 years \n     on earth, joined together two ages. He stood in the presence \n     of Queen Victoria, who first reigned in 1837. He was the \n     Prime Minister to Elizabeth II, who reigns today. Sir Winston \n     met Theodore Roosevelt, and he met Richard Nixon.\n       Over his long career, Winston Churchill knew success and he \n     knew failure, but he never passed unnoticed. He was a \n     prisoner in the Boer War, a controversial strategist in the \n     Great War. He was the rallying voice of the Second World War, \n     and a prophet of the Cold War. He helped abolish the sweat \n     shops. He gave coal miners an eight-hour day. He was an early \n     advocate of the tank. And he helped draw boundary lines that \n     remain on the map of the Middle East. He was an extraordinary \n     man.\n       In spare moments, pacing and dictating to harried \n     secretaries, he produced 15 books. He said, ``History will be \n     kind to me--for I intend to write it.'' (Laughter.) History \n     has been kind to Winston Churchill, as it usually is to those \n     who help save the world.\n       In a decade of political exile during the 1930s, Churchill \n     was dismissed as a nuisance and a crank. When the crisis he \n     predicted arrived, nearly everyone knew that only one man \n     could rescue Britain. The same trait that had made him an \n     outcast eventually made him the leader of his country. \n     Churchill possessed, in one writer's words, an ``absolute \n     refusal, unlike many good and prudent men around him, to \n     compromise or to surrender.''\n       In the years that followed, as a great enemy was defeated, \n     a great partnership was formed. President Franklin Roosevelt \n     found in Churchill a confidence and resolve that equaled his \n     own. As they led the allies to victory, they passed many days \n     in each other's company, and grew in respect and friendship. \n     The President once wrote to the Prime Minister, ``It is fun \n     to be in the same decade with you.'' And this sense of \n     fellowship and common purpose between our two nations \n     continues to this day. I have also been privileged to know a \n     fine British leader, a man of conscience and unshakable \n     determination. In his determination to do the right thing, \n     and not the easy thing, I see the spirit of Churchill in \n     Prime Minister Tony Blair. (Applause.)\n       When World War II ended, Winston Churchill immediately \n     understood that the victory was incomplete. Half of Europe \n     was occupied by an aggressive empire. And one of Churchill's \n     own finest hours came after the war ended in a speech he \n     delivered in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill warned of the new \n     danger facing free peoples. In stark but measured tones, he \n     spoke of the need for free nations to unite against communist \n     expansion. Marshal Stalin denounced the speech as a ``call to \n     war.'' A prominent American journalist called the speech an \n     ``almost catastrophic  blunder.'' In fact, Churchill had set \n     a simple truth before the world: that tyranny could not be \n     ignored or appeased without great risk. And he boldly \n     asserted that freedom--freedom was the right of men and \n     women on both sides of the Iron Curtain.\n        Churchill understood that the Cold War was not just a \n     standoff of armies, but a conflict of visions--a clear divide \n     between those who put their faith in ideologies of power, and \n     those who put their faith in the choices of free people. The \n     successors of Churchill and Roosevelt--leaders like Truman, \n     and Reagan, and Thatcher--led a confident alliance that held \n     firm as communism collapsed under the weight of its own \n     contradictions.\n        Today, we are engaged in a different struggle. Instead of \n     an armed empire, we face stateless networks. Instead of \n     massed armies, we face deadly technologies that must be kept \n     out of the hands of terrorists and outlaw regimes.\n        Yet in some ways, our current struggles or challenges are \n     similar to those Churchill knew. The outcome of the war on \n     terror depends on our ability to see danger and to answer it \n     with strength and purpose. One by one, we are finding and \n     dealing with the terrorists, drawing tight what Winston \n     Churchill called a ``closing net of doom.'' This war also is \n     a conflict of visions. In their worship of power, their deep \n     hatreds, their blindness to innocence, the terrorists are \n     successors to the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. \n     And we are the heirs of the tradition of liberty, defenders \n     of the freedom, the conscience and the dignity of every \n     person. Others before us have shown bravery and moral clarity \n     in this cause. The same is now asked of us, and we accept the \n     responsibilities of history.\n        The tradition of liberty has advocates in every culture \n     and in every religion. Our great challenges support the \n     momentum of freedom in the greater Middle East. The stakes \n     could not be higher. As long as that region is a place of \n     tyranny and despair and anger, it will produce men and \n     movements that threaten the safety of Americans and our \n     friends. We seek the advance of democracy for the most \n     practical of reasons: because democracies do not support \n     terrorists or threaten the world with weapons of mass murder.\n        America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the \n     Middle East. We're challenging the enemies of reform, \n     confronting the allies of terror, and expecting a higher \n     standard from our friends. For too long, American policy \n     looked away while men and women were oppressed, their rights \n     ignored and their hopes stifled. That era is over, and we can \n     be confident. As in Germany, and Japan, and Eastern Europe, \n     liberty will overcome oppression in the Middle East. \n     (Applause.)\n        True democratic reform must come from within. And across \n     the Middle East, reformers are pushing for change. From \n     Morocco, to Jordan, to Qatar, we're seeing elections and new \n     protections for women and the stirring of political \n     pluralism. When the leaders of reform ask for our help, \n     America will give it. (Applause.)\n        I've asked the Congress to double the budget for the \n     National Endowment for Democracy, raising its annual total to \n     $80 million. We will focus its new work on bringing free \n     elections and free markets and free press and free speech and \n     free labor unions to the Middle East. The National Endowment \n     gave vital service in the Cold War, and now we are renewing \n     its mission of freedom in the war on terror. (Applause.)\n        Freedom of the press and the free flow of ideas are vital \n     foundations of liberty. To cut through the hateful propaganda \n     that fills the airwaves in the Muslim world and to promote \n     open debate, we're broadcasting the message of tolerance and \n     truth in Arabic and Persian to tens of millions. In some \n     cities of the greater Middle East, our radio stations\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\n     are rated number one amongst younger listeners. Next week, we \n     will launch a new Middle East television network called, \n     Alhurra--Arabia for ``the free one.'' The network will \n     broadcast news and movies and sports and entertainment and \n     educational programming to millions of people across the \n     region. Through all these efforts, we are telling the people \n     in the Middle East the truth about the values and the \n     policies of the United States, and the truth always serves \n     the cause of freedom. (Applause.)\n        America is also taking the side of reformers who have \n     begun to change the Middle East. We're providing loans and \n     business advice to encourage a culture of entrepreneurship in \n     the Middle East. We've established business internships for \n     women, to teach them the skills of enterprise, and to help \n     them achieve social and economic equality. We're supporting \n     the work of judicial reformers who demand independent courts \n     and the rule of law. At the request of countries in the \n     region, we're providing Arabic language textbooks to boys and \n     girls. We're helping education reformers improve their school \n     systems.\n        The message to those who long for liberty and those who \n     work for reform is that they can be certain they have a \n     strong ally, a constant ally in the United States of America. \n     (Applause.)\n        Our strategy and our resolve are being tested in two \n     countries, in particular. the nation of Afghanistan was once \n     the primary training ground for al Qaeda, the home of a \n     barbaric regime called the Taliban. It now has a new \n     constitution that guarantees free election and full \n     participation by women. (Applause.)\n       The nation of Iraq was for decades an ally of terror ruled \n     by the cruelty and caprice of one man. Today, the people of \n     Iraq are moving toward self-government. Our coalition is \n     working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law \n     with a bill of rights. Because our coalition acted, \n     terrorists lost a source of reward money for suicide \n     bombings. Because we acted, nations of the Middle East no \n     longer need to fear reckless aggression from a ruthless \n     dictator who had the intent and capability to inflict great \n     harm on his people and people around the world. Saddam \n     Hussein now sits in a prison cell, and Iraqi men and women \n     are no longer carried to torture chambers and rape rooms, and \n     dumped in mass graves. Because the Baathist regime is \n     history, Iraq is no longer a grave and gathering threat to \n     free nations. Iraq is a free nation. (Applause.)\n       Freedom still has enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq. All the \n     Baathists and Taliban and terrorists know that if democracy \n     were to be, it would undermine violence--their hope for \n     violence and innocent death. They understand that if \n     democracy were to be undermined, then the hopes for change \n     throughout the Middle East would be set back. That's what \n     they know. That's what they think. We know that the success \n     of freedom in these nations would be a landmark event in the \n     history of the Middle East, and the history of the world. \n     Across the region, people would see that freedom is the path \n     to progress and national dignity. A thousand lies would stand \n     refuted, falsehoods about the incompatibility of democratic \n     values in Middle Eastern cultures. And all would see, in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, the success of free institutions at the \n     heart of the greater Middle East.\n       Achieving this vision will the work of many nations over \n     time, requiring the same strength of will and confidence of \n     purpose that propelled freedom to victory in the defining \n     struggles of the last century. Today, we're at a point of \n     testing, when people and nations show what they're made out \n     of. America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. \n     we will do what it takes. we will not leave until the job is \n     done. (Applause.)\n       We will succeed because when given a choice, people \n     everywhere, from all walks of life, from all religions, \n     prefer freedom to violence and terror. We will succeed \n     because human beings are not made by the Almighty God to live \n     in tyranny. We will succeed because of who we are--because \n     even when it is hard, Americans always do what is right.\n       And we know the work that has fallen to this generation. \n     When great striving is required of us, we will always have an \n     example in the man we honor today. Winston Churchill was a \n     man of extraordinary personal gifts, yet his greatest \n     strength was his unshakable confidence in the power and \n     appeal of freedom. It was the great fortune of mankind that \n     he was there in an hour of peril. And it remains the great \n     duty of mankind to advance the cause of freedom in our time.\n       May God bless the memory of Winston Churchill. May God \n     continue to bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S581-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S581-S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have had a chance now to look over the \nPresident's budget. What with being out of our offices and stuck over \nin the Capitol and not being able to see some of the people we were \nsupposed to see and conduct business as usual, I have had the chance to \nlook at the budget. Of course, I had heard it was kind of bad. I read \nsome of the preliminary reports, but it was not until I really started \ndigging into it and looking at some of the fine print and getting out a \ncalculator and adding it all up that I realized how stupefyingly bad \nthis budget is. It almost defies logic.\n  After going through it, I can sum up his election year budget in four \nwords: More of the same. More tax cuts for the wealthy, more massive \nspending increases on things such as Star Wars and, of course, that \nnice trip to Mars we are going to take, more giveaways to special \ninterests, and more massive budget deficits.\n  This is Mr. Bush's fourth budget submission, so now I think we can \ntake stock. We can size up the full 4-year fiscal record of this \nadministration. Quite frankly, the irresponsible actions of this \nadministration over 4 years boggle the mind.\n  In just 4 years, Mr. Bush has put in place trillions of dollars in \ntax cuts, overwhelmingly for the very wealthy. In spite of the huge \ndeficits, the President now is demanding that those tax cuts be made \npermanent. At the same time, he is proposing tens of billions of \ndollars on new spending programs, and this includes untold billions for \ntrips to the Moon and Mars. There is billions more for Star Wars, which \nMr. Bush intends to build now and test later.\n  President Bush has taken the projected 10-year surplus of some $5 \ntrillion that he inherited from President Clinton and turned that into \na projected 10-year deficit of nearly $5 trillion. Think about that. In \n4 short years, this President and this administration have taken a $5 \ntrillion surplus and turned it into a $5 trillion deficit, a $10 \ntrillion swing. As I said, it just boggles the mind.\n\n  By any measure, this is an astonishing record of economic \nmismanagement and economic malpractice. In fact, I challenge my \ncolleagues to cite any President in the 215-year history of our \nRepublic who has compiled such a record of sheer recklessness.\n  The White House now says the deficit in the current fiscal year will \nbe $521 billion. That is bad enough, but that is not the worst of it. \nFar more dangerous are the long-term, permanent, structural deficits \nthat will result. Mr. Bush dares to claim he has charted a course to \ncut the deficit in half in 5 years. This has about as much credibility \nas his claim that Iraq possessed massive stockpiles of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The fact is that, after 4 years, Mr. Bush has zero \ncredibility on the budget.\n  Let's look at his past projections and promises. In 2001, Mr. Bush \npromised: ``We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \ndeficits.'' That turned out to be untrue.\n  In 2002, Mr. Bush reassured us: ``Our budget will run a deficit that \nwill be small and short term.'' That turned out, also, to be untrue.\n  In 2003, Mr. Bush again assured us: ``Our current deficit is not \nlarge by historical standards and is manageable.'' That also is turning \nout to be untrue.\n  This year, President Bush claims that the massive deficits he has \ncreated will be magically cut in half in 5 years' time. Is there any \nSenator in either party who believes that promise? I don't think so. \nMr. Bush has not just created a structural budget deficit, he has \ncreated a structural credibility deficit. Few credible economists \nbelieve him anymore.\n  The Washington Post sized up this budget in an editorial yesterday \nmorning. The editorial was titled ``Bogus Budgeting.'' The editorial \nstated that:\n\n       The Bush administration 2005 budget is a masterpiece of \n     disingenuous blame-shifting, dishonest budgeting and \n     irresponsible governing.\n\n  The reality is that the deficits will persist at high levels even if \nthe economy stays healthy. Year after year they will stay at high \nlevels, until the baby boomers start to retire, and then the deficits \nwill explode.\n  If we look at the operating budget--that is not counting the surplus \nthat comes from the Social Security taxes--the picture becomes crystal \nclear. Under the operating budget--again, excluding Social Security \nsurpluses--Bush has a huge $675 billion deficit for this year. That is \nequal to 5.9 percent of our GDP, our gross domestic product, the second \nhighest operating deficit since 1946.\n  But President Bush claims this operating deficit will drop to $470 \nbillion in just 2 years. Then, according to his own\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nbudget documents, the operating deficit begins to rise, reaching $500 \nbillion in 2009--deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  There are three huge problems here. No. 1, we are continuing to add \ndebt at a very rapid rate. No. 2, the glidepath is not downward to \nlower deficits but upwards to bigger deficits, and it rises more \nrapidly as we begin paying Social Security benefits to the baby boomers \nand, as the Social Security surplus shrinks, the true direction of the \nbudget disaster under Bush's plan becomes clear. No. 3, the Bush budget \ndoes not include costs that we all know we are going to have.\n  For example, get this. The Bush budget does not include any \nadditional funds for Iraq after September 30 of this year. In other \nwords, for 2005, beginning October 1 of this year, fiscal year 2005, \nthere are zero dollars for Iraq. We will have no troops there? We will \nhave no support going to Iraq? After September 30 it is just going to \nall end? Does anyone believe that? Yet this budget has zero dollars in \nit for Iraq after September 30 of this year. That alone ought to tell \nyou this budget is bogus.\n  The 2001 tax bill left a timebomb called the AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. In 2001, fewer than 2 million, mostly wealthy, taxpayers \npaid it. By 2010, if it is not changed, over 30 million taxpayers will \nbe paying it, mostly middle-class families. Nobody around here believes \nthat is going to be allowed to happen. Everyone understands it will be \nfixed, probably at a cost of over $400 billion. So, what does the Bush \nbudget do? It just fixes it for 1 year. Again, bogus.\n  What do these huge deficits mean, coming ahead? They mean we are \nincreasingly dependent on the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other \nforeign governments and investors who buy our Treasury bonds.\n  I said to someone the other day, after looking over this budget and \nlooking over who is loaning us money to buy our bonds, we are actually \nborrowing money from the South Koreans to finance our deficit.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I was struck by the statement made by the Senator from \nIowa, that this budget includes not a penny for our troops and the \nother programs we have going on in Iraq. The question I ask the Senator \nis, Does this kind of remind you of what took place last year? Does the \nSenator remember that the President came and asked for a supplemental \nof $69 billion early in the year, and then later came and asked for $87 \nbillion, in 1 year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Iowa think for 1 minute we are going \nto spend no money in Iraq, after last year having had two supplementals \nin the amount of more than $150 billion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I tell you, the Senator from Nevada has put his finger on \nit. Look, everyone knows, we had the $69 billion last year. We knew it \nwasn't enough, so he had to come back and ask for $87 billion. He got \nthat. We also know that is not enough. Yet the President has the \naudacity, as the Senator has pointed out, to have a budget that on \nSeptember 30 of this year has no money for Iraq.\n  I say to my friend, no one believes that. Yet the President puts it \nin his budget as though it is factual.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator believe that in the Pentagon and in the \nbowels of the White House they have already prepared the documents for \na supplemental appropriations bill to take care of the funding in Iraq \nand poor little Afghanistan, about which we seem to have just \nforgotten?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Nevada is very perceptive. He has been \nhere a long time. My good friend from Nevada knows how these things \nwork, and he is absolutely right. The Senator is right. We all know \nthat. The Pentagon already has figures put together. In the bowels of \nthe White House they have figures put together. They already know it is \ngoing to cost money for next year.\n  Again, I guess I respond to my friend by asking him, why wouldn't \nthey be honest with us? Why wouldn't they be honest and put this in the \nbudget? because everyone knows the facts--that it is going to cost some \nmoney after September 30.\n  I ask my friend what possible reason would they have for saying it \ncosts nothing and they are zeroing it out?\n  Mr. REID. Because they believe, in my opinion, we will do whatever is \nnecessary to fund the key things that are important. I am sure down \nthere they have taken into consideration the programs they say they are \ngoing to cut. I believe this is just a prelude to having these people \naccomplish indirectly what they can't do directly; that is, decimate \nand in effect void the Social Security laws that have been in effect \nfor this country for more than 70 years. Those people do not believe in \nSocial Security. They don't believe in Social Security.\n  I carry this with me, because I want people to know I don't make this \nup. It is my wallet. It is kind of worn. I am not going to read all of \nit. But let me just read a couple of statements from Senator Robert \nDole, our friend, who is a nice man and does a good job now on \ntelevision being a commentator. This is a direct quote. He said:\n\n       I was there fighting the fight, one of 12 voting against \n     Medicare because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  He is one of the patriarchs of the Republican Party who gives advice \nand counsel to the President of the United States today. He doesn't \nlike Medicare, and most other people at the White House do not like \nMedicare.\n  Listen to this one:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world.\n\n  I am not making this up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who said that?\n  Mr. REID. The recently departed majority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, Dick Armey.\n  That is only part of what he said.\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world.\n\n  I am not making this up. That is what he said.\n\n       Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we are going to \n     have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out \n     over time.\n\n  These people are doing indirectly what they cannot do directly. They \nare going to rob this Government of all the moneys they have until they \nhave no choice but to say what we have to do is basically do away with \nthe Social Security program; do away with Medicare. Let the private \nsector take care of it. If you want some retirement benefits, get it at \nyour job; and if the job doesn't, save it.\n  Social Security is a rotten trick. That is what they think. But my \nmother and father who drew Social Security--actually, my dad didn't. He \ndied too early. But my mother did. I don't think it was a rotten trick. \nI can remember my grandmother. I was a little boy. Every month she got \nwhat we called and she called her ``old age pension.'' That was Social \nSecurity. That was what gave my grandmother independence from her eight \nchildren. She got her check. She didn't have to depend on her children. \nShe was a widow. She got her Social Security check.\n  I thank my friend very much for talking about this budget, which is \nas phony as a six-dollar bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Iowa yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his questions and for answering \none of my questions, too. The Senator is right. There is a part in this \nbudget where essentially the administration points out that with the \nhuge deficits, the Social Security system will be unsustainable in its \npresent form. Talk about code words. There is a code word for \nprivatization. Charge Social Security, turn it over to the private \nmarketplace, and let people take a chance on whatever. I think the \nSenator from Nevada is absolutely right. I will not say every \nRepublican, because I can't cast the net that far. But I would say \nthere are forces in the Republican Party--the Senator mentioned Senator \nDole and Dick Armey. Newt Gingrich said he wanted Medicare to wither on \nthe vine and also led the charge to try to privatize Social Security.\n\n  There are forces at work and they are in control of the Republican \nParty now that do not like Medicare. They do not like Social Security, \nand they will do whatever they can to get rid of it. I believe this \nbudget is a step in that direction.\n  I yield to my friend from Illinois for a question.\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask the Senator a question through the Chair. I \nthank the Senator from Nevada for his comments.\n  But I have before me the budget. It is now in four different books. I \nhave the lead book. By the time you get to page 14 of the President's \nbudget, right in the front end of it, in the introduction, ``Winning \nthe War On Terror,'' is a long section on removing the threat of Saddam \nHussein. It talks about Operation Iraqi Freedom, the removal of Saddam \nHussein, and the responsibility of the United States in Iraq.\n  If I understand the Senator from Iowa correctly, despite the fact \nthis is in the opening introduction of the budget, you can pour through \nthis entire budget and not find a single penny--not one cent--that is \ngoing to be spent by the United States of America in waging the war in \nIraq after September 30 of this year.\n  Is that my understanding of what the Senator from Iowa said?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. I didn't \nbelieve it myself when I was first told of this. I started digging in \nthe budget along with my staff. I said surely someplace in this budget \nthey must have some money in there to fund our operation in Iraq.\n  You will look until your dying day and you will not find one penny in \nthat budget for our operations in Iraq after September 30, you will \njust find a note about possible funding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Iowa through the Chair this \nquestion: Has he heard any member of this administration suggest we \nwill be withdrawing all of our troops from Iraq before September 30 of \nthis year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator asked a very good question. I don't \nknow. I have not heard them say that. But that is what the budget \nimplies.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the Senator has visited with his National Guard \nin Iowa as I have visited them in Illinois. They have been told just \nthe opposite. The Guard and Reserve have been activated and told they \nwill be gone for a year or 18 months in service to our country. It is \nclear that once there we are going to support them. We will give them \nwhat they need to come home safely with their mission accomplished. But \nwe can't do it for nothing.\n  My question to the Senator from Iowa is, Why would the President of \nthe United States refuse to include in his budget one penny to wage \nthis war in Iraq and this war in Afghanistan? What is the purpose \nbehind shortchanging this budget and making it look cheaper than it \nactually is? I ask the Senator from Iowa if he has any opinion.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will just say to my friend all you have to do is go \nback and look at 2002, 2003, and 2004. Look at the last 3 years of the \nBush budget and you can see what happened. They have dug themselves and \nour country into a huge fiscal hole. Now what they want to do, rather \nthan trying to get out of it, is going to dig us even further into that \nhole and try to make it look not so bad. They are trying to cut here \nand cut there, and doctor things up a little bit so it doesn't look \nquite so bad. They put zero money in there for Iraq.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask another question----\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a shell game. That is all it is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator realizes that only 4 years ago we had a $236 \nbillion surplus that we were strengthening Social Security with, paying \ndown America's debt, and reducing the mortgage our children will have \nto carry. And now, if I am not mistaken, we are going to be faced with \nthis budget which is the largest deficit in the history of the United \nStates of America.\n  My question to the Senator from Iowa is this: In basic terms for \nthose following this discussion, how do we pay for the debt? I am told \nevery minute the Bush administration spends $991,000 more than we take \nin in taxes. This results in a $520 billion deficit this year. I ask \nthe Senator from Iowa, How do we balance the books? Where do we turn \nwith a deficit like this to help balance the books?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are not going to balance it. But I tell you what they \nare doing. Effectively, they are going hat in hand to the Chinese, and \nthey are saying, Please loan us some money. The Chinese will buy our \nbonds. Japan is buying our bonds. I think Japan now is the single \nlargest owner of bonds. I think China is No. 2, if I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Japan is $526 billion, and China--I can give you the \nexact number. I think the figure is $144 billion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. From China?\n  Mr. DURBIN. China.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And they will keep buying more and more and as the huge \ndeficits pile up America's debt. This is going hat in hand to China and \nJapan and South Korea and many other countries. To do what? To finance \nhuge tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Iowa to complete the thought; the \nobvious question which I ask which we ought to consider, where does \nChina get the dollars to buy the debt of the United States? Where does \nChina have a surplus of dollars coming in? What is it about China that \nthey end up with all of these dollars?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask my friend from Illinois, what is the trade deficit \nwe have with China?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly the answer. It is a trade deficit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So we have a huge trade deficit with China. We are buying \neverything from China. They get the dollars, and we go hat in hand, a \ndebtor nation, and effectively say, please, buy our bonds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I ask the Senator from Iowa, in your home State of \nIowa and my State of Illinois, we have lost 20 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs in the last few years; America has lost 3 million \njobs under this President, more than any President since the Great \nDepression. So as we have lost these jobs and lost these businesses, \nand our economy is sinking--a jobless recovery is no recovery where I \nlive--we see other countries who now take over our manufacturing jobs, \nlike China, and because they are selling more to the United States, \nthey have dollars and turn around and own our debt.\n  So our workers do not have the jobs, their children have the debt, \nand China is holding the mortgage. Is that the fact?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is on to something. First of all, they are \ngetting our dollars for the products they make and send to this country \nwith cheap labor, with no Social Security protections for the workers. \nThey get all those dollars. They then buy our debt, they buy our bonds. \nThe Senator is right. They buy the bonds and then there is interest on \nthe bonds, a lot of interest. So who gets the interest payments? The \nChinese get the interest payments.\n  So our workers lose their jobs, the jobs go to China, we buy their \ngoods, they get the dollars, they buy our bonds, and the Senator is \nabsolutely right. It is the workers' families, the kids who now have to \npony up to pay the interest charges.\n  Now, I ask the Senator, looking ahead, if, in fact, we have these \nhuge budget deficits which are going to roll on year after year, that \nmeans someone has to finance this debt. So we will still be going back \nto the Chinese and the Japanese, the Europeans and others, to buy our \ndebt.\n  I ask the Senator, if you are in the position of having a lot of \nmoney and you are buying debt, do you want high interest rates or low \ninterest rates?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Iowa, clearly what we have here \nis a scarce commodity--dollars. And the people who can come up with the \ndollars want to get paid more for coming up with them in terms of \ninterest. As the interest goes up that is being paid for those holding \nour debt overseas, it runs up the interest rates in America in terms of \nhow we can expand our businesses.\n  So we have lost the jobs. We have lost the manufacturing. And with \ninterest rate pressure going up from all of the debt, we are making it \nmore difficult for businesses to rebound, build in America, and create \nAmerican jobs.\n  Is the Senator from Iowa aware of the figures given by Senator Kent \nConrad on the Budget Committee that by 2009, every American will have \nas their personal share of our American mortgage, our American debt, \n$35,283, so that the debt tax from the Bush administration on every \nindividual American will be over $35,000.\n  I ask my friend from Iowa if he believes the people in his State, let \nalone\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\nany other State, have a notion that President Bush's failed economic \npolicy is building up the mortgage on every single American and \nAmerican family for years to come.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. I ask the Senator to repeat this \nfigure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. By 2009, each American's share of the debt will total \n$35,283.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is bad enough in itself. I say to the Senator, also \nby 2009, the interest payments on this debt that we are piling up under \nthis budget that we have will lead to $980 for the credit card of every \nman, woman, and child in America. In other words, a family of four will \npay nearly $4,000 just in interest on the debt in just that year. They \nare not buying it down but just paying the interest charges. And, with \nthe policies of this administration, they will just grow and grow. We \nknow what happens to families as they have a growing difficulty just \npaying the interest on their credit cards.\n  Where is a big chunk of that interest rate payment going?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly it goes overseas.\n  And I ask the Senator from Iowa, the President said in the State of \nthe Union, the key to the future of the American economy is to make the \ntax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, permanent law.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, as he has traveled his State and I have \ntraveled mine, as well, has the Senator found with the working \nfamilies, a hue and cry, demands to keep President Bush's tax cuts in \nplace, tax cuts that have basically given us the biggest deficit in the \nhistory of the United States and have failed to create jobs? Has the \nSenator heard this in the State of Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not only have I not heard from the people in the State of \nIowa, even friends of mine who have a lot of money, who make a lot of \nmoney, have basically told me: You guys are crazy what you are doing \nback there. You have to get this economy straight.\n  Even the people who made out under this tax break, if they are \nhonest--and many are--are saying: Wait a minute, this is not right for \nAmerica, not right for our economy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask through the Chair, I know the Senator from Iowa has \nhad a leadership position when it comes to education and health issues \nin his appropriations subcommittee. I ask the Senator from Iowa, is the \nSenator hearing the same thing I am hearing as you visit school \ndistricts in Iowa and sit down with school board members and principals \nand teachers, regarding No Child Left Behind, which is imposing a \nrequirement for testing kids to find out the progress they are making--\nand there is nothing wrong with that--but then when they find the kids \nare falling behind, does the Senator hear in Iowa the same as I do in \nIllinois, hear that these educators are asking, Why did the Federal \nGovernment fail to fund this mandate? Why are you sending us the No \nChild Left Behind mandate and failing to send the money to help educate \nthe children?\n  Again, we find this President's budget is not funding his education \nprogram. It is underfunding his mandate. Does the Senator find the same \nthing as he travels through Iowa?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time was I allowed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a 30-minute time limit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under what rule was I allowed 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We had an order for a 30-minute time limit for \nmorning business.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. It is my understanding the Senate is in a period of \nmorning business with a time limit not to exceed 30 minutes. I will not \ntake that much time. I wish to speak very briefly and ask a rhetorical \nquestion, since I am not allowed to ask a question of a Senator who \ndoes not have the floor. But then I would be pleased, if permissible \nunder the rules, to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S584-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I happened to come to the floor to hear my \ncolleagues from Illinois and Iowa talking about their concern for the \ndeficit and for spending priorities, and I share their concern.\n  However, it is worth noting that at this time the pending business of \nthe Senate is a transportation bill that is, by any standards, \nenormous. It represents an increase of over 40 percent over the \nprevious 6-year bill. It represents a dramatic expansion in the size \nand scope of Federal Government. It totals over $300 billion. \nUnfortunately, it seeks to obtain funds by diverting general revenue \ntax receipts into the highway trust fund, something that has never been \ndone before.\n  To the best of my knowledge, both of my colleagues who spoke earlier \nare more than willing to vote for this enormous spending measure.\n  I just do not think it is credible to take the floor and raise \nconcerns about deficits and spending priorities and, at the same time, \nbe willing to support such a massive increase in infrastructure \nspending, when we know full well that States are very capable of making \nsound decisions for this kind of construction and investment. We know \nfull well that it is wrong to divert money from the general revenue \nfund in order to support an expansion of this funding. And we know full \nwell this bill is significantly in excess of what has been proposed by \nthe President.\n  While I do not agree with all the priorities in the President's \nbudget, I think it is fair to say that we would have $20 or $30 or $40 \nor $50 billion more for the priorities my colleagues spoke about if \nthey would join with me in raising concerns about this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S584-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S584-S587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BUDGET AND THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nIowa in a dialog on this issue relative to the budget and the deficit.\n  The question I asked earlier related to the experience of the Senator \nfrom Iowa when he traveled his State and the response of the people of \nIowa when it came to the suggestion of President Bush that his tax cut \nprogram--primarily for the wealthiest people in the country--be made \npermanent law. And I asked the Senator: I know that everyone likes a \ntax cut, but what are you finding?\n  If I might have the permission of the Chair to ask this question of \nthe Senator from Iowa, without yielding the floor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What are you finding to be the response, as you travel \nthroughout your State, in terms of the President's tax cut policy?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reply to my friend from Illinois, as I \ntraveled around my State since we adjourned back in December, I have \nnot heard anything about making this tax cut permanent. I cannot think \nof one person who came up to me saying that. But I will tell you what I \ndid hear a lot about.\n  As the Senator pointed out, I heard from my schools on No Child Left \nBehind, that they are being underfunded. Special education is taking \nits toll on property taxpayers all over our State, and they are \ndemanding the Federal Government live up to its promise on special \neducation. I am hearing about the loss of manufacturing jobs in our \nState. And there are no jobs to be had. I am hearing about the need for \nbetter health care for people who do not have health insurance in our \nState.\n  I am hearing about the high cost of education. So many middle-class \nfamilies now, and low-income families, are simply being priced out of \nhigher education. It is taking more and more money to get into college. \nRight now, a Pell grant provides for about--under this budget--30 \npercent, give or take 1 percent--maybe 31 percent--of the cost of \ncollege. Just 4 years ago, it was 40 percent. So we have lost 25 \npercent of the purchasing power just of a Pell grant. And these are for \npoor kids to go to college. Twenty-five percent, just in\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\n4 years, has been eroded. Yet this budget keeps Pell grants right where \nthey have been--with not one penny of an increase.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Illinois, this is what I hear Iowans \ntalking about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might further engage my colleague from Iowa in this \ndialog and go back to the point I made earlier, I say to the Senator, \nhe has been chair and ranking Democrat on the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that is responsible for education and health, and he has \ndone a substantial and marvelous job, including record funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health and amazing efforts to help the funding \nof education.\n  I ask my friend and colleague from Iowa to just reflect on what I \nhave found, and I ask if he has found the same. I have gone to good \nschools in Illinois, and they have told me the results of the testing. \nThe results of the testing, in the most recent rounds of testing in No \nChild Left Behind, required that the students reach a 60-percent plus \nof performance in terms of their learning ability and learning \nattainment, education attainment--60 percent.\n  In some of the schools I have visited in the suburban areas of \nChicago--not in the cities, in the suburban areas of Chicago--here is \nwhat we found. When they took the test, we found that the white \nstudents in the schools were testing slightly over 60 percent. So they \nwere meeting their target. The African-American students were testing \nin the 40-percent range; the Hispanic students in the 25- and 30-\npercent range; and the special education students, the students with \ndisabilities, below 20 percent. All of these subgroups, if there are \ncertain numbers of them in each school, are all expected to hit 60 \npercent.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa if he has had similar experiences, and if \nhe would share them with me and try to answer the question these \neducators asked. They said: If these groups are not meeting the test \nscores they are supposed to meet, and we are going to be labeled a \nfailing school because of that, what are we supposed to do? What will \nyou do to help us in terms of mentoring students, tutoring students, \nafterschool programs, and summer school programs?\n  My response to them, sadly, is, if you look at President Bush's own \nbudget for No Child Left Behind, he underfunds the promised money for \nthese school districts. The law authorizing No Child Left Behind said \nthis year we would send $34.3 billion to school districts across \nAmerica to help these kids--$34.3 billion--and the budget only provides \n$24.9 billion. So we are underfunding it by $9.4 billion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Nine billion dollars, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, who deals with this appropriation, and \nthe money behind it, where does this leave our schools in Iowa and \nIllinois, taking the test, finding the challenge, but without the \nresources to address it? I ask unanimous consent, through the Chair, \nfor the Senator from Iowa to respond, without my yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Illinois, Lew Finch, who is the \nretiring superintendent of schools in Cedar Rapids, talked to me about \nthis. There was an article in the paper also quoting him saying that \ntheir good schools are failing and they are doing it for the exact \nreason the Senator from Illinois pointed out. But here is what he said \nto me.\n  He said: I fear that all the progress we have made in the past, under \nthings like the Americans with Disabilities Act, IDEA, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, and integrating students in schools, \nbringing kids with disabilities into the mainstream of schools--he \nsaid: I fear what we are going to start doing is now segregating them \nout one more time, segregating them out of our schools again because \nthey are being a drag on all the other students.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me add to what the Senator from Iowa said. This year \nwe will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, \n50 years in America where we have said the integration of schools is \nessential to equality of opportunity. Separate but equal--Plessy v. \nFerguson--was rejected by the Supreme Court 50 years ago, moving us \ntoward a colorblind America and the integration of races in America, \nsomething essential to put the era of slavery and racism behind us.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Jim Crow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And I say to the Senator from Iowa--and I know how deeply \nhe feels about special education--I feel the same way, the same \nintensity level about the reaction, as parents walk into the school \nboard meeting and say: This high school that I planned on sending my \nson to, my daughter to so she could get into a good college, I read in \nthe morning paper is a failing school. Will you tell me why I made the \nsacrifice to buy an expensive home in the suburbs to send my child to a \nschool for his future or her future and now it is a failing school? \nExplain it to me.\n  The educators will put the test scores up, and they will see it is \nthe minority students and the students of Hispanic ancestry, as well as \nthe special education students, who are leading to this conclusion.\n  Now, two things can happen, I say to the Senator from Iowa. The good \nthing that can happen is we will say: What can we do to bring all test \nscores up, particularly for those kids who are not doing well. Well, \nyou will not find the answer in this budget. This budget misses the \ntarget by $9 billion in providing extra teachers, extra technology, \nextra attention. It is not there.\n  But there is another course we can take that is sinister and ugly. It \nis the course that says: Incidentally, when those minority students \ndon't come to school, don't go looking for them--would you?--because \nthey are dragging down the test scores. That would be a terrible \noutcome.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Or vouchers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Or vouchers. And for those--and there are many, even in \nthis Chamber--who have given up on public education long ago, this is \nthe answer to their prayers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They will get bad test scores and say: Didn't we tell you \npublic education has failed in America? I say to the Senator from Iowa, \nI think the funding of education is pushing us into a critical moment \nin the future of public education. Starting just 2 weeks ago, with the \nsignature on the Omnibus appropriations bill, we will have the first \nFederal funding of a voucher program for private schools in the history \nof the United States of America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Right here in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is an answer to the prayers of those who have a \nloathing for public education and for the teachers in public schools \nwho many think have the wrong political allegiance, whatever the reason \nmight be. When you put all this together, you realize it is more than \ndollars. We are moving ourselves to a decision that is calling into \nquestion 50 years of American history and more.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, what is his impression as he reviews No \nChild Left Behind and this funding and the challenges it presents?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Our budget has basically two purposes. Any budget, \nwhether it is your own personal family budget, a business budget, or \nthe Government budget, has two purposes: One is to balance income and \noutlays--in other words, what is the income and what are the outlays, \ntry to get some balance between the two--and the second purpose is to \nset priorities, choices.\n  I am sure the Senator is like I am. When you have an income, you sit \ndown and say, this is our income. What is our mortgage? What is our car \npayment? What is our tuition, all those sorts of things. You add it up \nand you make choices on how you budget.\n  That is what this budget is. It is about choices, the choices that \nthis President has chosen: tax breaks for the wealthy, continue those \nand make them permanent; continue to ship our jobs overseas; continue \nto underfund education, as the Senator has pointed out; and continue \nthis march towards bigger and bigger debt, bigger and bigger deficits \nthat is going to choke off any hope of having a viable Social Security \nand Medicare system for our kids and grandkids. Those are the choices \nin this budget.\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Iowa, he and I have a mutual \nfriend in former President Bill Clinton who spoke to a group of \nDemocratic Senators a week or so ago. He said: When you look at this \nbudget and you project what this administration and this budget are \nheaded to, it is the concentration of wealth and power in America, the \nbreakdown of our effort to enlarge the middle class in America and, \nfrankly, to accept--sadly--the reality of the haves and have-nots, the \ndisparity in income.\n  We don't find in this budget an effort to lower the ladder to allow \npeople to come climbing up, as your parents and my parents and we did \nin our own lives. That is the worst part of this budget, as the Senator \nsaid, tax breaks for wealthy people, for this to be the hallmark of \nthis administration for the next year. It has failed to lift the \neconomy. It has failed to create jobs. What it has done is drag us \ndeeply and deeply into debt.\n  The Senator brought up the issue of Social Security. We went through \nthe Medicare bill, the prescription drug bill. I have certainly been \nback to talk to my seniors in Illinois about it. What have you found in \nIowa as you traveled around about that bill?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, again, people in Illinois are not that much \ndifferent than the people in Iowa. I hear the same things you hear. \nPeople are frightened. They are not frightened of Saddam Hussein. They \nare not even frightened by Osama bin Laden. They believe we will have \nthe power and the wherewithal to protect our citizens, maybe not with \nabsolute certainty but with enough that they will feel comfortable in \ntheir homes and businesses and in their travel.\n  What they are frightened about is their kids' education. They are \nfrightened about not being able to pay the next health care bill \nbecause they don't have adequate health insurance. They are concerned \nabout whether or not there is going to be a viable Medicare system for \ntheir parents, and whether their parents will truly get any \nprescription drug help at all. There is some confusion right now. \nPeople were promised a prescription drug benefit. It passed the \nCongress last year. The President signed it. Now we are finding out \nthat it is not going to help them that much and that most of the money \nis going to the pharmaceutical companies.\n  That is what I find. People in Iowa are afraid that we are headed in \nthe wrong direction. I sense this kind of mood among people, that they \nknow it is not right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One of the Presidential candidates, one of our \ncolleagues, refers to two Americas, an America for the wealthy and an \nAmerica for everyone else. What the Senator has just described is what \nI hear. People who really believed in the American dream thought that \nwith enough hard work and the right values you could succeed. That is \nwhat brought my mother as an immigrant to this country and millions \nlike her. Now the concern is that despite your good values, despite \nyour effort, despite your hard work, you can't reach that point of \nsecurity because the Senator from Iowa is hearing, as I am, retirees \nfinding that their retirement benefits are being cut off. Their health \ncare benefits are cut off.\n\n  These people also wonder if Social Security and Medicare will be \nthere when they need it. If we reach the point where we have diminished \nthose institutions through the prescription drug bill on Medicare, \nthrough this budget and its raid on the Social Security trust fund for \nyears to come, then, frankly, we have walked away from the heritage we \nreceived.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There was a recent article in Time magazine talking about \nhow life in America now for many middle-income families, low-income \nfamilies has become a game of chance. The game is kind of rigged \nagainst you.\n  I remember reading a little newspaper article and the headline was: \nVietnamese Immigrants Achieve American Dream, Win State Lottery. The \nstory went on to talk about this Vietnamese couple. They bought a \nlottery ticket and won the lottery. The idea that this is the American \ndream, a one-in-a-million chance of winning the lottery, that is the \nAmerican dream, that our life is a roll of the dice, the odds are a \nmillion to one against you. No, that is not the American dream. The \nAmerican dream is what your parents and my parents did, to work hard, \nto save, to buy a home of their own, to educate their kids and build a \nbetter life.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let's pursue one aspect of that which has been an issue \non which the Senator has been the leader. Not only has this \nadministration cost us 3 million jobs during the 3 years plus that the \nPresident has been in office, more jobs lost than any President since \nthe Great Depression, but now, to add insult to injury, the hardest \nworking Americans, the ones who say we are going to keep going, not \njust 40 hours a week but whatever it takes for our family, those \nworking hard with time away from their family, working overtime to pay \nthe bills, to get the money together for college, would the Senator \nfrom Iowa share with those who are following this debate what this \nadministration has done to overtime pay for Americans for the first \ntime in history?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is amazing. Last year this administration came out \nwith proposed rules to change how overtime is figured. Those changes \nwere made without one hearing, not one. Without any consultation with \nCongress, they just rolled them out there. There was not one public \nhearing on it.\n  Without going into all the fine details, it basically means that up \nto 8 million Americans will have their overtime pay protection removed.\n  One person said to me: My time with my family is premium time. If I \nhave to give up my premium time with my family to work overtime, I \nought to get some premium pay at time and a half.\n  That has been in law since 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act. This \nadministration, with one stroke of the pen, one set of proposed rules \nis going to undermine overtime pay protections for up to 8 million \nAmericans. I can't fathom why they would want to do this to hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What was the name of the law?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Is this not the \nonly time since the passage of this law that any President, Democrat or \nRepublican, has reduced overtime coverage and protection for American \nworkers? This is the first time it has ever been done?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true. I want to be very fair. We have changed the \nFair Labor Standards Act a number of times since then because some of \nthe job descriptions, buggy whip manufacturers and buggy harness \nmakers, have gone out, obviously.\n  But, at the same time, we have always expanded overtime pay \nprotection. So the Senator is right. This is the first time since 1938 \nwhere an administration has said we want to restrict, tighten down, the \namount of people who are eligible for overtime pay protection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To follow up on that point, is my impression correct that \nthe Bush administration didn't just sign the law, they sent out \ninformation to employers across America saying here is the way to cut \nthe overtime pay of your employees; that the Bush administration \nproactively sent out this information encouraging employers to cut \ntheir employees off of overtime?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, the Senator is right. Again, this is mind-boggling. \nI will say this--and again to be as fair as possible--there was one \npart of the proposal that was good, which was to raise the low-income \nbase from about $8,000 to about $21,000. That means that right now, no \nmatter who you are in this country, if your pay is less than $8,000 a \nyear, you are guaranteed overtime regardless of what you do. Well, that \nneeded to be raised for some time. Nobody argues that. They wanted to \nraise it to $21,000. We agree with that. But in doing so, they issued \nadvice to employers on how to get around it. They said we are going to \nraise the base to $21,000, but here is advice on how to get around it. \nNo. 1, what you do is simply work your people longer and you build that \ninto their base pay. So you work them longer, but you don't have to pay \nthem any more.\n  Secondly, they said if they are near $21,000--let's say $20,500--you \nmay want to raise their pay to $21,000 and then\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\nthey are exempt and you save by not paying overtime. There is gimmick \nafter gimmick on how they can basically get around it. I said this on \nthe floor. This is like the IRS issuing advice to tax cheats on how to \ncheat on their income taxes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under the Bush administration, we have lost 3 million \njobs, we have seen thousands and thousands more manufacturing jobs lost \nin your State and mine--probably gone forever to China and other \nplaces, and then this Department of Labor, for the first time in \nhistory, decides that hard-working Americans will not be paid overtime \nand says 8 million of these Americans stand to lose their overtime pay. \nIf the Senator from Iowa will help me, if we could tell those following \nthis debate, what kind of workers are we talking about? I heard Senator \nKennedy say we are talking about nurses and we are talking about people \nwho are involved in firefighting and police protection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. These are the people, unless protected through a \ncollective bargaining agreement, who could lose their overtime pay. I \nsay to the Senator, I don't know what it is like in his State, but we \nare desperate for nurses in my State. We are looking all over the world \nto bring in nurses. Along comes the Bush administration saying here is \na way, incidentally, for this hospital to stop paying overtime to \nnurses. It is a tough profession being a nurse, demanding. We count on \nthem when somebody in our family is ill. What is going on here when we \nare cutting overtime for nurses? Why would this administration make \nthat part of their economic policy?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, it is one way some unscrupulous employers--I would \nnot say all--will be helped. Again, I must say to my friend that prior \nto this rule being issued last year by the administration, and even \nduring the debate on this last year, I never had one employer in my \nState come up to me and say we need that. Not one. Obviously, there are \nsome someplace who want to get it changed. They must have very close \nfriends in the White House. This is one way of working people longer \nhours. American workers now work a longer work week than any other \nworkers in any other industrialized country right now. Now they want to \nwork them longer and not pay them overtime.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. To close this chapter completely, I want the Senator to \ntell us about the legislative history. Didn't you ask us to vote on \nthis on the floor of the Senate? Didn't you ask us to say to the \nadministration, no, you cannot cut 8 million people off of overtime. \nDidn't the Senate decide that? What happened?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We had a vote here last summer to basically keep this \nrule from going into effect. It passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. To protect workers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, to protect them and their right to overtime. The \nHouse of Representatives earlier passed a bill and it lost by about \nfour votes. After we passed it, it went back to the House and they had \na big vote to instruct conferees. In other words, telling their \nconferees to go along with the Senate provision on this. So we had \nthat. We went to conference and before the conference came to this \nissue, the gavel was banged and we were never invited back. Guess what. \nWhat we voted on here and what the House agreed to disappeared, because \nthe administration came in and said they didn't want it in the big \nappropriations bill we passed a couple weeks ago. So they thwarted the \nwill of Congress, and of the conferees who never got to vote on the \nissue. Most important, they thwarted the will of the American people. \nBut I have an amendment in my desk drawer and every appropriate \nopportunity this Senator gets, I am going to offer it here on the \nSenate floor because American workers deserve to have their overtime \nprotected--nurses, firefighters, police officers, ordinary working \npeople all over America. If they are going to be asked to give up their \npremium time with their families, they deserve time and a half.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will say this and I will yield the floor. We have a \nmutual friend, Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, who has a favorite \nsaying on the floor of the House about Members of Congress posing for \n``holy pictures.'' In this situation, with the vote the Harkin \namendment asked for in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans said we \nare against this Bush policy of cutting 8 million Americans off of \novertime pay, and then the House of Representatives in instructing \nconferees said we are against this Bush policy, so that all of us were \nposing for this big group picture--holy picture--on how we are standing \nwith American workers.\n  In a matter of 5 minutes, as the gavel is struck in the conference \ncommittee, the Bush White House prevailed and this rule striking \novertime for 8 million American workers is signed into law by the \nPresident. Is that the final result, until your amendment comes along, \nI hope?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The final result is the rules are still pending. They \nhave not implemented them yet. As I understand it, they want to get the \nrules finalized by March, which is next month. So they want to finalize \nthe rules, put them out there, and it is going to be very hard for us \nto turn them back again. But we will. The American people will not \nstand for having their overtime pay protection taken away. Time and a \nhalf, for time over 40 hours a week is something every American worker \ndeserves. Some families rely on that extra time. They give up premium \ntime and they work longer so they make a little extra money to get \ntheir kids through school. Now we are going to say we are going to work \nyou longer, but we are not going to pay you overtime. The American \npeople won't buy that. We are going to continue to fight here to \nprotect their overtime rights.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for this dialog about the budget and \nabout issues involving working families in America. I thank him for his \nleadership time and, again, whether on special education, funding for \ncollege expenses, or protecting American workers on overtime, he has \nbeen a leader in the Senate and he will continue to be. There is much \nmore that needs to be said about this budget. At this point, I will \ndefer to others who want to join in this conversation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for about \n5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his kind words and \nreciprocate by thanking him for his leadership on the floor and in our \ncaucus, and for always being here to respond and make sure we have the \ninformation we need on which to base our votes. We served together in \nthe House and we are together in the Senate, and I could not ask for a \nbetter neighbor either here or across the Mississippi River.\n  I will close by again saying this--and I will have more to say about \nthis later. The budget the President has proposed is just one that will \nharm America. It is going to harm our workers, increase our deficit \nand, quite frankly, it is going to put in jeopardy the Social Security \nand Medicare system.\n  It is a shame all this has been squandered in just 4 years. I believe \nwe in the Senate need to respond, we need to say no to this Bush \nbudget, and we need to have a budget that puts us back on the path we \nwere on just 4 short years ago.\n  With that, we can have a budget that will be in balance, and we can \nhave a future that is much brighter for our workers, for our children, \nand for our elderly.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about the budget in the coming \ndays and weeks before the budget resolution is brought to the floor.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S587-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S587-S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred on April 13, 2001, in San Antonio, TX. A 39-\nyear-old man was attacked in a park because he was thought to be \nhomosexual. After stopping to examine some rocks, the victim was \napproached by a man with a knife who held him in a bear-hug before \nstabbing him in the chest. The attacker used anti-gay slurs as he \nattacked his victim.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S588-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RETIREMENT OF JUDGE BARZ\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a good friend \nof mine, Judge Diane Barz, who is retiring from her successful career \nas a Yellowstone County District Court Judge.\n  Judge Barz is a remarkable woman who has enjoyed a distinguished and \nwonderful career as a member of the Montana Bar. Judge Braz' career is \nnotably one of ``firsts.'' She was the only woman in her University of \nMontana Law Class of 1968, was the first female law clerk to the \nMontana Supreme Court, started the first ``female'' law firm with her \ncolleague Doris Poplar in 1973, was the first woman district court \njudge, and youngest, and the first female attorney appointed to the \nbench of the Montana Supreme Court.\n  Judge Barz has not only been an exemplary attorney and member of the \nbench, she has been a role model for women and champion for children. \nAnyone who has worked with Judge Braz knows that what ever she does, \nshe does it with a leading role. Judge Barz has been instrumental in \nthe development of your court in Montana as we know it today. She \ndoesn't just sit back--she gets the job done! As a member of the bench, \nshe has been gentle and compassionate with children and families when \nthe circumstances required it, but she could be as tough as nails when \njustice demanded it. Most importantly, Judge Braz always aspired to do \nwhat was right for the children and families of Montana. We have all \nbeen well served by her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S588-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH E. LETA\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Joseph E. \nLeta, whose endless enthusiasm and energy promoted many of Colorado's \nsportsmen's organizations. Mr. Leta, who passed away on January 14, \n2004, was a champion of wildlife and conservation programs. Joe was a \nlifetime member of numerous sporting organizations which included in \nSafari Club International, SCIF Sables, Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep \nFoundation, The Mule Deer Foundation, The Elk Foundation, The Alaskan \nand Canadian Outfitters Association, The Wild Turkey Federation, and \nThe National Rifle Association.\n  He had a particular passion for Safari Club International and served \nas President of the SCI Denver Chapter until September 2003. \nConcurrently and subsequent to his tenure as Chapter President, he was \nalso very active at the National level for SCIF by serving on the \nEthics Committee, The Conservation Committee, The Guides and Outfitters \nCommittee, Director of SCIF Nominating Committee, Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Convention Committee, Humanitarian Committee, and as a \nDirector at Large.\n  In recognition of Joe's years of dedicated service, the Safari Club \nInternational will posthumously present him with the President's Award \nat SCI's 32nd Annual Hunters' Convention in Reno, NV in January 2004.\n  As president of the SCI Denver Chapter, he inaugurated the \nestablishment of the SCI Denver Sables, which is a club venue for \nsports women and men dedicated to preserving our hunting heritage \nthrough education. Joe recently proposed that the SCI Denver Chapter \nestablish a scholarship fund for needy junior and senior college \nstudents who major in wildlife and conservation management. As a \ntribute to Joe, the Board of Directors approved the proposal and named \nthe fund The SCIF Sables Joe Leta Hunting Heritage Scholarship Fund.\n  During Joe's tenure as SCI Denver Chapter President, he presided over \nsuch club accomplishments as promoting the Sportsmen Against Hunger \nProgram, which distributed over 3,000 pounds of fresh salmon to \nColorado's various humanitarian food banks. He also presided over \nseveral revenue generating programs for the benefit of the Colorado \nDivision of Wildlife by promoting big game hunting licenses. Numerous \nwildlife students at Colorado State University have received \neducational grants from the SCI Denver Chapter under Joe's direction.\n  Joe was even instrumental in helping the Wyoming Game and Fish \nDepartment by directing SCI funds to construct an anti-poaching cabin \nin one of Wyoming's more remote regions where unlawful hunting was a \nproblem. Joe was also a champion of the newly formed Colorado \nSportsman's Caucus which is a sportsman's support group that interfaces \nwith members of the Colorado Legislature on hunting, fishing and \nvarious other outdoor and wildlife issues.\n  After graduating from Youngstown University and completing a tour of \nduty in the U.S. Air Force as an x-ray technician, Joe joined Picker \nInternational as a sales representative for their Medical Imaging \nEquipment Division. He retired from Picker after 30 years of service as \na regional sales manager.\n  Joe Leta was born July 16, 1931 in New Castle, PA as the only child \nof Joseph and Edith Leta. His wife of 49 years, Shirley and their three \nchildren, Joseph, Jr., Christopher, Lisa (Charles) Stanley, and one \ngrandchild, Lacy, survive him.\n  Joe and Shirley resided in Evergreen, CO for the past 26 years and \nthey are members of Christ the King Catholic Church and the Hiwan Golf \nClub in Evergreen, Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S588-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3724.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2003.''\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Authority.--The term ``Authority'' means the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority.\n       (2) Emergency medical services personnel.--The term \n     ``emergency medical services personnel'' means an individual \n     who provides out-of-hospital emergency medical care, \n     including an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or \n     first responder.\n       (3) Employer; public safety agency.--The terms ``employer'' \n     and ``public safety agency'' mean any State, political \n     subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or any \n     territory or possession of the United States that employs \n     public safety officers.\n       (4) Firefighter.--The term ``firefighter'' has the meaning \n     given the term ``employee engaged in fire protection \n     activities'' in section 3(y) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 203(y)).\n       (5) Labor organization.--The term ``labor organization'' \n     means an organization composed in whole or in part of \n     employees, in which employees participate, and which \n     represents such employees before public safety agencies \n     concerning grievances, conditions of employment and \n     related matters.\n       (6) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n     officer'' has the meaning given such term in section 1204(5) \n     of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3796b(5)).\n       (7) Management employee.--The term ``management employee'' \n     has the meaning given such term under applicable State law in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act. If no such State \n     law is in effect, the term means an individual employed by a \n     public safety employer in a position that requires or \n     authorizes the individual to formulate, determine, or \n     influence the policies of the employer.\n       (8) Public safety officer.--The term ``public safety \n     officer''--\n       (A) means an employee of a public safety agency who is a \n     law enforcement officer, a firefighter, or an emergency \n     medical services personnel;\n       (B) includes an individual who is temporarily transferred \n     to a supervisory or management position; and\n       (C) does not include a permanent supervisory or management \n     employee.\n       (9) Substantially provides.--The term ``substantially \n     provides'' means compliance with the essential requirements \n     of this Act, specifically, the right to form and join a labor \n     organization, the right to bargain over wages, hours, and \n     conditions of employment, the right to sign an enforceable \n     contract, and availability of some form of mechanism to break \n     an impasse, such as arbitration, mediation, or fact finding.\n       (10) Supervisory employee.--The term ``supervisory \n     employee'' has the meaning given such term under applicable \n     State law in effect on the date of enactment of this Act. If \n     no such State law is in effect, the term means an individual, \n     employed by a public safety employer, who--\n       (A) has the authority in the interest of the employer to \n     hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, \n     lay off, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove public safety \n     officers, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively \n     recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is \n     not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the \n     consistent exercise of independent judgment; and\n       (B) devotes a majority of time at work exercising such \n     authority.\n\n     SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.\n\n       (a) Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Authority shall make a \n     determination as to whether a State substantially provides \n     for the rights and responsibilities described in subsection \n     (b).

EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS AND AGREEMENTS.\n\n       A certification, recognition, election-held, collective \n     bargaining agreement or memorandum of understanding which has \n     been issued, approved, or ratified by any public employee \n     relations board or commission or by any State or political \n     subdivision or its agents (management officials) in effect on \n     the day before the date of enactment of this Act shall not be \n     invalidated by the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 8. CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLIANCE.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed--\n       (1) to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and \n     procedures of any law of any State or political subdivision \n     of any State or jurisdiction that provides collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal \n     to or greater than the rights provided under this Act;\n       (2) to prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law \n     that prohibits employers and labor organizations from \n     negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require \n     union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of \n     employment;\n       (3) to invalidate any State law in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act that substantially provides for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in section 4(b) solely \n     because such State law permits an employee to appear on his \n     or her own behalf with respect to his or her employment \n     relations with the public safety agency involved; or\n       (4) to permit parties subject to the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) and the regulations \n     under such Act to negotiate provisions that would prohibit an \n     employee from engaging in part-time employment or volunteer \n     activities during off-duty hours; or\n       (5) to prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under \n     this Act a political subdivision of the State that has a \n     population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 \n     full time employees.\n       For purposes of paragraph (5), the term ``employee'' \n     includes each and every individual employed by the political \n     subdivision except any individual elected by popular vote or \n     appointed to serve on a board or commission.\n       (b) Compliance.--No State shall preempt laws or ordinances \n     of any of its political subdivisions if such laws provide \n     collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that \n     are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Mr. DORGAN proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1072, to \nauthorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and \ntransit program, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 880, after the item following line 6, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1621. EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS \n                   TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Eligible Person.--In this section, the \n     term ``eligible person'' means an individual or entity that \n     is eligible to receive benefits in accordance with section \n     1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308-3a).\n       (b) Exemption.--Subject to subsection (c), part 172 of \n     title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, shall not apply to an \n     eligible person that transports or offers for transport a \n     fertilizer, pesticide, or fuel for agricultural purposes, to \n     the extent determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Applicability.--Subsection (b) applies to--\n       (1) security plan requirements under subpart I of part 172 \n     of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor \n     regulation); and\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2268. Mr. GREGG proposed an amendment to amendment SA 2267 \nproposed by Mr. Dorgan to the bill S. 1072, to authorize funds for \nFederal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit program, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the moral of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

In any \n     judicial review of a determination by the Authority, the \n     procedures contained in subsections (c) and (d) of section \n     7123 of title 5, United States Code, shall be followed, \n     except that any final determination of the Authority with \n     respect to questions of fact or law shall be found to be \n     conclusive unless the court determines that the Authority's \n     decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n       (b) Rights and Responsibilities.--In making a determination \n     described in subsection (a), the Authority shall consider \n     whether State law provides rights and responsibilities \n     comparable to or greater than the following:\n       (1) Granting public safety officers the right to form and \n     join a labor organization, which may exclude management and \n     supervisory employees, that is, or seeks to be, recognized as \n     the exclusive bargaining representative of such employees.\n       (2) Requiring public safety employers to recognize the \n     employees' labor organization (freely chosen by a majority of \n     the employees), to agree to bargain with the labor \n     organization, and to commit any agreements to writing in a \n     contract or memorandum of understanding.\n       (3) Permitting bargaining over hours, wages, and terms and \n     conditions of employment.\n       (4) Requiring an interest impasse resolution mechanism, \n     such as fact-finding, mediation, arbitration or comparable \n     procedures.\n       (5) Requiring enforcement through State courts of--\n       (A) all rights, responsibilities, and protections provided \n     by State law and enumerated in this section; and\n       (B) any written contract or memorandum of understanding.\n       (c) Failure To Meet Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Authority determines, acting \n     pursuant to its authority under subsection (a), that a State \n     does not substantially provide for the rights and \n     responsibilities described in subsection (b), such State \n     shall be subject to the regulations and procedures described \n     in section 5.\n       (2) Effective date.--Paragraph (1) shall take effect on the \n     date that is 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5 ROLE OF FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Authority shall issue regulations \n     in accordance with the rights and responsibilities described \n     in section 4(b) establishing collective bargaining procedures \n     for public safety employers and officers in States which the \n     Authority has determined, acting pursuant to its authority \n     under section 4(a), do not substantially provide for such \n     rights and responsibilities.\n       (b) Role of the Federal Labor Relations Authority.--The \n     Authority to the extent provided in this Act and in \n     accordance with regulations prescribed by the Authority, \n     shall--\n       (1) determine the appropriateness of units for labor \n     organizations representation;\n       (2) supervise or conduct elections to determine whether a \n     labor organization has been selected as an exclusive \n     representative by a majority of the employees in an \n     appropriate unit;\n       (3) resolve issues relating to the duty to bargain in good \n     faith;\n       (4) conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair labor \n     practices;\n       (5) resolve exceptions to the awards of arbitrators;\n       (6) protect the right of each employee to form, join, or \n     assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such \n     activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and \n     protect each employee in the exercise of such right; and\n       (7) take such other actions as are necessary and \n     appropriate to effectively administer this Act, including \n     issuing subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of \n     witnesses and the production of documentary or other evidence \n     from any place in the United States, and administering oaths, \n     taking or ordering the taking of depositions, ordering \n     responses to written interrogatories, and receiving and \n     examining witnesses.\n       (c) Enforcement.--\n       (1) Authority to petition court.--The Authority may \n     petition any United States Court of Appeals with jurisdiction \n     over the parties, or the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit, to enforce any final orders \n     under this section, and for appropriate temporary relief or a \n     restraining order.

Mr. President, we will be closing very shortly but I want \nto make a couple of remarks on the events of the day. The highlight of \nthe day for me personally was the joint session we had earlier today \nwith the presentation by President Aznar of Spain. His address to \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives very much \ncaptured the essence of what makes Spain and the United States of \nAmerica strong allies and friends in the much broader defense of \nliberty.\n  For much longer than many other nations and most other nations, Spain \nhas been a part of United States history and indeed we have been a part \nof Spain's history. As we look back over the time, that history has \nbeen one full of discovery for both sides. It has been an experience \nrich in harmony and discord.\n  I was able to talk to the President before as we reviewed that \nhistory and after his speech today. It has been a history that has been \ncharacterized by wars fought against each other and wars fought \nalongside each other.\n  We have had the opportunity to celebrate together the creation of new \ndemocracies. We have celebrated together the defense of existing \ndemocracies, of old democracies. Together, as we look back over the \nlast several years, we have faced the gravest threats to the security \nof free people, and through that togetherness and that partnership we \nhave prevailed, advanced, and progressed.\n  In our hour of need, our response to the acts of terrorism, September \n11, 2001, acts that the President referred to--he referred to that day \nas a terrible day, reflecting, as he did today, that the principles \nthat were attacked that day were the principles Spain had and the \nUnited States had, both countries have, and those very principles and \nvalues were attacked. I believe he used the words ``brutally \nattacked.'' In our hour of need, the Spanish people showed us a \nsolidarity, a friendship, and a compassion that very much were the \nmedicine for the soul of our Nation.\n  Spain--and the President reflects this--has very much been our ally \nin every sense of the word. It was wonderful for us to be able to \nwelcome him today and to listen to his comments in the Halls of the \nCapitol of the United States of America.\n  For me and many others, in the course of the day, as business has \nprogressed on the floor, we have been centered on the response to the \nricin attack in the Dirksen Building now a little over 48 hours ago. I \nam happy to report that everybody is doing fine. A few hours ago I made \nan announcement that the postal system and that people in the postal \nsystem, both inside our buildings and inside our grounds, but also \noutside, are doing fine, which is very good news. I say that because it \nis important to realize that this agent ricin is a deadly agent. It is \na life-threatening agent and, through exposure, could have hurt many \npeople.\n  As I said earlier but want to reinforce, we are making great progress \nin the collection of mail and in examining the Senate office buildings. \nOfficials have moved aggressively. They have moved in an almost \nsymphonic fashion to respond to this insult. As I previously announced, \nthe Russell Office Building will open tomorrow at noon, the Hart Office \nBuilding will open Friday at 9 a.m., and the Dirksen Office Building, \nMonday at 7 a.m. Staff have been patient. Staff have been \nunderstanding. Staff have adapted to this terrible incident, working at \nhome and working wherever they can find a space, sometimes in the \nhallways. I do want to thank my colleagues and the staff for responding \nin this fashion.\n\n  I have previously mentioned that every time I go through the list in \nmy own mind, I leave people out, but all the various people who are \nworking together through the Sergeant at Arms' Office, the Office of \nthe Secretary of the Senate, especially the Capitol Police, the U.S. \nMarines who are here with us, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Environmental Protection Agency, the various law \nenforcement agencies that have responded, the postal workers, the \npostal system across the United States of America in what has truly \nbeen remarkable when we think of what we have gone through, with \nanthrax 2\\1/2\\ years ago and a number of other incidents.\n  Looking back over the 200-year history of this wonderful celebrated \nbuilding, probably the most celebrated building in the world, the place \nhas been burned down essentially, has been attacked, has been assaulted \nagain and again, but the institution itself, just like the people who \nare here, who are working here every day, has responded with a \nresiliency that is truly remarkable. There is a toughness and an \nability to bounce right back.\n  We have not missed a step in terms of conducting the Nation's \nbusiness in spite of the really tragic occurrence of the last several \ndays.\n  I will close on this particular issue, again talking about my own \nstaff who responded so admirably. I have my own staff who are in the \nmailroom, and when they see something is not quite right, they use \nprocedures that they have been trained in and that we have all focused \non very much in terms of our procedures. They immediately responded \nappropriately and handled that operation in an appropriate way with \nevaluation of the room, notification of the appropriate personnel, and \nthe appropriate response. Without that, people could have been hurt and \ncould have died.\n  It is nice to be able to see that and commend the people working in \nsuch an environment. Unfortunately, these are the realities we have \nseen, anthrax 2\\1/2\\ years ago, ricin today, Capitol Police officers \nassaulted in this building and killed not too long ago. The resiliency \nis truly remarkable in this great institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/04/senate-section/article/S597-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S597-S598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
