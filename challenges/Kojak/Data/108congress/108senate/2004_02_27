Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration \nof the gun manufacturers liability bill. We have made real progress \nover the course of the week. The managers are here to discuss the \nlegislation and other Senators are expected to come to the floor for \nfurther debate over the course of the day.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today. Therefore, the next vote will \noccur on Monday. As to the timing of that vote on Monday, I will have \nmore to announce over the course of the day after consultation with the \nbill managers and the Democratic leader.\n  Pursuant to the agreement that was reached on Wednesday, we will \nfinish this bill on Tuesday. I thank everyone for their assistance in \nreaching that consent agreement. I commend the bill managers for their \nefforts during the negotiations.\n\n\n                        Highway Reauthorization\n\n  We have a very important outstanding issue before we finish our \nbusiness this week. As Members know, the current highway authorization \nexpires this weekend. Thus, it is imperative that we pass an extension \nof the authorization before we conclude our work today. I have talked \nto Members on both sides of the aisle, as well as to our House \ncounterparts, as to how best to achieve this temporary extension.\n  Yesterday the House passed a 2-month extension, and they have \nadjourned for the week. Regardless of what Senators think about the \nlong-term solution for this legislation--legislation which we debated--\nwe have an issue that we must settle today in terms of the extension. \nThe House, again, passed a 2-month extension. They sent that to us and \nthey have adjourned.\n  The real issue is that we absolutely must extend the current law to \nkeep people working until we find some agreement. We will need to \naddress this over the next several minutes because of the sense of \nurgency, the significance of not passing this highway extension today, \nthis week. That is because beginning Monday, 3 days from now, no funds \nwill be available to pay\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nfor the operation of surface transportation programs or the salaries of \nindividuals who run them. That is why we must act today.\n  That means, as of this Monday, more than 4,600 Department of \nTransportation employees will be furloughed, if we fail to act today. \nThe Federal Highway Administration will have to stop paying bills on \nMonday. That includes reimbursements to States for ongoing highway \nprojects.\n  Federal Highway Administration employees, 2,925 Federal Highway \nAdministration employees, will be furloughed, in Washington, DC, and, \nindeed, in State offices around the country. If they are furloughed on \nMonday, these Federal Highway Administration employees will not be able \nto carry out the necessary steps required to approve the federally \napproved, funded highway projects. We have construction contractors and \ntheir suppliers who will suffer economic losses and hardships.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also will be \naffected. They would have to stop paying bills on Monday. There are 630 \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration employees who would be \nfurloughed. The operation of our Federal highway safety programs would \nbe dramatically impacted. States would receive no Federal funding for \nthings such as alcohol-impaired driving and safety belt programs.\n  In addition, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration would \nhave to stop its operations. The Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nemployees, numbering 1,078, would have to be furloughed, and the agency \nand its partners would not be able to carry out the new entrant safety \naudits on motor carriers.\n  The issues go on and on. I state those at the outset because by the \nend of the day we have to come to some agreement to make sure that what \ncould happen doesn't happen. It is important for people to understand \nthe significance of where we are, in particular the leadership, as we \naddress the other important issues we will talk about shortly.\n  For clarification, the House sent us two vehicles, a 2-month \nextension as well as a 4-month extension. The House is not in session \ntoday. The practical reality is we must pass one of the extensions--I \nthink it would be the 2-month extension today--or 4,600 people are \ngoing to be laid off on Monday. We cannot let that happen.\n  Now the challenge is to figure out how we are going to address that. \nAgain, it is a very important issue, which I know my colleague from \nArizona will address shortly and we need to resolve it.\n  At this point, I am prepared to ask unanimous consent to allow us to \npass the short-term extension. I know Senators will want to comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1854-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1854-S1856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3850\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3850, a highway program extension \nbill, which is at the desk. I further ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  (Mr. CHAFEE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Is this the 2-month extension?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. first of \nall, I don't object to taking up the highway extension bill under the \nnormal Senate procedures, which is that the bill is an amendable \nvehicle. That is the normal parliamentary procedure we abide by as we \naddress legislation, so I don't object to taking up the highway \nextension bill under the normal Senate procedures, which makes the bill \namendable. I would obviously have an amendment to the bill.\n  I object to the unanimous consent request that it be taken up and \npassed without debate or amendment.\n  Second of all, we have to make some choices here. The choice is \nwhether we will have a short-term disruption--and I might point out no \nexisting projects now underway would be cut off--of the highway \nprograms, or we renege on our commitment to the families who lost their \nloved ones, brave firefighters and members of law enforcement agencies, \non September 11, 2001.\n  Senator Lieberman and I introduced legislation that created a \ncommission to study the causes of the tragedy of September 11, 2001, \nand also an effort to prevent a recurrence of that terrible tragedy. We \nhave a choice here between a temporary disruption--I might say a minor \none, although it will be described, as it is whenever a government \nagency might be disrupted, as ``Apocalypse Now''--or telling the \nfamilies of those who died on September 11 the Commission will not be \nable to complete its work and part of the reason for it, as described \nby Commission members, is because of failure to cooperate on the part \nof the administration.\n\n  We are faced with a choice. If there is another amendable vehicle \nthat would have an amendment on it that must pass by the House, I would \nbe glad to agree to passage of this extension. If there is any way we \ncould get the other body to agree with what the President has asked \nfor--not Senators McCain and Lieberman, but what the President asked \nfor--and that is an extension of 2 months of the 9/11 Commission, which \nwas reported out of the Intelligence Committee unanimously yesterday, \nthen I would be glad to withdraw my objection.\n  The majority leader just pointed out, this is the end of civilization \nas we know it if these highway employees are deprived of some hours. I \nmight point out we knew when this bill was going to expire. Why is it \nwe do business in such a way that we are faced with a shutdown unless \nwe give an extension, knowing when the bill was going to expire? Most \nimportantly, we all have a choice to make here, including the majority \nleader and the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Nevada. We \nhave a choice. Are we going to face a disruption in some highway \nprojects which, although important, can be fixed and repaired over time \nor are we going to abandon the families of 9/11 who demanded and \nreceived the appointment of a commission that would thoroughly and \ncompletely investigate the events that led up to one of the greatest \ntragedies in American history? That is our choice. I intend to again \nobject to this unanimous consent agreement.\n  I will agree to taking up the highway extension bill and to not \nblocking it if I am allowed to amend it. I cannot dictate the schedule \nof the other body. But I do know the President of the United States, \nthe majority leader, a majority of the Senate, the members of the 9/11 \nCommission, and the families of those who died want this Commission to \nbe able to complete its work and, by God, we should honor that \ncommitment to them.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I intend \nto join Senator McCain in this objection. Let me say this briefly \nbecause he has spoken clearly and powerfully. Life is about choices. We \ndon't take any pleasure in stopping the extension of the highway law \nand the consequent disruption that may occur. There are priorities \nhere.\n  As I see this, the objection we are registering in pursuit of an \nextension of the time limit or deadline of the work of the September 11 \nCommission, as agreed to by the White House, as requested by the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission led by the distinguished former Governor of \nNew Jersey, Republican Tom Kean, as demanded by the families of the \nvictims of September 11, that has to take precedence in the choices we \nmake.\n  I believe the work of this Commission is a critical element in the \nlarger war on terrorism because the work of this Commission is to \ndetermine independently, aggressively how did September 11 happen. \nSeptember 11 occasioned the official commencement of our war on \nterrorism. Unless we exhaust every opportunity to determine how it \nhappened, we cannot feel we are successfully prepared to fight and win \nthe war on terrorism and to protect the American people at home from \never having to suffer again the kind of devastating attack we suffered \nSeptember 11, 2001. It is that important.\n  Senator McCain and I introduced this proposal in the fall of 2001 to \ncreate the Commission. It took more time than it\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\nshould have to create it. It has been created. The Commission has had \nmore trouble than it should have had obtaining documents, including \nnoncooperation--or at least footdragging by folks in the \nadministration, which I don't understand, because we are all on the \nsame side here. It is possible had that kind of delay not occurred, the \noriginal deadline of May 27 of this year for the work of the Commission \nwould have been adequate. It is not.\n  The bipartisan commissioners have told us that the White House has \nagreed--to the President's credit and the administration's credit--that \na 2-month extension is necessary, to July 27, plus an additional month \nfor the Commission to wind down after it issues its report and the work \nit is doing.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously reported out such a \nproposal yesterday. I don't believe there is any objection to it here \nin the Senate. There is bipartisan support. Yet some of our friends in \nthe House leadership apparently do object. With all respect, I say they \nare plain wrong. I don't understand it.\n  Therefore, Senator McCain and I are faced with a choice. We have to \nmake a choice. We have made the choice and, in doing so, respectfully, \nthere may be consequences to this highway bill. I join the Senator in \nsaying we would be happy to have another vehicle that the House will \ndefinitely have to take up to get this done. It is that important.\n\n  We do not live in ordinary times. We have constitutional \nresponsibilities to provide for the common defense and to insure \ndomestic tranquility. To me, with all respect to the consequences of \nnot extending the highway law--and they are real--they pale in \nsignificance to not giving this commission the extra time it needs to \ncomplete its work.\n  Here again, the Congress is challenged procedurally to find a way to \nallow what I think every Member of the Senate wants to happen. That is \nwhy Senator McCain and I are standing up and basically crying out to \nour colleagues: Help us. Don't just help us, help the country \nsuccessfully prosecute the war on terrorism with the information that \nwill result from this Commission's report. Help us honor the memory of \nthe 3,000 who were killed on September 11, 2001, and help us respond to \nthe understandable appeals of the families of the victims of September \n11, of which about 114 families live in the State of Connecticut.\n  It is for those reasons, respectfully, that I join Senator McCain in \nthis objection.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me make several points in response \nbecause we are going to work this out in some shape or form. I am not \nexactly sure how yet, but the challenge has been laid out.\n  We have two independent issues that my two colleagues are rightfully \nlinking, but by linking them, 5,000 Americans and their families are \ngoing to be hurt. I would argue they are being hurt by their proposal--\nit can be blamed on all sorts of situations as to how we got to where \nwe are, but the point is, if the action they propose is taken, 5,000 \nfamilies who have nothing to do with the Commission--they are separate \nissues--these transportation families are going to be hurt \nunnecessarily by their action today.\n  I hope what I have just said is proven right by us working together \ntoday and settling this matter because what they propose, because the \nHouse is out of session and because the bill is before us, if amended, \ncannot be acted upon by the House until next Tuesday night, and 5,000 \ntransportation families will be hurt by what they are insisting upon. \nTherefore, that is unacceptable to me.\n  I say that very quickly. Let me say that I support the extension. \nBoth Senators who have spoken know I am a supporter of their \ninitiative. The President of the United States supports their \ninitiative of an extension. But I am not going to have 5,000 families \nhurt unnecessarily today. That is what we need to work out. That is No. \n1.\n  No. 2, the Commission--I have talked mainly about transportation--the \nCommission about which my colleagues from Arizona and Connecticut \ntalked so eloquently, and the families, my commitment is to them to \nalso make sure through this Commission that we have an extension, and I \nwill use all the powers that a leader has in his caucus to make sure \nthat Commission has sufficient time and access in fairness to the \nbenefit of those families. They deserve that. It is very important the \nfamilies understand that is my commitment as majority leader of the \nSenate and that is what the majority of the Senate believes. Though we \nare having a disagreement with the House, in part, I am confident we \nwill be able to work through that, as well.\n\n  The reason I say these 5,000 families do not have to be hurt, with \npaychecks stopping, a big furlough, don't show up for work, which has \nreal repercussions throughout our transportation system, is that what \nwe decide today on extension of the Commission will not have any impact \nif we can make that same decision a week from now or 2 days from now or \n3 days from now.\n  Why do I say that? Because the Commission is still working. It is \nworking February, March, April, and May. The Commission is underway. \nThey are doing their work. Originally, on May 27, the Commission is \nsupposed to end, and the idea is extending it 2 months beyond that, \nwhich, again, I support. But the Commission is underway. We do not have \nto hurt 5,000 people in transportation families which will affect our \ninfrastructure today because the Commission is working and we can still \naddress the extension.\n  There is no urgency about addressing the extension today. I \nunderstand my colleagues are using the leverage of this must-pass \ntransportation bill, in my mind, to force the vote today on the \nextension. But for me, it does not have to be done today. I pledge to \nkeep working with them.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me go through my points quickly because it is \nimportant for people to understand we have been working on this for the \nlast couple of days. I have been working with the Senator from Arizona, \nand he knows my commitment in trying to work out alternatives.\n  The Senators from Arizona and Connecticut asked if there is another \nvehicle on which we can put this extension that is a must-do that will \nget through the system and make sure it will happen, which is their \nobjective and my objective. The problem with that--and again we had \nthis discussion--is, What vehicle does he suggest?\n  I suggested the adjournment resolution. That is usually a must-do. \nBut then the response to that was that is not certain these days for \nall sorts of reasons. Can we put it on the underlying bill that is \npending before the Senate, the gun liability bill? That may not quite \nwork because we don't know what the outcome of that bill is going to \nbe.\n  I mention that only to say, let's work together, and if we can agree \non another amendable vehicle, then I am willing to work with that, and \nI will do everything I can. I think we can be successful. The problem \nis when you set a bar that is going to become law in the next few days, \nit is impossible.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. One other point, because it is going to be important as we \ngo forward, has to do with what the Intelligence Committee did \nyesterday. Again, all of the Senators are aware that the Intelligence \nCommittee yesterday, on Thursday, marked up a bill which is consistent \nwith what I believe and what the Senator from Arizona believes, that a \n2-month extension is appropriate. They marked up that legislation. We \nare going to hotline that bill right now to see if we can get unanimous \nconsent for that bill. I just want to put that on the table. Again, it \nis a freestanding bill that later this morning I will ask unanimous \nconsent that we address. That bill would be brought to the floor and \npassed, which again is exactly what the families want, what Senator \nMcCain wants, what Senator Lieberman wants, what the President of the \nUnited States, I suppose, the administration wants and would ask that \nmy two colleagues at least consider that approach as well.\n\n  Let me close and say it is unnecessary to hurt these 5,000 people \ntoday. There are alternatives that will allow the Commission, if we \nwork together, to be extended, if that is the will of the\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nSenate. We would be unnecessarily hurting our transportation community \nby linking two unrelated issues just to use leverage to get this \nextension passed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for one \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me yield to the Senator from Connecticut and then the \nSenator from Arizona, or either one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just have a brief question for the \nmajority leader. In case he missed the morning Washington Post, it says \nthat the independent commission investigating the September 11, 2001, \nattacks will have to consider scaling back the scope of its inquiry and \nlimiting public hearings unless Congress agrees by next week to give \nthe panel more time to finish its work, its chairman. Governor Keane, a \nRepublican chairman, said that their ability to conduct their \ninvestigation will be impaired permanently and severely unless Congress \nacts by next week.\n  Mr. FRIST. In response to the Senator's question, I have not read the \narticle today, but I am glad he pointed it out. Let's do it by next \nweek and not hurt 5,000 people with an unrelated issue trying to use \nleverage that he knows we have no alternative to deal with on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I am glad he pointed it out. Let's deal with it next week. He knows I \nam working to deal with it, which shows it does not have to be dealt \nwith today and hurt 5,000 people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The majority leader is incorrect. This article was last \nFriday, talking about this week, the chairman of the panel talking \nabout this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and the leader.\n  My friend from Arizona is right. That is the first thing I wanted to \npoint out that it was February 20, 1 week ago, in the Washington Post \nthat Governor Keane made those statements.\n  I will give a quote from him:\n\n       Every week that goes by makes the extension less valuable. \n     When you have to work toward the earlier deadline, you have \n     to start cancelling things and you can't go over things quite \n     as clearly as you might like.\n\n  This is last Friday. He says:\n\n       Congress comes back into session next week and we really \n     need to hear something by then.\n\n  We all know we would not be here doing this if the leadership in the \nHouse at one point had not said quite clearly that they were not going \nto let this extension pass, notwithstanding the fact that the \nCommission requested it, the President has accepted the extension, and \nit is pretty clear to me, Senator Frist, the leader, the Democratic \nleadership, all support the extension.\n  Unfortunately, the nature of the presses that often breaks down here, \nthe only way one can get done what one really thinks is necessary in \nthe national interest is to stand up and say, stop.\n  Of course, we do not want to put those 5,000 families at a \ndisadvantage even temporarily, but we do not have an alternative.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is it the contention of both the Senators that the \nCommission right now has had to shut down this week because we have not \nallowed this extension?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No, not at all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Is that what the Senator from Arizona is basically \nimplying, that the Commission has cut back this week or if it is not \nsettled today that the Commission has been compromised?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond by again repeating what was in last \nweek's Washington Post: The independent Commission will have to \nconsider scaling back the scope of its inquiry, limiting public \nhearings, unless the Congress agrees by next week--that is this week--\nto give the panel more time.\n  They may not have to shut down but certainly their ability to conduct \ntheir investigation, according to the chairman of the Commission, Mr. \nKeane, former Governor of New Jersey, a Republican, says would be \nimpaired.\n  Every week that goes by makes the extension less valuable, and when \nthey have to work toward the earlier deadline they have to start \ncancelling things and cannot go over things quite as clearly as they \nmight like. There is a certain urgency, obviously, to Governor Keane's \nplea that we act this week.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me go ahead, because I had asked that \nwe further explore the only option I see, and again I think we ought to \nat least address that. If we do what the Senator from Arizona has \nproposed, 4,600 employees cannot show up for work, are not going to be \npaid and are going to be hurt if we accept their proposal. So I ask \nthat they consider the proposal which I mentioned a few minutes ago, I \nsaid we would be hotlining, and to take the bill that was passed out of \nthe Intelligence Committee yesterday, that does exactly what they want, \nwhat I want, which is to extend the Commission, and pass that as a \nfreestanding bill. So as majority leader, I am prepared to get this \nbill done this minute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1856-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXTENSION OF FINAL REPORT DATE OF NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST \n                     ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for \nhis request.\n  Before the distinguished minority assistant leader leaves the \nChamber, I want to say I appreciate the good work of the majority \nleader and the minority to try to resolve this roadblock.\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n  What we have before us is a false choice posited by the Senators from \nArizona and Connecticut. It does not matter how much they try to hold \nhostage the extension of the highway bill to keep these people working, \nthere is no guarantee--and they cannot guarantee--that the House would \naccept whatever they put on.\n  They can hold this body hostage, and they have shown their \nwillingness and ability to do so, but should they be able to add an \namendment to the highway extension, or now that we have passed the bill \non extending the 9/11 Commission, it still has to go to the House.\n  The action of the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday was not \nunanimous. There are many other issues that should be debated about \nthat bill, but I was not here to object and no one objected to passing \nthe bill from this body to extend the 9/11 Commission.\n  It is important to realize this Commission was set up a long time \nago. They knew their deadline was May 27, and if one were to ask the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, who appointed members of the \nCommission, I believe he said at the time that the problem with \ncommissions is we give them a lot of time and a lot of money and they \ndo not always come up with the deadline.\n  They have had this time. They have had extensive hearings. Now the \nquestion is whether the House will accept the proposal that the Senate \nhas adopted to extend the 9/11 Commission for 2 more months.\n\n  This body cannot hold hostage the other body. What the Senators from \nArizona and Connecticut are doing is seeking to hold hostage the whole \nhighway program in the United States. If they hold that hostage, there \nis no assurance that even next week there will be agreement by the \nHouse to take a bill with the 9/11 Commission.\n  TEA-21's current extension expires on Sunday. If we fail to extend \nthis, there will be a shutdown of any further contract authority for \nFederal aid highway projects and a shutdown of payments for work \nalready contracted for by the States and performed by contractors. This \nmeans no further projects can be approved or awarded. It also means \nthat not only the Federal Highway Administration but also the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier \nAdministration, as well as the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, \nwill cease operation.\n  The Federal Highway Administration said that 2,925 employees will be \nfurloughed. These are not just employees in Washington but Federal \nemployees in every State office throughout the Nation, including those \nin the States of Arizona and Connecticut. This also does not even \ninclude the many contractors that will be affected by the shutdown.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration employees would \nalso be furloughed affecting about 630 Federal employees. The Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration would stop operation. This action \nwould put out of work 1,078 employees, and that does not even include \nthe Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n  All told, 4,633 people will not be able to report to work on Monday, \nMarch 1, if this bill is held hostage to a proposition that may or may \nnot be acceptable sometime or any time by the House of Representatives. \nNot only are we talking about people's livelihoods, we are shutting \ndown the Federal agencies, which will have an adverse consequence for \nour Nation's highways, motor carrier safety, and consequentially for \nthe condition and operation of our Nation's surface transportation \nsystem.\n  The Federal Transit Administration will be affected without passage \nof this extension. This is a time when the States are reaching the most \nintense quarter of the fiscal year for announcing construction \nprojects.\n  States, particularly those that have seasonal construction award \nperiods, and others that have work immediately prepared to go to bid, \nwill be effectively stopped from making further awards or bid lettings \nthat have not been previously approved. Construction and other \ncontractors will suffer economic loss with the potential for smaller \noperators to suffer substantial economic hardship. Many of the \nbusinesses and many of the operations involved are small businesses \nthat would effectively be cut off from their ability to be paid for \ntheir work if we refuse to do this extension.\n  Jobs will be lost in the private sector. Immense harm could happen. \nIt is not possible to calculate immediately the actual job impacts for \nshutdown outside the workforce, but there was a survey, AASHTO's August \n2003 survey, which emphasized that perhaps 90,000 jobs could be lost if \nwe went to a short-term extension. An extension is bad enough, but a \ncomplete disruption of the program when there are crucial job needs \nacross the country will have an economic impact on the families \ndirectly, and on the economy.\n  Another major problem if we fail to extend it is that further debts \nwill not be paid. In the absence of an extension, the Government will \nnot have authority to continue to reimburse States for projects for \nwhich expenditures by States have already been made. This has caused a \ncashflow crisis, since States are obligated to pay contractors with or \nwithout reimbursement from the Federal Highway Administration. Some \nStates depend on Federal aid funds to pay bond debt service, and the \nhighway trust fund will be charged interest under the Cash Management \nImprovement Act. We need the extension to stop playing politics with \npeople's jobs in this most important legislation.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1857-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1857-S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHARLES TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in 1989, a little known thief and thug \nnamed Charles Taylor set in motion a series of events which have thrown \nthe impoverished nation of Liberia into chaos and its neighboring \nnations into genocide. From Ivory Coast he launched a successful coup \nagainst Liberia's sitting President, Samuel Doe, plunging Liberia into \n15 years of civil war. We are still dealing with the fallout of that \nwar today.\n  The coup, notably, followed after Charles Taylor had escaped from a \nMassachusetts prison in 1985, where he was about to be extradited for \nembezzlement.\n  Groups on all sides of the Liberian conflict have committed \natrocities, including widespread rape, massacres, mutilation and \ntorture, and forced labor of children. There are literally hundreds of \naccounts of villagers having been slaughtered as they tried to flee, \nwomen being raped, children being brutally raped. Such atrocities have \nbeen part of the deliberate policies of Charles Taylor, his government, \nand the groups that fought for him.\n  In the conflict, it is estimated approximately 60,000 to 200,000 \npeople died in the violence, and many more died from hunger, disease, \nand lack of medical care.\n  After the end of the civil war in 1996--it really wasn't a civil war; \nit was more of an attempt by Charles Taylor to use brutality to force \nhis way into Liberia--Charles Taylor became the President of Liberia by \nwinning an election which he won simply by saying if he did not win, he \nwould continue the violence, continue the rape and destruction and \nplunder of the country. Meanwhile, in 1991, civil war erupted in the \nneighboring country of Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is one of the most \nimpoverished nations in the world, which is particularly tragic in \nlight of the fact that it has some tremendous natural resources. The \nconflict was primarily between the Government of Sierra Leone and a \nrebel group known as the Revolutionary United Front. The RUF lacked any \ndiscernible political agenda other than violence and plunder. Its main \nobjective was to take control of the Sierra Leone diamond mines.\n  The RUF became notorious for its use of forced amputations to control \nthe civilian population. The conflict between the government and the \nRUF and other factions has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and \nthe displacement of more than 2 million people, well over one-third of \nthe population.\n  The situation in Sierra Leone became so bad in 1999 the United \nNations established a peacekeeping mission. This mission was called \nUNAMSIL and has\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\ncost the U.S. taxpayers a total of $646 million over a period of 6 \nyears. This mission got off to a rocky start. The British intervention \nin 2000 helped stabilize the situation, and we should congratulate the \nBritish for being willing to step up to this issue.\n  Today, Sierra Leone is a relatively stable country, which is quite a \nmiracle. It is widely known that the then-Liberian President, Charles \nTaylor, during the time of the violence in Sierra Leone, was \nessentially the force behind the RUF. He was supplying the weapons, the \ntraining, and it was his purpose to use the RUF to control the diamond \ntrade. For his support, he got a great amount of the resources in the \ndiamond trade. This is an important point because herein lies two roots \nof the cause of Sierra Leone's woes: First Charles Taylor, and second, \nconflict diamonds.\n  We have addressed the issue of conflict diamonds through the \nKimberley Process, which is something that our committee has played a \nmajor role in driving forward, where we now have some control over the \ntypes of diamonds that are sold into the international market and \nwhether or not they are conflict diamonds.\n\n  We have also attempted to address Charles Taylor. This is why I come \nto the floor today, to talk about where we stand in addressing Charles \nTaylor. Back in Liberia, around the time that the mission to Sierra \nLeone got underway, the anti-Taylor forces began to mobilize and to \nactively fight the Taylor government in Liberia. In 1999, an anti-\nTaylor faction called the Liberians United for Reconciliation and \nDemocracy, LURD, was formed in northern Liberia. In 2003, a second \nanti-Taylor faction called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia, or \nMODEL, emerged in the southern Liberia area. Both groups have been \naccused of atrocities similar to those committed by the Taylor forces.\n  As the situation in Liberia worsened in the summer of 2003, the \nUnited States came under intense pressure to intervene. At one point, \nthe U.S. sent marines in to protect U.S. citizens in Monrovia and to \nconduct an assessment of the situation in Monrovia. On September 19, \n2003, with U.S. support, the United Nations established a full-blown \npeacekeeping mission to Liberia, ordering the deployment of some 15,000 \ntroops. One month later Congress responded by appropriating $245 \nmillion to cover the U.S. cost of the UNMIL project, which is the U.N. \ninitiative there--$200 million for humanitarian aid in Liberia. In the \nfiscal year 2005 budget request, the State Department has requested \nanother $215 million for UNMIL. I am told the amount fell short of what \nthe U.S. believes its share of the cost will actually be. I am unclear \nwhat will be required to stabilize Liberia, but it is estimated that \n40,000 combatants, including 15,000 children, must be disarmed, \ndemobilized, and reintegrated into society.\n  Hundreds of thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their \nhomes during the wars must be reintegrated into their villages from \nsqualid refugee camps in and outside Liberia. Liberia's infrastructure \nmust be rebuilt. So it is an expensive and long path.\n  In the fall of 2002, the neighboring and equally unstable country of \nIvory Coast also collapsed into violence. Charles Taylor is known to \nhave recruited some of his mercenary fighters in Ivory Coast. He is now \nreported to have supported rebels in west Ivory Coast who were trying \nto oust the President of Ivory Coast. He is now reported to be \nsupporting the rebels in west Ivory Coast that seek to oust the \nPresident of Burkina Faso, a neighboring country that has enjoyed \nrelative stability.\n  The U.N. is expected to take a vote as early as tomorrow, or maybe \neven today, on the establishment of another U.N. peacekeeping mission \nto Ivory Coast. The State Department has informed me that the United \nStates will vote for such a mission. The U.S. share of that cost will \nbe about $60 million.\n  Both Sierra Leone and the Liberian missions are attributable in large \npart to Charles Taylor. It is clear that Taylor is also heavily \ninvolved in the Ivory Coast conflict. We know he continues to dabble in \nother west African countries.\n  The conflicts that plague west Africa have many common denominators, \nbut the one that stands out is Charles Taylor. Another one that stands \nout is the amount of death, destruction, and loss of economic well-\nbeing that has occurred in that region as a result of Charles Taylor's \nactions.\n  In 2000, with strong U.S. backing, the U.N. and the Government of \nSierra Leone began the process of establishing a special court for \nSierra Leone. The mission of the Special Court is to try those who bear \nthe greatest responsibility for the genocide which occurred in Sierra \nLeone and to try them under Sierra Leone law.\n\n  The Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted Charles Taylor as its \nfirst act. As its first act, it indicted the President of Liberia. He \nis accused of 17 counts of war crimes against humanity, and other \nserious violations of international humanitarian law.\n  But where is Charles Taylor? Not in prison awaiting trial where he \nshould be. He is living in a luxury villa in the southeastern port city \nof Calabar, Nigeria. He is able to live in luxury because of the timber \nhe plundered from Liberia and the diamonds he plundered from Sierra \nLeone, much of which can be tracked to terrorists. He is able to live \nin luxury because he was allowed to leave Liberia and to go to Nigeria.\n  When the situation in Monrovia last summer became so bad that his \nsafety could no longer be assured, Taylor began looking for an escape \nroute.\n  As pressure mounted in the international community for an \nintervention in Liberia, key players such as the U.S., U.N., the \nEconomic Community of West African States--ECOWAS--and Nigeria \ncorrectly realized that a peace agreement--a necessary precursor to \nU.N. intervention--could not include Taylor, an indicted war criminal. \nFurther, the parties recognized that even if an agreement could be \nreached, the rebels would never trust Taylor to abide by it, given his \nlong history of reneging on peace agreements. So Taylor had to go--and \nfast.\n  The U.S., U.N., ECOWAS, and Nigeria engaged in talks about how to get \nTaylor out of Liberia. An agreement was reached in which Nigeria would \noffer Taylor asylum, but would not then be pressured to turn Taylor \nover. The details of these talks are vague, but finding a way to bring \nTaylor to the Special Court was reportedly not even discussed. But such \na promise to Nigeria--that it would not be pressured to hand over \nTaylor--should not have been made.\n  The parties involved decided that getting Taylor out of Liberia was \nthe fastest way to ``stop the bloodshed.'' I would argue that, indeed, \ngiving Taylor asylum in Nigeria was the surest way to prolong the \nbloodshed. Now safely ensconced in Nigeria with a hefty security \ndetail, Taylor is arguably in a better position now to destabilize \nLiberia and other West African nations. I will come back to this point.\n  Taylor, astutely, took Nigeria up on its offer of asylum. And on \nAugust 11, 2003, he and his entourage of 100 flew to Nigeria. Taylor \nused Nigeria's offer to escape both the rebels and prosecution by the \nSpecial Court.\n  The Nigerians have been offended by Congress' recent calls for them \nto hand over Charles Taylor to the Special Court. The Nigerians should \nbe commended for the important leadership role they have played in this \nand other West African crises. But their past and continued \ncontributions do not justify their refusal to cooperate with the \nSpecial Court. If Nigeria is going to play a leadership role in West \nAfrica, it must be committed to seeing those who destabilize that \nregion stopped and held accountable for their actions. It must be \ncommitted to promoting the rule of law.\n  But the blame does not rest on Nigeria alone. The blame rests equally \non the parties that negotiated for Taylor's transfer to Nigeria instead \nof his delivery to the Special Court--the U.S. and the U.N. It is \ninconceivable that the U.S. and the U.N., which have been driving \nforces behind the Special Court, would cast aside an opportunity to get \nthe Special Court halfway to its goal and would not pursue the first \nperson consequential in their activities of violence in Sierra Leone.\n  Upon his departure from Liberia, Taylor pledged: ``I'll be back.'' \nTaylor has reneged on at least 13 cease fire agreements and 8 peace \nagreements, each time using the negotiations to stall and re-arm. It is \nclear from statements like this and from Taylor's past\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nactions that he intends to use asylum in Nigeria to stall and re-arm, \njust as he has done in the past. The result of this is that, now, no \none believes Liberia has seen the last of Charles Taylor--least of all \nthe Liberians.\n  Very clear conditions were placed upon Mr. Taylor's offer of asylum: \nhe was to completely disengage himself from the day to day affairs--\nmilitary or otherwise--of Liberia. Immediately upon his arrival in \nNigeria, however, Taylor began breaking--flagrantly--the terms of his \nasylum agreement.\n  Taylor has maintained contact with his lieutenants and supporters \nthrough telephone calls, instant messaging, and intermediaries who act \nas couriers. It is also said that Taylor maintains control over \nsubstantial numbers of combatants. Sources told me that Taylor was ``on \na satellite phone every day talking with Liberian officials.'' Even the \nUnited Nations Security Council in October, 2003, then under U.S. \nchairmanship, issued a warning that Taylor should discontinue \ncommunications with his supporters in Liberia.\n  In November, 2003, it was reported that Taylor's former chief of \nstaff was recruiting mercenaries in Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and \nGhana, all small and similarly troubled West African nations. Also in \nNovember, it was reported that Charles Taylor's son was in Ukraine \nnegotiating for arms with which to launch a fresh attack from Ivorian \nterritory.\n  It is reported that Taylor lieutenants and loyalists have carved out \na piece of western Ivory Coast and have clashed with French \npeacekeepers there.\n  It has even been reported by highly reliable sources that Taylor \nengineered the attempted coup in Burkina Faso last October. The reason? \nThe President of Burkina Faso, a former ally of Taylor's, was starting \nto cooperate with the Special Court. It is also thought that Taylor \nsupported the coup because he believes renewed regional chaos would \nassist him in his return to power in Liberia. Taylor is reported to be \ntraining 400 armed men in the town of Guiglo Ivory Coast. This group, \ncalled ``Death Roll M-15'', was reportedly established for the sole \npurpose of destabilizing Burkina Faso.\n\n  These are just reports. It will be partly the Special Court's job to \nconfirm or discredit them. But if even one of these reports is true, \nthat is enough.\n  As long as Taylor's former warlords take their orders from the man \nhimself, no one is going to disarm. I am told that Taylor supporters \nare already, in fact, refusing to disarm because they believe he will \nreturn to power. Anti-Taylor rebels also refuse to disarm because they \ntoo believe Taylor's exile is temporary. They believe they will need to \nmaintain the ability to defend themselves against reprisals or prevent \nhis return to power.\n  Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration, or DDR, is the \nbackbone of all U.N. peacekeeping missions. U.N. peacekeepers do not \nhave the authority to disarm rebels forcibly. Disarmament is always \nvoluntary. What incentive, I ask you, do combatants have to lay down \ntheir arms while their boss is still calling the shots from his mobile \ncommand center in Calabar?\n  Similarly, many Taylor subordinates hold key positions in Liberia's \ntransitional government. What incentive do they have to cooperate on \nnecessary reforms when they too believe that Taylor could one day \nreturn? The longer Taylor escapes justice, the longer UNMIL will last \nand the worse its prospects for success.\n  As if all of this weren't bad enough, I am told by well-placed \nsources that reports of Taylor's link to Al Qaeda and other terrorist \ngroups are ``highly credible''. We have heard public testimony from \nmembers of the Liberian media, now living in the U.S., that Taylor \n``supports terrorists and encourages the presence of al-Qaeda members \nin Liberia''. Taylor's reported motive for supporting terrorists is to \nassure himself access to large amounts of arms.\n  What am I missing here? Why are we so willing to go around cleaning \nup messes created by Charles Taylor, and yet we seem so content to let \nhim live his life peacefully in his villa? He continues to terrorize \nand destabilize, and yet now he does so under the protection of a \nnation that is in danger of becoming an accomplice, though most \ncertainly unwitting, to his crimes.\n  The people of Sierra Leone deserve justice. They deserve the right to \nhave the person who essentially designed and was the brains behind the \nRUF and the atrocities which it committed brought to justice.\n  It sends a terrible signal to Charles Taylor, an indicted war \ncriminal by an internationally recognized tribunal set up by the United \nNations, underwritten by the United Nations and supported with American \ntax dollars. That tribunal has not been able to bring Charles Taylor \nbefore it. The forces which are keeping that from happening are the \nvery forces which set up the tribunal itself. This is not only a bad \nprecedent for the Sierra Leone situation but we know that other special \ncourts are going to be needed to deal with atrocities in other \ncountries, with genocide in other countries. Who is going to take those \ncourts seriously when a court that has been set up by the U.N. and \nunderwritten by the United States finds itself stymied when the person \nit believes is most responsible for the genocide and the horror, the \ndestruction and the death in Sierra Leone is not allowed to be brought \nbefore the court because the intermediaries that allow him to maintain \nhis safe haven in Nigeria are the same people who set up the court? \nNobody is going to take the special court seriously if we do not pursue \nCharles Taylor and bring him to justice before that court. He cannot be \ntried in absentia under Sierra Leone law; he must be present in Sierra \nLeone.\n\n  I have heard that some have the position, maybe we could try him in \nNigeria while doing the trial in Sierra Leone. That does not work \nbecause Sierra Leone does not allow that to happen. Nigeria tried to be \na positive and constructive player in this effort. I congratulate them \nfor their purpose of being constructive and positive. But it is now \ntime to hand over Mr. Taylor. We should support Nigeria in that effort. \nThe United States should support Nigeria in that effort.\n  We are not pursuing the handover of Charles Taylor to the special \ncourt for what I believe are selfish reasons. That we are pursuing the \nTaylor handover is critical to peace and stability in west Africa and \nbecause the people of Sierra Leone deserve justice.\n  I commend the men and women of Sierra Leone. They have gone through \nextraordinary pain and trauma. They have made the difficult decision to \nsupport the special court. They are trying to run a democratic \ngovernment. They have done this with the expectation that the \ninternational community will support the commitments we have made. \nClearly, one of the fundamental commitments we have made is that the \nspecial court, when it indicts an individual, will have the ability to \nbring that person before it.\n  The prosecutor of the special court is a man named David Crane. He is \nan American, a very competent and dedicated former Defense Department \nofficial. Each day, he and his team demonstrate that justice can be \neffectively and efficiently delivered in a war-torn region of the \nworld. We should be proud of what they have done. What they have done \nis incomplete and will continue to be incomplete as long as they are \nnot allowed to bring Charles Taylor before the bar of justice in Sierra \nLeone.\n  It is time for the international community, the U.N., the United \nStates, to put an end to this extraordinarily destructive chapter in \nwest African history. The only way we can put an end to it is if we \nallow the court to try Charles Taylor and bring him to justice. It is \ntime to support that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Gregg for his \nimportant statement.\n  As we all know, Charles Taylor was the brutal dictator of Liberia, \nresponsible for numerous atrocities in West Africa. His loyalists \nraped, killed and hacked the limbs off of innocent civilians. To bring \nMr. Taylor--and others responsible for these crimes--to justice, the \nUnited States and United Nations Security Council established an \ninternational tribunal--the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n  Congress has consistently supported the Special Court by \nappropriating $20 million for it. The Prosecutor for the Special Court \nis an American, a former lawyer in the Defense Department. He moved \nquickly to indict Mr. Taylor for his crimes. To back up this \nindictment,\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nINTERPOL issued a Red Notice asking member states to help bring him to \njustice.\n  Today, Mr. Taylor remains beyond the reach of the court. He is in \nNigeria--shielded by that government. To make matters worse, Taylor \ncontinues to work to destabilize parts of West Africa. The State \nDepartment says it will not pressure Nigeria to turn Taylor over to the \ncourt.\n  This is completely unacceptable. Taylor is under indictment by a UN-\nbacked court. He continues to destabilize parts of West Africa. We know \nwhere he is. The United States needs to act and it needs to act now.\n  Yesterday, Senator Gregg and I--along with 5 other Senators--sent a \nletter to the State Department urging immediate action to get Taylor to \nthe court. It is time for the United States to do the right thing. It \nis time for Taylor to come before the court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1805, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1805) to prohibit civil liability actions from \n     being brought or continuing against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition \n     for damages resulting from the misuse of their products by \n     others.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hatch (for Campbell) amendment No. 2623, to amend title 18, \n     United States Code, to exempt qualified current and former \n     law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the \n     carrying of concealed handguns.\n       Kennedy amendment No. 2619, to expand the definition of \n     armor piercing ammunition and to require the Attorney General \n     to promulgate standards for the uniform testing of \n     projectiles against body armor.\n       Craig (for Frist/Craig) amendment No. 2625, to regulate the \n     sale and possession of armor piercing ammunition.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today we begin the third day of debate on \nthis important bill, S. 1805, addressing the problem that should \noutrage many Members of this Senate and by the cosponsorship we have at \nthis moment, I believe that is the case. That outrage should be against \nthe abuse of our courts by those who cannot change public policy \nthrough representative government but instead are attempting an end run \naround the State and Federal legislatures to impose their political \nagenda on the people of this country through litigation. In this case, \ntheir target is the one consumer product whose access is protected by \nnothing less than the U.S. Constitution itself; that is, firearms.\n  The bill, the Protection of Lawful Commerce In Arms Act, we are \ntalking about today and debated thoroughly yesterday and the day \nbefore, would stop what I call junk lawsuits that attempt to pin the \nblame and the cost of criminal misbehavior on business men and women \nwho are following the law and selling a legal product.\n  This bill responds to a series of lawsuits filed primarily by \nmunicipalities advancing a variety of theories as to why gun \nmanufacturers and sellers should be liable for the cost of injuries \ncaused by people over whom they have no control, criminals who use \nfirearms illegally.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. Let me acknowledge my Democrat sponsor, \nMax Baucus of Montana, for his work on this initiative. Many others \nhave helped advance it, as well as the leaders and the assistant \nleaders on both sides. By that demonstration, this bill is truly a \nbipartisan effort. The cosponsors we have to date are substantial. With \nmyself and Senator Baucus included, we now have 54 cosponsors.\n  We introduced the bill nearly a year ago, last March, with more than \nhalf of the Senate as cosponsors at that time: Senator Alexander, \nSenator Allard, Senator Allen, Senator Bennett, Senator Bond, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Brownback, Senator Bunning, Senator Burns, Senator \nCampbell, Senator Chambliss, Senator Cochran, Senator Coleman, Senator \nCollins, Senator Cornyn, Senator Crapo, Senator Dole, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Ensign, Senator Enzi, Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, Senator Grassley, Senator Gregg, Senator Hagel, Senator \nHatch, Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Johnson, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lott, Senator Miller, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, Senator Nickles, Senator \nRoberts, Senator Santorum, Senator Sessions, Senator Shelby, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Smith, Senator Specter, Senator Stevens, Senator Sununu, \nSenator Talent, Senator Thomas, and Senator Voinovich.\n  This range of cosponsorship reflects extraordinarily widespread \nsupport that crosses party and geographical lines and covers the \nspectrum of political ideologies that is clearly always represented in \nthe Senate. It demonstrates a strong commitment by a majority of this \nbody to take a stand against a trend of predatory litigation that \nimpugns the integrity of our courts, threatens a domestic industry that \nis critical to our Nation's defense, jeopardizes hundreds of thousands \nof good-paying jobs, and puts at risk access Americans have to a legal \nproduct used for hundreds of years across this Nation for lawful \npurposes such as recreation and defense.\n  We have been joined in this effort by a host of supporting \norganizations representing literally tens of millions of Americans from \nall walks of life. I thank them all for their effort to help pass the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. I invite my colleagues to \nconsider a broad cross section of American citizens represented by such \ndiverse organizations as unions, including United Mine Workers of \nAmerica, United Steelworkers of America, United Automobile, Aerospace \nand Agricultural Implement Workers of America, the locals of the \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; business \ngroups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Alliance of \nAmerica's Insurers, the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, and the American Tort Reform \nAssociation, the National Rifle Association; and more than 30 different \nsportsmen's groups and organizations whose members are engaged in the \nconservation and hunting and the shooting sports industry in all 50 \nStates across this great Nation.\n  I have used the term ``junk lawsuits,'' and I want to make it very \nclear, because this was part of our discussion yesterday, to anyone \nlistening to this debate, I do not mean any disrespect to the victims \nof gun violence in any way who might be involved or brought into these \nactions by other groups.\n  Although their names are sometimes used in the lawsuits, they are not \nthe people who came up with the notion of going after the industry \ninstead of going after criminals responsible for their injuries or for \ntheir losses. The notion originated with some bureaucrats and some \nanti-gun advocates, and the lawyers they were with.\n  Victims, including their families and communities, deserve our \nsupport and our compassion, not to mention our insistence, on the \naggressive enforcement of the laws that provide punishment for the \ncriminals who have caused harm to them.\n  There are adequate laws out there now, and we constantly encourage \nour courts to go after the criminal, to lock them up, and to toss the \nkey away when they are involved in gun violence and when they use a gun \nin the commission of a crime. If those laws need to be toughened, our \nlaw enforcement efforts improved, then the proper source of help is the \nlegislatures and the governments, not the courts, and certainly not \nlaw-abiding businessmen and workers who have nothing to do with their \nvictimization. No.\n  The reason there are junk lawsuits is that they do not target the \nresponsible party for those terrible crimes. They are predatory \nlitigation looking for a convenient deep pocket to pay for somebody \nelse's criminal behavior. Let me repeat that. I define junk lawsuits as \npredatory litigation looking for a convenient deep pocket to pay for \nsomebody else's criminal behavior.\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nThey are junk lawsuits by any definition of the word because they are \ndriven by political motives to hobble or bankrupt the gun industry as a \nway to control guns, not to control crime.\n  By definition, the legislation we are considering today aims to stop \nlawsuits that are trying to force the gun industry into paying for the \ncrimes of people over whom they have absolutely no control.\n  Let me stop a minute right here and make sure everyone understands \nthe very limited nature of this bill. I have expressed it. I have \nexplained it. I have talked about it. I have asked all of our Members \nto read S. 1805.\n  What this bill does not do is as important as what it does. This is \nnot a gun industry immunity bill. This bill does not create a legal \nshield for anyone who manufacturers or sells firearms. It does not \nprotect members of the gun industry from every lawsuit or legal action \nthat could be filed against them. It does not prevent them from being \nsued for their own misconduct.\n  Let me repeat that. It does not prevent them--``them,'' the gun \nindustry--from being sued for their own misconduct. This bill only \nstops one extremely narrow category of lawsuits: lawsuits that attempt \nto force the gun industry to pay for the crimes of third parties over \nwhom they have no control.\n  We have tried to make that limitation clear in the bill in several \nways. For instance, section 2 of the bill says its No. 1 purpose is:\n\n       To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \n     ammunition products for the harm caused by the criminal or \n     unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by \n     others when the product functioned as designed and intended.\n\n  We have also tried to make the bill's narrow purpose clear by \ndefining the kind of lawsuit that is prohibited. Section 4 defines the \none and only kind of lawsuit prohibited by this bill. Let me repeat \nthat. Section 4 defines the one and only kind of lawsuit prohibited by \nthis bill. Let me quote:\n\n       a civil action brought by any person against a manufacturer \n     or seller of a qualified product, or a trade association, for \n     damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a \n     qualified product by the person or a third party . . .\n\n  We have also tried to make the narrow scope of the bill clear by \nlisting specific kinds of lawsuits that are not prohibited. Section 4 \nsays they include: actions for harm resulting from defects in the \nfirearm itself when used as intended--that is product liability suits--\nactions based on the negligence or negligent entrustment by the gun \nmanufacturer, seller, or trade association; actions for breach of \ncontract by those parties.\n  Furthermore, if someone has been convicted under title 18, section \n924(h), in plain English, that means someone who has been convicted of \ntransferring a firearm knowing that the gun will be used to commit a \ncrime of violence or drug trafficking, that individual is not shielded \nfrom a civil lawsuit by someone harmed by the firearms transfer.\n  Finally, the bill does not protect any member of the gun industry \nfrom lawsuits for harm resulting from any illegal action they have \ncommitted. Let me repeat that. If a gun dealer, manufacturer, or trade \nassociation violates the law, this bill is not going to protect them \nfrom a lawsuit brought against them for harm resulting from that \nmisconduct.\n  What I have listed for my colleagues' convenience is all spelled out \nin section 4 of the bill. We have been through that section several \ntimes over the last several days. Again, this is a rundown of the \nuniverse of lawsuits against members of the firearms industry that \nwould not be stopped--I repeat, not be stopped--by this narrowly \ntargeted bill.\n  What all these nonprohibited lawsuits have in common is that they \ninvolve actual misconduct or wrongful actions of some sort by a gun \nmanufacturer, seller, or trade association. Whether you support or \noppose the bill, I think we can all agree that individuals should not \nbe shielded from the legal repercussions of their own lawless acts. The \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act expressly does not provide \nsuch a shield.\n  I am going to repeat this again because some opponents continue to \nmischaracterize the bill. This is not a gun industry immunity bill. It \nprohibits one kind of lawsuit: a suit trying to fix the blame of a \nthird party's criminal acts or misdeeds on the manufacturer or seller \nof the firearm used in that crime.\n  Even though this is a narrowly focused bill, it is an extremely \nimportant bill. The junk lawsuits we are addressing today would reverse \na longstanding legal principle in this country that manufacturers of \nproducts are not responsible for the criminal--I repeat, the criminal--\nmisuse of their products.\n  You do not have to be a lawyer to know that runaway juries and \nactivist judges can turn common sense on its head in specific cases, \nsetting precedents that have had dramatic repercussions. The potential \nrepercussions here could be devastating.\n  If a gun manufacturer is held liable for the harm done by a criminal \nfor misusing a gun, then there is nothing to stop the manufacturers of \nany products used in crimes from having to bear the cost of those \ncrimes. Since when is this country going to step to that level? So \nautomobile manufacturers will have to take the blame for the death of a \nbystander who gets in the way of a drunk driver? Yes, there are some \nwho would suggest that. The local hardware store will be held \nresponsible for a kitchen knife it sold that was later used in the \ncrime of rape? A baseball team, whose bat was used to bludgeon a \nvictim, will have to pay for the cost of that crime?\n  Now, does that sound silly to the average listener? It may. But those \nkinds of charges are being brought today because this country does not \nwant to hold its criminal element accountable, in many instances.\n  It is not just unfair to hold law-abiding businesses and workers \nresponsible for criminal misconduct with the products they make and \nsell, but it would also bring havoc to our marketplaces.\n  Hold on to your wallets, America, because those businesses that don't \nactually go into bankruptcy will have to pass their costs through to \nthe consumer. My guess is that many in the anti-gun community would \nsay: That is just fine; if we cannot bankrupt the business, then let's \nprice the product out of the range of the average law-abiding citizen \nwho would like to afford a gun. To the criminal element that probably \nsteals for a living, they may have the kind of funds to buy that gun in \nthe black market at any price, and oftentimes they do.\n  Even without being successful, this litigation imposes enormous \nfinancial burdens on the gun industry. It is important to keep in mind \nthat the deep pocket of the gun industry isn't all that deep. In \nhearings on the House side, experts testified that the firearms \nindustry, taken together--I mean put them all together, look at their \nassets, their income--would not collectively equal one Fortune 500 \ncompany.\n  Last year it was estimated--and we can only estimate because the \ncosts of litigation are confidential business information--that these \nbaseless lawsuits have cost the firearms industry more than $100 \nmillion. Furthermore, don't think these companies can just pass the \ncosts off to their insurer because in nearly every case, insurance \ncarriers have denied coverage.\n  I quote from what a Massachusetts union had to say about the issue, \nthe union whose members work at the Savage Arms Company in Westfield, \nMA:\n\n       Today, we have 160 members from Savage workforce. By \n     comparison, about a dozen years ago, we had over 500 Savage \n     workers who were members of our Local. . . .\n\n  Savage Arms is not alone. Other businesses have closed their doors, \nand the jobs have not been lost because of the sheer cost, the jobs \nhave been lost because of the sheer cost of fighting these junk \nlawsuits.\n  The impact on innocent workers and communities is not the only \npotential repercussion of these lawsuits. If U.S. firearms \nmanufacturers close their doors, where will our military and peace \nofficers have to go to obtain their guns? Do we then have to start a \ngovernment gun manufacturing company? I doubt that the efficiencies and \nthe qualities and the costs would be the same. Surely we don't want \nforeign suppliers to control our national defense and community law \nenforcement, not to mention the ability of individual American citizens \nto exercise their second amendment protected rights through accessing \nfirearms for self-defense, recreation, and other lawful purposes.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n  For all these reasons, more than 30 States have laws on the books \noffering some protection for the gun industry from these extraordinary \nsuits. Support has steadily grown in Congress for taking action at the \nFederal level. This would not be the first time Congress had acted to \nprevent this kind of threat to industries. Some would suggest it is \nunprecedented, it has never happened before.\n  Let me give an example. There are a number of Members in this Chamber \nwho were serving when the Congress passed the General Aviation \nRevitalization Act barring product liability suits against \nmanufacturers of planes that were more than 18 years old. Just a couple \nof years ago, in the Homeland Security Act, Congress placed limits on \nthe liability of a half a dozen industries, including manufacturers of \nsmallpox vaccine and sellers of antiterrorist technologies. These \nare only a couple examples out of a significant list of Federal tort \nreform measures that have been enacted over the years when Congress \nperceived a need to protect a specific sector of our economy or defense \ninterests from burdensome, unfair, and/or frivolous litigation.\n\n  I could go on. I have said enough for the moment. My colleagues are \nhere. Senator Reed, who is handling the opposition, has statements to \nmake. I believe Senator Levin has an amendment he would like to offer. \nBut clearly, this is an issue whose time has come. It is time to step \nout and say: We are not going to suggest to law-abiding citizens that \nyou ought to bear the brunt of the criminal action. That is not the \ncase. Law-abiding citizens already bear a substantial amount of that \nbrunt. Taxpayers usually pick up most of the bills in these tragic \ninstances. That is why enforcing the law, putting those who misuse \nfirearms behind bars, is what it really ought to be all about.\n  But for social purposes, for political purposes, for whatever reason \nthat the anti-gun community has not been able to legislate either on \nthe floor of the Senate, on the floor of the House, or in State \nlegislatures across the Nation, they now run to the court system.\n  We suggest they can't do that, nor should they do that. We want to \nprotect the victims. We certainly want to protect them from the \ncriminal element. Much legislation is talked about now for the victim \nand victims' rights. I support all of those kinds of things. But why \nshould the law-abiding manufacturer of any product in this country, \nthat is quality but simply misused and that misuse takes the life of a \nthird party--why should that manufacturer be responsible? We already \nhave a broad range of areas in which that responsibility is described \nand in which the consumer is protected if that responsibility is not \nfollowed by the manufacturer or those who sell that product in the \nmarketplace. That is an arena that is well litigated today. That is an \narena in tort law that is well spelled out.\n  Here today and in past lawsuits, we have had great imagination that \ntries to cook up the issue of negligence or to redefine it or shape it \nin a way that Americans have said and that tort law has said for \ncenturies: You shall not go there; you cannot go there.\n  Judges are saying that today and have said it consistently in these \nkinds of lawsuits. That doesn't stop the lawsuits from coming. That \ndoes not stop these lawsuits from draining hundreds of millions of \ndollars out of a law-abiding, responsible commercial and manufacturer \nentities.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the legislation before us can't be all \nthings. It can't be an effective barrier against litigation to protect \nthe gun industry and yet a way to protect the legitimate rights of \ncitizens who have been harmed by guns.\n  In fact, it is not both; it is one of them. It is carefully, cleverly \nworded legislation to immunize the gun industry--dealers, \nmanufacturers, and the National Rifle Association--from any type of \nliability with respect to guns, virtually.\n  There are perhaps minor exceptions, but the cases we see before us \ntoday--the case of the DC snipers, the case of two police officers in \nNew Jersey--would be barred. These cases have already been filed. In \nfact, one of the sweeping aspects of this legislation is, it doesn't \nattempt to set the rules prospectively, to say as we go forward these \ncases would not be heard by the courts. It literally walks in and tells \npeople who have filed cases, cases that have survived summary judgment \nmotions already by State court judges: You are out of court.\n  This is sweeping, and it is unprecedented. It deals a serious blow to \ncitizens throughout this country while enhancing dramatically the legal \nprotections for the gun industry.\n  Consistently the proponents say: You can't hold someone responsible \nfor the criminal actions of another. That is not what these cases are \nabout. These cases suggest, declare, allege that an individual failed \nin his or her duties, his or her responsibility to do what is \nnecessary, responsibility in the conduct of their activity--in the case \nof gun dealers, to take sensible, reasonable precautions, the standard \nof care that a business person would use, the standard of care that any \nbusiness person must use in the United States.\n  The allegation is they fail to do that. The evidence is overwhelming \nthere was no standard of adequate care. Here is a gun dealer who could \nnot account for 238 weapons, who claims a teenager--he didn't realize \nit at the time--must have walked in and shoplifted an automatic weapon, \na sniper weapon, and carried it away undetected. In fact, this weapon \nwas missing without his knowledge for weeks and months, undetermined.\n  Is that the standard of care we would expect a businessperson to \nexercise, particularly one who deals in products that can kill? I don't \nthink so. That is what this is about. This is not about punishing \npeople for the criminal activity of others. It is about holding \nindividuals up to a standard of conduct we expect from anyone. There \nare various examples. Some say, my God, if the hardware store sells a \nknife to somebody and it is used in a crime, they are not responsible. \nIf you have a car dealer who leaves the keys in the cars and has no \nsecurity, and a teenager takes that car and gets into an accident and \nharms someone, certainly I think the parents of the individuals harmed \nor that individual could legitimately go to court and say this dealer \ndidn't meet the rational standard of care of anybody in the automobile \nindustry. They have to secure these cars. You cannot make them \navailable to people and teenagers who might steal them. That is common \nsense.\n  That would apply to the automobile dealer, but if this legislation \npasses, common sense doesn't apply to the gun industry in this country. \nIn fact, this is really a license for irresponsibility we are \nconsidering today. As I said before, when they get the Federal firearms \nlicense, if this bill passes, you can get another license. You are \nbeing irresponsible. That is not to suggest all dealers are \nirresponsible, but many are.\n  We talk about junk lawsuits. It is not a junk lawsuit when your \nhusband has been shot while sitting in the bus waiting to go to work. I \ndon't think the Johnson family volunteered to be part of this social \nexperiment. I think any suggestion to that effect is offensive. They \nhave been harmed grievously. A wife has lost her husband; children have \nlost their father. Their livelihoods are in question. They seek \nredress, as anyone would. That is not a junk suit. That is someone who \nsays I have been harmed by the negligence of someone and that person \nshould pay.\n  The suggestion that this suit is in response to some avalanche of \nlawsuits that is devastating the firearm manufacturers is without any \nfoundation. The industry is so stressed they have raised $100 million \nto protect themselves, not just legally, but also in terms of \ncontrolling the documents and communications between themselves and \ntheir attorneys. This is not an industry that seems to be without \nresources. But I can tell you many of the families of victims of the \nWashington snipers are looking forward to a lifetime where they might \nhave the resources to send children to college and do the things they \nwould have been able to do if their spouse was still alive. The \nindustry, it has been suggested, is being pushed into bankruptcy \nbecause of these frivolous junk lawsuits.\n  Well, Savage Arms was mentioned. It is a company that was founded in \n1894. It has provided firearms for now over a century. It went bankrupt \nin 1988 because, according to the CEO, Ron\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nCoburn: ``We had too many products, each of them in dire need of re-\nengineering.''\n  There is no suggestion they were being intimidated by these fancy \npolitical science lawsuits. Under the bankruptcy plan, Coburn reduced \nthe product line and fired 400 employees. There has been contraction in \nthis industry, as in every manufacturing industry, but it is not as a \nresult of these suits.\n  Since that time, Savage has done remarkably well. They have taken the \nlead in many different aspects. They are a responsible company. They \nwere honored as manufacturer of the year and in many other aspects. It \nhas been suggested this company, in effect, is overwhelmed by these \nlawsuits. I don't think that is the case. I think they make business \njudgments as any business--based upon products, demand, and all these \nthings.\n  We are not facing a situation where we would be without the benefit \nof gun manufacturers in the United States because of these lawsuits. \nThe suggestion that this somehow would interfere with our national \nsecurity is outlandish. The suggestion we would then have to turn to \nforeign suppliers for our military is rather odd. Indeed, today, many \nof the suppliers for our national defense are the subsidiaries of \nforeign companies. Browning, Winchester and Fabrique Nationale, which \nsupplies M-16 A-4 assault rifles and the M-2 49G squad automatic \nweapon, are subsidiaries of Herstal, a Belgium firm. The Pentagon \ncontracted with Heckler and Koch, a German firm, to help develop the \nnext generation of industry weapons.\n  Clearly, the Pentagon doesn't feel American manufacturers are so \ndistressed that they have to go overseas. They are going overseas \nbecause they are looking for superior weapons. They are dealing with \nAmerican subsidiaries of foreign companies. This is not about \npreserving the defense and the ability to access weapons. This is about \nprotecting one industry from the legal responsibility to exercise \ncaution any individual must exercise--one industry, when all industries \nmust do that, or indeed the vast majority. This is not about protecting \nthe integrity of the courts. What does it say to the integrity of the \ncourts of West Virginia when a judge already found that a suit \ninvolving these two New Jersey police officers should proceed, when we \nsay, no, you are wrong, this case is out the door? This is not about \nprotecting courts. It is about protecting an industry.\n  We have been asked to look closely at the law. We have to look \nclosely at the law in terms of the cases we know are pending because, \nfrankly, we could hypothesize about cases in the future. This is the \nlaw:\n\n       A qualified civil liability action may not be brought in \n     any Federal or State court.\n\n  That is not a particularly narrow excerpt. It is not a listing of \nthose exemptions the gun industry made available themselves. This is \nbroad and sweeping, barring the doors of these types of suits. In \naddition to that--talking about overreaching, dismissal of pending \nactions--it is rare indeed that this Congress could go in and tell \nplaintiffs who have a case in progress you are out the door, you cannot \nproceed. This is extraordinary, to me.\n\n       A qualified civil liability action that is pending on the \n     date of enactment of this act shall be immediately dismissed \n     by the court.\n\n  Not reviewed but dismissed. I think, again, that is extraordinarily \nbroad and sweeping. The real aspect of this legislation goes to the \ndefinition on the next chart.\n\n       A qualified civil liability action means a civil action \n     brought by any person against a manufacturer or a seller of a \n     qualified product or trade association, for damages resulting \n     from the criminal or unlawful misuse of the qualified product \n     by the person or a third party, but shall not include--\n\n  So it is any action, again not narrowly constrained, carefully worded \nlegislation.\n  Then there are several exemptions. Let me point out, if this were a \nnarrowly crafted piece of legislation, the exemption I think should \napply to the gun industry, not to the litigants. It should be those \nsafe harbors where if they do certain things, they are protected, if \nthey exercise due care. That is the way we want to draft narrowly \nworded legislation. And this is quite to the contrary.\n  The burden is now on the individual to show that they qualify to \nbring their case to court, not on the companies to show that their case \nis somehow outside the normal range of negligent actions.\n  The key provision, in terms of the sniper case--and I will talk about \nthe sniper case in a moment--is sections ii and iii. Madam President, \nii is ``actions brought against a seller for ``negligent entrustment'' \nor ``negligence per se.''\n  Negligent entrustment is a defined term in the legislation. It means:\n\n       . . . the supplying of a qualified product by a seller for \n     use by another person when the seller knows, or should know, \n     the person to whom the product is supplied to is likely to, \n     and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable \n     risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n\n  The key element is ``know.'' For example, in the sniper case, the \ndealer claims he did not know that the weapon was missing. It has been \nacknowledged by the sniper that the weapon was shoplifted. This theory \nwill not provide that case to go forward.\n  ``Negligence per se,'' again, is an element of knowledge which does \nnot seem to exist within the facts as we know them about the Bull's Eye \nsituation. By the way, it has been abrogated as a theory of law in \nWashington State which would be an appropriate forum for the trial, or \nat least for consideration. That doesn't work.\n  The next section is actions in which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product who violated a State or Federal statute and, quite \nimportantly, that violation was a proximate cause of the harm.\n  In the case of the sniper shootings, literally it would have to be \nshown that the individual gun dealer at Bull's Eye knew the particular \nweapon was missing more than 48 hours before he was confronted by the \nATF and that he failed to report it and, as a result, the sniper using \nthat weapon inflicted the harm. But, of course, the facts suggest \notherwise. The weapon was shoplifted. The individual claimed he did not \nknow it was missing at all.\n  All of these carefully worded exceptions do not provide relief for \nindividual plaintiffs. They do not provide it for the plaintiffs in the \ncase of the snipers. They do not provide relief in the case of the two \npolice officers in New Jersey. Yesterday, we had an opportunity to \ncorrect that, just a small correction that would allow for these \nsituations, and we failed to do that.\n  This legislation is designed with one purpose: to immunize the gun \nindustry. I think it is unfortunate, it is unprecedented, and it leads \nto the conclusion that we are essentially encouraging the kind of \nreckless behavior, the kind of irresponsible behavior which is not the \nnorm, but it is certainly present and, indeed, it is present in the \ncontext that firearms pose a particular danger to the community.\n  We talked about Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in Tacoma, WA, over 238 \nweapons missing. You are not supposed to have any weapons missing.\n  Then there are the situations, for example, of Buckner Enterprises, \nPro Guns and Sporting Goods, D Discount, Hock Shop, Julie's Pawn, \nKent Arms, Northwest Shooters, Woodstove Supply, and Steve's Guns and \nArchery, all in Michigan.\n  Over a 4-month period, an undercover State trooper and a 20-year-old \nconvicted felon traveled to 14 firearms retailers and attempted to make \na straw purchase. The eight stores I mentioned above agreed to make the \nstraw deal--irresponsible and reckless and, under this legislation, \nperhaps invulnerable to a suit by someone who might have been hurt as a \nresult of the potential straw sales.\n  Bob's Gunshop, Bristol, PA, repeatedly sold firearms to convicted \nfelons and out-of-State residents, including a 9 mm Taurus sold to a \nNew Jersey convicted felon. The owners of the store counseled criminals \nand out-of-State residents to find a local resident to complete the \nbackground check.\n  Is that irresponsible? Yes. Is that against the law? Perhaps not.\n  It goes on and on. One gun store with which I am intrigued is \nIllinois Gun Works in Chicago, IL. John ``No Nose'' DiFronzo, a reputed \nmobster, owns the property where Illinois Gun works is located. \nIllinois Gun Works is one of the leading suppliers of crime guns to \nlocal criminals. This is from the Chicago Sun Times.\n  There are gun dealers out there who are acting irresponsibly and \nnegligently. They will escape liability if this legislation passes. \nThere are manufacturers that are not policing the\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nranks of their dealers effectively enough who continue to sell to \ndealers such as these, who continue to report, as Bushmaster, the \ncompany that manufactured the sniper weapon, reported in regard to \nBull's Eye. They are a good company. Even after all of this, they will \nescape liability.\n  We are in an extraordinarily important moment. Will we extend this \nunprecedented protection to an industry, will we signal to an industry \nthat they can be irresponsible, they can be negligent? That is what we \nare talking about today.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Levin, is here to offer an amendment. \nLet me ask that he be allowed to do that. I retain my time for \nadditional comments later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, may I briefly say, I think the Senator is \nhere for the offering of an amendment, and then I believe Senator \nWarner would like to follow him in the offering of an amendment. If \nthere is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that be the procedure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding the \nSenator from Virginia wants to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Following the Senator from Michigan, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Virginia, is it a \nsecond-degree amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, no, it is a freestanding amendment in no \nway related to the amendment of my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would agree to that providing--\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me clarify--\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to make sure we get a vote on my amendment. This is \nwhat this is all about. We might as well get this out in the open as to \nwhether or not there will be votes that will be agreed to on the \namendments that are offered. The unanimous consent agreement talked \nabout amendments being offered today and Monday. The Senator from \nIdaho, I think, as well as I believe the Senator from Nevada, talked \nabout votes on these amendments, but it is not clear in the UC that the \namendments offered would be voted upon.\n  I do not want to lose the regular order that my amendment would be \ndisposed of by agreeing to a unanimous consent agreement that my good \nfriend from Virginia would then come next. That is the issue, I tell my \ngood friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is our belief, it is my purpose today to disallow any \nvotes from occurring. There will be no votes today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course.\n  Mr. CRAIG. On any action. The Senator can offer his amendment. We \nhave just seen it. Senator Reed and I will review it over the weekend, \nor our staffs will. I think that is fair and appropriate. Because the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia is not in the second degree, it \nis my understanding the amendment of the Senator from Michigan would \nhave to be set aside for the purpose of offering the amendment by the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would then offer--Madam President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I then suggest the amendment in a unanimous consent \nrequest, that my amendment again be the regular order first thing on \nMonday. The reason for this is that it is important to assure that \nthere be votes on these amendments. I do not know what the intention of \nthe Senator from Idaho is relative to----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object to that unanimous consent. There may be other \namendments offered today by other parties.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection, of course, to that, but my question \nto the Senator from Idaho is, is it the intention of the Senator from \nIdaho that there be votes on amendments that are offered on Monday?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe the leadership on both sides intends for there \nto be votes, or a vote on an amendment, but I cannot tell the Senator \nwhat that amendment will be. I object to a specific amendment at this \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then I would have to object because otherwise I am no \nlonger the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I seek a clarification from the distinguished floor \nmanager?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I do not seek to take the floor, but if the Senator \ncarried out his objection to the full meaning, it would prohibit any \namendments coming up today unless the Senator agreed to laying his \namendment aside so that another amendment could come up. Is that the \ndesire of the Senator?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not at all. My desire is that I not lose my opportunity to \nhave a vote on my amendment.\n  I do not want a vote today. Let's be very clear on this. When the \noperating UC was entered into, it was my understanding that amendments \nwould be allowed to be offered today and Monday. It was also my \nunderstanding that there was an intention that that meant those \namendments would be voted on at some point--not today but at some \npoint. If there is any doubt that that is the intention of the \nleadership or of the floor managers, to allow votes on amendments that \nare offered today, the only way I can come close to having assurance \nthat there will be a vote on my amendment at some point will be to \nmodify any UC to agree to set aside my amendment, which will be fine, \nbut then make it a part of the UC that my amendment then be the \namendment that is in order on Monday, because otherwise I am weakening \nthe position I have.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, there is no intention of this Senator to \nweaken. As a matter of fact, I intend to vote in favor of the Senator's \namendment, subject to a colloquy we will have to clarify a question I \nhave in my mind. But the Senate must go forward today on amendments. I \nam trying to figure out what is the procedure by which we do it so that \nmy colleague from Michigan is protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection to yielding the floor for an answer to \nthat question, without losing my right to the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Certainly the explanation of the Senator as to what \nleadership proposed in the unanimous consent request, that amendments \ncould be offered today and Monday, is accurate. But the unanimous \nconsent request guaranteed votes only to those amendments that were \nwithin the unanimous consent request. I am not today going to allow \nthat unanimous consent request to be amended for the purpose of \nstacking up a variety of votes. I am willing to look at that on Monday. \nI have not yet seen the Senator's amendment. We just received it. We \nare reviewing it now. There may be other amendments I want to review \nwith staff over the weekend.\n  So I renew my objection to allowing the Senator to become in order \nagain. We have an amendment that we did not get to last night, and that \nis Senator Bingaman's amendment that was in order under the unanimous \nconsent agreement. The hour was late and most were wanting to go home. \nThe Senator was kind enough to put that vote over. It is my \nunderstanding that that will be at least one amendment that could be \nvoted on, because it is entitled to be voted on within the unanimous \nconsent agreement, late Monday afternoon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2631\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant Journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2631:\n\n    (Purpose: To exempt any civil action against a person from the \n provisions of the bill if the gross negligence or reckless conduct of \n             the person proximately caused death or injury)\n\n       On page 11, after line 19, add the following:\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n     SEC. 5. GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESS CONDUCT.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the provisions in the Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit a civil liability action from being \n     brought or continued against a person if that person's own \n     gross negligence or reckless conduct was a proximate cause of \n     death or injury.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``gross negligence'' has the meaning given the \n     term in subsection (b)(7) of the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan \n     Food Donation Act (42 U.S.C. 1791(b)(7)); and\n       (2) the term ``reckless'' has the meaning given the term in \n     the application notes under section 2A1.4 of the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines Manual.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let us try to sort this out so that the \nSenator from Virginia is not left out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me place a unanimous consent request \nto facilitate actions of the two Senators on the floor. I ask unanimous \nconsent the Levin amendment be temporarily set aside for the purpose of \nallowing the Senator from Virginia to offer his amendment. Once that \namendment is offered and discussed, the Warner amendment would then be \nset aside for the purpose of returning to the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Do I understand, then, that the Levin amendment would \ncontinue to be the regular order under that unanimous consent?\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe that is correct, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be the pending question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Idaho. It is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for his cooperation and turn to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2624\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleagues. I ask that amendment No. 2624 be \nthe pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior Journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2624.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to make it eminently clear that I \ndesire in every way to cooperate with the joint leadership which, in a \nbipartisan way, has indicated their desire, together with expressions \nof the President, that this bill move forward. This is not a dilatory \ntactic on my part, nor is it to be construed in any way as a political \ntactic. The subject of this amendment simply is a very heartfelt, \npersonal matter for me.\n  Each of us counts our joys and benefits through life. I was blessed \nwith two very strong and wonderful parents. My father devoted his life \nto the medical profession. He served in World War I as a very young \ndoctor in the trenches. He returned a decorated soldier, and \nestablished his practice as a surgeon. He concluded a lifetime of total \ndedication to the profession of medicine, his patients, and the healing \nof those who have the misfortune of illnesses and other diseases. It is \nfor that reason I bring up this amendment for consideration in the \nSenate. In brief, this amendment states that if the Senate believes \ncertain protections from lawsuits should be afforded to the gun \nindustry, then certain protections should be likewise afforded to the \nmedical profession. It is as simple as that.\n  Earlier this week, we dealt with a similar piece of legislation. But \nthis amendment differs in the sense that I have purposely removed any \nreference to insurance companies or to those companies engaged in the \nmanufacture of healing drugs. I have done this to point out with \nabsolute clarity in the minds of all Senators that if the underlying \nbill does move forward, then should comparable fair treatment be \nextended to the medical profession that serves every single American.\n  The gun industry has a narrow following, in terms of those served \nunder this bill. I don't say that with any disrespect. I, throughout my \nlife, have owned and enjoyed guns. My father gave me my first gun when \nI was 9 years old, and I have a modest collection to this day. I enjoy \nthe fields and the streams. I pride myself as being a hunter and an \noutdoorsman. In no way, do I make any personal affront against those \nwho similarly follow the joys of the outdoors.\n  But, I believe it is essential that if this mighty institution of the \nSenate move forward with the underlying bill, they carry with it an \namendment which accords the same protections to the medical \nprofession, whether it is an emergency room or the doctor's office.\n\n  With that in mind, I hope my colleagues look upon my effort as one of \npurity of heart, and not for political reason. I have no reason to try \nto impede the underlying bill, but I simply want to give the medical \nprofession such benefits as the Senate is now contemplating in giving \nto a very narrow segment of our industry; namely, the gun industry and \nthe gun dealers.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment to address the issue of a form of \ntort reform. Today the Senate is debating tort reform for the gun \nindustry. I wish to take a few minutes to raise the issue of tort \nreform with regard to another industry--the health care profession.\n  I have indicated my father's lifework was in medicine. I had often \nthought as a young man to pursue that profession. But without getting \ntoo personal about this, I served briefly in World War II in the Navy. \nMy father died just months after I returned home. I think had he lived \nI might well have followed in his profession. But nevertheless, I went \non to law school, and had a modest career in the practice of law and in \none thing and another. And here I am today, proud to represent my great \nState in the Senate.\n  Soon, the Senate will vote on S. 1805, legislation to provide certain \nlegal protections to the gun industry--legal protections which are \ndenied almost across the board to almost every other industry in the \nprivate sector, and certainly the medical profession.\n  It is a very selective piece of legislation for a very selective \ngroup. Proponents have argued this legislation is necessary because \nlawsuits are driving gun dealers and gun manufacturers out of business.\n  It is very simple. The same thing is happening to the medical \nprofession. Simply stated, the same situation, although far more \nserious in my judgment and in the judgment of others, is happening to \nthe medical profession. Doctors, nurses, and other health care \nprofessionals are leaving the practice of medicine due to the \nastronomical cost of malpractice insurance, frivolous lawsuits, and \nwhat is regarded as runaway jury verdicts where awards, by any standard \nof fairness, far exceed the damages which some may have suffered as a \nconsequence of receiving medical attention.\n  In my view, if we are going to be protecting the gun industry from \nlawsuits, we at least ought to protect the medical profession. We have \nall heard the real stories from doctors about the rapidly increasing \ncost of medical malpractice insurance. Some States' malpractice \ninsurance premiums have increased as much as 75 percent in a single \nyear.\n  As a result, the fact is these doctors, unable to afford ever \nincreasing premiums, are leaving the profession altogether and patients \nare losing access to health care.\n  Again, my father's profession was surgery primarily, but he also \npracticed gynecology.\n  I was astonished to learn that in many medical schools today those \nyoung people studying to go into the various segments of medical \npractice are shunning gynecology. Some medical schools are not even \ngraduating those engaged in gynecology. They have just stopped that \nsegment of the profession because they know of the difficulties to \npractice gynecology as a result of medical malpractice suits.\n  I have here today the front pages of two of the leading magazines we \nall read. There it is. One: ``The Doctor Is\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nOut.'' The other: ``Lawsuit Hell--How Fear of Litigation Is Paralyzing \nOur Professions.''\n  There is the story.\n  All I am asking is if this bill passes the Senate that doctors, \nnurses, and other practitioners in health care are given the same equal \ntreatment as the gun dealers and the gun manufacturers. It is as simple \nas that.\n  I have received numerous letters, as have every single Member of this \nbody, from medical professionals in the Commonwealth of Virginia that \nshare with me the very real difficulties they are encountering with \nmalpractice insurance as a consequence of this problem.\n  I myself went through a modest medical procedure the other day. The \nradiologist literally cornered me as I was exiting the examination, and \nstopped to talk to me--not one, not two, but about eight came in \nknowing the Senator from Virginia was in the facility. They had me flat \non my back. I listened very carefully as they explained--not \ncomplaining nor whining in any way, but in a factual way--how the \nradiologists in their profession have watched the astronomical increase \nin cost of their insurance.\n  Let me read a letter I just received. I will withhold the name. But \nthe letter is in my office. This young doctor writes:\n\n       I am writing you to elicit your support and advice for the \n     acute malpractice crisis going on in Virginia. . . . I am a \n     48-year-old single parent of a 14- and 17-year-old. After all \n     the time and money spent training to practice OB-GYN, I find \n     myself on the verge of almost certain unemployment and \n     unemployability because of the malpractice crisis. I have \n     been employed by a small OB-GYN Group for the last 7 years. \n     Our malpractice premiums were increased by 60 percent in May \n     2003. The prediction from our malpractice carrier is that our \n     rates will probably double at our renewal date in May 2004. \n     The reality is that we will not be able to keep the practice \n     open and cover the malpractice insurance along with other \n     expenses of practice.\n\n  Colleagues, that is happening in just about every State in this great \ncountry of ours. We have here and now the chance to address this crisis \nin a fair and constructive way.\n  I mentioned the two magazines: The June 2003 edition of Time magazine \nhad a cover story on the effects of rising malpractice insurance costs. \nThe story, entitled ``The Doctor Is Out,'' discusses several doctors \nall across America who have had to either stop practicing medicine or \nhave had to take other action due to increased insurance premiums. One \nexample cited in this magazine is the case of Dr. Mary-Emma Beres. Time \nreports this doctor, a family practitioner from Sparta, NC--\nincidentally, the distinguished Presiding Officer represents this State \nwith great distinction. That doctor in Sparta, NC ``has always loved \ndelivering babies. But last year, Beres, 35 years old, concluded that \nshe couldn't afford the tripling of her $17,000 malpractice premium and \nhad to stop'' caring for those women going through perhaps the greatest \njoy of life; that is, childbirth.\n  The article continues:\n  ``With just one obstetrician left in town for high-risk cases, some \nwomen who need C-sections now must take a 40-minute ambulance ride'' to \nother communities to try to get that service.\n  Dr. Beres' case makes clear that not only doctors are being affected \nby the medical practice insurance crisis, but patients are as well. \nWith increased frequency, due to rising malpractice rates, more and \nmore patients are not able to find the medical specialists they need.\n  The second magazine, Newsweek, also recently had a cover story on the \nmedical liability crisis entitled ``Lawsuit Hell.''\n  I was particularly struck by the feature in this magazine about a \ndoctor from Ohio who saw his malpractice premiums rise in 1 year from \n$12,000 to $57,000--1 year. As a result, this doctor ``decided to lower \nhis bill by cutting out higher-risk procedures like vasectomies, \nsetting broken bones and delivering babies--even though obstetrics was \nhis favorite part of the practice. Now he glances wistfully at the \ncluster of baby photos still tacked to his wall in the office. 'I miss \nthat part of the practice terribly,' he says.''\n\n  While these stories are compelling on their own, the consequences of \nthis malpractice crisis can be more profound. On February 11, 2003, a \nyoung woman in Gulfport, MS, shared with both the HELP Committee in the \nSenate, on which I serve, and the Judiciary Committee her personal \nstory about how this crisis affected her.\n  This woman told us how on July 5, 2002, her husband Tony was involved \nin a single car accident, in which he had a head injury, and was rushed \nto a hospital in Gulfport where he received medical attention. He could \nnot be treated at the Gulfport hospital because they did not have the \nspecialist necessary to care for him. After a 6-hour wait, he was \nairlifted to University Medical Center.\n  Today, Tony is permanently brain damaged. According to the person \ndelivering this story, no specialist was on staff that night in \nGulfport because overriding medical costs forced almost all the brain \nspecialists in that community to abandon their practice. As a result, \nTony had to wait 6 hours before the only specialist left in Gulfport \ncould treat him to reduce the swelling of his brain.\n  Without a doubt, the astronomical increases in medical malpractice \npremiums are having wide-ranging effects. It is a national problem. It \nis time for a fair and national solution. This moment in the life of \nthis great Senate is the chance to address that.\n  The President has indicated that the medical liability system in \nAmerica is largely responsible for the rising costs of malpractice \ninsurance. The American Medical Association and the American College of \nSurgeons agree with him as does almost every doctor in Virginia who I \nhave discussed the issue with.\n  The president of the AMA, Dr. John Nelson, has publicly stated, ``We \ncannot afford the luxury of waiting until the liability crisis gets \nworse to take action. Too many patients will be hurt.''\n  The American College of Surgeons concurs by stating, ``More and more \nAmericans aren't getting the care they need when they need it. . . . \nThe `disappearing doctor' phenomenon is getting progressively and \nrapidly worse. It is an increasingly serious threat to everyone's \nability to get the care they need.''\n  Let me state unequivocally that I agree with our President, with the \nAMA, with the American College of Surgeons, and with the vast majority \nof doctors all across Virginia. That is why I am offering my amendment \ntoday.\n  My amendment is simple, like other measures that have come before the \nSenate, my amendment provides a nationwide cap on damages in medical \nmalpractice lawsuits.\n  My amendment differs from other measures that have been voted on in \nthe Senate in one key aspect--whereas these other bills would have \napplied to doctors, my amendment is solely limited to the caring \nmedical professionals who take care of each and every one of us when we \nneed medical care.\n  It is a commonsense solution to a serious problem.\n  Now that I have laid out the amendment, I would like to reiterate one \nimportant point. As you know, the gun immunity bill provides broad \nprotection to gun manufacturers and gun dealers in both Federal and \nState court. The bill is aimed at protecting the manufacturers and \ndealers from lawsuits that result from the criminal or unlawful use of \na firearm. The basic data is that if a manufacturer or dealer follows \nthe statutory law in the manufacturing and sale of a legal product, \nthey should not be held responsible for the actions of a third party.\n  While some may claim that this gun immunity bill might be an \nimportant component of tort reform, in my opinion, health care \nliability reform is even more important. We must protect the medical \nprofession and the patients it serves.\n  How can we give near absolute protection from litigation for one \nindustry--the gun industry--and do absolutely nothing for another \nindustry that is solely dedicated to saving lives?\n  Let's ask ourselves, in the event that a bullet from a firearm is \nshot into an innocent victim, is our healthcare system prepared to help \nthat victim? Without healthcare liability reform, it may not be, as \nthere might not be the appropriate doctor in the area to tend to the \npatient. That is why my amendment goes hand-in-hand with the gun \nimmunity bill.\n  So now it is up to my colleagues in the Congress. It is your choice. \nIf we are going to give legal protections to the gun industry, all I \nsay is let's give it to the doctors as well.\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\n  If you gave this choice to the American people, there is no doubt \nthat the doctors would win by a 100 to 1 margin.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2631\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is pending, the Levin \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in the fall of 2002 the entire country \nwas focused on the Washington, DC, area as an unknown sniper \nindiscriminately shot 16 innocent people in little more than a month, \nfrom September 14 to October 24. Among the sniper victims were Jim \nMartin, shot and killed on October 2 while walking across a Shoppers \nFood Warehouse parking lot in Wheaton, MD, after purchasing groceries \nfor his church; Sarah Ramos was shot and killed while sitting on a \nbench in front of a post office. She was waiting for a ride to take her \nto a babysitting job; Thirteen-year-old Iran Brown, the youngest of the \nvictims, was shot in the chest and wounded on October 7 after getting \nout of a car at his middle school; and Conrad Johnson, a 35-year-old \nbusdriver, was shot and killed on October 22 while standing on the top \nstep of his bus at a ride-on bus staging area in Aspen Hill, MD.\n  On Thursday, October 24, members of the sniper task force arrested \nJohn Allen Muhammad and John Lee Boyd Malvo at a rest stop on I-75 in \nFrederick County. They were charged with shooting the victims with a \nBushmaster semiautomatic assault rifle. Both were prohibited under \nFederal law from possessing a gun. Malvo is a juvenile and Muhammad was \nthe subject of a domestic violence restraining order. Both have been \nconvicted of capital murder in Virginia.\n  The sniper rifle used by Malvo and Muhammad was later traced to \nBull's Eye Shooter Supply in Takoma, WA. Bull's Eye representatives \nclaim not to have any record of sale of the weapon, cannot account for \nhow the snipers obtained the assault rifle. Malvo later admitted he had \nshoplifted the gun.\n  The sniper case prompted an ATF investigation of Bull's Eye. The \ninvestigation revealed that the gun dealer had no record that the gun \nused by the snipers was missing from the inventory. The ATF \ninvestigation also determined that 77 other guns were missing from the \nBull's Eye store. Four prior audits of the dealer found at least 160 \nadditional guns missing from the store. The guns that were missing from \nBull's Eye were not all handguns that could walk out the door in \nsomebody's pocket. The gun shoplifted by Malvo was an assault rifle.\n  The families of the sniper victims filed a lawsuit against Bull's Eye \nand Bushmaster, the manufacturers that supplied the sniper weapon to \nthe dealer, claiming that Bull's Eye operated its business in such a \ngrossly negligent manner that scores of guns routinely disappeared from \nits store and that Bushmaster continued to supply that dealer even \nafter years of audits by ATF showing that scores of guns were missing \nfrom the dealer's inventory.\n  Did Bull's Eye or Bushmaster violate any Federal or State statute? \nThat is the issue. That is the heart of the issue we are debating. If \nyou are reckless in your operations, even though you may not have acted \nillegally, but if you are reckless or if you are grossly negligent in \nyour operations, should you be held accountable for your own actions? \nThat is the question. Should you be held accountable for your \nown reckless or grossly negligent actions if that gross negligence or \nrecklessness is the proximate cause of somebody else's death or injury?\n\n  That is what this amendment is all about. Frankly, that is what the \nbill is all about, to eliminate the possibility of recovery in cases \nwhere somebody can prove recklessness or negligence unless they can \nalso prove illegality. That is the purpose of the bill, to give that \nimmunity unless plaintiffs can prove illegality. The purpose of this \namendment is to say that if you can prove gross negligence or \nrecklessness on the part of an individual, and if that recklessness and \ngross negligence is the proximate cause of injury or death, then you \nare entitled to bring a lawsuit.\n  I listened to this debate; I have not been here for much of it, but I \nread a great deal and tried to follow it. It seems to me that is the \nheart of the matter and what it comes down to. That is what this \namendment is intended to clarify.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I ask my distinguished colleague a question, \nbecause Virginia was hard hit, as were Maryland and other States, by \nthat sniper case, which the Senator recounted in the opening remarks.\n  It is my understanding--and I have followed the debate very carefully \non all aspects of this legislation--but the legislation, if it were to \npass, would put in doubt, to some considerable extent, the right of the \nmany families. The greater community of the Nation's Capital was in \nsemiparalysis. Schools closed. People could not conduct their normal \nactivities because of the sense of lack of safety. They could not even \ndo something simple such as filling the gas tank of the car.\n  It seems to me unless we let the full force and brunt of all the \nlegal remedies available to citizens of our Nation be utilized to bring \nto justice, either civilly or criminally, all those who may have \ncontributed--as the Senator says, by gross negligence--then we are \ndenying, particularly to these sniper victims' families and others \nacross the Nation, some very fundamental rights.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Michigan. It is my intent \nto support the Senator.\n  Am I correct in my premise, in my question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Virginia is very much on point and is \ncorrect. This is a victim's right remedies issue. Do we provide a \nremedy for a victim of somebody's gross negligence or recklessness that \nhas injured that victim where the proximate cause of the injury--or a \nproximate cause of the injury, to be technically correct--is the \ndefendant's recklessness or gross negligence or are we going to deny \nvictims that remedy? Are we going to tell a victim: You have to prove \nthat someone violated a law in order to get recovery, even though you \ncan prove gross negligence or recklessness. Even though you can prove \nthat recklessness or gross negligence on the part of someone you sue \nwas a proximate cause of death or injury, you have to prove that there \nwas a violation of law?\n\n  Why would we immunize any particular industry from that kind of \nrecovery where it is not somebody else who is being sued for their \ncontribution to somebody's injury but it is the industry itself or a \ngunstore itself or any store that contributed, through recklessness or \ngross negligence, to somebody's death or injury?\n  I have read and heard a lot in this debate about individual \nresponsibility and accountability, that you should not be accountable \nfor somebody else's actions injuring somebody else, and I do not \ndisagree with that. My amendment says where it is your own recklessness \nor gross negligence which is a proximate cause of an injury or a death, \nyou should not be immunized. That is what my amendment provides, that \nif your own recklessness or your own gross negligence is a proximate \ncause of death or injury, you should still be held accountable.\n  That is what we are going to be voting on. I hope we are going to be \nvoting on it, I should say.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for clarification, when my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan refers to ``victims,'' we should make it clear \nthat oftentimes victims perish, so it is their spouses, their families \nwe are talking about. I think in our discussion we ought to make it \nclear it is a class of people we are trying to protect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. In terms of the definition of \n``victims,'' we are talking here about families who lose loved ones as \nwell as people who are injured themselves.\n  I want to emphasize one fact here, which is there was a motion to \ndismiss this case in the State of Washington brought by victims against \nBull's Eye and against Bushmaster. On June 27, 2003, the court denied \nthe motions, and here is what the court said:\n\n       [T]he facts in the present case indicate that a high degree \n     of risk of harm to the plaintiffs was created by Bull's Eye \n     Shooter Supply's alleged reckless or incompetent conduct in \n     distributing firearms.\n\n  The court said it was the defendant's actions that caused damage to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nplaintiffs. It seems to me for us to say even though Bull's Eye caused \ndamage through recklessness or gross negligence to victims, we are \ngoing to deny those victims a remedy unless they can prove there was an \nillegal action--not just a reckless action, but an illegal action--is \nto mistreat this particular class of victims.\n  To single out this class of victims and say, ``You cannot recover \nunless you can prove illegal action on the part of the defendant''--not \njust that they were reckless, not just that they were negligent--I \nthink is highly arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of real victims \nwho right now can go to court, and if they can show reckless behavior, \nnegligent behavior on the part of the defendants that was a proximate \ncause of their injury, then they can recover.\n  I do not even know that Congress can constitutionally destroy the \npending claim. I hope not. I hope we cannot destroy a claim that is \npending for an injury that has already been caused, constitutionally, \nbut I do know we should not try. We should not be trying to remove the \nrights of victims to sue people whose recklessness or gross negligence \nwas a proximate cause of their injury.\n\n  That is what this amendment would assure, that that right of action \nfor recklessness or gross negligence which is a proximate cause of the \ninjury can be compensated for.\n  There are a number of other troubling cases that have been referred \nto that would be jeopardized. Again, I do not know that we can \nconstitutionally eliminate a claim based on an action which has already \ntaken place. I sure hope not. But I know what the intent of this bill \nis, which is to immunize the defendants whose reckless or negligent \nconduct is being sued upon.\n  The Guzman case, on Christmas Eve 1999--this was a man who was killed \nby a shot to his heart while standing in front of a Worcester, MA, \nnightclub. About a week later, the police recovered a handgun in a lot \nnear where this man, Danny Guzman, was killed. The gun was lacking a \nserial number. It was found by a 4-year-old child. A ballistics test \ndetermined the gun was the one that killed Danny Guzman.\n  The investigation following the shooting revealed the gun was one of \nseveral stolen by employees of Kahr Arms. It was discovered that one of \nthe employees in the Kahr manufacturing facility had stolen the gun \nused to kill Danny Guzman and sold it to buy crack cocaine.\n  Publicly available records, summarized in a complaint filed by Danny \nGuzman's family, indicate this employee of the Kahr facility had not \nonly been arrested on various charges over the years but as early as \n1995 had been addicted to cocaine and was ``habitually stealing money \nto support his cocaine habit.''\n  In March of 2000, the police arrested the Kahr employee who later \npled guilty to the gun thefts. The investigation also led to the arrest \nof a second Kahr employee who also pled guilty to stealing a gun.\n  According to a complaint that was filed by Danny Guzman's family, \nKahr Arms not only apparently hired a drug addict with a record of \ncriminal charges, but the company also chose not to utilize basic \nsecurity measures that could have prevented the theft, or an inventory \ntracking system that could have determined that guns were missing. \nAccording to the family's complaint, Kahr Arms did not conduct \nbackground checks on employees. The company did not install medal \ndetectors, security cameras, x-ray machines, or other devices to ensure \nthat employees did not just walk off with guns.\n  In fact, an affidavit signed by ATF Special Agent Michael Curran says \nthe person who stole the gun that ended up killing Danny Guzman once \nsaid--we all should listen to those words--``he had taken the firearm \nout of the company, that he does it all the time, and that he can just \nwalk out with them.'' Those are his words. He takes guns out of here \n``all the time''--this drug addict. He can just walk out with them.\n  The company did not track its inventory in any meaningful way. And \naccording to the complaint, from February 1998 to February 1999, \napproximately 16 shipments of handguns from Kahr Arms failed to arrive \nat their points of destination.\n  Did Kahr Arms violate a State or Federal statute? Nobody has claimed \nthey did. And unless they did, under this pending bill, immunity from \nsuit would result. It seems to me this is something all of us ought to \nbe troubled by and focus on because there is a lot of uncertainty and \nconfusion, I believe, as to what this bill would provide.\n  But at its heart, the issue is this: Should we say unless you can \nprove an act was illegal on the part of the defendant, you will not be \nable to recover for damages caused by that defendant's recklessness or \ngross negligence?\n  Should that defendant be immune from suit even though his \nrecklessness or gross negligence has caused your injuries, unless you \ncan prove that that conduct was also illegal?\n  The lawsuit that was filed by Danny Guzman's surviving family members \nalleges the wrongful death based on Kahr Arms alleged negligence. While \nthe defendants moved to dismiss this case on April 7, 2003, the \nMassachusetts Superior Court denied the motions. This bill is aimed at \nnullifying that kind of case. I hope we can't constitutionally do it \nretroactively. I hope we cannot destroy that cause of action. But we \nshould not try and we surely should not single out one industry to help \nimmunize them against their own acts of recklessness or gross \nnegligence.\n  In a third case, a team of Orange, NJ, police officers was operating \nundercover at a gas station that had been robbed repeatedly over the \ncourse of several months. Detective Lemongello was among the officers \ntaking part in the undercover surveillance. In the course of a \nstakeout, Detective Lemongello attempted to question a man who had \nsuspiciously approached the gas station. Lemongello walked up to the \nman and asked him to remove his hand from his pockets, whereupon the \nman turned and opened fire, shooting Detective Lemongello three times--\nonce each in his stomach, chest, and left arm.\n  Detective Lemongello was able to announce over his police radio that \nhe had been shot and that the suspect had fled the scene. In response \nto the radio call, Officer Kenneth McGuire set off on foot after the \nshooter, who had fled into a nearby neighborhood. When Officer McGuire \nentered a backyard where the suspect was hiding, the suspect emptied \nhis ammunition clip, shooting Officer McGuire in the abdomen and leg. \nOfficer McGuire managed to return fire, killing the suspect. It turned \nout that the man who shot Officer McGuire and Detective Lemongello was \nwanted for attempted murder and had at least three felony convictions \non his record. This man could not have legally purchased a gun, so the \nquestion is, Where did he get it?\n  Mr. President, I have been asked by my good friend from Vermont to \ninterject a statement on a different subject at this point. To \naccommodate him, I would be perfectly happy if the Senator from Idaho \nwould be willing to have me yield to him for a statement, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, we had hoped to conclude the \noffering of amendments. I know there are many on your side who asked \nfor morning business time today, some to make fairly extensive \nstatements. I would not object to this happening. I hope you can get \nanother Senator here for the offering of that amendment. Then we could \nstep off the bill into morning business and open up other \nopportunities.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Michigan yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a situation we have to address. We \nknow Senator Lautenberg is coming to the floor to offer an amendment, \nbut that can't be done unless Senator Levin sets his amendment aside. \nIf Senator Levin sets his amendment aside, he loses his rights to maybe \nhave a vote. I certainly have no problem whatsoever with the Senator \nfrom Vermont speaking for 10 minutes since that is my understanding. \nSenator Levin would get the floor again. But I think for Senator \nLautenberg, he should understand that he may not be able to offer his \namendment today, as it is my understanding from my conversations with \nthe Senator from Michigan, he is not going to allow his amendment to be \nset aside.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to have my amendment set aside, providing\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nthat after the Lautenberg amendment is offered, the floor then be \nreturned to me.\n  Mr. REID. We could certainly do it that way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question, I saw the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey just enter the Chamber. I ask my \nfriends, the senior Senators from Michigan, Nevada, Rhode Island, and \nIdaho, if perhaps the senior Senator from Vermont could proceed for \nabout 10 minutes on the subject of land mines without the Senator from \nMichigan losing his right to reclaim the floor. In the meantime, maybe \nthrough the work that is always done with such finesse by the senior \nSenator from Nevada, something can be worked out.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Vermont be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes and, \nfollowing that, the Senator from Michigan would reclaim his right to \nthe floor. He would be recognized after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object, what the Senator from \nMichigan did a few moments ago--the Senator from Nevada may not have \nbeen present--was yield to the Senator from Virginia for the offering \nof an amendment. He did not lose his place. We returned to that. So if \nyou are willing to extend that kind of courtesy to the Senator from New \nJersey, we certainly have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. What we should do is have it go back to the Senator from \nMichigan, and then we will try to do something that will get us out of \nhere today.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                  President Bush's Policy on Landmines\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as an aside, for one who has been here for \n29 years, sometimes the press talks about the rancor in the Senate. \nThis was a matter of courtesy shown by the senior Senator from Idaho, \nthe senior Senator from Rhode Island, and the senior Senator from \nMichigan to the Senator from Vermont. These are the kind of things that \nmake the Senate work. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, back in the 1980s, about 15 years ago, I flew in a \nhelicopter from Tegucigalpa, Honduras to the border of Honduras and \nNicaragua. It was at the height of the Iran-contra war. On the way I \nmet with the contras there at their camp. And on the way back, there \nwas a clearing in the jungle. You could see a Quonset hut with a red \ncross on the top. We landed there. It was a field hospital. There was a \ndirt floor inside, with beds, and an operating room next to it.\n  Inside I met a little boy, probably about 12 years old, with one leg; \nhe had a homemade crutch. He had no place to live, and the doctors let \nhim stay there on sort of a makeshift bed of blankets and rags in the \ncorner.\n  He was a nice boy. He had no idea who I was or what I was doing \nthere. He was just excited to see a helicopter come in. I talked with \nhim through a translator. He had lost his leg from a landmine along one \nof the trails near where his family lived. They were farmers.\n  I asked him if the landmine was placed there by a Sandinista or a \ncontra. He didn't have the foggiest idea. He wasn't even sure what this \ncountry, just a few miles away across the border, Nicaragua, was.\n  What he did know was his life was changed forever, and that he would \nnot be able to run again, or work in the fields, or be a farmer like \nhis father. It was a tragic story.\n  I came back and started work on a fund for mine victims, which \nthrough the courtesy of the Republican side is now known as the Leahy \nWar Victims Fund, and it has had strong bipartisan support. But while \nthat fund has helped many mine victims get artificial limbs and walk \nagain, I soon realized that no matter how much money we spend we would \nnever stem the loss of life from landmines that way.\n  Since I met that boy over a decade and a half ago, I have spoken on \nthis floor about the dangers of landmines to innocent civilians and \nAmerican soldiers so many times I have lost count. Perhaps I sound like \na broken record, but I feel so passionately about this.\n  Years ago, I sponsored the first law anywhere in the world to stop \nthe export of antipersonnel landmines. My distinguished friend from \nWest Virginia and my distinguished friend from Michigan voted for it. \nThe United States had the first law in the world stopping the export of \nantipersonnel landmines. That led to similar actions by other nations. \nIn a short time, our allies took far bolder steps. Just 5 years later, \na treaty banning antipersonnel mines was signed in Ottawa. I was there \nwhen it was signed. Today, over 150 nations have joined that treaty, \nincluding every NATO ally and every country in the Western Hemisphere, \nexcept two, the United States and Cuba.\n  It is interesting to recall the speech of former Foreign Minister \nLloyd Axworthy, who laid down the challenge in Ottawa. Yet today, \nalmost a decade later, in this hemisphere only two countries, the \nUnited States and Cuba remain the outcasts.\n  During the Clinton administration, I worked closely with the White \nHouse on this issue. I was disappointed that President Clinton did not \njoin the Ottawa Treaty, even though he could have, but he pledged to \nwork aggressively to find alternatives to landmines so the United \nStates could join by 2006.\n  Until this morning, that pledge was United States policy and the \nPentagon publicly embraced it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a May 15, 1998, letter to me from the \nformer National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, which spells out that \npolicy be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Pentagon said publicly that they would uphold the \npledge of the President of the United States, but behind the scenes \nthey worked assiduously to undermine the Clinton policy. Today, we see \nthe result in an announcement that the White House and Pentagon \ncarefully leaked to the press last night in an attempt to put a \npositive spin on what anyone who knows the issue can see is a step \nbackward.\n  We see that the Bush administration has abandoned any pretext of \njoining other civilized nations to eliminate these outmoded, \nindiscriminate weapons.\n  Before I explain why the administration's policy is so deeply \ndisappointing to those of us who have worked on this issue for years, I \nwant to be clear of my respect for Secretary of State Powell, for \nAssistant Secretary Lincoln Bloomfield, and others in the State \nDepartment who administer our humanitarian demining programs. These \nprograms save lives and limbs, and this administration's plan to \nincrease funding for these programs by $20 million is constructive. It \nis far too little, especially for the wealthiest Nation on earth, but \nit is a positive step.\n  I also want to emphasize that, except for in Korea, the United States \nno longer uses the type of landmines which pose the gravest risk to \ninnocent people, the way some nations and rebel forces do. Instead, we \nare helping countries clear their minefields. Just this week, the \nVietnam Veterans of America Foundation, led so courageously by Bobby \nMuller, signed an agreement with the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense to \nconduct a countrywide survey of unexploded mines and other bombs, many \nof which were left by our soldiers, as well as by Vietnamese soldiers, \nand which continue to maim and kill innocent people. Once that survey \nis completed, we and other nations can help remove these explosives and \nend the deadly legacy of that war.\n\n  So the issue for the United States is not whether the U.S. is using \nmines that are causing civilian casualties. In fact, we have not used \nlandmines since 1991 in the first Gulf war, and there is no evidence \nthose mines had any effect whatsoever. In fact there is no evidence the \nIraqis even knew they were there. The real issue, which the Pentagon \nand White House are either incapable of grasping or, more likely, want \nto ignore, is that as long as the United States, with by far the most \npowerful Armed Forces ever known in history, continues to insist on its \nright to use these indiscriminate weapons, other nations with armies \nfar weaker than ours are going to insist on their right to use them \nalso.\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\n  The victims are going to be innocent civilians and U.S. soldiers who, \neven today, are losing their lives and limbs from mines in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, over 2 years ago, the Bush administration announced it \nwould review U.S. landmine policy. I welcomed that review. I told \nPresident Bush, the Secretary of State, and officials in the Pentagon \nthat I wanted to find an approach with broad, bipartisan support, \nincluding from the Pentagon. Also, as much as I wanted us to be one of \nthe overwhelming majority of nations that have joined the treaty, I \nknew the Bush administration was not likely to do that. I felt that \nworking together we could move toward that goal by strengthening our \nown policy.\n  Today, over 2 years later, and after refusing to consult with me or \nother Members of Congress on either side, the White House announced its \nplans. We now see that we would have been far better off if the \nadministration had not conducted its review in the first place. Except \nfor a few positive aspects, the policy is a disappointing step \nbackward.\n  What we see is another squandered opportunity for U.S. leadership on \na crucial arms control and humanitarian issue. We see the United States \nsaying we will continue to use landmines indefinitely.\n  Once again, we had the opportunity to join the civilized world in \nsolving a global crisis, as all our NATO allies have. And once again, \nwe have chosen unilateral arrogance over leadership and cooperation.\n  The administration's press office has done an impressive job \nportraying this policy as an important advance, but it is not.\n  They say they will eliminate persistent landmines by 2010. That is \nconstructive. But in fact, except for Korea, the United States has not \nused these types of mines for decades.\n  Six years ago, the Clinton administration, including the Pentagon, \npledged to ``search aggressively'' for alternatives to self-destructing \nanti-vehicle mine systems by 2006. The Bush administration abandons \nthis pledge and will allow the use of these mines anywhere, \nindefinitely.\n  In 1998, the Clinton administration pledged that it would sign the \nOttawa treaty banning anti-personnel mines by 2006, if suitable \nalternatives to these mines were fielded by then. The Bush \nadministration abandons this pledge.\n  The Bush administration says it will seek a worldwide ban on the sale \nor export of persistent mines, but that we will keep our self-destruct \nmines indefinitely. Let's be honest. We tried that back in 1994, and \nthe reason it failed was, not surprisingly, that other countries said \n``if you, the world's strongest military power are unwilling to give up \nyour landmines, why should we give up ours?''\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that the President would seize this \nopportunity to show real leadership. We can solve this problem if we \nset the example. It could be done so easily. Instead, the President has \ntaken us backwards.\n  I will speak more about this in future weeks. I do appreciate the \nconsideration of my colleagues in giving me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The President has asked me to confirm \n     our understanding regarding the one-year statutory moratorium \n     on the use of anti-personnel landmines (APLs) that is due to \n     take effect next February. We very much appreciate your \n     working so closely with us to define an approach that meets \n     not only our solemn obligation to provide for the protection \n     and safety of our Armed Forces in battle, but also our mutual \n     goal of advancing our efforts to rid the world of APLs.\n       We are very gratified that you will not oppose adding \n     flexibility to the 1996 moratorium legislation in the form of \n     a Presidential waiver authority that would be attached to the \n     pending FY 1999 defense authorization bill when it is \n     considered by the Senate next week.\n       In this context, let me reiterate the following commitments \n     on the part of the Administration:\n       The United States will destroy by 1999 all of its non-self-\n     destructing APLs, except those needed for Korea.\n       The United States will end the use of all APLs outside \n     Korea by 2003, including those that self-destruct.\n       The United States will aggressively pursue the objective of \n     having APL alternatives ready for Korea by 2006, including \n     those that self-destruct.\n       The United States will search aggressively for alternatives \n     to our mixed anti-tank systems by (a) actively exploring the \n     use of APL alternatives in place of the self-destructing \n     anti-personnel submunitions currently used in our mixed \n     systems and (b) exploring the development of other \n     technologies and/or operational concepts that result in \n     alternatives that would enable us to eliminate our mixed \n     systems entirely.\n       Finally, the United States will sign the Ottawa Convention \n     by 2006 if we succeed in identifying and fielding suitable \n     alternatives to our anti-personnel landmines and mixed anti-\n     tank systems by then.\n       Again, I thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know under the order, Senator Levin is to \nhave the floor. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to propound a \nunanimous consent request and that he have the floor following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan says he will \ncomplete his statement in 10 minutes. The Senator from New Jersey has \ntwo amendments he wishes to offer, 10 minutes on each amendment, for a \ntotal of 20 minutes. I will propound a unanimous consent request in \njust a second, but I want everyone to know what is going on. That will \ntake a half hour. Following that, I ask that there be a time to go to \nmorning business. There will be no more amendments offered today, and \nwe would go to morning business and Senator Levin's amendment would be \nthe amendment that would recur following the two amendments of the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  I will propound that in the form of a unanimous consent request \nunless someone at this stage believes there is anything inappropriate \nwith it. I know Senator Byrd has been waiting. He asked yesterday to \ncome and speak, but we didn't know it would take as long. I tell the \nSenator from West Virginia, it will be approximately a half hour before \nwe get to morning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Democratic whip \nyield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. About what time would it be possible for me to get the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I tell the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, it would be a little bit after 1 o'clock, thereabouts. \nThen we have Senator Conrad who wishes to speak for 45 minutes and \nSenator Harkin who wishes to speak for a half hour. I am not going to \nset the order, but I ask that Senator Byrd be recognized initially in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I do not believe I have any disagreement \nwith that concept or the UC the Senator will propound, just as long as \nwe have adequately served all Senators who want to offer amendments to \nS. 1805. It appears the numbers are here for that purpose.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, who is \nin the Chamber, we are still in the process of trying to work out \ndefinite times on Monday so that he, Senator Feinstein, and those who \nare speaking in opposition--which will take a total of 3 to 4 hours--\nwill have time on Monday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes to complete debate on his amendment; \nfollowing that, that his amendment be set aside temporarily and that \nSenator Lautenberg be recognized to offer two amendments and that \nSenator Lautenberg be able to speak for a total of 20 minutes on his \ntwo amendments; following that, the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan would recur; and that following that, we go to a period for \nthe transaction of morning business, and that Senator Byrd be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\n  I want to go back to the case of the two police officers who were \nshot with a gun that was sold under extremely suspicious circumstances \nby a gun dealer who was then sued by these two police officers.\n  The lawsuit alleged on the part of the defendants some very serious \nnegligence, gross negligence, recklessness in terms of that sale. The \nperson who purchased the gun bought 11 other guns at the same time, \nselected by somebody else. The person who filled out the purchase \npaperwork was not the person who actually bought the guns. They were \npicked out by a second person.\n  Like the New Jersey man who shot these two officers, the man who \nselected the guns was a convicted felon. The guns were paid for \nentirely in cash, several thousand dollars. The gun purchase was about \nthe second in 3 weeks from the same two buyers from that dealer.\n  These were significant allegations that were brought by two police \nofficers who were severely injured by that gun, claiming that the \naction on the part of the gun dealer was negligent and reckless \nbehavior. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that it was.\n  A West Virginia judge refused to dismiss this case that these two \npolice officers brought saying there was sufficient evidence to go to a \njury; that is, evidence of recklessness or negligence on the part of \nthe defendants. It was their recklessness, their negligence which was \nthe proximate cause, allegedly, of the damage.\n  We have heard a lot about whether people should be held accountable \nfor somebody else's illegal action. That is not what this amendment is \nabout. That is not what this bill is about. What this bill is about is \nto immunize a certain industry from their own reckless and negligent \nbehavior, not somebody else's, but from their own reckless and \nnegligent behavior, unless the people who are injured can also show \nthat they acted illegally.\n  This is special treatment for one particular industry.\n  We owe a great debt to these police officers who put their lives on \nthe line, and it seems to me it is an insult for the response to their \nbravery to be: You cannot bring an action against a gun dealer who \nacted negligently or recklessly and whose negligence or recklessness \nwas a proximate cause of your injury. Sorry, you have to prove that gun \ndealer acted illegally; that he acted reckless is not enough; that you \nwere injured as a proximate result of that recklessness is not enough. \nWe are going to immunize that particular gun dealer and anyone like him \nfrom their own reckless, negligent behavior unless you can carry an \nadditional burden that they also acted illegally.\n  That is the response to officers who are gunned down and where their \ninjuries were a proximate result of the recklessness and negligence of \nthat gunshop.\n  Those are the allegations. Should they be allowed to prove them? The \nintention of the legislation in front of us is that they not be allowed \nto prove them unless they can also allege there was illegal action on \nthe part of that gunshop. I think we can see why so many associations \nof police officers are very much opposed to this legislation and its \npurpose.\n  A number of law enforcement officers wrote Senators a letter opposing \nwhat this bill intends. In it they said police officers like Ken \nMcGuire and David Lemongello put their lives on the line every day to \nprotect the public. Instead of honoring them for their service, this \nbill would deprive them of their basic rights as American citizens to \nprove their case in a court of law.\n  Manufacturers and dealers of guns have a right to make and sell guns, \nbut that right also is not unlimited because it comes with some \nresponsibility. Like every other business in this country, people who \nare in the gun business have a responsibility to conduct that business \nwith reasonable care. If a gun manufacturer or gun dealer fails to do \nso, and their negligence or recklessness leads to someone being killed \nor injured, they should not be immune from suit.\n  According to a recent report, 57 percent of crime guns in the United \nStates could be traced back to 1 percent of the gun dealers in this \ncountry. We should not let that 1 percent off the hook. We should not \nsingle out one industry for these special protections.\n  Earlier this Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee, considered an \namendment to exempt class action lawsuits filed against the gun \nindustry from the diversity and removal provisions of the class action \nbill. The committee rejected that amendment and in its report on the \nbill the majority put it this way:\n\n       Simply put, there should not be one set of rules for one \n     category of defendants and another for another group of \n     defendants.\n\n  Well, if that holds true in the case of a class action bill, it \nshould be true also relative to this legislation. This bill not only \nsingles out one industry for special favored treatment, but in the \nprocess it undermines long-standing principles of tort law.\n  Traditionally, tort law has been left to the States to define, and if \nchanges have been necessary Congress has usually deferred to State \nlegislatures to make those changes. This bill seeks to impose a Federal \ntort regime that would virtually eliminate the ability of State courts \nto hear and decide cases involving even grossly negligent or reckless \nconduct by gun dealers and manufacturers, even where existing State law \nwould permit such cases.\n  A Georgetown University Center law professor by the name of Heidi \nFeldman put it this way about this bill:\n\n       . . . one of the most radical statutory revisions of the \n     common law of torts that any legislature--Federal or State--\n     has ever considered, let alone passed.\n\n  I have looked at a lot of Federal laws that affect the civil \nliability of various industries, and I, too, have seen nothing that \ncomes close to what this bill would do.\n  Whatever we are going to do, it seems to me we ought to do it \nknowingly. We ought to understand what it is that we are being asked to \ndo. What the bill says is, unless someone who is injured by somebody \nelse's reckless or negligent conduct, unless that plaintiff can also \nshow that the conduct was illegal, they will not be able to recover \ndamages for their injuries. That is a radical departure from fairness, \nnot just from the common law. That is a radical departure from \nprotecting victims and trying to preserve their rights.\n  We should not take that step without at least understanding what we \nare doing. The purpose of my amendment is to make sure that we at least \nhave an opportunity to vote on a central proposition: Whether or not \nwhen somebody is injured as a proximate result of somebody else's gross \nnegligence or recklessness that that person who is injured should have \nan opportunity to recover damages, even if they are unable to show that \nthe defendant's reckless or negligent conduct was also illegal.\n  That is the central issue this bill addresses. It is the central \nissue my amendment addresses. I think it is important that this Senate \nnot only understand what the central issue is but have an opportunity \nto vote on that specific issue, and that is what my amendment is all \nabout.\n  My amendment will give us the opportunity to vote on whether we \nintend to give immunity to persons who cause injuries to others through \ntheir own--and I emphasize ``their own''--reckless and grossly \nnegligent behavior, where that behavior is a proximate cause of \nsomebody else's injuries.\n  I hope the Senate will adopt my amendment. I hope we will modify the \nbill in front of us so that we can protect victims, and that is really \nwhat the amendment and the bill is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2632\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is set aside and the clerk will report the Lautenberg \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2632.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that certain notifications occur whenever a query \nto the National Instant Criminal Background Check System reveals that a \n person listed in the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File is \n       attempting to purchase a firearm, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. --. AMENDMENTS TO BRADY HANDGUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Terrorist Apprehension Act''.\n       (b) Amendments.--Section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence \n     Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (i), by striking ``No department'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in subsection (j), no \n     department'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (j) and (k) as subsections \n     (k) and (l), respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (i) the following:\n       ``(j) Terrorist Apprehension.--\n       ``(1) Initial notification.--If the system established \n     under this section determines that a prospective transferee \n     is listed in the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization file \n     or a similar terrorist watch list, regardless of the \n     eligibility of such person to purchase a firearm, the system \n     shall provide this information to the employee at the \n     Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation that is accessing the national \n     instant criminal background check system (referred to in this \n     subsection as the `NICS operator').\n       ``(2) Notification of law enforcement.--Upon receiving \n     information under paragraph (1), the NICS operator shall \n     immediately provide the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Department of Homeland Security, the terrorist task force, \n     and State and local law enforcement in the jurisdiction in \n     which the firearm purchase is being attempted with--\n       ``(A) the name, date of birth, and any other identifying \n     information reported by the prospective transferee;\n       ``(B) the time and place of the attempted firearm purchase; \n     and\n       ``(C) the type of weapon, if known, that the prospective \n     transferee attempted to purchase.\n       ``(3) Notification of originating agency.--In addition to \n     the notifications under paragraph (2), the NICS operator \n     shall immediately provide the agency that placed the name of \n     the suspected terrorist on the terrorist watch list with the \n     information described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of \n     paragraph (2).''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would override what I \nsee as a misguided Department of Justice policy that adds to the \nthreats to our homeland security and leaves our country more vulnerable \nto terrorist attacks. This amendment is identical to bipartisan \nlegislation I previously introduced. It was called the Terrorist \nApprehension Act, and it was cosponsored by Senator DeWine with me.\n  This amendment will direct the administration to do all it can to \napprehend potential terrorists within our borders.\n  We found out if someone on the terrorist watch list, someone who is a \npotential threat to communities across the country, purchases a weapon, \nand that information is logged into the gun background check system, \nthe Department of Justice has an order that prevents that background \ncheck information not to be put on an alert. They do not even share the \ncritical information with law enforcement concerning the whereabouts of \nthe terrorists.\n  It sounds kind of backwards to me. I find it very disturbing that we \ncould have a nationwide lookout for known terrorists within our \nborders, and if he obtained a weapon the Justice Department's policy is \nto conceal that information from the FBI or other interested law \nenforcement personnel.\n  I know there are differences on gun policy that we may have within \nthe Government, but I cannot believe there is anyone in this body who \nwould not want to see us do whatever we can to alert the FBI or the \nappropriate parties to the fact that there is a terrorist lurking \naround trying to purchase a gun or who has purchased a gun.\n  I know many pro-gun groups have said terrorists are not likely to or \nwould not buy a firearm on the legal market anyway, but the evidence we \nhave discovered points otherwise.\n  An investigation by my staff revealed that a small sample of gun \npurchases reviewed by the Department of Justice showed that over a few \nmonths 13 people on the terrorist watch list successfully purchased a \nfirearm at gunshops. The access that terrorists in our country have to \nguns is chilling, such as the .50 caliber assault weapon which could \ntake down a helicopter, according to the Congressional Research \nService. We learned also that that weapon can penetrate 6 inches of \nsteel plating and has the range of a mile; that a target can be hit \nfrom a mile away, and it can also carry an incendiary bullet that would \nimmediately cause the surroundings to burst into flames.\n  I know the Justice Department's position is at odds with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, but again I cannot believe that either \none of those Departments are not anxious to get as much information as \nthey can about terrorist activity relating to guns.\n  During his confirmation earlier this year, Tom Ridge acknowledged to \nme the dangers of terrorist access to guns, and under oath at another \nhearing the General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security told \nme it was his belief that someone on the terrorist watch list should \nnot be at all permitted to purchase guns.\n  Unlike the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice \napparently sees things very differently. DOJ is not willing to give \ncritical information to law enforcement sectors when someone on the \nterrorist watch list purchases a firearm. In fact, the Department of \nJustice requires the FBI to prove--believe this--that the terrorist \nshould not be able to legally buy a gun and DOJ gives the FBI 3 days to \ncome up with a reason. But if no reason is given in 3 days, then the \ngun is handed over to the terrorist.\n\n  It is quite an anomaly, that the Department of Justice requires the \nFBI to prove a terrorist should not be able to legally buy a gun. That \ndoesn't make sense to me.\n  To make matters worse, the policy of the Department of Justice is not \nto tell law enforcement the details of the transaction, including where \nit took place and when it took place. So we could have a nationwide \nlookout for a terrorist and the Department of Justice, knowing that the \nterrorist just obtained a gun, will not tell the appropriate law \nenforcement people where the terrorist is.\n  This is a misguided policy of the Department of Justice. It has to \nchange. My amendment would make that change. My amendment is simple and \nto the point. It says if a terrorist buys a gun, law enforcement must \nbe notified promptly that this transaction has taken place. The FBI, \nlocal police, and the regional terrorist task force must be told the \ntime and place of the purchase, without excuses. Every minute we allow \nthe current Department of Justice policy to stand, we put our \nconstituents at unnecessary risk.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan \namendment. It is my hope that amendment will carry. We are all \ninterested in reducing the threat of terrorism as much as we possibly \ncan.\n  Mr. President, of course, we have to lay the first amendment aside \nbefore we can proceed to the second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the first Lautenberg \namendment is set aside.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I neglected to use the graph I have to \ndemonstrate what happens. The subject of a terrorist watch list \npurchases weapons, the NICS gun background check system is in place, it \nis entered in the NCIC crime database, and here there is a silent \nalarm. It doesn't really tell anything to the FBI terrorist task force. \nThat is almost totally incomprehensible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2633\n\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the request I made that the other \namendment be laid aside, I now send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2633.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To exempt lawsuits involving injuries to children from the \n            definition of qualified civil liability action)\n\n       On page 9, between lines 2 and 3 insert the following:\n       ``(vi) any action involving injury to children.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to protect\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nthe rights of our most vulnerable and most precious resource, our \nchildren. If this bill is enacted without this amendment to the pending \nbill, we will be passing legislation that protects the interests of the \nNational Rifle Association and negligent gun dealers and manufacturers, \nerrant manufacturers, at the expense of our kids.\n  It is really coldhearted, as we see if we examine this legislation. \nHow distant do we want to make ourselves from a condition that is so \ntragic that even just hearing about it, if it is in your own household, \nsends chills up and down the spine? We have already rejected in this \ndebate the rights of sniper victims and police officers. But are we now \nwilling to go ahead and victimize our children? Children who are \ninjured by a gun, the families of children killed by guns, do we want \nto shut down their rights? I am a proud grandfather of 10 wonderful \ngrandchildren. It pains me to think that the Senate in which I serve is \nwilling to expose them to greater danger. That process is pretty easy, \nif there is no punishment severe enough to curb either negligent or \nreckless behavior on the part of manufacturers, dealers, or \ndistributors.\n  I think the biggest rogue of all that we all talk about is the shop \nthat permitted Lee Malvo to get the gun he had, the Bull's Eye shop. \nThey had guns all over the place on display and couldn't detect that \n237 or so guns were unaccounted for. That suggests even greater danger. \nWhat I really hope we can do is not take away a tool that helped make \nthis society safer for our kids.\n  How can we leave out the children, the children's families, when it \ncomes to seeking redress if this kind of tragedy strikes that family? \nEvery day we hear more about another child falling victim to gun \nviolence. It is a national epidemic. In 2002 alone, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention estimates there were 13,000 kids injured \nby a firearm. From 1996 to 2001, more than 1,500 children were killed \nin firearm accidents. The CDC also found the overall firearm-related \ndeath rate among United States children below the age of 15 was nearly \n12 times higher than it is in 25 other industrialized countries \ncombined. This horrible trend in our Nation must be stopped. We should \nbe working to enhance the safety of our children and not reduce it.\n  Tennille Jefferson, the mother of a child victim, understands only \ntoo well what dangers can result from negligent gun dealers. On April \n19, 1999, her son Nathan was shot and killed by a young boy who found \nthe gun on the street, a gun belonging to a gun trafficker named Perry \nBruce, who bought the gun from a disreputable gun dealer. The gun \ndealer sold Perry Bruce guns, despite many obvious signs that he was \ntrafficking in guns. Bruce had shown a welfare card as his only form of \nidentification. Yet somehow he was never questioned about how he \nmanaged to scrape up the thousands of dollars necessary to purchase 10 \nguns.\n  The gun trafficker, Mr. Bruce, admitted the gun dealer ``had to know \nwhat I was doing,'' and that he was high on marijuana each time he \nbought guns from this company. But the dealer acted recklessly. He had \nthe information. Yet he sold the guns to Bruce. The result was the \ndeath of Nathan Jefferson. If this bill passes, families like the \nJeffersons will not be able to hold the negligent, careless, \nirresponsible dealers and manufacturers who sell them to be liable for \nthe murder of innocent children. This bill chooses special interests \nover the innocents. It is a sad commentary on this Senate. To be blunt, \nthis immunity bill is a form of child abuse. We still have a chance to \nreverse the course and I hope we are going to do it. Meanwhile, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment and preserve the rights of \nAmerica's children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1873-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1873-S1875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   A BUDGET OF GIMMICKS, FALSE PROMISES, AND UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with the release of the President's budget \nfor the fiscal year 2005, and the upcoming markup of the fiscal year \n2005 budget resolution, it is now clear the promises made by this \nadministration during the 2000 election have not been kept. Contrary to \nthe promise made 4 years ago to ensure the Social Security benefits \npromised to our Nation's workers, our retirement and disability system \nhas become more vulnerable.\n  Contrary to the promise made 4 years ago to make health care more \naffordable, drug prices continue to rise and health insurance remains \nunobtainable for too many Americans.\n  Contrary to the promise made 4 years ago to protect our Nation's \nvital industry, this administration's tax and trade policies have been \nan unmitigated disaster with an alarming number of jobs being lost \noverseas.\n  Contrary to those assurances that it could be trusted to act as a \nprudent and responsible manager of our Nation's fiscal policies, the \nBush administration has demonstrated neither prudence nor fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  In his February 2001 address to a joint session of Congress, the \nPresident promised to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 \nyears. He said that is ``more debt repaid more quickly than has ever \nbeen repaid by any nation at any time in history.''\n  The President has not kept that promise.\n  Since President Bush submitted his fiscal year 2002 budget, our gross \nnational debt has increased from $5.6 trillion to $7 trillion, and \ndeficits have risen to $521 billion in fiscal year 2004.\n  With the deficit projections mounting, the cries of alarm are growing \nsteadily louder. The IMF--an international organization normally \nconcerned with the debt problems of third world nations--has issued an \nalarming critique of the United States, pleading with the Bush \nadministration to rein in its massive budget and trade deficits. \nSimilar warnings have emanated from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and the U.S. \nComptroller General, David Walker.\n  Even the administration's own political allies, ranging from the \nconservative Heritage Foundation to private sector economists who \nendorsed the President's tax cuts, have pleaded with this \nadministration to get its fiscal act together. Yet these warnings fall \non deaf ears in this administration.\n  After spending $1.7 billion to finance three enormous tax cuts in the \nlast 3 years, the President's budget proposes an additional $1.24 \ntrillion--in other words, that is one and a quarter trillion dollars--\nfor more tax cuts.\n  President Bush's assertion that his budget will cut the deficit in \nhalf by 2009 is one more in a litany of promises that will go \nunfulfilled.\n  The Bush administration's own budget documents show that if none of \nits proposals were enacted into law, the deficit would still be cut in \nhalf.\n  The President's budget actually makes the deficit worse in 2009 than \nif the Congress took no action at all.\n  For the fiscal years 2001 through 2010, this administration's \npolicies have transformed a 10-year, $5.6 trillion surplus into a $4 \ntrillion deficit--and it just keeps getting worse.\n  The President's budget includes record deficit projections that will \npush our national debt to extreme limits never before seen in our \nNation's history, or any other nation's history for that matter.\n  President Bush's budget is a wake-up call for working Americans. \nUnder the guise of inviting middle class workers to sit at the table \nand share in the tax cut, this administration ran up a tab that won't \nbe paid for by those with golden parachutes. It will be the working \nman--the man who works with his hands, in many instances, or most. It \nwill be the working man who gets stuck with the bill--the working man, \nthe forgotten man in this administration. In this administration's \ntenure, the working man is the forgotten man.\n  Instead of ensuring the Social Security benefits promised to \nworkers--here me out there--the President's budget would spend the \nentire Social Security surplus over the next 5 years--all $1.1 trillion \nof it--to pay for the administration's tax cuts for the affluent and \nfor the corporate elite. Not one thin dime would be allocated to save \nyour Social Security.\n  I remember life in the coalfields life in southern West Virginia when \nthere was no Social Security. We had the old Raleigh County poor farm. \nRaleigh County is in south-central West Virginia, a great coal-\nproducing county over the years. I remember the old\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\ncounty poor farm out at Shady Springs.\n  It used to be when folks became old--and there in those coalfields \nthey became old early--when they became old, they could no longer get a \njob. A person who was 60 years old, I can remember when I was a boy, \nwas an old man. Sixty years old, that was old. Fifty-five years of age \nor 60 years of age was considered old. There was no Social Security \nwhen they became old. Those men and women who had given their best \nyears in the toil and labor had given their best years. And they could \nno longer get work. The only thing they could do would be to go to the \ngates of their children with their hats in their hand and hope their \nchildren could take them in. Many of them went to that old county poor \nfarm. No Social Security.\n\n  Then like the rays of hope breaking away the shadows in those West \nVirginia mountains, a new President, a crippled President, Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, came to the helm of this shipless state. He and a Democratic \nCongress enacted a law bringing to the country and to the old folks \nSocial Security. I remember when those first Social Security checks \ncame. A check came to my house where my old coal miner father--he was \nnot my father, he was my foster father--received a check. And my mom, \nwho was my aunt, had taken me to raise when my mother died in the great \ninfluenza in 1918. So the Byrds took me in and raised me and they drew \na Social Security check.\n  So I know what it meant for those who had to depend upon Social \nSecurity, and those out in the plains, mountains, the prairies, and the \nvalleys of America, who still depend upon Social Security.\n  But even the enormous surpluses in the Social Security accounts \ncannot cover the colossal cost of the administration's tax cuts. \nPresident Bush's budget would also cut the funding for those Federal \nprograms that most benefit working families: Federal student aid, \nunemployment and job training programs, health care initiative for \nveterans and the poor and the elderly by a whooping $50 billion to pay \nfor the administration's tax cuts. Hear me, out there. And still it is \nnot enough.\n  After Draconian spending cuts on the loss of the entire Social \nSecurity surplus, the President's budget proposes to borrow an \nadditional $1.4 trillion. How long does it take to count $1 trillion? \nAt the rate of $1 per second, how long would it take to count $1 \ntrillion? A thousand years? Two thousand years? Thirty-six thousand \nyears.\n  The President's budget proposes to borrow an additional $1.4 \ntrillion, much of it from countries such as China and entities like \nOPEC, to pay for what? To pay for its tax cuts, tax cuts for the well-\nto-do, tax cuts for the wealthy. I say to the people from West Virginia \nwho may be watching, there are not many of you included in that group.\n  When you look at the promises of this administration on the one hand \nversus the performance on the other hand and the massive increases in \nthe national debt necessary to finance their ill-conceived fiscal \npolicies, our Nation would be left with a Bush debt gap of $4.5 \ntrillion.\n  The administration is forcing working class Americans not only to \nshoulder a massive debt burden but also to give up those Federal \nprograms and services from which they most benefit. The President's tax \ncuts are squeezing State revenue, forcing increases in tuition rates. \nThe cost of attendance at a 4-year public college or university has \ngone up 26 percent since Mr. Bush became President, from an average of \n$8,418 in the year 2000 to $10,636 in 2003. Let me say that again: The \ncost of attending a 4-year public college or university has gone up 26 \npercent since Mr. Bush became President, from an average of $8,418 in \n2000 to $10,636 in 2003. Interest rates on student loans will increase, \nwhile Pell grant moneys and Federal student aid programs are rolled \nback.\n  Drug prices will continue to increase and veterans and senior \ncitizens--the old folks; I can call them senior citizens; I can call \nthem old folks because I am one of them, thank God--veterans and \nseniors will continue to see their savings depleted while cuts are made \nin those programs that help to provide them with basic health care.\n  Workers' pensions will remain underfunded and vulnerable while this \nadministration stands passively mute. Social Security's financing \nproblems will continue to worsen as money that should be saved to \nensure the benefits promised to workers is wasted on an ideological \nfiscal policy that advocates tax cuts above all else.\n  The financial perils underlying the Social Security Program were \nbrought to light this week when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nforced the President to confront the fact that his administration has \nbeen for 3 years hiding from the facts. Namely, if we continue on the \nfiscal course set by this administration, we will lose the only \nopportunity that we will have left to save Social Security. Congress \nhas a responsibility to better educate the public about their Social \nSecurity system.\n  The panic--have you ever heard panic in the voice of someone? The \npanic in the voices of my constituents as they called my office \nyesterday made it clear that more must be done to keep the public \ninformed.\n  What is regrettable is that the real problems confronting future \nSocial Security retirees have only recently surfaced in the \nPresidential debates--how about that--only recently surfaced in the \nPresidential debates.\n\n  What is unforgivable, however, is if it were not for Chairman \nGreenspan's comments, this administration may not have even raised it \nas an issue this year. The President's evasive remarks have been to \nassure the American people that he will not cut the benefits of \nretirees or those near retirement. But what does that mean for 59-year-\nolds? What does that mean for 60-year-olds? Oh, I wish I could say I \nwas 60 again. Maybe not. Maybe not.\n  What does that mean for 59-year-olds or 60-year-olds? Will the \nPresident try to cut their Social Security benefits or not? To cut \nSocial Security benefits, without first engaging the public about its \nintentions, should tell us a great deal about the fiscal priorities and \nmethods of this administration.\n  In the face of this dismal reality, the administration does not offer \nsolutions, it offers excuses--just excuses. This administration can \nonly argue that their budgetary decisions are not their fault. The \nrecession and out-of-control spending is to blame for massive deficits. \nCorporate accounting scandals are to blame for weak pension funds. The \nSeptember 11 terrorists are to blame for the shoddy economy.\n  All of these arguments are belied by the facts.\n  Our investments in education, health care, transportation, and other \ndomestic discretionary programs are not the source of this \nadministration's deficit problems. Domestic discretionary comprises \nonly 9 percent of the increase in spending over the last 3 years, and \nit represents only 17 percent of all Federal spending. President Bush's \nbudget does not even look at mandatory expenditures for savings even \nthough they comprise two-thirds of the Federal budget. While the \nPresident's proposed spending cuts would significantly undermine our \neducation and health care investments, it would barely make a dent in \nthe administration's deficit projections.\n  Meanwhile, the Defense Department is plagued with accounting problems \nso severe that the Secretary of Defense cannot account for billions of \ntaxpayers' dollars. The General Accounting Office estimates that the \nvery earliest that the Defense Department could possibly pass an audit \nwould be the year 2007, and that is optimistic. The administration does \nnot even know how much time and how much money it will take to fix the \naccounting problems.\n  It is absurd that the administration is proposing to cut vital \ndomestic investments while billions and billions and billions of \ndollars are lost every year in the Pentagon's broken accounting system. \nThe administration's deficits have exploded, and they have exploded in \nlarge measure because revenues as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct have declined to their lowest levels since 1950--1950. \nAccording to the House Budget Committee, the three Bush tax cuts have \nincreased the deficit by nearly $2.6 trillion from 2001 to 2013.\n  The notion that the administration's deficits were created by a poor \neconomy and increased spending is pure fantasy. It is made all the \nworse by this administration's efforts to hide these facts from the \npublic--from you,\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\nyou. They say it is your money. The administration is touting the tough \nchoices it is making to cut the deficit in half over 5 years. Yet its \nbudget is full of ``magic asterisks'' that assume an initiative will be \noffset, such as the $65 billion health care tax credit but provides no \ninformation on from where that savings will come.\n\n  Contrary to the Bush administration's past budgets, with surplus \nprojections extending out 10 years to justify their tax cuts, this year \nPresident Bush proposed a 5-year budget--a 5-year budget. It hides from \nthe public the alarming long-term deficits projected by the \nCongressional Budget Office. It hides the real cost of the \nadministration's proposals, such as the $1.1 trillion cost of extending \nthe Bush tax cuts. Further, President Bush's budget includes no \nadditional funds for Iraq, even though the administration reportedly \nwill submit another supplemental request for Iraq--when? After the \nNovember elections.\n  Not many of you, perhaps, are old enough to remember the old \nvaudeville shows, where they would tell you, ``Watch this hand,'' while \nthey were doing something they did not tell you about with the other \nhand, or, ``Now you see it; now you don't.''\n  So they do not tell us how much money they need for Iraq, but they \nreportedly will submit another supplemental for Iraq after the November \nelections.\n  Here, perhaps more than anywhere else, is where the budget deficit is \nthe most deceptive.\n  To date, contrary to the modern tradition of an administration \nfunding large-scale, ongoing wars, at least in part, through the \nregular appropriations process, the Bush administration has refused to \nrequest funds for the war in Iraq in its annual budget.\n  Why? They do not want you to know. They want the American people to \nbe fooled. The administration waits until funds for the troops are \nalmost exhausted before requesting additional funds through a \nsupplemental--through a supplemental. The Bush administration's purpose \nis clear. What is it? To limit debate, to limit discussion, to limit \nhaving to explain to those people out there who are watching the Senate \nthrough those electronic lenses--to limit having to explain to the \nAmerican people how much this war will cost. This unnecessary war, how \nmuch will it cost, this war which the American people should never have \nfought, never. They were fooled, then, into believing there were \nweapons of mass destruction all over Iraq and that we were in danger of \nseeing a mushroom cloud. But to date there have been none found. This \nadministration, which will argue until they are blue in the face that \nblack is white and white is black, will still say: Oh, there are still \nweapons of mass destruction there; we just have not found them yet. \nThey are there. Well, who knows? Maybe they will be. But that is not \nthe way it was when the administration proposed our invasion of Iraq \nearly last year.\n  How much will it cost, to say nothing of how many lives will be lost \nbefore it is over? How many lives? On how many doors will that knock \nfall before the war ends?\n  See, we have two wars. We have the war in Afghanistan, which resulted \nfrom the attacks upon us on the Twin Towers, on the Pentagon--the \nattacks by al-Qaida, by the 19 hijackers, not one of whom was an Iraqi. \nNot one was from Iraq. That is the war that is still going on in \nAfghanistan. That is the war I support. That is the war I have \nsupported from the beginning. But I have never supported the other war, \nthe Bush war, the war still going on in Iraq, the war that comes under \nthe rubric of the doctrine of preemptive strikes. That is another war. \nThat is the Bush war in Iraq. That is the war in which the American \npeople should never have had to spill a drop of blood. The American \npeople should never have had to send one of their sons or daughters to \nfight. That is the Bush war, and nobody knows how many more lives will \nbe lost before that war is over.\n  This year, the political posturing has gotten worse. Not only did the \nPresident not include any funds in his budget for the ongoing \noperations in Iraq, the administration has announced no supplemental \nwill be sent to the Congress until after the November election, \ndepriving the American voters of any opportunity to judge the President \nbased on his promises about the cost of a war in Iraq. This is a budget \nof gimmicks, false promises, unrealistic expectations. It is a budget \nof misdirection, canards, speciousness, spuriousness, sophistry, \nequivocation, fallacies, prevarications, and flatout fantasy.\n  Worse, under the guise of reining in budget deficits, this \nadministration is continuing its assault on the values of the working \nclass. This is an administration of corporate CEOs and Texas oil men. \nThe corporate elite of this administration did not grow up wondering if \ntheir parents could afford to send them to college. Their parents did \nnot have to choose between paying for groceries and paying for health \ncare. Their parents did not have to stay up late at night worried about \nwhether they would lose their pension benefits or whether Social \nSecurity would be enough to provide for their retirement.\n  When the administration proposes to cut these programs or fails to \nprovide adequate resources for them, it is because it has no personal \nunderstanding of the plight of American workers and how much the \nPresident's budget cuts affect middle-class Americans.\n  Only a President who never had to apply for unemployment benefits \nwould oppose extending them when so many workers are without a job. \nOnly a President who never needed overtime pay would advocate taking it \naway from those workers who rely on it to make ends meet. Only a \nPresident who never needed Federal aid to attend college would advocate \ncutting it back for those students who cannot attend college without \nit.\n  When this administration leaves office--and I hope it won't be long--\nits legacy will be an enormous debt, an enormous debt burden that will \nweigh heavily on the middle class. In the process, it will have \nseverely weakened their safety net and will have left little means for \nfixing it. But it won't matter to this President. At that point, he \nwill just move back to Texas, back to good old Crawford, TX, knowing \nthat his pension and his health care benefits are secure, and that \ncorporate CEOs and Texas oil men are wealthier and more comfortable \nthan ever before. He will never have to rely on the safety net his \nadministration has worked so hard to dismantle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1875-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk for a few moments about \nmany of the subjects Senator Byrd addressed. I think this week has been \na wake-up call to the United States, for the Senate, for the House of \nRepresentatives, and I hope for the White House, because this week the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Greenspan, as the Washington \nPost headlined from the next morning indicates: ``Fed Chief Urges Cut \nin Social Security.'' The subhead says: ``Future Benefits Must Be \nCurtailed, Greenspan Warns.''\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n  Chairman Greenspan is talking in this article about the \novercommitment this country has. He said:\n\n       I am just basically saying we are overcommitted at this \n     stage.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan went on to suggest that he favors making permanent \nthe tax cuts the President has proposed. He also says he recommends we \ncut Social Security benefits as one way of beginning to deal with these \nlong-term imbalances.\n  Not so long ago, the President, in his FY2002 budget, ``A Blueprint \nfor New Beginnings'' said:\n\n       None of the Social Security surplus will be used to fund \n     other spending initiatives or tax relief.\n\n  None. Oh, how wrong the President was in that assertion because when \nwe look at his budget what we find is he is going to borrow from Social \nSecurity $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years--$2.4 trillion--and he \nhas no plan to pay it back.\n  It is very interesting to look at the relationship between the money \nthe President is taking from the Social Security surplus over the next \n10 years to float this boat, nearly $2.4 trillion, and to compare it to \nhis tax cuts during this same period.\n  Notice how similar the figures are. They are almost identical. The \namount being borrowed from the Social Security trust fund is almost \nidentical to the money going out in the tax cuts, primarily income tax \ncuts, that go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest among us, as this chart \nshows.\n  This chart shows the benefits of the Bush income tax cuts. What it \ndemonstrates is the top 1 percent, those with incomes of over $337,000 \na year, get 33 percent of the tax cuts. That is pretty stunning. Let me \nrepeat it. Those who are in the top 1 percent, earning over $337,000 a \nyear, got 33 percent of the benefits of the income tax cuts. And now we \nfind out it is being financed by taking Social Security money funded by \nthe payroll taxes overwhelmingly paid by middle-income Americans.\n  This is an enormous wealth transfer from the many to the few. This is \nclass warfare writ large. Take from the many, give to the few, and then \nhave us head in a fiscal direction that leads the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve to say, at the end of the day, cut the Social Security \nbenefits that were supposed to have been financed by the payroll taxes \nof the people who paid them.\n  It is very interesting to see the effect of Social Security on this \nsociety. Two-thirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than \nhalf of their income; 31 percent of Social Security beneficiaries get \nat least 90 percent of their income from Social Security; 33 percent \nget 50 to 89 percent of their income from Social Security.\n  If you put those two together, nearly two-thirds of retirees rely on \nSocial Security for more than half of their income. We know Social \nSecurity has been the engine driving people who are Social Security \nbeneficiaries out of poverty.\n  This chart shows without Social Security, 48 percent of our Nation's \nseniors would be in poverty. With Social Security, only 9 percent are. \nIs anybody paying attention here? We talk about connecting the dots. We \ntalk about what has happened with the fiscal policy this President has \nconstructed, a fiscal policy that has led to the largest deficits in \nthe history of our country, budget deficits that have no end in sight, \nthat have led the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to say: Cut Social \nSecurity benefits but make the tax cuts permanent, and the tax cuts \nhave about the same cost over the 10-year period as the amount of money \nthat is being taken from the Social Security trust fund surpluses over \nthat same period. If we connect the dots, it becomes very clear.\n\n  Middle-class people are paying heavily into Social Security with \npayroll taxes on the promise they will get Social Security benefits, \nbut the money is being taken and instead of being used to prepay the \nliability or to pay down the debt to prepare for their retirement, the \nmoney is being used to finance income tax cuts for the wealthiest among \nus.\n  I showed a chart that demonstrated the top 1 percent, those earning \nover $337,000 a year, get a third of the tax benefits. But it is even \nmuch more dramatic than that. If you are earning over $1 million a \nyear, those who in this country are fortunate enough to earn over $1 \nmillion a year will get a tax cut this year of over $100,000.\n  Those earning over $1 million a year will get an average income tax \ncut of over $100,000, and yet we are running deficits that are the \nbiggest in the history of the country with no end in sight, so serious \nthat the Chairman of the Federal Reserve board says: Cut Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  This is all about choices. This chart shows the cost of the \nPresident's tax cuts over a 75-year period, $12 trillion. The Social \nSecurity shortfall over that same period is just under $4 trillion. It \nis a 3-to-1 ratio. The difference between the cost of the President's \ntax cuts over a 75-year period and the Social Security shortfall. The \nChairman of the Federal Reserve looks at that shortfall and says: Cut \nbenefits, but make the tax cuts permanent. That is the logic of where \nthe President's budgets are leading, and nobody should be under any \nillusion that is where this is all headed because here is what is about \nto happen.\n  This chart is the number of Social Security beneficiaries whose \nnumbers will explode with the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nWe are going to go from about 40 million in 2005, look at 2045, there \nwill be 82 million people receiving Social Security. This isn't a \nprojection. These people are alive. They have been born, and they are \ngoing to be eligible, and the President has no plan, none, to deal with \nit.\n  Under the President's budget, we are spending $991,000 a minute more \nthan we are taking in--$991,000 a minute. If we look at budget deficits \nand the relationship over a long period of time, from 1969 to this \nyear, we can see the deficits in dollar terms are at an all-time high, \nby far the biggest budget deficit we have ever had--$100 billion more \nthan last year, and last year was a record.\n  Some try to minimize it, saying: As a percentage of our gross \ndomestic product, these deficits are not so large. Wait just a minute, \nthese deficits are huge by any measure. If you look as a percentage of \ngross domestic product on an operating basis, protecting Social \nSecurity as it was intended to be, what one sees is this deficit is \nonly exceeded once since World War II as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct, only exceeded by a deficit of 6 percent of GDP back in 1983.\n  The big problem with the President's plan is he is hiding from the \nAmerican people the true effect of his policies. I do not make that \ncharge lightly. The President is hiding from the American people the \nfull effect of his policies. Here is just one way. Here is what happens \nto his tax cut proposal just beyond the budget window. This dotted line \nis the end of the 5-year period.\n  Here is what happens to the cost of the President's tax cut once you \nget beyond the 5-year window. It absolutely explodes. But it is not \njust his tax cut that explodes just beyond the budget window. So does \nthe cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax, the old millionaires' \ntax, designed to make certain that people with high incomes paid some \ntaxes. And yet that old millionaires' tax is rapidly becoming a middle-\nclass tax because, as we know, there will be 3 million people affected \nby it now, and at the end of the 10-year period there will be 40 \nmillion Americans affected by the alternative minimum tax.\n  The President does something about it for 1 year. He does nothing \nabout it for all of the future years.\n  This is the pattern of the cost increases to deal with the \nalternative minimum tax, which everybody knows has to be dealt with. \nThe President has no plan to do anything about it. It is not just in \nterms of paying the $2.4 trillion he is borrowing from back Social \nSecurity. He has no plan there. He has no plan to deal with the \nexploding cost of the alternative minimum tax. He has no plan to pay \nthe war cost, the war on terror.\n  He says we are going to fight a robust battle against terror, but he \nis not going to fund it because he has zero in his budget past \nSeptember 30 of this year. Does anybody believe the war on terror, the \nwar in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, is going to neatly end at the end \nof the fiscal year? Does anybody seriously believe that? That is what \nthe President says is going to happen. He says there is going to be no \ncost\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\npast September 30, no cost for Afghanistan, no cost for the war on \nterror, no cost for the war in Iraq, none.\n  When we ask him how can that be, his response is, gee, I really do \nnot know what the cost is going to be. Well, the right answer is not \nzero. The right answer is not no cost.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us the cost is going to be $280 \nbillion, but the President does not acknowledge that cost. It is no \nwonder that he is able to say he is going to cut the deficit in half in \n5 years. He just does not count things. He does not count the war cost. \nHe does not count dealing with the alternative minimum tax crisis. He \ndoes not count paying back the $2.4 trillion he is taking from Social \nSecurity, every penny of which he has to pay back but none of which he \nhas a plan to do.\n  The President says he is going to cut the deficit in half in the next \n5 years. We have gone back and included the cost of his war policies, \nhis tax cut proposals, and the alternative minimum tax, just those \nthree areas. What emerges is a more realistic view of where the deficit \nis headed. As we can see, there is no cutting the deficit in half.\n  In fact, we do not see the deficit ever getting below about $600 \nbillion. That is a realistic expectation, instead of what the President \nis telling the American people.\n  Here is what is happening to the debt: The gross debt of the United \nStates is absolutely exploding, at the very time the President promised \nus he would have maximum paydown of the debt. Remember 2001, that is \nwhat he told us, that he would have maximum paydown of the debt. \nInstead, the debt is exploding from some $6 trillion in 2001 to $15 \ntrillion by 2014.\n  This chart is one of the most sobering of all. The green bars show \nthe Social Security trust fund, the blue bars the Medicare trust fund, \nand the red bars show the tax cuts already enacted and those proposed \nby the President. What this shows is right now we are being buffered \nfrom the full effect of what the President has proposed by the \nsurpluses in the trust funds.\n  Look what happens when those trust funds go cash negative out in \n2016. At that very time the cost of the President's tax cut proposals \nexplode, driving us right over the cliff into deficits and debt never \nbefore seen in this country. Do not take my word for it. Here is the \nCongressional Budget Office report on the long-term budget outlook \nshowing the President's tax cuts exploding the deficit at the very time \nthe baby-boomers retire. This is not just reckless and irresponsible. \nIt is wildly reckless and irresponsible.\n\n  This is what happens under the President's scenario. Where is the \nmoney coming from? Well, he is going to borrow $2.4 trillion from \nSocial Security with no plan to pay it back, but that is not the only \nplace he is borrowing. Now he is borrowing from countries all over the \nworld. We are into Japan for over $500 billion and this is from 2003. \nWe know this is a much higher number now because Japan is buying \ndollars at a furious pace. So is China. We are into them for over $140 \nbillion, and that number would be much higher if we had a current \nnumber. We borrowed $62 billion from Caribbean banking centers. We are \nin hock to Hong Kong for $56 billion, to Taiwan for $46 billion, but we \nhave even borrowed $43 billion from South Korea.\n  When I was growing up, if anybody had told me America would be having \nto borrow money from South Korea, that we would be having to be \nborrowing money from Japan and China, why nobody would have believed \nit. But that is what is happening.\n  This was the President's statement just the other day in Louisville, \nKY:\n\n       We've got plenty of money in Washington, DC, by the way.\n\n  This is not the statement of a serious person, ``We've got plenty of \nmoney in Washington, DC, by the way.'' That is not the statement of a \nserious person when he is running the biggest deficit in the history of \nthe United States of America, with no end in sight, and his proposal is \nto dig the hole deeper, to have no more spending and cut the revenue \neven more when we already are running record deficits, right on the eve \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  This President tells the American people that we have plenty of \nmoney? The only reason there is plenty of money is because he is \nborrowing it from every place that he can find somebody who will loan \nit to him.\n  There is $2.4 trillion being borrowed from the Social Security trust \nfund with no plan to pay it back, and now Chairman Greenspan warns that \nthe over commitments are so large that Social Security benefits ought \nto start being cut.\n  That is the logic of the President's course, and it is a disastrous \ncourse. It is one that risks the economic security of this country. It \nis one that risks putting upward pressure on interest rates that will \nchoke off economic growth, that will cost this Nation even more jobs, \nand force this Congress and a future President into the most \nexcruciating of choices.\n  This is a reckless course. This is not conservative. This is radical. \nIt is reckless and it has to be stopped.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are Senators \nallotted a certain amount of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.

Mr. President, today things are peaceful in Washington, \nDC, and around the United States. We are all enjoying our time at home \nwith our families knowing that we can walk outside and go to our local \ngrocery store or to a shopping or a local theater, and knowing that we \nare reasonably assured we can do so with the assurance that we will not \nbe subjected to being killed or be subjected to a violent activity.\n  But today, as we are here, a reign of terror has descended upon a \nsmall and impoverished country a few hundred miles off our coast, the \npoorest country in this hemisphere, Haiti. A reign of terror has \ndescended upon Haiti. It is a crisis of immense human proportions.\n  As I take the floor today, the people of Haiti are living under the \nthreat of anarchy--under the threat that a few well-armed thugs and \nkillers who are well known to them because of their past involvement in \nplotting coup d'etat in Haiti because in the previous years they have \nbeen convicted by the courts in Haiti of murder. These same individuals \nnow have guns, modern weapons, flak jackets, helmets, and communication \ngear. They are threatening to take over the democratically elected \nGovernment of Haiti, and they are going to do it by killing thousands \nof people.\n  Today, stores and shops are closed in Port-au-Prince. The situation \nis deteriorating by the hour. Commercial airlines have cancelled all \nflights in and out of Haiti. Private charter flights have been halted. \nParts of the main port are reportedly on fire. U.S. diplomatic \nrepresentatives are hunkered down in the embassy compound guarded by \nsome Marines. France, Canada, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic have \nwithdrawn their personnel.\n  What is our response? Silence, nothing. We are a pitiful, helpless \ngiant when it comes to averting a humanitarian crisis in a small \nimpoverished country in our hemisphere a few hundred miles from our \nshores.\n  We can send $160 billion to Iraq. We can send our young men and women \nto Iraq to die. We can send billions of taxpayer dollars to Iraq to \nbuild their infrastructure. But we can do nothing to stop the bloodshed \nand the anarchy descending upon Haiti today.\n\n  I find this inexcusable. We have a moral obligation, a moral \nimperative because of our past relationships with Haiti, because it is \na neighbor of ours, because it is in our hemisphere, because we are the \nmost powerful country in this hemisphere, let alone the world, and \nbecause we believe in democracy, we believe in the rule of law, we \nbelieve in human rights and human dignity.\n  Do we only believe in it for Iraq? Do we only believe in it when it \nsuits our\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\nconvenience? Do we only believe in these principles when the country \nhas a lot of oil, for example? Are these just so many words we utter \nabout human rights, democracy, and rule of law? When it comes to a \nsmall, black, impoverished nation where people are poorer than dirt, \nwhere they have been subject to centuries of dictatorial rule, where \nthey have been ignored by their neighbors and by us for centuries, \nwhere they have been ground down for a couple of hundred years, I guess \nwhen it comes to a country like that, like Haiti, democracy, human \nrights, rule of law does not mean much. I guess it just means we can \nturn a deaf ear and a blind eye to what is happening.\n  The situation in Haiti cries out for us to do something. The poorest \npeople in this hemisphere are crying out to us to help them. Somehow, \nwe are saying we cannot do anything. Talk about a lack of moral spine. \nWhere is the moral spine of this administration when it comes to Haiti, \nwhen it comes to a poor, black, impoverished country like that? What is \nour response to the situation?\n  I read in the newspaper this morning that Powell puts pressure on \nHaitian leader to resign, that Secretary Powell is questioning whether \nhe should stay in office, and as Secretary Powell even said:\n\n       He is the democratically elected president, but he has had \n     difficulties in his presidency.\n\n  United States officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a \nresignation would be in order, that Aristide should resign.\n  He has been democratically elected. He has had some difficulties, and \ntherefore he should resign.\n  Let us take a look at that record, because I find this totally \nunacceptable and the American people ought to find this unacceptable. \nThese statements, combined with our inaction, have encouraged and \nemboldened a lawless insurrection by armed thugs and murderers. This is \nno legitimate uprising indigenous to the people of Haiti. These are a \nfew killers and thugs who got their hands on guns, who were in the old \narmy Aristide disbanded, and now they want to come back and take over \nHaiti again. Guess what. We are helping them by our inaction.\n  Human Rights Watch has said these insurrections are by the very same \npeople who are responsible for widespread killings and abuses that \noccurred during the military rule in the early 1990s.\n\n  Who are these people? We see them in the Post. They get pictures \ntaken. They give interviews. Guy Philippe is quoted all the time. Kind \nof a handsome-looking guy. Guy Philippe has given all these interviews. \nHe said in the paper he is going to get Aristide. We are going to get \nhim. He said, No way, Jose, will he be allowed to stay in office. This \nGuy Philippe knows how to use colloquial English.\n  Who is Guy Philippe? Who is this individual who now says he wants to \nrun the country, that he wants to take it over, who has the guns and \nthe arms? Well, not a very savory character. Guy Philippe was convicted \nof drug trafficking in Panama. He was extradited to the Dominican \nRepublic, put in jail in the Dominican Republic. Somehow--we do not \nknow how--somehow he got out of jail last year and, lo and behold, now \nhe is in Haiti with guns and with his old thugs from the military.\n  Louis Jodel Chamblain, one of the main leaders of this FRAPH, the \nRevolution Front for Haitian Advancement Progress. It means ``hit'' in \nCreole. Again, where does he come from? Well, you do not have to go \nvery far back. In the early 1990s during the military government this \nguy was very active--in killing people. In fact, he was convicted in \nabsentia in September of 1995 and sentenced to life imprisonment for \nthe murder of Antoine Izmery, a well-known prodemocracy activist. \nChamblain has been notorious for killing people in the past. Yet he is \nin Haiti right now, one of the guys who is going to liberate Haiti. And \nyou have Jean Tatoune, Jean-Pierre Baptiste, also a FRAPH leader, also \nin Haiti, one of those responsible for the massacre in Raboteau in \n1994. Again, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life \nimprisonment.\n  He is back again. He will liberate Haiti. These three individuals--\nand there are only three I mentioned; there are more who used to be in \nthe military--want to take Haiti back. They do not want democratic \ngovernment. They do not want to run for office.\n  Again, a little history is in order. We all know Haiti was one of the \nfirst countries where there was a slave uprising in 1804 and they threw \noff the French rule and defeated Napoleon, defeated Napoleon's forces \nand became a free country. It was kind of unsettling because we still \nhad slavery in America and a lot of Senators and Congressmen at that \ntime in the Congress of the United States were very upset about this \nslave revolt in Haiti. We had to be very careful it did not reach our \nshores.\n  After that, Haiti devolved into one dictatorship after another. For \nthe better part of the last century, most of the dictators were \nsupported by us, the Duvalier regime being the most infamous of them \nall.\n  Finally, after the Haitian people had been tortured and enough people \nkilled, they rose up in the 1980s and they got rid of not only Papa \n``Doc'' Duvalier, who died, but also his son, Baby ``Doc,'' and ran him \nout of the country. They had an electoral process and had an election \nin 1990 everyone said was fair, and a guy by the name of John Bertrand \nAristide won the Presidency in 1990. He was inaugurated, if I am not \nmistaken, in January of 1991.\n  How long was he President? Eight months. In 8 months the military \ncame in and threw him out. There was a coup d'etat and they threw him \nout of the country. And thus began a ruthless killing field in Haiti. \nOf all those people who had supported Aristide, the military went out \nand killed them. Some of these guys like Chamblain and Tatoune were \ninvolved in this.\n  The international community came down pretty hard on Haiti at that \ntime. Under President Clinton, we sent about 20,000 troops to Haiti to \nrestore order and to bring Aristide back as the elected President, \nwhich was accomplished.\n  It took 3 years, but we accomplished it. He came back, if I am not \nmistaken, in late 1994 or early 1995.\n  One of the things that was agreed upon with Aristide is that the 3 \nyears he was out of the country would count as part of his presidency. \nFor the good of Haiti, and to move democracy along, President Aristide \nagreed to that. Though he only served 8 months as President, he agreed \nthey would count all the time he was out of the country as part of his \npresidency.\n  He came back, and he had about a year in office before he had to \nleave, on a 5-year term. Before he left office, though, he did one \nthing: President Aristide, in 1995, disbanded the military. He said: \nHaiti does not need a military. No one is going to invade us. It uses \nup a lot of the money that should go for hospitals and education and \nthings like that, paying all these soldiers. We do not need soldiers.\n  He was right. Haiti did not need a military. So he disbanded the \nmilitary. Since that time, there has not been a military in Haiti.\n  A lot of these military people left the country, Guy Philippe being \none of them, who went to Panama and got involved in drug trafficking \nand got caught. He got put, as I said, in prison in the Dominican \nRepublic. Now he is out. Now he is back with a gun.\n  A little history is important to see what happened.\n  Aristide was out for 5 years because he also agreed he would abide by \nthe Constitution and he would not seek a consecutive reelection. The \nConstitution of Haiti says for a 5-year presidential term, you cannot \nhave two consecutive terms. You can come back and run later on, but you \ncannot have two consecutive terms. President Aristide agreed to that.\n  From 1995 until 2000, there was another President in there named \nPreval. I will not go into that. Aristide basically was not heard of \nmuch during that period of time. He formed a new political party. He \nran again in 2000 and was reelected in what was deemed a fair election. \nSome people say only 5 percent of the people turned out, but there are \nother accounts that as many as 60 percent of the people turned out to \nvote in that election. But the opposition wanted to boycott it, would \nnot participate.\n  Aristide was reelected for another term. Since that time, the Bush \nadministration has put an embargo on financial aid and assistance to \nHaiti. So when Secretary Powell says he has had difficulties in his \npresidency, sure, when we pull the rug out from underneath him, and we \ncut down aid and\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nsupport to a democratically elected government, of course they are \ngoing to have difficulties.\n  This is a poor country. This is a country where the military wants to \ntake over again. This is a country that for 200 years had no democracy \nwhatsoever and is still struggling to try to figure out how to make \ndemocracy work there. Of course there are difficulties. So I question \nSecretary Powell's and our administration's insistence somehow that \nAristide has to go.\n  One other thing is important. Recently the CARICOM nations--this is \nthe Caribbean community of nations--met in Jamaica to come up with a \nproposal to help try to solve the impasse in Haiti, the political \nstalemate in Haiti. They met. They invited the opposition to come. They \ninvited Aristide to come. Aristide went to Kingston, Jamaica. The \nopposition boycotted it.\n  The CARICOM nations decided on a plan they promoted for a political \nsettlement in Haiti. Guess who backed that plan. Our State Department, \nI assume speaking for the President. Our Secretary of State, the same \nSecretary Colin Powell, supported the CARICOM proposal, which was a \npower-sharing arrangement Aristide would have to give to the \nopposition. For the benefit of Haiti, to promote, again, democratic \nprinciples, Aristide agreed to that. He did not have to, but he agreed \nto it. Guess who did not agree to the CARICOM proposal. The opposition.\n  Let's get this straight. The Caribbean community comes up with a \nproposal for political settlement. Aristide agrees to it; the \nopposition does not. Our own Secretary of State promoted the CARICOM \nproposal, the settlement, and now our Secretary of State is saying it \nis Aristide who has to go. Wait a minute. He was the one who agreed to \nthe proposal. It was the opposition who did not agree.\n  What is going on here? One has to ask, what is going on? I see this, \nand I say, there is a disconnect here. There is something wrong here. \nThere is something wrong here when all of the focus is being put on \nAristide to leave the country. When you have murderers and thugs, ex-\nmilitary people convicted in absentia of vicious killings and murders \nin Haiti, who left the country, who are now coming back in with guns, \nmodern weaponry, one has to ask, where did they get them?\n  This is a country of 8 million people. How many people are we talking \nabout in Gonaives or in Cap-Haitien or places like that? The best \nestimates are maybe a couple hundred. One town got overrun with 40 \npeople. Forty people with guns came in, shot the police chief, killed \nhim, burned the police station down, and left the town. Out of 8 \nmillion people, you have 200 or 300 people who have these guns causing \nthis trouble.\n  That is a popular uprising? You might say, well, why don't the \nHaitian people, then, confront these people? Because the Haitian people \ndo not have an army because Aristide disbanded the army. The police \nforces he set up are ill-trained, ill-equipped to deal with it because \nwe did not come in to help them set up a professional police force in \nHaiti.\n  So when you come in with guns blazing, and you have the guns, who is \ngoing to stand up to you? That is why I opened my comments by saying, \nthe people in Haiti are in a reign of terror right now. And make no \nmistake about it, if Guy Philippe and Chamblain and those armed thugs \nare able to take over Port-au-Prince and either kill President Aristide \nor somehow run him out of the country, there will be a killing field in \nHaiti. Thousands of people will lose their lives because this army, \nvicious as it was in the 1990s, will be even more vicious now in \nseeking retribution against those who supported Aristide in disbanding \nthe Haitian military.\n  It is devolving into anarchy in Port-au-Prince and the rest of Haiti. \nPeople are fearful. They are fearful for their children, for their \nfamilies. Businesses are closed. Food aid. We were feeding 300,000 \npeople a day--malnourished, starving people. That now is not happening. \nThink about the implications of that. Think about it. Don't we have a \nmoral obligation here? The Bush administration, justifying inaction, \nsays it does not want to choose sides. I am not asking anyone to choose \na side. What we are asking the administration to do is to--right now, \nthis weekend, tomorrow--join with the OAS and send in a peacekeeping \nforce to bring some order to let people know they cannot run roughshod, \nthey cannot come in and shoot police stations up and burn buildings \ndown, to help create some stability.\n  The side we should choose is the side of democracy. That is the side \nwe should choose. These armed thugs were not elected. President \nAristide was elected, not the armed thugs. It is clear that the \nadministration's unwillingness to get involved is paving the way for \nthe destruction of Haiti's fledgling democracy.\n  What about all this talk of spreading democracy? What about the \nforward strategy for freedom? Can you imagine how this must sound to \nHaitians as we embolden and encourage the gunmen, criminals, and thugs \nwho are now trying to overthrow the democratically elected Government \nof Haiti? The administration speaks about democracy halfway around the \nworld. What about democracy 600 miles off our shores?\n  To be sure, the fledgling democracy in Haiti is imperfect. I am the \nfirst to admit that. But it would be a profound mistake of historic \nproportions that I believe would have deep moral implications for our \ncountry if we abandon this fledgling democracy to the likes of these \ngunmen.\n  Well, maybe the administration says this is an easy way out. We don't \ndo anything, we just let it go. Talk about an abdication of our \nposition in this hemisphere. We have a responsibility in Haiti--a \nresponsibility based on our democratic values, a responsibility based \non humanitarianism.\n  Mr. President, there is one other thing. There are now 20,000 U.S. \ncitizens in Haiti. We have a responsibility to protect them also. What \nabout those 20,000 American citizens in Haiti? Why are we not \nprotecting them? I ask that question. Why are we not protecting the \n20,000 U.S. citizens living in Haiti? Maybe you can draw your own \nconclusions. I don't know.\n  Well, what needs to be done? Right now, there is a debate on how we \ngot there. Who is right? Who is wrong? Did Aristide do this, or did he \nnot do that? Did he keep out the opposition? There is all this talk \nabout how we got here. When your house is on fire, you put out the fire \nfirst. You don't go around saying, How did it start? Get the fire out, \nthen we can have the debate about how we got there.\n  Haiti is on fire. It is burning right now. Innocent men, women, and \nchildren are being killed right now. We can stop it. We have the power \nto stop it--with very little involvement on our part. We have the power \nto stop it.\n  Tomorrow, the United States should deploy a stabilization force in \nHaiti along with the Organization of American States. The Organization \nof American States has a history in this, by the way. They have sent \npeacekeeping operations to places like Yugoslavia. The Caribbean \ncountries are one-third of the OAS. They have sent people, too, as \npeacekeepers. They have experience in this. They can be involved with \nus in setting up a stabilizing force this weekend in Haiti. If we were \nto send that signal now, that would stop these thugs and gunmen and \nmurderers in their tracks. But I can tell you, from conversations I \nhave had on the phone with people in Haiti today, that the people in \nHaiti are thinking that we are on the side of the thugs and the \nkillers. Why? Because we are not doing anything and they have the guns. \nIf we were to send in a stabilization force, the people of Haiti would \nknow we are on their side. That would give them courage. But right now, \nthe poor people of Haiti believe that they are alone--alone, forgotten, \nabandoned, as they have tried to implement a democratic form of \ngovernment in their country.\n\n  The administration says they don't want to act until there is a \npolitical settlement. Mr. President, you cannot have a political \nsettlement until you have some stability. You cannot have a political \nsettlement when people are being gunned down in the streets, when armed \nthugs are burning down police stations. Think about that.\n  The people who want to ``liberate'' Haiti are the people with guns. \nWhat are they doing? They are burning down police stations. Does that \ngive you an idea of what they want to do after they take over?\n  The administration says they are reluctant to act without a political \nsettlement. You cannot have a political\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nsettlement without stability. Stability first. That is why I say this \nadministration, tomorrow, needs to send in a peacekeeping force to \nHaiti, along with the Organization of American States. It can be done \nin less than 24 hours. It would stop the bloodshed immediately. Then we \ncan work on the CARICOM proposal or other proposals for a political \nsettlement.\n  How are you going to have a political dialog, a political settlement \nin this environment right now? Our own embassy staff cannot even leave \nthe compound or move around. How can we work on dialog and a \nresolution? You have to have a secure environment in order for a \nproductive dialog to take place. Is it this administration's intent to \ntotally destabilize the Aristide government, the democratically elected \ngovernment of Haiti, and let the gunmen take over and hope somehow we \ncan deal with them later? Is that their intent? Because that is who is \ngoing to take over. It will not be the political opposition. It will be \nthe people with the guns. The most lethal element in Haiti will be the \nones who will take over. Don't take my word for it. Read the paper. \nWhat are Guy Phillipe and Jodel Chamblain and others saying to the \npress? They are going to run things, not some civilian opposition.\n  After we would send in a stabilizing force this weekend, we would \nwork with OAS, the CARICOM, to mediate a political solution, one that \nrespects and preserves Haiti's emerging democracy. On February 20, I \njoined with a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary \nPowell saying the CARICOM initiative offers the best vehicle for a \npeaceful resolution of this critical situation. If we fail to act, \nthere will be real consequences.\n  Consider what happened in 1993 and 1994 when we didn't act at that \ntime. Thousands of Haitians were killed, torture chambers were set up. \nThere was raping and pillaging and looting. Many more fled to the U.S. \nand other neighboring countries. That was in 1993. That is when we had \na military dictatorship in Haiti. The same people are now trying to \noverthrow the Aristide government.\n  But today we are on the brink of even a bigger catastrophe. The World \nFood Program, which I have mentioned, is feeding about 300,000 Haitians \na day. This distribution, for all intents and purposes, is stopping. A \nhumanitarian crisis of immense proportions is happening on our own \ndoorstep, and we do nothing.\n  What kind of signal do we send to the children of Haiti? Is it our \nsignal that the only way to get anything done is to pick up a gun, to \nkill, to intimidate?\n  The issue is not about partisanship. The issue is about a \nhumanitarian crisis. This small impoverished country, the poorest in \nour hemisphere, a nation with this long history of dictatorial regimes \nsupported a lot by us is crying out for help.\n  We have a small, diminutive man, a former Catholic priest, Jean-\nBertrand Aristide, a hero to his people, elected freely twice, \noverthrown once by a murderous coup in the nineties who has come back \nfearlessly to try to engender a political democratic solution to the \nproblems in Haiti, this very small diminutive man who disbanded the \nmilitary in Haiti is asking for our help to save the democratic system.\n  Every time we have called upon President Aristide to take a step back \nto do something for the democratic process in Haiti, he has done so. As \nI said, when he was in exile in the nineties, in our dealing with the \nmilitary in Haiti, we made Aristide agree that the 3 years he was in \nexile would be counted as part of his Presidency, even though he was \nnot there, even though he served only 8 months as President. For the \ngood of democracy and his constitution, he agreed to those requests. \nEven though he would have been reelected in a landslide in 1995, he \nabided by the constitution and did not seek reelection, as the \nconstitution provides.\n  So this little man without an army, without any oil, without some \nstrategic importance in the world community, this little diminutive \nman, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Catholic priest, who, back when \nhe first started in the eighties, only wanted to increase the \neducational level, the health level, the living standards of the \npoorest people in Haiti--it has been his life's work--is crying out for \nour help to save democracy.\n  What are we saying to him? Leave the country. You leave the country \nand turn it over to the gunmen. That is not saving democracy. That is \ndestroying it. That is killing the fledgling democracy in Haiti.\n  President Aristide said he would serve until his term is up, I \nbelieve it is February of 2006, but when Secretary Powell and the \nCARICOM nations went to Aristide and said, Look, to save your fledgling \ndemocracy, you have to agree upon powersharing, upon this, all the \nelements they put into that package, what did Aristide say? OK, to save \ndemocracy in Haiti, he would do it. The opposition, to save democracy, \nwould they come halfway and meet him? They said, no, they would not \nagree to that. The only thing they would agree to is Aristide going \ncompletely out of the country and them taking over.\n  One has to wonder what is going on. This is a seminal moment, I \nbelieve, in the history of our country and in our relationship to the \nrest of this hemisphere because what we do or do not do in Haiti this \nweekend and immediately speaks to what the American character is, what \nwe really stand for. The moment is now.\n  Haiti could descend into anarchy at any moment. On the radios in \nPort-au-Prince, opposition people are getting on the air saying \nAristide is fleeing the country; right now he is fleeing the country. \nThe poor people who were counting on Aristide to protect them now are \nfrightened, and it emboldens the gunmen and the thugs to take over \nbecause they do not see us anywhere, and not seeing us anywhere must \nmean we are on the gunmen's side because they have the guns.\n\n  Now they are trying to say this is some kind of a popular uprising. \nThese gunmen, these murderers, these ex-military people were not even \nin Haiti. They had been convicted by the courts in Haiti of murder, \nsentenced to life in prison in absentia. There is no popular uprising. \nThese are armed thugs coming across the border from the Dominican \nRepublic taking arms, communications equipment, and everything with \nthem and terrorizing people, killing policemen, and burning down police \nstations.\n  They are well equipped. They have big weapons. They move at night. \nThey know how to communicate. This is an uprising of Haitian people? \nNot a bit.\n  The people of Haiti are crying out to us. It speaks to our moral \nvalues. Are we going to pay attention to the poorest country in this \nhemisphere, one of the poorest in the world, almost an entirely black \ncountry where they have been beaten and trod upon for so long and where \nthey saw a little bit of hope and finally getting out from under \nmilitary rule, under dictatorial regimes, such as the Duvaliers, being \nable to have some power to vote for who they wanted to see in office, \nnot who we wanted to see in office? Are we just now going to turn our \nbacks on them?\n  I hope not. I hope that somewhere in this State Department, somewhere \nin this administration there is a spark of conscience that says we \ncannot stand by, that we must send a peacekeeping force to Haiti \nimmediately, and we have to work upon a political settlement rather \nthan a settlement at the end of a gun barrel held by thugs and \nmurderers.\n  I hope there is a spark of conscience someplace because if there is \nnot, a lot of people are going to die, a lot of innocent people, poor \npeople, people who do not have much to begin with. They are going to \nget in their boats. They are going to want to flee the country. What \ndid our President say? If they come out, we will pick them up and send \nthem right back. Think about that. Poor people trying to flee the \nkilling fields, and we are telling them if they get in a boat and try \nto go someplace, we will send them back.\n  Is this America? Is this the country my mother came to as an \nimmigrant? There is a lot to ponder in our relationship with Haiti at \nthis point in time. It is a seminal moment. I believe what happens \nwithin the next 24 to 48 hours will determine the fate of democracy in \nHaiti. It will determine the fate of thousands of innocent Haitian \npeople and it will determine our moral standing, not only in this \nhemisphere but in the world.\n  I hope that spark of conscience happens very soon somewhere in this \nadministration, because anarchy, murder,\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nand killings are going to happen very soon unless that spark of \nconscience happens somewhere in this administration.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

At this juncture, Mr. President, I rise with heavy heart \nin that Thursday morning, Boris Trajkovski, the President of Macedonia, \nperished in a plane crash in the mountains of Bosnia. He was a good \nman, a man I had met, a man with whom I had extensive discussions, a \nman who was a great leader. Indeed, the people of Macedonia have lost a \ntrue hero and, indeed, America has lost a great friend.\n  Elected to his country's highest post in 1999, President Trajkovski \nheld his country together through terrible crises and conflicts. He \nkept the struggling new Republic from descending into anarchy and civil \nwar and, in doing so, set an example for the entire region.\n  President Trajkovski was one of our first allies to publicly support \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and to commit troops to the liberation. The \nIraqi people owe President Trajkovski and the Macedonian people a debt \nof gratitude for his belief in them.\n  He was a sincere champion of freedom. Only 47 years old, Boris \nTrajkovski was a President, a minister, an attorney, a father, and a \nhusband. Our prayers go out to his family and the families of all who \nwere lost on that fateful plane.\n  It is my hope that the people of Macedonia will honor him by carrying \non his work of cultivating and nurturing their newfound freedom.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nprogress that has been made to date in my efforts to resolve a \ncritically important issue; that is, the issue of asbestos litigation--\na crisis that is currently playing out and has been playing out over \nthe last several years, an issue I have addressed on the floor of the \nSenate. I wanted to give an update of where we are, a little bit about \nwhere we have been, but also what my expectations will be as we look to \nthe future.\n  First and foremost, we have made good progress toward enacting \nChairman Hatch's FAIR Act, which is the Fairness In Asbestos Injury \nResolution Act. I have made this a personal priority in that the Senate \nmust resolve this issue.\n  First of all, the crisis itself, the asbestos crisis. As I mentioned \non the floor last fall, the magnitude of the asbestos crisis is truly \noverwhelming. The torrent of litigation has wreaked havoc on victims, \non American jobs, and on the economy. The 600,000 claims that have been \nfiled have already cost $54 billion in settlements, in judgments, and \nin litigation costs.\n  Even with those billions being spent, the current asbestos tort \nsystem has today become nothing more than a litigation lottery. A few \nvictims receive adequate compensation, and far more suffer long delays \nfor unpredictable and inequitable awards, if they receive anything at \nall. Today, it is a system with only one real winner; that is, the \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers. They are taking half of every dollar that is \nawarded to victims. One-half of every dollar that is awarded to victims \nends up going to plaintiffs' trial lawyers.\n  The future prospect for people who have been victimized even gets \nworse. But let me say it is not only the victims who suffer--that is \nclear--but workers lose their jobs. Asbestos-related bankruptcies spell \ndoom for workers' jobs, for their incomes and, of course, for their \nretirement savings. It has already cost more than 60,000 Americans \ntheir jobs. For those who lose their jobs, the average personal loss in \nwages over a career is as much as $50,000. That $50,000 does not \ninclude lost retirement and lost health benefits.\n  Workers at asbestos-related bankrupt firms with 401(k) plans lost \nabout 25 percent of the value of their 401(k) plans. The victims; yes. \nThey have been hurt by the current system but, indeed, with the \nbankruptcy of these companies, employees are hurt all around the \ncountry.\n  The problem is there. It is a crisis. It is a crisis that is getting \nworse. It is not getting better. Thus, it is incumbent upon us to act.\n  I asked a simple question during my remarks last year. That question \nwas, Can we create a system that is better than the status quo? The \nanswer is, of course, yes. But time is running short. That is what \nbrings me to the floor today.\n  First of all, progress to date: The crisis is there, it is getting \nworse, and it demands a response from us. As an update on what we have \naccomplished to date, the FAIR Act--Fairness In Asbestos Injury \nResolution Act--has already made significant headway. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Hatch, it was passed by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last July, and there have been ongoing discussions and \nnegotiations ever since.\n  I commend Senator Hatch and the ranking minority member, Senator \nLeahy, for their tremendous hard work on this bill.\n  I also want to recognize my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, who has done hard work in conjunction with Judge Becker on \nthis particular issue.\n  A strong bill, steady progress, and constant discussion.\n  I want to note that my Democratic colleagues as well as organized \nlabor and other stakeholders have been deeply involved throughout the \nprocess.\n  Led by Senator Hatch, bipartisan breakthroughs were made on issues \nthat previously have proved irreconcilable. These included a whole \nrange of issues but included the linchpin issue of medical criteria \nthat has proven historically to be so difficult and controversial.\n  In addition, much work was done over the winter recess to resolve \noutstanding issues regarding the appropriate administrative structures \nof the system for resolving current and future asbestos claims.\n  What has emerged under S. 1125 and the current negotiations is a \nstreamlined national trust fund for paying asbestos claimants quickly, \nfairly, and efficiently. The new system will provide more certainty and \nefficiency for claimants, and more certainty and predictability for \nbusinesses.\n  Passing this bill will create enormous economic benefits. Certainty \nthat flows from a bill will stimulate capital investment, preserving \nexisting jobs and creating new ones. I had hoped to bring this bill to \na floor vote before the end of last session, but we were simply unable \nto achieve that goal.\n  Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy worked hard to resolve many \ndifficult issues at the committee level. Senator Daschle and I, along \nwith our staffs, have continued to work with stakeholders to put more \nissues behind us over the past months. In fact, there have been more \nthan 20 meetings starting last July at which my staff, Senator Hatch's \nstaff, Senator Specter's staff, and staff representing the minority \nhave negotiated these issues.\n  While there are many issues which remain outstanding, the core \nprinciples of an effective bill are now clear. The crisis is there, the \ncrisis is getting worse, the bill has been delivered, continued \nprogress, continued discussions with improvement of the bill.\n  Then the question is, Where do we go from here?\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\n  If we intend to make good on our collective hope to pass legislation, \nat some point the ongoing discussions and negotiations must end and a \nbill must be brought to the floor.\n  In addition to the months of work that have been put in by my staff \nand others on these discussions last year, we had an additional 90 days \nsince the winter recess, and I am prepared to have talks go on for \nanother 30 days through the end of March. But at some point, talking \nmust end. As I made clear last fall, I am committed to bringing a bill \nto the floor by the end of March.\n  Victims are still going uncompensated. Companies are still going \nbankrupt, and the economy is still being unnecessarily burdened.\n  The minority leader, as well as Senator Leahy, Senator Dodd and other \nDemocratic Members have made clear to me their interest in working \ntoward consensus legislation.\n  I ask all participants in the process to work during these remaining \ndays to bring these discussions to a close and to reach consensus on \nthe remaining outstanding issues.\n  I am not interested in forcing a vote on this bill. But the victims \nand the workers who are being hurt by these delays deserve closure. \nThey deserve a bill that puts an end to this ongoing crisis. I will \nbegin floor action on an asbestos bill either the last week of March or \nthe first week in April. Again, I will begin floor action on an \nasbestos bill either the last week of March or the first week in April.\n  There is no perfect solution to the current asbestos litigation \ncrisis. But it is clear that maintaining the status quo is simply \nunacceptable. We must not let this historic opportunity to enact fair \nand meaningful reform pass in order to pursue a perfect solution that \nis unachievable. The time has come for the Senate to fashion the right \nsolution for one of the most pressing issues facing us, facing our \neconomy, and facing this Nation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1882-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1882-S1883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will make a few comments in respect to \nthe closing days of Black History Month, the month of February.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to take a truly extraordinary \njourney with Members of the Senate and House Members. I use the word \n``journey'' because this trip was not only to a geographic destination, \nnot only a place to which we traveled but, indeed, was in many ways an \nemotional and a spiritual voyage that touched--I know me and, in \ntalking to my colleagues, them--in very deep and meaningful ways.\n  It was 2 weeks ago Friday that we departed from Washington. This \njourney was one I had the honor of leading. It was a bipartisan \ndelegation. Ten Senators participated at some time over the course of \nthose 3 days on this civil rights pilgrimage to Alabama and to \nTennessee. It was a real privilege to travel not just with my \ncolleagues in this body and the House of Representatives, but also \ntraveling with us were some of the loftiest figures of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  These included our colleague, Congressman John Lewis, who, by the \nway, graciously organizes this trip each year for his colleagues. This \nis the first time he specifically put it together for the Senate, but \nalso traveling with us or speaking to us as we were in Alabama and \nTennessee were the real civil rights giants, people such as Dorothy \nCotton; Bernard LaFayette, who I had the opportunity to get to know \nover the years, he is a close friend of a physician friend, Dr. Karl \nVanDevender from Nashville; Diane Nash, who played a prominent role in \nthe nonviolence movement, much of which originated in Tennessee; \nJohnnie Carr; Attorney Chestnut, whose vivid words are starkly ringing \nin my mind even as I stand here; Bob Mants, and the list goes on--\npeople who were there, people who participated through the late 1950s \nand early 1960s in the civil rights and nonviolence movement.\n  I say to them and take this opportunity, something I have told each \none personally, to publicly thank them for their service to our \ncountry, for their willingness to face violence and intimidation \ndirectly, to face injustice and to face oppression, and to face all of \nthis with bravery and to face it with love and caring and compassion. \nIt was this juxtaposition of one facing the other that ultimately had \nthe impact of transforming America. Indeed, it led to a great awakening \nthat continues to reverberate through history.\n  I also thank these remarkable individuals for sharing their hearts \nover this 3-day period, of sharing their faith, sharing their \nspirituality, and sharing their stories with us for these intense \nsessions over Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I speak for my colleagues. \nAgain, 10 Senators is 10 percent of the Senators in this body \nparticipating in this pilgrimage in some shape or form. I speak for all \nof them when I say that we thank the participants from the civil rights \nmovement who spoke to us, who spent time with us, and left us \nprofoundly inspired.\n  We began our trip in Montgomery, AL, visiting the Montgomery bus stop \nwhere Rosa Parks said no to moving to the back of the bus. We marched \nover the Edmund Pettus Bridge where--you read about it and you study it \nand you hear where, as they marched over the bridge they were trampled \nby horses and were beaten with billy clubs and were sprayed with tear \ngas just for the audacity of seeking their constitutional right to \nvote. You read about it and you hear about it and you see it in some \nlittle clips, but actually being there, that physical presence, that \nphysical sense of time and space that we were given 2 weeks ago, really \ncaptures the full picture as much as one can. Again, to those \nparticipants, I say thank you.\n\n  We met with people throughout who were present and who described the \ncrushing of bones as those billy clubs came down; people who, in the \nfirst person, described in such vivid detail, that had such a \ntremendous impact when you hear it. It is difficult for me to find just \nthe right words to express the power of standing shoulder to shoulder \nwith people who actually crossed the bridge at the time, that bridge \nthat almost 40 years ago was faced with the threatening opposition \nstanding before them.\n  We later visited the Birmingham Sixteenth Street Baptist Church where \nfour young girls perished on that vicious Sunday morning bomb attack--\nagain, talking to other people who were in the church that morning when \nthat bomb went off, taking the lives of those four young girls.\n  We walked through Kelly Ingram Park where Bull Connor unleashed dogs \nand fire hoses on schoolchildren. And on Sunday we entered the \nNashville First Baptist Church where the nonviolence movement's young \nheroes studied and learned and where we heard accurately described the \nrole-playing of nonviolence which ultimately played out just a few \nweeks and a few months later in the historic lunch counter sit-ins in \nNashville. The role-playing, the studying, the curriculum, the \ndiscipline, was all around a movement of nonviolence which \ncharacterized so much of the subsequent Civil Rights Act in the late \n1950s and early 1960s. We met many of the participants who were at the \nhistoric lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville, sit-ins that peacefully \ntransformed Nashville, TN, over a period of weeks and then months, sit-\nins that started at the lunch counters and subsequently a few months \nlater moved to the movie theaters.\n  We walked in the footsteps of giants, and we came closer thereby to \nknowing them as men and women.\n  I relate all this because it is also clear to me that the movement is \nnot over. So much has changed. We heard it again and again, so much has \nchanged in a very short period of time, but the great hope of that \nmovement has yet to be realized; that is, full equality not only before \nthe law but in the lives of every single citizen.\n  Immediately you relate it to the sort of things we do in the Senate, \nto create an environment that equality is not just before the law but \nin the lives of every citizen. That means equal education. It means no \nchild left behind. It means equal opportunity to live the American \ndream. It means equal treatment at the doctor's office. It means equal \nconsideration by the mortgage lender. It means equal opportunities to \nclimb that economic ladder and to open the doors to higher learning.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month, as we look forward to the 50th \nanniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, we must remember that, yes,\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\nyes, we have come a long, long way, but there are still many miles to \ngo.\n  In his historic speech following the march to Selma, the great Dr. \nKing told his fellow freedom marchers and, I should add, generations to \nfollow:\n\n       We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at \n     peace with itself, a society that can live with its \n     conscience. And that will be a day not of the white man, not \n     of the black man. That will be the day of man as man.\n  I would like to close with a wonderful account that I think does \nunderscore the universality and great achievement of the civil rights \nmovement. It also underscores the truth that all it takes is one person \nand one act of courage to inspire millions.\n  The following is an account by the historian Douglas Brinkley. The \nyear is 1990. Nelson Mandela is arriving in Detroit, MI, where Rosa \nParks awaits on the tarmac. The passage reads:\n\n       ``He won't know me,'' Parks kept repeating, embarrassed \n     that she had come.\n       Moments later the airplane's door opened and Nelson Mandela \n     accompanied by his then-wife Winnie appeared to the \n     enthusiastic crowd, shouting ``Viva Nelson!'' and \n     ``Amandala!'' the Swahili word for power. Slowly he made his \n     way down the steps and toward the receiving line. Suddenly he \n     froze, staring openmouthed in wonder. Tears filled his eyes \n     as he walked up to the small old woman with her hair in two \n     silver braids crossed atop her head.\n       And in a low, melodious tone, Nelson Mandela began to \n     chant, ``Ro-sa Parks. Ro-sa Parks. Ro-sa Parks,'' until his \n     voice crescendoed into a rapturous shout, ``Ro-sa Parks!''\n       Then the two brave old souls, their lives so distant yet \n     their dreams so close, fell into each other's arms, rocking \n     back and forth in a long, joyful embrace. And in that \n     poignant, redemptive moment, the enduring dignity of the \n     undaunted afforded mankind rare proof of its own progress.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1883-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE HIGHWAY BILL AND 9/11 COMMISSION EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in regards to the issue which has been \nholding up the proceedings of the Senate, that is the extension of the \nhighway bill and the issue tied to it, which is the charter of the 9/11 \nCommission chaired by Governor Keane and former Congressman Lee \nHamilton, we have been in extensive discussions all day long. I would \nlike to begin by thanking the majority leader as well as the Senator \nfrom Nevada for their patience, but also their involvement in trying to \nhelp bring about a resolution to this issue. They have certainly done \neverything in their power.\n  The upshot of it is that the Senator from Connecticut and I have been \nin conversations with former Congressman Hamilton and Governor Keane. \nAs we understand from our conversations with them, they are scheduled \nto meet with the Speaker on Tuesday, this coming Tuesday, and that \ntheir chief of staff, the general counsel of the Commission, has been \nassured by the chief of staff of the Speaker that at that time the \nSpeaker will agree to an additional 30 days in addition to the 60 days \nthat the Commission will need to operate, and will be then given an \nadditional 30 days in which to wrap up their report. That is \nsatisfactory to Congressman Hamilton and Governor Keane. Both of them \nhave personally assured me that is satisfactory to them. They will be \nproceeding on the assumption that they will receive an additional 30 \ndays, as well as the 60-day extension.\n  I hope, as a result of this, that the House will take up and pass the \nbill reported out of the Senate Intelligence Committee which the Senate \nmajority leader had approved by a voice vote earlier today. It seems to \nme that is the most reasonable resolution.\n  I thank the majority leader again for his patience and hard work in \nthis effort, including visits over on the other side of the Capitol. He \ncertainly performed above and beyond.\n  May I finally say I believe that the Commission will now receive an \nadditional 60 days of work plus 30 days to wrap up, and hopefully this \nissue will be resolved.\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut who has always done such great \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, let me join the Senator \nfrom Arizona in thanking the majority leader, the Senator from Nevada, \nand our colleagues for working together. We have, in fact, in the words \nof Scripture, ``reasoned together,'' have we not? It may have taken \nlonger than it should have, which is not unusual for the Congress, but \nwe have reached a just result. I am grateful to the Speaker for having \nagreed to the extension of the deadline during which the Commission \ninvestigating September 11 will have to report by the 2 months that the \nCommission itself, the bipartisan Commission, requested and now having \napparently indicated to at least staff of the Commission that he is \nprepared, in addition to the 2-month extension for the report to be \ncompleted, to have an additional 30 days for a winddown period. But \nthis will be worked out in detail.\n  As Senator McCain said, the easiest way to do this is the way we all \nstarted today, which was with the Senate bill adopted that, in fact, \ndoes this 2-month extension for the report, 30 days for winding down of \nthe Commission.\n  The basic principle is the enormity of what happened, the horror of \nwhat happened on September 11, 2001, that none of us want to ever \nhappen again. That is what this Commission was created to investigate, \nand then advise us how to avoid.\n  There never should have been on the question of the search for truth \nabout September 11 a time deadline which the Commission itself believed \nwas too short to complete their work. I think we have now opened a \npath--a door--to give it the time it needs to complete its work, which \nis going to be critical to us as we continue to protect the security of \nthe American people at home.\n  Again, I thank everybody for being part of it.\n  Once again, it reminds me of the truth of what I said a short while \nago. It is good to be back in the Senate where sometimes it takes a \nlittle longer but good things actually get done. This is one of them.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I thank my friend from Arizona. He is a \ngreat and principled fighter for what is right.\n  The majority leader is bipartisan.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say on behalf of the minority \nleader that we certainly thank Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for \ntheir persistence in accomplishing something that is important.\n  I extend my appreciation to the majority leader for his patience. His \njob is a difficult job. He has 99 of us to put up with. Even though we \nare the most reasonable people in the world most of the time, once in a \nwhile it happens that we are not, and that makes his life more \ndifficult. Having been involved in working with leaders for a while \nnow, I appreciate his patience. It is an admirable quality.\n  Having worked with the very patient Senator Lieberman since he came \nto the Senate, I have such great admiration for him. I am personally \ndisappointed that it didn't work out better for him on the campaign \ntrail. But we are really happy to have him back. He is such a great \naddition to the Senate.\n  My friend from Arizona is one peg ahead of me in seniority. I am No. \n1778 and he is No. 1777 as far as the number of Senators coming here. \nSenator McCain is a unique individual. Every day, serving with him is \nan experience. The vast majority of those experiences are extremely \ngood.\n  (Laughter.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is an experience, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1883-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1883-S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2004\n\n\n               Technical Correction to Public Law 108-199\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I and my colleagues would like to engage \nmy friend, the majority leader, in a colloquy regarding a necessary \nchange\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nthat must be made to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004. This change pertains \nto the administration of the Federal Aid Highway Program and corrects a \ntechnical drafting error in the original bill. This technical \ncorrection must be enacted soon so as not to create unnecessary \nconfusion as to how the program is to be administered.\n  It was my expectation and that of several of my colleagues that this \ntechnical correction would be included as part of the temporary \nextension bill that was to be adopted today to extend the Federal Aid \nHighway Program for an additional 2 months. However, since it is the \ndesire of the majority leader to have the Senate pass the House-passed \nbill that was adopted last evening, we are not in a position to have \nthe technical correction included in the bill at this time. It is \nessential that this correction be enacted into law at the earliest \npossible date. It must be enacted into law during the next few weeks so \nthat the intent of the appropriations act can be carried out as \nintended.\n  Mr. BYRD. I share the concern of my chairman, Senator Stevens, on \nthis matter and join with him in insisting that the Senate attend to \nthis matter on a legislative vehicle that will be enacted into law very \nsoon. This matter is of the utmost urgency, if we are not to create \nconfusion at the Federal Highway Administration as to how this program \nis to be implemented.\n  Mr. SHELBY. As the chairman of the Transportation, Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I, too, wish to echo \nthe adamant view of Chairman Stevens that this provision must be \nenacted into law in the next few weeks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Transportation, Treasury and General Government, I also must insist \nthat this technical correction be adopted immediately. The provision in \nquestion simply ensures that the program will be administered in the \nsame manner as it has been in previous years. It must be enacted into \nlaw at the earliest possible date.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my colleagues for bringing this matter to my \nattention. As the bipartisan leaders of the full Appropriations \nCommittee and its Transportation Subcommittee, they have all been \nunified and consistent in their view as to the legislative intent of \nthe 2004 appropriations act. They have been equally unified in their \ninsistence that this matter be fixed as quickly as possible.\n  Given the fact that the other body has now adjourned, we are required \nto pass a bill without this technical correction in order to keep the \nhighway program operating beyond its expiration date of this Sunday, \nFebruary 29. I give my personal assurance to my colleagues that, in the \ncoming few weeks, I will work with my Senate colleagues as well as with \nthe House leadership to ensure that the necessary technical correction \nis incorporated in a legislative vehicle that the President will sign \nin the very near future. I share their hope that this can be \naccomplished prior to the expiration of the short term highway \nextension bill that we will be adopting today.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have the pleasure of serving both as \nchairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and a member of the \nTransportation/Treasury Appropriations Committee. I want to join with \nmy colleagues on the Appropriations Committee in emphasizing the \nurgency of adopting this technical correction as soon as possible. I \nalso want to join with the majority leader and commit myself to seeing \nto it that this correction is enacted into law in the next few weeks.\n  Mr. REID. I serve as the ranking member of Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee and I, like Chairman Bond, also serve on \nthe Transportation/Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee. In both of \nthose capacities, I want to commit myself to getting this important \ntechnical correction enacted into law at the earliest possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1884-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, in 1926, historian Carter G. Woodson \ndesignated the second week of February as ``Negro History Week,'' an \nopportunity for America to recognize the achievements and contributions \nmade by African Americans.\n  As a result of promoting our Nation's history of diversity, and \nadvancing tolerance and civil rights, this week was extended into a \nmonth in 1976.\n  Today, Black History Month serves as more than just a reminder of \nAfrican American culture. It serves as a reminder of how far America \nhas come in the areas of tolerance, civil rights, and diversity and far \nwe have yet to go.\n  Black History Month conjures up familiar heroes for all of us: Rosa \nParks and her legendary defiance; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his \nhistoric leadership; Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and his \nequitable judgment.\n  There are also inventors and physicians who may be less familiar to \nsome of us: Granville Woods, who was granted more than 60 patents for \ninventions including steam-driven engines and a telephone transmitter; \nand Dr. Charles Drew, a medical professor at Howard University who, \namong other things, developed a way to extend the storage life of blood \nfrom two days to 1 week.\n  Interestingly, Elijah McCoy, the developer of the locomotive \nlubricator, is responsible for one of the most familiar expressions in \nthe English language. Mr. McCoy, in an attempt to promote his product, \ncoined a catchy slogan to remind railroad engineers that his original \ninvention was the best: ``The Real McCoy.''\n  These are just some of our national heroes and heroines who achieved \nsocial, political, economic, and scientific goals. By reaching their \nown goals, they also contributed their strength and innovation to the \ncollective American thought.\n  While the southern United States is the birthplace of many \nsignificant achievements in African American history, there are also \naccomplishments of note in western States, including my native Nevada.\n  Among the African American men and women who hailed from or made \nsignificant contributions to Nevada, there are a few pioneers I want to \nintroduce to you.\n  At a time when black people were not invited to participate in the \npolitical process or the business world, there was a group of ranchers \nin Nevada who thought differently.\n  Ben Palmer, who was noted as ``one of the heaviest taxpayers in \nDouglas County,'' was a hugely successful rancher and businessman.\n  This may seem commonplace today. But at the time when he was \nprospering, blacks couldn't even vote, serve on a jury, testify against \nwhites, send their children to public school, or marry whites.\n  Mr. Palmer lived in Carson Valley, NE, which is not only one of the \nmost beautiful parts of the State, but also served as an early route \nfor the migration to California.\n  It didn't take long for him and his sister to deduce that, by \nestablishing\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nranches, they could turn a profit by providing care for weary travelers \nand their livestock.\n  Since there was no Federal authority over much of the land at that \ntime, ranchers used to just claim a spot of land and water rights; then \nthey would start to sell grazing rights to emigrants and cut grass to \nprovide feed during the winter.\n  By the 1870's, Palmer had established himself as a prosperous \ncattleman. It was reported in the Carson Valley News that he had driven \n1,500 head of cattle from Seattle to Carson Valley to replenish his \nherd. He also introduced fine horses into the Valley, pioneering \nlocally with the Bonner breed.\n  Despite the legal restrictions facing African Americans during this \ntime, Palmer was so highly regarded that he was invited to register to \nvote in the Mottsville precinct before the 15th Amendment to the \nConstitution was passed.\n  It is recorded that in 1876 and 1878, he was selected to be a member \nof a Douglas County grand jury, and was named to the panel of trial \njurors for that year's term of the District Court.\n  When the residents of Carson Valley launched a short-lived political \norganization, the National Greenback and Workingmen's Party, a county \ncentral committee was selected and Ben Palmer was one of the committee \nmembers representing the Mottsville precinct.\n  He couldn't read or write, but that didn't stop him; he wasn't \nsupposed to vote or serve on a jury, but he did anyway; the color of \nhis skin was supposed to prevent him from participating in the \npolitical process, but he pressed ahead.\n  It is no wonder that his obituary in the Record-Courier said that, \n``He met success in every meaning of the word and leaves one of the \nfinest farms in Carson Valley as a monument. He bore a man's part in \nthe battle of life, bore it bravely, gently and without ostentation. He \nbelieved in the right and practiced the right always.''\n  Treasure Hill and Virginia City are two other areas of Nevada where \nAfrican Americans overcame restrictions to find success.\n  The mining prospects in Nevada and other parts of the West attracted \npeople from all races and walks of life in search of gold.\n  Black people came to Nevada in hopes of securing mining jobs and \nfinding prosperity for themselves. Unfortunately, most mines would not \nhire blacks, as some whites quipped that they would be too ignorant to \ntell one rock from another.\n  This discriminatory perspective may explain why there were only six \nblack people recorded as official miners in Nevada in 1870. Another \nreason for their widespread absence from the mining industry may be \ntheir exclusion from unions.\n  Despite these obstacles, African Americans had considerable success \nmining in Treasure Hill in eastern Nevada from 1868 to 1870, noted as \n``probably the shortest, most intense mining rush in the history of the \nWest.''\n  In April 1869, a group of black miners, headed by William Hall and \nJ.C. Mortimer, announced their discovery of a rich mining ledge in \nTreasure Hill and vowed that they would ``supply (their) colored \nbrethren of the low countries with mines as good as any a white man \ndare own.''\n  Messrs. Hall and Mortimer incorporated the Elevator Mining Company of \nTreasure Hill, White Pine, and planned to issue 6,000 shares of stock \nat $100 each.\n  Treasure Hill was an economic advance for blacks and the area was \nhome to several wealthy families: Samuel Wilcox, Daniel W. Cherry, John \nMaxwell, Sanford Venery, and Joseph Anderson.\n  After fires and poor prospects drove many residents out, Treasure \nHill was left with only one black resident and only eight black \nresidents in White Pine County.\n  Another mining district, the Comstock Mining District, was founded in \n1859 and was once considered to be one of the richest gold and silver \ndiscoveries in history.\n  Blacks who had come to Virginia City in hopes of securing jobs in the \nindustry would face discrimination; however, when their mettle was \ntested, most were resolute to become business owners. Although there is \nno documentation of a particular neighborhood or area where they lived, \nthere is a scant record of the number of businesses they owned and \noperated.\n  One of the most successful businesses in Virginia City was the Boston \nSaloon. In 1864, William A.G. Brown founded the Boston Saloon only a \nyear after arriving from Massachusetts and initially working as a \nbootblack and street polisher.\n  The Boston Saloon catered to the Comstock black population and served \nas a place to socialize and exchange information about business \nopportunities.\n  Archeologists and historians discovered the site of the Boston Saloon \nin 1997 and quickly determined that uncovering the history behind the \nspecific characteristics of the saloon and its patrons would help \nreveal an important chapter of African American history in the early \nwest.\n  Ranchers, frontiersmen, miners, business owners--all success stories \nduring a time when success was discouraged or denied by ignorance and \ndiscrimination.\n  These are just a handful of the African Americans who made important \ncontributions toward the early establishment of Nevada and the early \nWest. Countless others have gone unnoticed or uncelebrated.\n  I commend Dr. Elmer Rusco of Reno for his tireless leadership in \nattempting to chronicle the contributions of African Americans in \nNevada. It is due to his scholarship that much of Nevada's black \nhistory is preserved and presented.\n  I am honored to share these nuggets of Nevada history on behalf of \nthe African Americans who helped establish the great Silver State, and \nin honor of Black History Month.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, for the past month, we have been \ncelebrating Black History Month.\n  I believe that Black History Month is not only a time to recognize \nthe contributions and achievements of African Americans to this Nation, \nbut it is also a time to acknowledge both progress African Americans \nhave made and the continued racial disparities in this Nation.\n  We usually celebrate African-American athletes, musicians, and \nactors. While their successes have been significant, I feel it is \nimportant that we acknowledge some of the great thinkers, inventors, \nand discoverers who were African American.\n  Some of the great pioneers include Dr. Charles Drew, who discovered \nthe process for storing blood plasma; Garrett Morgan, who was the first \nto patent the traffic light and the gas mask; Granville T. Woods, who \ninvented a train-to-station communication system; Astronaut Mae \nJamison, the first African-American woman to enter space; Dr. Benjamin \nCarson, who successfully separated Siamese twins joined at the head; \nand Otis Boykin who invented the electronic control devise for guided \nmissiles, IBM computers, and the pacemaker.\n  These great innovators and pioneers not only blazed the trail for \nother young African Americans to follow, but they also inspired and \ncontributed to American development and progress. Therefore, these \npioneers were not only great African Americans, they were \nquintessentially American.\n  During this time when our Nation's military is engaged in conflicts \nthroughout the world, I would like to acknowledge the contributions \nthat African Americans have made to every war in American history. \nToday, African Americans serve a vital part of the troops deployed \nthroughout the world, including Afghanistan and Iraq. Almost 22 percent \nof the members of our enlisted armed services are African-American.\n  Despite all of these important accomplishments, African Americans \nhave yet to enjoy true racial equality in this Nation. And, in the \nabsence of real equality, African Americans are being denied the \nessence of what it means to be a first-class American.\n  Statistics are the clearest barometer for determining and measuring \nthe quality of life in American society and far too many of them reveal \nthat African Americans continue to lag behind whites in important ways.\n\n       In January 2004, the national unemployment rate was 5.6 \n     percent overall but just 4.9 percent for white Americans \n     while it was 10.5 percent--more than twice as high--for \n     African Americans.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n       The national poverty rate rose, for the second straight \n     year, to 12.1 percent in 2002, from 11.7 percent the year \n     before. In 2002, the national poverty rate for African \n     Americans was 22.7 percent.\n       In 1999, median income for African Americans was $31,778, \n     compared to $51,244, for the median income of white families. \n     According to one report, in 1995, average white households \n     had $18,000 in financial wealth, while African-American \n     households possessed a total of only $200.\n\n  These statistics show the depth of racial inequality in America. In \naddition to economic disparities, the incarceration rate of African \nAmericans, especially African-American males, is deeply disturbing.\n\n       Today, black men make up 41 percent of the inmates in \n     Federal, State, and local prisons, but black men are only 4 \n     percent of all students in American institutions of higher \n     education, according to the Journal of Blacks in Higher \n     Education, autumn 2003.\n       According to a recent study, while African Americans are 13 \n     percent of the population of my home State of New Jersey, \n     they represent a staggering 63 percent of New Jersey's 27,891 \n     State prisoners in 2002.\n       About 10 percent of all black men between 25 and 29 were \n     incarcerated in 2002, compared with 1.2 percent of white men \n     and 2.4 percent of Hispanic men\n\n  Not only are African Americans imprisoned in disproportionately high \nnumbers, they are disproportionately the victims of crimes, as well. In \nNew Jersey, out of 341 total homicides by guns in 2002, 138 of those \nvictims were African American. In 2000, more than 6,200 African \nAmericans were killed by guns. In the 15 to 24 age group, firearm \nhomicides were responsible for more than 86 percent of homicides \nsuffered by African Americans. In the next age group up, 25 to 34, \nfirearm homicides were more than 81 percent of homicides. In both cases \nfirearm homicides were the number one cause of death for African \nAmericans. The homicide victim rate for African Americans, 20.5 per \n100,000 persons, is over six times that of whites, 3.3 per 100,000 \npersons.\n  I highlight these statistics about our Nation and my home State \nbecause the problems confronting the African-American community are in \nNew Jersey, and they are in every State. We all bear responsibility to \nacknowledge them, to confront them, to help remedy them.\n  There are no easy answers to the problems African Americans face, but \nas Theodore Roosevelt put it a century ago, ``This country will not be \na really good place for any of us to live in if it is not a really good \nplace for all of us to live in.'' So while we take this opportunity to \ncelebrate the wonderful accomplishments of African Americans through \nthe ages, we should also rededicate ourselves to making America a \nreally good place for all of us to live in.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every February nationwide we celebrate the \ndiverse and monumental contributions African Americans have made not \nonly for the advancement of African Americans but for all people of our \nNation.\n  This celebratory month was made possible by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, an \nAfrican-American studies scholar, who proposed such a recognition as a \nway of preserving African-American history. In keeping with the spirit \nand vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I would like to pay tribute to one \ncourageous woman, Sojourner Truth, who lived and died in Battle Creek, \nMI, and who played a significant role in addressing injustice and \ninequality in America. Sojourner Truth was a leader in the abolitionist \nmovement and a powerful voice in the women's suffrage movement, playing \na pivotal role in ensuring the right of all women to vote. Sojourner \nTruth changed the course of history.\n  Sojourner Truth was unable to read or write, but she mesmerized \nothers by her speeches addressing the inhumanity and immorality of \nslavery. In 1851, Sojourner delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' \nspeech at the Women's Convention in Akron, OH. She spoke from her heart \nabout the most troubling issues of her time. Her words on that day in \nOhio are a testament to Sojourner Truth's convictions and are a part of \nthe great legacy she left for us all.\n  I am proud and the people of my State are proud to claim this \nlegendary leader as our own. In September 1999, we honored Sojourner \nTruth with the dedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, \nwhich was unveiled in Battle Creek, MI.\n  Sojourner Truth was a political and social activist who personally \nconversed with President Abraham Lincoln on behalf of freed, unemployed \nslaves, and campaigned for Ulysses S. Grant in the Presidential \nelection in 1868. Sojourner was a woman of great passion and \ndetermination who was spiritually motivated to preach and teach in ways \nthat have had a profound and lasting imprint on American history.\n  Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 in Ulster County, \nNY, and served as a slave under several different masters. She bore \nfour children who survived infancy, and all except one daughter were \nsold into slavery. Baumfree became a freed slave in 1828 when New York \nState outlawed slavery. She remained in New York and instituted \nsuccessful legal proceedings to secure the return of her son, Peter, \nwho had been illegally sold to a slave-owner from Alabama.\n  In 1843, Baumfree changed her name to Sojourner Truth and dedicated \nher life to traveling and lecturing. She began her migration west in \n1850, where she shared the stage with other abolitionist leaders such \nas Frederick Douglass. In October 1856, Truth came to Battle Creek, MI, \nwith Quaker leader Henry Willis to speak at a Friends of Human Progress \nmeeting. She eventually bought a house and settled in the area. Her \nantislavery, women's rights, and temperance arguments brought Battle \nCreek both regional and national recognition. Sojourner Truth died at \nher home in Battle Creek, November 26, 1883, having lived quite an \nextraordinary life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Sojourner Truth ``Ain't \nI a Woman'' speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Ain't I a Woman?\n\n                          (By Sojourner Truth)\n\n       Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be \n     something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the negroes of \n     the South and the women at the North, all talking about \n     rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But \n     what's all this here talking about?\n       That man over there says women need to be helped into \n     carriages, and lifted over ditches and to have the best place \n     everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud \n     puddles, or gets me any best place!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed, and planted, \n     and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       I could work as much and eat as much as a man--when I could \n     get it--and bear the lash as well!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       I have borne five children and seen most all sold off to \n     slavery, and when I cried out with a mother's grief, none but \n     Jesus heard me.\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this \n     they call it? (member of the audience whispers `intellect') \n     That's it, honey.\n       What's that got to do with women's right or negroes' \n     rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and your holds a \n     quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half \n     measure full?\n       Then that little man in black there, he says women can't \n     have as much rights as men, cause Christ wasn't a women?\n       Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come \n     from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.\n       If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn \n     the world upside down all alone, these women together ought \n     to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! \n     And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.\n       Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain't \n     got nothing more to say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1886-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1886-S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been nearly 2\\1/2\\ years since a \nmonstrous act of war was committed against the United States. The \nAmerican people responded to the attacks of September 11 with courage--\ncourage that was evident that horrible day in the heroic actions of the \npassengers on Flight 93, in the firefighters and police officers at \nGround Zero, and in the Pentagon employees who led their co-workers to \nsafety through fire, smoke, and rubble.\n  That courage is evident today in the men and women of our Armed \nForces on the front lines in the war on terrorism and in the ordinary \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nacross the country who carry on normal, productive lives, refusing to \nbe terrorized by terrorism.\n  President Bush and Congress responded by recognizing that this was a \ndifferent kind of war with a different kind of enemy. Together we saw \nthat this enemy used as a weapon the freedom and openness that \nAmericans cherish but that it despises. We realized that our efforts to \ndefend our Nation against this unconventional and unprincipled enemy \nwere hampered by the lack of a unified strategy. To revisit a phrase \nused so often in the aftermath of September 11, we were not connecting \nthe dots. We knew that turf battles, communication gaps, and \ninteragency rivalries could no longer be tolerated. The stakes were too \nhigh.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is perhaps the most significant \nmanifestation of the efforts undertaken by the President and Congress \nto create that unified strategy, to connect those dots, to coordinate \nthis urgent new mission. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nwhich I chair, played a key role in creating the department and is \nhelping it to succeed.\n  My committee swiftly confirmed eight talented and dedicated \nindividuals to lead the department, including Secretary Ridge himself. \nWe have held hearings and investigations on a wide range of homeland \nsecurity issues, from the President's plan to better coordinate \nintelligence analysis and sharing, to unraveling the tangled web of \ninternational terrorism financing, to protecting American agriculture \nfrom sabotage, to securing our seaports. We have approved bills to \nreform the department's multi-billion dollar State grant program, to \nprovide cutting edge technology to first responders, to help the \ndepartment attract talented individuals with sought-after skills, and \nto ensure accountability within DHS's financial system.\n  Now the department is 1 year old. And in the span of just 1 year, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, under the leadership of Secretary Tom \nRidge, has made significant, even remarkable, progress.\n  The melding of 22 Federal agencies and 180,000 employees has occurred \nwith some of the resistance we all expected but without the widespread \nturf battles many predicted. The level of cooperation and coordination \nwithin this new department, though not perfect, is a vast improvement \nover the previous, ad hoc structure. The initial focus upon airport \nsecurity has been expanded to include other vulnerabilities, such as \nseaport and border security. The department has distributed billions of \ndollars to our first responders--the local and State emergency \npersonnel on the front lines--for the equipment, training and guidance \nto carry out their vital missions. And we will continue to work with \nSecretary Ridge to ensure that a steady stream of funding is available \nfor those efforts.\n  Of course, challenges lie ahead for this new agency, for the \nPresident and for this Congress. As we change, so does our enemy. As we \naddress vulnerabilities, he seeks out new ones to exploit. As we move \nto protect our most high-profile targets in our major cities, we must \nalways be aware that our small cities, towns and countryside are at \nrisk as well. As we improve security at our borders, we must strive to \nkeep them open to friendship and to commerce. As we defend our Nation \nagainst future attacks, we must never sacrifice the liberty that makes \nour Nation so worthy of being defended.\n  In an address given February 23 before the Homeland Security \nInstitute, Secretary Ridge offered a first anniversary assessment of \nhis department's accomplishments. He charted an ambitious but necessary \ncourse for its second year, and he described his vision for the years \nahead.\n  Secretary Ridge pledge that the department will pursue the \ndevelopment of new technologies to combat terrorism. Analysis tools and \ndetection equipment are keys to thwarting nuclear, chemical and \nbiological attacks before they occur. We must, as he said, button up \nour lab coats and push the scientific envelope by forging new \npartnerships among government, the private sector, national \nlaboratories and university research centers.\n  The Secretary pledged to strengthen information sharing among the \npublic and private sectors and to create standards for communications \nand equipment. ``Interoperability'' is a cumbersome word, but it is one \nwe all should add to our vocabularies. Only by improving communications \nand ensuring that equipment works across jurisdictions will our front-\nline defenders and our first responders be able to better detect \nattacks and to coordinate their efforts during an emergency.\n  Secretary Ridge pledged to integrate our port and border security \nsystems in a way that does not impede the flow of trade and travel \nacross our borders, a critical goal for border States like Maine. The \ndepartment's first year produced much progress: screeners, air marshals \nand state-of-the-art technology have made air travel safer. Traffic \nthrough our ports and our borders, which nearly ground to a halt after \nthe attacks, is moving with speed, efficiency and greater security: \nmore than 500 million people, 130 million motor vehicles, and millions \nmore railcars and containers are processed at our borders every year. \nAt the same time, container inspection has been expanded from our own \nshores to 16 key overseas ports.\n  Borders will always be a point of vulnerability for any free society. \nIn partnership with the private sector and our international allies, we \ncan reduce that vulnerability without unduly impeding the flow of \nlegitimate commerce.\n  The Committee on Governmental Affairs stands ready to assist the \nDepartment as it begins its second year. We will continue to provide \nthe department with the authority it needs to protect our Nation, and \nwe will continue our aggressive oversight of its programs and \nactivities. At times, we may disagree with the department, but our goal \nis always to improve the department and to recognize the extraordinary \nprogress made by Secretary Ridge and Deputy Security Loy, their \ntalented leadership team, and the dedicated men and women in the \ndepartment who work each and every day to strengthen our security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRYOR RECESS APPOINTMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the Presidents Day break in the \nSenate session, President Bush chose to act unilaterally to appoint \nWilliam Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Over the past \nfew weeks, I have shared with the Senate three other divisive \ndevelopments regarding judicial nominations: The Pickering recess \nappointment, the renomination of Claude Allen, and the theft of \nDemocratic computer files by Republican staff. In spite of all those \naffronts, Senate Democrats cooperated in confirming two additional \njudicial nominees this year and continue to participate in hearings for \njudicial nominees. We have done so without the kinds of delays and \nobstruction that Republicans relied upon to stall more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees.\n  Today, I report upon the President's appointment of William Pryor in \nwhat the Democratic leader has properly termed an abuse of power. It \nwas an abuse of the limited constitutional authority of the executive \nto make necessary recess appointments only when the Senate is \nunavailable. This is unprecedented.\n  Actions like this show the American people that this White House will \nstop at nothing to try to turn the independent Federal judiciary into \nan arm of the Republican Party. Doing this further erodes the White \nHouse's credibility and the respect that the American people have for \nthe courts.\n  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people \nbut that has chosen time and again to act in ways that divides us, to \ndisrespect the Senate and our representative democracy. This is an \nadministration that squandered the goodwill and good faith that \nDemocrats showed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.\n  This is an administration that refused to acknowledge the strides we \nmade in filling 100 judicial vacancies under Democratic Senate \nleadership during 17 difficult months in 2001 and 2002, while \novercoming the September 11 attacks, the subsequent anthrax attacks and \nin spite of Republican mistreatment of scores of qualified, moderate \njudicial nominees of President Clinton.\n  This is an administration that has once again demonstrated its\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nunilateralism, arrogance and intention to divide the American people \nand the Senate with its controversial judicial nominations. With this \nappointment, the President is acting--as he has in so many areas over \nthe past 3 years--unilaterally, overextending and expanding his power, \nwith disregard for past practice and the rule of law.\n  The recess appointment of Mr. Pryor threatens both the independence \nof the judiciary and the constitutional balance of power between the \nlegislative and executive branches. We entrust to the stewardship of \nlifetime judges in our independent Federal judiciary the rights that \nall of us are guaranteed by our Constitution and laws. That is an \nawesome responsibility. Accordingly, the Constitution was designed so \nthat it would only be extended after the President and the Senate \nagreed on the suitability of the nomination.\n  The President has chosen for the second time in as many months to \ncircumvent this constitutional design.\n  I have sought in good faith to work with this administration for the \nlast 3 years in filling judicial vacancies, including so many left open \nby Republican obstruction of President Clinton's qualified nominees. \nWhen chairman, I made sure that President Bush's nominees were not \ntreated the way his predecessor's had been. They were treated much \nbetter, as I had promised.\n  Republicans had averaged only 37 confirmations a year while vacancies \nrose from 65 to 110 and circuit vacancies more than doubled from 16 to \n33. Under Democratic leadership, we reversed those trends and opened \nthe system to public accountability and debate by making home-State \nSenators' objections to proceeding public for the first time and \ndebating and voting on nominations. We were able to confirm 100 judges \nin just 17 months and virtually doubled the Republican annual average \nwith 72 confirmations in 2002, alone.\n  I have urged that we work together, that we cooperate, and that the \nPresident be what he promised the American people he would be during \nthe last campaign--a uniter and not a divider. I have offered to \nconsult and made sure we explained privately and in the public record \nwhy this President's most extreme and controversial nominations were \nunacceptable. Our efforts at reconciliation continue to be rebuffed.\n  Both these recess appointments are troubling. The President says that \nhe wants judges who will ``follow the law'' and complains about what he \ncalls ``judicial activism.'' Yet, he has acted--with disregard for the \nconstitutional balance of powers and the Senate's advice and consent \nauthority--unilaterally to install on the Federal bench two nominees \nfrom whom the Senate withheld its consent precisely because they are \nseen by so many as likely to be judicial activists, who will insert \ntheir personal views in decisions and will not follow the law.\n  In the case of Mr. Pryor, he is among the most extreme and \nideologically committed and opinionated nominees ever sent to the \nSenate. Mr. Pryor's nomination to a lifetime appointment on the Federal \nbench was opposed by every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nafter hearings and debate.\n  It was opposed on the Senate floor because he appears to have \nextreme--some might say, ``radical''--ideas about what the Constitution \nshould provide with regard to federalism, criminal justice and the \ndeath penalty, violence against women, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and the Government's ability to protect the environment on behalf \nof the American people. He has been a crusader for the federalist \nrevolution. He has urged that Federal laws on behalf of the disabled, \nthe aged, women, minorities, and the environment all be limited.\n  His comments have revealed insensitivity to the barriers that \ndisadvantaged persons and members of minority groups and women continue \nto face in the criminal justice system. He has testified before \nCongress in support of dropping a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act \nand has repeatedly described the Supreme Court and certain justices in \novertly political terms. He received the lowest possible qualified \nrating from the American Bar Association--a partial rating of ``Not \nQualified''--underscoring his unfitness for the bench.\n  In sum, Mr. Pryor has demonstrated that he is committed to an \nideological agenda that puts corporate interests over the public's \ninterests and that he would roll back the hard-won rights of consumers, \nminorities, women, and others.\n  Mr. Pryor's nomination was considered in committee and on the Senate \nfloor. The Senate debated his nomination, and had enough concerns about \nhis fitness for a lifetime appointment that two motions to end debate \non his nomination failed. That is the constitutional right of the \nSenate.\n  But President Bush has decided to use the recess appointment clause \nof the Constitution to end-run the Senate. As far as I know, this power \nhas never been used this way before this President. Of course, this is \nthe first President in our Nation's history to renominate someone \nrejected after hearings, debate and a fair vote by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He did that twice. He has now twice overridden the Senate's \nwithholding of its consent after hearings and debate on judicial \nnominees. This demonstrates contempt for the Constitution and the \nSenate.\n  The New York Times opined over the weekend about ``President Bush . . \n. stacking the courts with right-wing judges of dubious judicial \nqualifications'' and even the Washington Post editorialized that recess \nappointments of judges ``should never be used to mint judges who cannot \nbe confirmed on their merits.''\n  The recess appointments clause of the Constitution was not intended \nto change the balance of power between the Senate and the President \nthat is established as part of the fundamental set of checks and \nbalances in our government. Indeed, the appointments clause in the \nConstitution requires the consent of the Senate as just such a \nfundamental check on the executive. This was meant to protect against \nthe ``aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.''\n  The clause was debated at the Constitutional Convention, and the \nfinal language--with shared power--is intended to be a check upon \nfavoritism of the President and prevent the appointment of unfit \ncharacters.\n  The President's claimed power to make a unilateral appointment of a \nnominee, Mr. Pryor, who the Senate considered and effectively rejected, \nslights the Framers' deliberate and considered decision to share the \nappointing power equally between the President and the Senate.\n  This President's appointment of Mr. Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit--\nafter he was considered by the full Senate--seems irreconcilable with \nthe original purpose of the appointments and recess appointment clauses \nin the Constitution. Perhaps that explains why the Pryor and Pickering \nrecess appointments by this President are the first times in our \ncenturies-long history that the recess appointment power has been so \nabused. No other President so acted. No other President sought such \nunilateral authority without balance from the Senate.\n  The President chose to sully the Martin Luther King Jr. weekend with \nhis unilateral appointment of Judge Pickering. Sadly, he chose the \nPresidents Day congressional break unilaterally to appoint Mr. Pryor. \nWe resumed our proceedings in the Senate this week with the traditional \nreading of President George Washington's farewell address. The Senate \nproceeds in this way every year. I urge this President and those in his \nadministration to recall the wisdom of our first President. George \nWashington instructs us on the importance of not abusing the power each \nbranch is given by the Constitution. He urges the three branches of our \ngovernment to ``confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres.''\n  He said more than 200 years ago words that ring true to this day:\n\n       The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers \n     of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever \n     the form of government, a real despotism. . . . The necessity \n     of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by \n     dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and \n     constituting each the guardian of the public weal against \n     invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \n     ancient and modern. . . . To preserve them must be as \n     necessary as to institute them.\n\n  The current occupant of the White House might do well to take this \nwisdom to heart and respect the constitutional allocations of shared \nauthority that have protected our nation and our\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nrights for more than 200 years so brilliantly and effectively.\n  The recess appointments power was intended as a means to fill \nvacancies when the Senate was not available to give its consent; it was \nintended to ensure effective functioning of the government when the \nSenate adjourned for months at a time. It was never intended as an \nalternative means of appointment by the executive when the President \nchose to serve some partisan short-term goal by simply overriding the \nwill of the Senate especially with respect to our third branch of \ngovernment, the Federal judiciary.\n  This administration and its partisan enablers in the Senate have \nagain demonstrated their disdain for the constitutional system of \nchecks and balances and for shared power among the three branches of \nour Federal Government. By such actions, this administration shows that \nit seeks all power consolidated in the executive and that it wants a \nJudiciary that will serve its narrow ideological purposes.\n  Such overreaching by this administration hurts the courts and the \ncountry. President Bush and his partisans have disrespected the Senate, \nits constitutional role of advice and consent on lifetime appointments \nto the Federal courts, the Federal courts, and the representative \ndemocracy that is so important to the American people. It is indicative \nof the confrontational and ``by any means necessary'' attitude that \nunderlies so many actions by this administration and that created the \natmosphere on this Committee in which Republican staff felt justified \nin spying upon their counterparts and stealing computer files.\n  After 8 years in office in which more than 60 judicial nominees had \nbeen stalled from consideration by Republican partisans, President \nClinton made his one and only recess appointment of a judge. Contrast \nthat appointment with the actions of the current President.\n  President Clinton acted to bring diversity to the Fourth Circuit, the \nlast Federal circuit court not to have had an African-American member. \nJudge Roger Gregory was subsequently approved by the Senate for a \nlifetime appointment under Democratic Senate leadership in the summer \nof 2001. This was made possible by the steadfast support of Senator \nJohn Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I have commended my \nfriend for his actions in this regard. When Judge Gregory's nomination \nwas finally considered by the Senate it passed by consensus and with \nonly one negative vote. Senator Lott explained his vote as a protest \nvote against President Clinton's use of the recess appointment power. \nHow ironic then that Judge Pickering now serves based on President \nBush's abuse of that power.\n  Judge Gregory was one of scores of highly qualified judicial \nnominations stalled under Republican Senate leadership. Indeed, Judge \nGregory and so many others were prevented from having a hearing, from \never being considered by the Judiciary Committee and from ever being \nconsidered by the Senate. Sadly, others, such as the nominations of \nBonnie Campbell, Christine Arguello, Allen Snyder, Kent Markus, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, Jorge Rangel, Carlos Moreno, and so many more, \nhave not been reinstated and considered. But President Clinton did not \nabuse his recess appointment power. Instead, his appointment of Judge \nGregory was in keeping with traditional practices and his use of that \npower with respect to judicial appointments was limited to that one \noccasion.\n  By contrast, the current President has made two circuit recess \nappointments in 2 months and his White House threatens that more are on \nthe way. These appointments are from among the most controversial and \ncontentious nominations this administration has sent the Senate. After \nreviewing their records and debating at length, the Senate withheld its \nconsent. The reasons for opposing these nominations were discussed in \nhearings and open debate during which the case was made that these \nnominees were among the handful that a significant number of Senators \ndetermined had not demonstrated their fairness and impartiality to \nserve as judges.\n  Contrast Roger Gregory's recess appointment, which fit squarely in \nthe tradition of President's exercising such authority in order to \nexpand civil rights and to bring diversity to the courts, with that of \nMr. Pryor. Four of the five first African American appellate judges \nwere recess-appointed to their first Article III position, including \nJudge William Hastie in 1949, Judge Thurgood Marshall in 1961, Judge \nSpottswood Robinson in 1961, and Judge Leon Higginbotham in 1964.\n  The recent appointments of Judge Pickering and Mr. Pryor stand in \nsharp contrast to these outstanding nominees and the public purposes \nserved by their appointments.\n  The nominations of Judge Pickering and Mr. Pryor were opposed by \nindividuals, organizations and editorial pages across the nation. \nOrganizations and individuals concerned about justice before the \nFederal courts, such as Log Cabin Republicans, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, and many others opposed the Pryor \nnomination. The opposition extended to include organizations that \nrarely take positions on nominations but felt so strongly about Mr. \nPryor that they were compelled to write, such as the National Senior \nCitizens Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and Sierra Club. Rather \nthan bring people together and move the country forward, this \nPresident's recess appointment is another example of unnecessarily \ndivisive action.\n  Further, the legality of this use of the recess appointments power, \nwithout precedent and during such a short Senate break, is itself now a \nsource of division and dispute. Recent Attorneys General have all \nopined that a recess of 10 days or less does not justify the \nPresident's use of the recess appointments power and would be \nconsidered unconstitutional. Starting in 1921, Attorney General \nDaugherty advised the President that he could make recess appointments \nduring a mid-session adjournment of approximately four weeks but that 2 \ndays was not sufficient ``nor do I think an adjournment for 5 or even \n10 days can be said to constitute the recess intended by the \nConstitution.'' More recently, a memo from the Reagan administration \nJustice Department concluded: ``Under no circumstances should the \nPresident attempt to make recess appointment during intrasession recess \nof less than 10 days.'' This year, a Federalist Society paper noted the \ndubious constitutionality of appointments during short intrasession \nbreaks.\n  We will not resolve the question of legality of these recess \nappointments here today, but we can all anticipate challenges to \nrulings in which Mr. Pryor participates. Thus, we can expect this \naudacious action by the administration will serve to spawn litigation \nand uncertainty for months and years to come.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for the statements he made this week in \nconnection with the abuse of the recess appointment power by this \nPresident. I remind the Senate that a few years ago when President \nClinton used his recess appointment power with regard to a short-term \nexecutive appointment of James Hormel to serve as ambassador to \nLuxembourg, Senator Inhofe responded by saying that President Clinton \nhad ``shown contempt for Congress and the Constitution'' and declared \nthat he would place ``holds on every single Presidential nomination.'' \nRepublicans continued to block nominations until President Clinton \nagreed to make recess appointments only after Congress was notified in \nadvance. On November 10, 1999, 17 Republican Senators sent a letter to \nPresident Clinton telling him that if he violated the agreement, they \nwould ``put holds for the remaining of the term of your Presidency on \nall of the judicial nominees.''\n  In November 1999, President Clinton sent a list of 13 positions to \nthe Senate that he planned to fill through recess appointments. In \nresponse, Senator Inhofe denounced 5 of the 13 civilian nominees with a \nthreat that if they went forward, he would personally place a hold on \nevery one of President Clinton's judicial nominees for the remainder of \nhis term. That led to more delays and to the need for a floor vote on a \nmotion to proceed to consider the next judicial nomination, in order to \noverride Republican objections.\n  When President Clinton appointed Judge Gregory at the end of 2000, \nSenator Inhofe called it ``outrageously inappropriate for any President \nto fill a federal judgeship through a recess appointment in a \ndeliberate way to bypass the Senate.'' When the Gregory\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nnomination was confirmed with near unanimity under Senate Democratic \nleadership in 2001, Senator Lott's spokesperson indicated that Senator \nLott's solitary opposition was to underscore his position that ``any \nappointment of federal judges during a recess should be opposed.''\n\n\n                 PROGRESS OF FILLING JUDICIAL VACANCIES\n\n  The American people understand that Democrats in the Senate have \nshown great restraint and extensive cooperation in the confirmation of \n171 of this President's judicial nominations. Republicans are loath to \nacknowledge that cooperation but with it this President has been \nachieving record numbers of judicial confirmations and we have reduced \njudicial vacancies to the lowest level in decades. Despite the \nunprecedented political upheavals and the aftermath of September 11, as \nof today, the Senate has already confirmed more judges than were \nconfirmed during President Reagan's entire first 4-year term. Indeed, \nat this point in President Clinton's last term, only 140 judges had \nbeen confirmed, as compared to the 171 confirmed and two recess \nappointed by this President.\n  The President's recent actions are unnecessarily divisive and \nharmful. We have already achieved much. If the President would work \nwith the Senate, we could achieve so much more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1890-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of Ms. Mary Frances Diaz upon her passing in \nFebruary. Mary was a woman who made a remarkable contribution toward \nimproving the lives of refugee women, children, and adolescents around \nthe world. She was a truly selfless woman who dedicated her life to \nothers.\n  Mary was born in Newport News, VA. She spent her childhood in \nPottstown, PA, before going to Brown University, where she graduated \nwith a major in international relations in 1982. After working for \nseveral years at WPVI television news station in Philadelphia, she \nreturned to school and received a master's degree in international \neducation from Harvard University in 1988.\n  But Mary's passion and life mission was refugees. While she was still \nat Harvard she began working for Catholic Charities in Boston, and upon \ngraduation became director of refugee and immigration services there.\n  In 1994, at the age of 33, Mary became executive director of the \nWomen's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, an organization that \nhelps some of the most vulnerable people on Earth. For 10 years, Mary \ntraveled to the world's trouble spots, dodging minefields, tsetse \nflies, and wars on her mission to help refugee women and children \nreclaim their lives. She went on fact-finding missions to places such \nas Serbia, Angola, Rwanda, Nepal, Pakistan, Haiti, and Colombia to talk \nto uprooted women and children firsthand.\n  Back in the United States and in Geneva, she would plead their cases \nbefore the United Nations and lobby lawmakers and relief agencies to \nimprove their conditions. She also fought for the rights of people \nclaiming asylum in the United States.\n  Her advocacy led to concrete results. After she reported on the \nsituation in Bosnia, the Clinton administration provided a fund to help \nrefugee women rebuild their lives. During a visit to Tanzania, she got \nthe rules changed to allow Burundian women as well as men to distribute \nfood to fellow refugees. As a result, many more women and their \nchildren got their food rations. After a visit to Afghanistan in 2002, \nMary initiated a fund for programs for Afghan women.\n  Under Mary's leadership, the Women's Commission grew from a small \norganization with a staff of 4 and a budget of $425,000 to one with \nmore than 20 staff and a budget of $4 million. She believed the \ninternational community had a responsibility to help women and children \nwho had been uprooted by war and persecution, and in her quiet, elegant \nway, used her eloquence and strong persuasive powers to persuade policy \nmakers to change policies and programs.\n  Mary, who was 43 years old, died of pancreatic cancer. She leaves \nbehind her longtime partner, Tom Ferguson of New York City; her mother, \nBertha Diaz of Pottstown, PA; two brothers, Dr. Philip Diaz of \nColumbus, OH, and Dr. Joseph Diaz of Barrington, RI; and two sisters, \nTheresa Diaz of Reading, PA, and Bernadette Diaz of Oak Park, IL. She \nalso leaves behind innumerable friends and colleagues.\n  Mary's legacy will live on in the lives of the refugees around the \nworld whose lives she helped improve and in the work of the Women's \nCommission for Refugee Women and Children. I rise today to commemorate \nMary Diaz, to celebrate her too-short life and to offer her family, \nfriends, and colleagues our support. She will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1890-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF RITA DOLAN SELLAR\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Tuesday, February 24, 2004, an \nextraordinary resident of Newport, RI celebrated a monumental \nachievement, her 100th birthday.\n  Rita Dolan Sellar has led a full and exceptional life. She was born \nFebruary 24, 1904, to Clarence Dolan and Rosalie Brown Dolan. She had \ntwo sisters, Rose and Alexandra.\n  As a young lady, Rita attended Foxcroft School in Virginia, where she \nis now the oldest living alumna. Later she married Norrie Sellar, and \nthey traveled extensively throughout the world.\n  Rita and Norrie had five children: Daphne, Norrie, Rosalie, Owen, and \nAlexandra.\n  Rita was an accomplished and bold horsewoman, who in the 1930s \nfounded and played on the first women's polo team, in Aiken, SC, and \nrode in fox hunts, steeplechase races, and jumping contests.\n  She was also an active sailor, who kept sailboats in Newport Harbor, \nand often sailed with her sister--one of America's first and most \ncapable women sailors.\n  Her home in Newport, ``Seaweed,'' has hosted five generations of the \nfamily, innumerable cheerful parties and dinners, and an extensive \narray of friends, cousins, in-laws, and visitors. She is the oldest \nmember of Newport's Spouting Rock Beach Association.\n  In addition to her 5 children, she has 15 grandchildren and 13 great-\ngrandchildren, as well as 3 step-grandchildren and 6 step-great-\ngrandchildren, of which she is the beloved, affectionate, and patient \nmatriarch.\n  Rita Dolan Sellar has led a successful and remarkable life as evident \nby her many achievements and, more importantly, her large, loving and \nsuccessful family which includes former Rhode Island Attorney General \nSheldon Whitehouse.\n  I would like to congratulate Rita on her 100th birthday. This \nextraordinary moment is not about the number of years she has lived but \nthe accomplishments she has made during those years and the excitement, \npride, love, and joy she has brought to her many family and friends \nthrough her life. I wish Rita a happy birthday and many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1890-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1890-S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources was discharged from\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nfurther consideration of the following measure which was referred to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n       H.R. 2584.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the New Jersey \nCoastal Heritage Trail Route, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Corzine. This bill makes a number of important \nchanges to legislation that was enacted in 1988 and reauthorized in \n1994 and 1999.\n  The original legislation, which I co-sponsored, called for a route \nthat links nationally significant natural and cultural sites associated \nwith the coastal area of New Jersey. The New Jersey Coastal Heritage \nTrail runs south for nearly 300 miles from Perth Amboy along the \nAtlantic Ocean to Cape May, then west along the Delaware Bay to the \nDelaware Memorial Bridge. Along the way are sites like the Barnegat Bay \nDecoy and Baymen's Museum, the Cape May Migratory Bird Refuge, and the \nSandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area.\n  Five theme trails, of which three are open, are planned to showcase \ndifferent aspects of New Jersey coastal life: maritime history, coastal \nhabitats, wildlife migration, historic settlements, and relaxation/\ninspiration. The Trail is operated by a partnership that includes the \nNational Park Service, the State of New Jersey, local communities, and \nprivate non-profit organizations. Fifty percent of the funding for the \nTrail is provided from non-federal funds.\n  My legislation raises the funding authorization for the New Jersey \nCoastal Heritage Trail to $8 million, doubling the current \nauthorization of $4 million. The legislation also: extends the deadline \nfor project completion by 5 years to May 4, 2009; allows funds to be \nused for grants in addition to technical assistance; and requires the \nNational Park Service to prepare a strategic plan for the long-term \nmaintenance of this coastal route. A companion bill, H.R. 3070, has \nbeen introduced in the House by Congressman LoBiondo, with \ncosponsorship by the entire New Jersey delegation.\n  New Jersey has a long shoreline of which we are extremely proud. This \nbill will provide the necessary resources and strategic planning to \nensure that the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail fulfills its promise \nto the people of my home State and to visitors from around the world. \nThe additional funding authorized in this bill will support: 1. \nCreation of a long-term strategic plan on the roles of the National \nPark Service and other Trail partners; 2. Development of two remaining \ntheme trails (historic settlements and relaxation/inspiration); 3. \nDevelopment of interpretive media such as videos, brochures and \nexhibits; 4. Technical assistance for the State park system, wildlife \nmanagement, and historic and cultural sites; 5. Construction of a New \nJersey State Park Service facility on the trail at Double Trouble State \nPark in the Barnegat Bay Region; 6. Continuing work on a welcome center \nat Sandy Hook; and 7. Construction of a welcome center in the Absecon \nregion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is needed to \nassure that funding for this valuable undertaking will continue to be \nauthorized after May 2004.\n   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 2142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend trade adjustment assistance to service \nworkers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Service \nWorkers Fairness Act to provide aid for American workers facing a \ndisturbing new trend: the offshore outsourcing of service jobs.\n  Congress first established Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) in 1962, \nin recognition that international trade can harm our workers. The \nprogram was overhauled in 1974, and since then, it has offered extended \nunemployment compensation benefits and job training for workers who \nlose their manufacturing jobs due to import competition.\n  Over the past decade, Congress has shown its willingness to adapt to \nincreasing globalization by modernizing TAA. For example, in 1993, with \nthe adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we added a \nprovision to offer those same unemployment and job training benefits to \nworkers whose manufacturing jobs were relocated to Canada or Mexico. \nMost recently, when the program was reauthorized in 2002, we expanded \neligibility once again. The program now includes workers whose \nmanufacturing jobs have been relocated to certain countries other than \nCanada or Mexico. It also now provides assistance to certain secondary \nworkers who have lost their manufacturing jobs as suppliers or \ndownstream producers to firms that have been affected by trade or plant \nrelocation.\n  Despite these changes, one factor has remained constant: Trade \nAdjustment Assistance is only available to workers in the manufacturing \nsector. If a service sector employee's job has been outsourced to a \nforeign country, he or she is not eligible for TAA because the \nperformance of services is not considered production of an ``article,'' \nas required by the law.\n  I can understand why the law was written that way--until recently, we \nbelieved that our service jobs were not put at risk by international \ntrade. But now, unfortunately, we know this is no longer the case. \nHundreds of thousands of service sector jobs already have been \noutsourced to other countries, including China and India. A report by \nForrester Research predicts that 3.3 million service jobs will be \noutsourced by the year 2015--and some economists believe that forecast \nis conservative. Last fall, the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban \nEconomics at the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that \nmore than 14 million service jobs are ``at risk to outsourcing''--that \nis 11 percent of all jobs.\n  That is the outer limit of service jobs at risk, but it demonstrates \nthat this issue will reach far beyond the software programmers and call \ncenters that are receiving attention today. The Fisher Center report \nnotes that the jobs being created in India and elsewhere also include \nthe following service sectors: geographic information systems services \nfor insurance companies; stock market research for financial firms; \nmedical transcription services; legal online database research; data \nanalysis for consulting firms; and payroll and other back-office \nrelated activities.\n  In fact, the offshore outsourcing of service jobs likely will grow at \na much\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nfaster rate than the manufacturing outsourcing we have witnessed over \nthe past two decades because there is an enormous cost differential in \nthe wages of well-educated workers here and abroad. For example, the \nhourly wage for telephone operators in the United States is $12.57, \nwhile it is less than $1.00 in India. The hourly wage for legal \nassistants and paralegals in the United States is $17.86, compared to \n$6.00 to $8.00 in India. Accountants in the United States earn $23.35 \nper hour, while those in India earn $6.00 to $15.00 per hour. Finally, \nfinancial researchers and analysts in the United States earn $33.00 to \n$35.00 per hour, while those in India earn only $6.00 to $15.00 per \nhour.\n  The offshore outsourcing of service jobs already is having an impact \non our economy. For example, it may be one reason that the recent \nincrease in the unemployment rate is larger for highly-educated \nworkers. From 2000 to 2003, total unemployment for workers with at \nleast a bachelor's degree increased by 95 percent, compared to a 40 \npercent increase for workers with a high school diploma or less. \nStatistics for long-term unemployment--representing workers who have \nbeen unemployed for more than six months--are similar. From 2000 to \n2003, long term unemployment for workers with at least a bachelor's \ndegree increased by 299 percent, compared to an increase of 156 percent \nfor workers with a high school diploma or less.\n  The offshore outsourcing of service jobs also may help explain why \nthe few jobs that have been created since the recession officially \nended in November 2001 have been primarily in low-paying sectors.\n  The question before us today is: How should Congress respond to this \nnew facet of globalization and how can we aid these hundreds of \nthousands--and eventually millions--of service workers whose jobs have \nbeen outsourced?\n  Although there are broader trade issues that we should examine over \ntime, there is one thing we can and should do now, and that is extend \nTrade Adjustment Assistance to these service employees. The service-\nproviding sector provides more than 86 million jobs and accounts for \nmore than half of our total GDP. We must extend the same helping hand \nto these men and women when their jobs are outsourced as we do to \nworkers in the manufacturing sector.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance not only provides additional unemployment \ncompensation benefits. Just as importantly, it provides training to \nhelp workers find jobs at a similar or higher skill level, including \nclassroom training, on-the-job training, and customized employer-based \ntraining. TAA also provides reemployment services, including employment \ncounseling, case assessment, job development, and supportive services.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Service Workers Fairness Act, \nwould provide TAA eligibility to laid-off service workers whose firm \nshifts the work for the same or directly competitive services to a \nforeign country. It also would cover contract service workers whose \ncontracts have been shifted overseas. Finally, my bill would extend the \ncurrent provisions for adversely affected secondary workers to those \nwho provide services.\n  Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted that \n``rigorous education and ongoing training'' are critical in ensuring \nthat as many Americans as possible can benefit from increased \nglobalization.\n  My bill would provide this education and training to service workers \nwhose jobs are outsourced abroad. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. Boxer):\n   S. 2145.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., to the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, every year, Americans commemorate the \nbirthday of America's greatest civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Last year I was pleased to introduce legislation to authorize \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins to recognize Dr. King's \ncontribution to the people of the United States. Revenues from the \nsurcharge on the coin would go to the Library of Congress to purchase \nand maintain historical documents and other materials associated with \nthe life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  I had hoped that this bill could have been enacted last year on the \n40th anniversary of Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, but we were \nunable to do so. Today, I would like to reintroduce the Dr. Martin \nLuther King Jr. Commemorative Coin Act of 2004, to have the coin minted \nin 2009 in commemoration of the 80th anniversary of Dr. King's birth. \nDr. King's significant contributions and his message should live on for \nfuture generations. America should remember him as a national hero and \na pioneer.\n  In recognizing Dr. Martin Luther King's legacy, it is important that \nwe continue to learn from his actions and words. When I was a young \ngirl in Louisiana, I learned from Dr. King that the struggle for civil \nrights and racial equality was more than simply changing the law, it \nrequired changing our hearts as well. Dr. King recognized that the \ncivil rights movement presented Americans with a choice. We could \nchoose hate and fear, or we could choose love and understanding. Dr. \nKing believed that when Americans choose love in their hearts, peace \nand equality would follow. Dr. King offered us a peaceful way to reach \nequality through non-violent protest and action. I believe that this \nshould continue to be a fundamental moral challenge for our country. In \nhis famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King said, ``I have a dream \nthat one day, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave \nowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.''\n  I would also like to take the time to thank my good friends on both \nsides of the aisle for supporting this important legislation. I urge \nothers to join us in remembering the selfless deeds of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., by cosponsoring this bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1896-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 306--DESIGNATING MARCH 2, 2004, AS ``READ ACROSS \n                             AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Reed) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, we will be wrapping up very shortly for the \nweek. Because it has been a very busy week, I would like to run through \nthe progress that has been made. We have proceeded in step-wise fashion \nand advanced the business of this body in a very thoughtful way. We \nstarted the week hoping to consider the OB/GYN medical liability bill, \naptly entitled ``Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access Care Act.'' \nWe debated the issue on Monday and Tuesday but, unfortunately, were \nprevented from formally going to the bill. A cloture motion was filed \non the motion to proceed.\n  I also want to thank our colleagues, Senator Ensign and Senator \nGregg, for their real leadership on this particular issue. As we closed \nthat debate, it was clear--as both sides stated--that we were going to \nhave to come back and address the liability issues, and we will bring \nit back before the Senate again.\n  S. 1805, the gun manufacturers' liability bill, which is more \nformally called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, was then \naddressed, continues to be addressed through today. I commend our \nleader, Senator Craig, for his leadership.\n  We do plan on proceeding and having a final vote on this bill \nTuesday. There was an objection to proceeding from the Democratic side \nof the aisle initially on that bill and thus we had to file, once \nagain, a cloture motion. We prevailed on that cloture motion to proceed \nby a vote of 75 to 22, and thus we were able to get on the bill and \ndebate the bill.\n  We were able to lock in the agreement limiting amendments to the gun \nliability bill, and during Thursday and Friday's session we have \nconsidered 16 amendments. We disposed of eight of those amendments, \nconducted six rollcall votes on Thursday. Under the agreement, we will \npass the legislation on Tuesday. The House passed their version of this \nbill April 19th of last year. I hope we will be able to proceed on a \nconference on this bipartisan legislation so we can reconcile the \ndifferences. Again, I understand there is an objection to proceeding to \na conference from the other side of the aisle,\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nbut we will continue to discuss with the Democratic leadership how we \ncan best proceed to conference.\n  Finally, just a few moments ago, we passed H.R. 3850, a 2-month \nextension of the highway bill. As we witnessed over the course of the \nday, it has required a lot in terms of discussions among colleagues in \nthis body with Members of the House of Representatives, but I am \npleased to announce we have reached a satisfactory conclusion for all \nparties involved. I thank all the Senators who were just appropriately \nthanked for their participation.\n  Again, the 5,000 Transportation employees who were at risk of not \nbeing able to go to work and being paid for work on Monday can rest now \nand, indeed, will receive both those checks and show up for work on \nMonday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1898-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 1, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n1805, the gun liability bill. There are a number of Senators who will \nbe here to debate the remaining amendments and there will be adequate \ntime for debate on Monday.\n  I sincerely thank the bill managers for their hard work on this \nlegislation. They have been on the floor constantly for the past 3 \ndays, working through amendments and moving this bill forward. Through \ntheir efforts and a lot of hard work, we are poised to finish the bill \nTuesday of next week. Again, they should be complimented.\n  I inform all my colleagues we will have a vote on an amendment to the \nbill Monday afternoon. Senators should expect that vote in relation to \nthe Bingaman definition amendment to occur promptly at 5 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder, with the easy week the majority leader has had \nthis week, could you tell us what we will do after we finish the gun \nliability legislation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Through the Chair, Mr. President, we have the agreement to \ncomplete the gun liability legislation Tuesday. It is our plan, \nalthough I want to discuss it further with the Democratic leadership \nand also my colleagues, but the plans are at this juncture to continue \nwith the manufacturing bill called FSC/ETI. There is a deadline we are \nall familiar with of March 1. This bill has been taken through \ncommittee and we will be addressing it on the floor. The House has not \nyet addressed it.\n  It is my intention, at this point in time--again, it could be subject \nto change--to proceed with FSC/ETI.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/27/senate-section/article/S1898-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 1, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
