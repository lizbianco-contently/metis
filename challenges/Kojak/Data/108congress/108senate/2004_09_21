Mr. President, I want to comment very briefly on something \nI mentioned in the last week, and that is the grand opening of the \nNational Museum of the American Indian. The grand opening officially is \noccurring today, actually in a couple of hours. This marks a milestone \nin American and American Indian history.\n  Established by an act of Congress in 1989, the museum, which we can \nall see from the front of the Capitol, is a tribute to the \nextraordinary achievements and the contributions made by American \nIndian culture. I had the opportunity 2 nights ago to tour that museum. \nIt is truly remarkable, unique, and unlike any other museum in the \nSmithsonian group in that the stories are told by participants of the \nculture.\n  There are great collections, as so many of the institutions have. It \nis a cultural experience that comes alive as one goes through this \nmuseum, starting on the fourth floor, and continuing to the third, \nsecond, and first floor. It is truly remarkable.\n  It is right here on the National Mall, as everyone in this body \nknows. It is a prominent symbol of the progress we have made in \nrecognizing and, in many ways, reconciling our shared history.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  The celebration began informally yesterday but will continue over the \ncourse of the week. There are going to be about 600,000 people \nparticipating in the celebration from around the world.\n  As one looks out from the front of the Capitol steps, they see the \nplatforms for singers, dancers, and storytellers, representing nearly \n40 American Indian communities, performing over the course of the week.\n  The museum is fascinating, and I wanted to bring that to everybody's \nattention. Again, I know the Democratic leader and myself will be \nparticipating in the opening of those ceremonies today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9396-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTELLIGENCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Another quick update on our progress along reform in terms \nof our intelligence operations, both within the Senate and outside the \nSenate with regard to the executive branch. The markup in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has begun, with the leadership of \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman. Senator Daschle and I had \ndirected that committee in late July to appropriately respond with \nlegislation to the 9/11 Commission recommendations. The committee's \nlegislation, as has been presented and is being marked up, does just \nthat. I assume that process will go on over the course of the next \nseveral days. There will be amendments and modifications on issues such \nas the national intelligence director and how much authority will be \ngiven the national counterterrorism center. The bill tracks very \nclosely with the plans and decisions that have been put forward by the \n9/11 Commission, although we have learned a lot since even that \nCommission report has been written, and also with plans put forth by \nthe White House. All of that is being considered by that committee.\n  Next week we will be bringing this to the Senate floor for a full \ndebate. It has been a very thoughtful process. The 9/11 Commission \nreport came out in late July. We in this body have gone nonstop through \nlate July, August, and now September, building on the foundation of \nreally 2 or 3 years of work where we have looked at reform and \nappropriate organizational reorganization.\n  As the Democratic leader and I mentioned, October 8 is when we will \nbe leaving, and it would be our objective, with the will of the Senate, \nto be able to complete the legislation before that time.\n  The other arm that Senator Daschle and I addressed by establishing a \nvehicle through which it could be addressed is the whole issue of what \nwe do inside this body in terms of organizational reorganization to \noversee the intelligence operations by the executive branch and the 15 \nintelligence agencies. That task force has met several times, both at \nthe staff level and at the Member level. I know they have more meetings \nplanned for this week.\n  The goal would be for them to come up with specific recommendations \nfor leadership to improve our oversight functions.\n  So a lot is going on. As we set out, the real focus of this month or \nthis period of time since the recess and until October 8 is the safety \nand security of the American people. We are working in a bipartisan way \nto do just that.\n  One last thing, the Senate Intelligence Committee will favorably \nreport out Porter Goss shortly and the entire Senate will be able to \nconfirm him this week. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is \nimportant to do so. It only makes sense that we have the post of \nDirector of Central Intelligence be filled at this important time. \nPorter Goss is a highly capable man and leader, with a strong \nbackground and a lot of experience in intelligence matters. He will be \nable to lead the intelligence community through this period of reform.\n  There is a lot going on today in Washington and on the Senate floor, \nwith the appropriations process, with intelligence organization and \nreorganization. We have now a little over 2 weeks to complete a very \nfull agenda but one that the American people deserve and on which we \nwill deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9396-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will comment on the progress that the \nmajority leader referenced with regard to both the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee work as well as the task force. This is one of those, \nunfortunately, all too rare occurrences where there is real bipartisan \npartnership and participation. Both Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman deserve great credit for bringing the committee to a point \nwhere they can begin the markup this morning. It is our expectation \nthat we will address that important legislation next week. In fact, we \nhave made a decision that on Thursday we will have a special caucus \njust to talk about the legislation. I hope we can work through that \nbill and complete it, as the majority leader has proposed.\n  Also, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have done an outstanding job \nin narrowing the focus, as we look at ways with which to improve \noversight. That, too, is on track. It would be my hope that we would \ncomplete our work on congressional reorganization as well before the \nend of this session.

Mr. President, this is a happy and historic day for all \nAmericans, and especially for the First Americans. Right now, about a \ndozen blocks from this Capitol, an estimated 15- to 20,000 Native \nAmericans representing tribes from South Dakota to South America are \nbeginning a grand procession down Pennsylvania Avenue. The procession \nis the largest gathering ever of American Indians in our Nation's \nCapital. As someone from South Dakota, proud homeland of the Great \nSioux Nation, I can tell you, it is an incredibly beautiful sight.\n  The procession marks the beginning of a week-long festival in \nWashington celebrating the opening of the spectacular new National \nMuseum of the American Indian. The new museum--part of the Smithsonian \nInstitution--is America's only national museum dedicated to Native \nAmericans. And it is the largest museum in the world dedicated to \ntelling the story of indigenous people in their own authentic voices. \nEvery detail reflects the views of Native people, from the text of the \nexhibits to the menu in the museum restaurant. The building itself was \ndesigned by the famed Native architect, Douglas Cardinal. Its curved \nexterior walls, made of rough-hewn limestone, suggest the ancient cliff \ndwellings of the American Southwest.\n  Inside those walls are 8,000 extraordinary artifacts representing \nmore than 10,000 years of history from more than 1,000 indigenous \ncommunities fromas far north as Alaska and as far south as Chile. The \nmuseum includes three permanent exhibits. ``Our Universes'' features \nthe spiritual beliefs of native communities, including the Oglala Sioux \nTribe. ``Our Peoples'' looks at historical events through native eyes. \n``Our Lives'' focuses on native people today. There is also space for \nchanging exhibits of artwork by contemporary Native artists, and large \nspaces for Native American ceremonies and performances. In this museum, \nNative people and communities are not anthropological oddities or \nhistorical footnotes. They are not stereotypes. They are vibrant, \nliving cultures.\n  I want to commend the museum's director, Dr. Richard West, a member \nof the Southern Cheyenne nation, and all of museum's dedicated staff \nand volunteers, who have worked so hard to make the dream a reality, \nincluding assistant curator Emil Her Many\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nHorses, a native of Pine Ridge, who was raised on Rosebud.\n  I also want to thank our colleague, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, \na long-time champion of the museum. I especially want to thank my dear \nfriend, Senator Dan Inouye, co-chairman, with Senator Campbell, of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs, and the original sponsor in 1987 of \nthe bill creating the National Museum of the American Indian. No \nSenator has ever worked longer or harder to get our government to honor \nits trust and treaty obligations to Native American tribes, to Native \nHawaiians and Alaska Natives than Danny Inouye, and I am proud to be \nable to work with him to keep those sacred commitments.\n  As many as 6 million visitors are expected to visit the National \nMuseum of the American Indian every year. They will come away with a \ndeeper understanding of America's rich Native cultures. It will lead, \nit is hoped, to a healing and reconciliation between Native Americans \nand those of us whose families came here from other nations.\n  It is moving to see this living monument to the First Americans take \nits rightful place on our National Mall, along side our Nation's other \ngreat monuments. At the same time, we know that there are priceless \ncultural and historical artifacts all across Indian Country that also \nmust be preserved.\n  I would like to tell you about one such treasure: an extraordinary \ncollection of letters known as ``The Dakota Letters.'' They were \nwritten 140 years ago by members of the Dakota Nation, the original \ninhabitants of what is now Minnesota. Four years ago, copies of 150 of \nthe Dakota Letters found their way to the home of some of the \ndescendants of the original letter writers: the Sisseton Wahpeton \nreservation in eastern South Dakota. What makes these letters rare--and \npossibly unique--is that they provide first-person, written accounts of \na tragic and little-known chapter in our Nation's history--as seen \nthrough Native eyes.\n  That chapter has been called many things. The first accounts, written \nby white historians in the 1880s and 1890s, referred to it as ``the \nGreat Sioux Massacre.'' Later, it was called ``the Sioux Uprising.'' \nToday, it is known as ``the U.S.-Dakota Conflict--some say the U.S. -\nDakota War--of 1862. It was the opening of the Great Plains Indian \nWars, three decades of armed resistance by Plains Indians against white \nsettlers and government soldiers.\n  The roots of the Dakota Conflict stretch back to 1851, when the \nDakota were coerced into signing treaties giving 90 percent of their \nland, including their hunting grounds, to the U.S. government. The \ngovernment promised the Dakota annual payments of gold and goods for \nthe land, as well as help building schools and farms. The promises were \nnever kept.\n  A decade later, in August of 1862, the Dakota were starving. The \nannuity payments were late and the government agent refused to sell on \ncredit food that was being stored in warehouses for sale to the Dakota. \nWhen Dakotas complained, he stunned them by telling them to ``eat \ngrass.'' Four days later, a hunting party of hungry Dakota youth killed \nfive white settlers in a dispute over some stolen eggs. It was the \nspark that ignited the war.\n\n  Reluctantly, some of the Dakota chiefs chose to go to war rather than \nsurrender the young men for hanging. Some hoped that the Army might be \nso distracted by the Civil War that the Dakota could drive them from \nthe Plains. That was a tragic miscalculation.\n  The fighting lasted 38 days, raging across the Minnesota River \nValley, south to Iowa and west to the Dakotas. Most Dakota people \nopposed the war and did not fight. Many risked their lives to save \nwhite settlers. When the war ended, nearly 100 American soldiers, \napproximately 359 settlers and an estimated 29 Dakota soldiers were \ndead.\n  Most of the Dakota warriors who led the fighting escaped north. \nNearly 400 men who remained were captured and taken to a prison in \nMankato, MN, where they were tried by a military commission. As many as \n40 trials were conducted in a single day--a single day. The prisoners \nwere all denied counsel. Many spoke no English and most likely did not \nunderstand the charges against them.\n  Of the 393 men tried, 323 were convicted, and 303 were sentenced to \ndie. President Lincoln commuted all but 38 of the death sentences. The \n38 condemned men were hanged in the Mankato prison the morning after \nChristmas of 1862 in what remains the largest public execution in our \nNation's history. Among the 38 were men who almost certainly had not \ntaken part in the fighting and two men whose names were not even on the \nlist of the condemned.\n  For the rest of the Dakota people, the worst was still to come. After \nlosing the war, they lost their nation. In March of 1863, the Dakota \nprisoners at Mankato were sent to Camp McClellan in Davenport, IA. More \nthan 1,600 other Dakota people who had nothing to do with the war were \nalso taken captive after the war and held at Fort Snelling, MN. In \nApril of 1863, they were forcibly removed to Crow Creek, SD. That same \nmonth, Congress cancelled all treaties with the Dakota and used the \nmoney that had been promised to the Dakota to pay claims by settlers. \nHundreds of Dakota family members died at Fort Snelling. Hundreds more \ndied on the way to Crow Creek, and many more died on the Crow Creek \nreservation. Eventually, some of the families moved from Crow Creek to \nSisseton Wahpeton. It is there, 140 years later, that the letters of \nthe Dakota prisoners have been translated into modern English by their \ndescendants.\n  Like the exhibits in the new museum, the Dakota Letters speak in the \nauthentic voices of the First Americans. The writers speak of their \nlove and concern for their families. They also speak of their \nuncertainty and their fears. One of the most extraordinary of the \nletters was written 3 days after the assassination of President \nLincoln, whom the Dakota call respectfully ``Grandfather.'' The letter \nwas written by a man named Moses Many Lightning Face to a missionary \nthe Dakota prisoners trusted and referred to as a relative. The writer \nexpresses fear about what might happen to the Dakota prisoners now that \nthe man who had spared their life once was dead. These are his words:\n\n       Well, my relative, I wish to write you a letter. We have \n     heard the news. They say that Grandfather was killed. But \n     someone of authority should tell us if this is not true. \n     Thus, I write to you this letter. Also, I have heard some \n     rumors. Grandfather has compassion for us and, so far, we are \n     still alive. But they told us he was killed, and we are \n     saddened. Those of us here think if this is so, we are \n     heartbroken. Perhaps the attitude of the cavalry soldiers may \n     change toward us. Tell me what your thoughts are; I want to \n     know; that's why I write to you. Then I wish to hear exactly \n     how they killed Grandfather. . . . This is all I am going to \n     say. I shake all your hands. Moses Many Lightning Face. This \n     is me.\n\n  What makes the Dakota Letters so rare is that, like most Native \nAmerican languages, Dakota in the mid-1800s was not a written language. \nMissionaries developed a written form of the language to teach the \nBible to the Dakota. The missionaries who visited the Dakota prisoners \ntaught it to them.\n  In Sisseton Wahpeton, the letters were translated by five tribal \nelders, working with Dakota language and history experts from Sisseton \nWahpeton College. It was a complicated process more like code-breaking \nthan simple translation. The words are first translated from Dakota, \nthen into literal English, then into modern English. The translation of \nthe letter to President Lincoln shows this process. I ask consent that \nit be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, like the exhibits in the new museum, the \nDakota Letters illustrate in a powerful way that we do not have \nseparate histories, but we see the same history through different eyes. \nThis gift of being able to see our history from others' perspectives \ncan only help heal our Nation and make us stronger.\n  I believe strongly that the Federal Government, which had such a \ndirect hand, for so long, in efforts to destroy Native cultures, has a \nresponsibility to help preserve these cultures not just on the National \nMall in Washington, but in tribal communities throughout America. And \nwe are making a start.\n  Next month, the first applications will go out for a new grant \nprograms\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nfor tribal museums. Under the Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum \nServices Program, tribes can receive grants of up to $20,000 a year. \nThe museum program, and a similar program to support tribal libraries, \nare both administered by the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences.\n  The Tribal Historic Preservation Program in the National Park Service \ngives tribes control of decisions about cultural preservation on tribal \nlands by establishing tribal historic preservation offices, just like \nState historic preservation offices.\n  The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, passed in \n1990, lays out a process to identify Native American sacred and \nfunerary objects and return them to their people.\n  In Sisseton Wahpeton, tribal elders and educators hope to use \ntechnology to record translation sessions of the Dakota Letters and use \nthe recordings to teach the Dakota language. They also want to use \ndistance learning to teach Dakota history and culture lessons based on \nthe letters. They can't do that now because they have run out of money \nfor the Dakota Letters project. An amendment Senator Inouye is \nsponsoring to the Native American Languages Act might help the tribe \nfinish the Dakota Letters project. It would provide additional \nresources for immersion schools and other intensive efforts to save \nNative American languages--which we are now losing at the alarming rate \nof one each month.\n  All of these efforts, and more, need and deserve the support of \nCongress.\n  Newspaper accounts of the executions of the Dakota prisoners at \nMankato note that the men met their deaths with courage and dignity, \nchanting a Dakota death song. One reporter recorded that their final \nwords were a simple plea for recognition: ``I am here.''\n  Those same words echo from every ancient corner of this Nation. Long \nbefore Europeans and others arrived, Native Americans were here. And \nthey are still here today, greatly enriching our national identity and \nculture. On this happy and historic day, as we celebrate the opening of \nAmerica's spectacular new National Museum of the American Indian, let \nus also celebrate the Native American history and culture that exists \nall across America. And let us vow to work together to preserve that \nhistory and culture everywhere it exists.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n  1. mitakuye ito wowapi cicage kta wacin nakaha wotanin naonhonpi\n  2.

I thank the Senator.\n  The minority leader has spoken about the injustice done to the Dakota \nover a century ago, and we are endeavoring this year in this Congress \nto address another injustice; that is, the injustice where people are \nsick and dying from asbestos exposure and are not getting the money \nthey and their families need. People who are not sick are drawing off \nmoney that should be going to those who desperately need it. We have \ncompanies going bankrupt, with people being displaced and losing their \njobs. It is a bad situation, a terrible situation. We can fix it.\n  I thank my leader for his extraordinary courage in pushing forward a \nproposal to further narrow our differences with our Republican \ncolleagues. If you think about all of the areas of progress, we have \nagreed there should be a trust fund, we have agreed there should be a \ntrust fund, and on how it should be administered; we have agreed on how \nmuch money should go into the trust fund; we have agreed the money \nshould be fully allocated to meet the claims out there; we have agreed \non medical criteria; we have agreed on 10 different levels of \nimpairment. We have basically agreed on the claims. While there are \nseveral areas in which we still have some differences to agree on, we \nhave made extraordinary progress.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for his leadership in getting us close to \nthis point. I have urged Senator Frist, who has left the floor, to \ninvite Senator Daschle to sit down and resolve the remaining \ndifferences between the two leaders.\n  This can be done, and it should be done this year, and we should not \nleave here without completing this job.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may respond to the distinguished \nSenator, I compliment him on his insistence and extraordinary \ndetermination. One of the reasons we have made progress is because of \nhis great persistence and his ability to bring together the consensus \nthat is so necessary if we are going to achieve final success. As he \nhas noted, we have come a long way. It has been my pleasure to work \nwith him as we have traveled the road together to reach this point \nwhere we find, as he has noted, just a few differences. It is my hope \nwe can still work it out prior to the end of this session of Congress. \nI thank him for his kind words and for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Kerry laid out his \nplan for Iraq and for enlisting international support to ease the \nburden on our troops, restoring stability to Iraq, and bringing our \ntroops home in honor. It is a clear warning that conditions are \nworsening in Iraq and changes are urgently needed.

Not just in New York, but in the \n     world. You've set a high standard, you always set a high \n     standard for global dialogue, as Ellen (ph) mentioned a \n     moment ago. And I intend to live up to that tradition here \n     today. This election is about choices. The most important \n     choices a president makes are about protecting America, at \n     home and around the world. A president's first obligation is \n     to make America safer, stronger and truer to our ideals.\n       Only a few blocks from here, three years ago, the events of \n     September 11th remind every American of that obligation. That \n     day brought to our shores the defining struggle of our times: \n     the struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism. And \n     it made clear that our most important task is to fight and to \n     win the war on terrorism.\n       With us today is a remarkable group of women who lost loved \n     ones on September 11th, and whose support I am honored to \n     have. Not only did they suffer unbearable loss, but they \n     helped us as a nation to learn the lessons of that terrible \n     time by insisting on the creation of the 9/11 Commission.\n       I ask them to stand, and I thank them on behalf of our \n     country, and I pledge to them, and to you, that I will \n     implement the 9/11 recommendations. Thank you.\n       In fighting the war on terrorism my principles are \n     straightforward. The terrorists are beyond reason. We must \n     destroy them. As president I will do whatever it takes, as \n     long as it takes, to defeat our enemies.\n       But billions of people around the world, yearning for a \n     better life, are open to America's ideals. We must reach \n     them.\n       To win, America must be strong and America must be smart.\n       The greatest threat that we face is the possibility of Al \n     Qaida or other terrorists getting their hands on nuclear \n     weapons. To prevent that from happening we have to call on \n     the totality of America's strength: strong alliances to help \n     us stop the world's most lethal weapons from falling into the \n     most dangerous hands; a powerful military, transformed to \n     meet the threats of terrorism and the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction; and all of America's power--our diplomacy, \n     our intelligence system, our economic power, our appeal to \n     the values, the values of Americans, and to connect them to \n     the values of other people around the world--each of which is \n     critical to making America more secure and to preventing a \n     new generation of terrorists from emerging.\n       We owe it to the American people to have a real debate \n     about the choices President Bush has made, and the choices I \n     would make and have made, to fight and win the war on terror.\n       That means that we must have a great and honest debate on \n     Iraq.\n       The president claims it is the centerpiece of his war on \n     terror. In fact, Iraq was a profound diversion from that war \n     and the battle against our greatest enemy.\n       Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and from our \n     greatest enemy, Osama bin Laden and the terrorists.\n       Invading Iraq has created a crisis of historic proportions \n     and if we do not change course, there is the prospect of a \n     war with no end in sight.\n       This month, we passed a cruel milestone: more than 1,000 \n     Americans lost in Iraq. Their sacrifice reminds us that Iraq \n     remains overwhelmingly an American burden. Nearly 90 percent \n     of the troops and nearly 90 percent of the casualties are \n     American.\n       Despite the president's claims, this is not a grand \n     coalition.\n       Our troops have served with extraordinary bravery and skill \n     and resolve. Their service humbles all of us. I visited with \n     some of them in the hospitals and I am stunned by their \n     commitment, by their sense of duty, their patriotism. When I \n     speak to them, when I look into the eyes of their families, I \n     know this: We owe them the truth about what we have asked \n     them to do and what is still to be done.\n       Would you all join me? My wife Teresa has made it through \n     the traffic, and I'm delighted that she is here. Thank you.\n       In June, the president declared, The Iraqi people have \n     their country back. And just last week he told us, This \n     country is headed toward democracy; freedom is on the march. \n     But the administration's own official intelligence estimate, \n     given to the president last July, tells a very different \n     story.\n       According to press reports, the intelligence estimate \n     totally contradicts what the president is saying to the \n     American people and so do the facts on the ground.\n       Security is deteriorating for us and for the Iraqis. Forty-\n     two Americans died in Iraq in June, the month before the \n     handover. But 54 died in July, 66 in August and already 54 \n     halfway through September. And more than 1,100 Americans were \n     wounded in August; more than in any other month since the \n     invasion.\n       We are fighting a growing insurgency in an ever-widening \n     war zone. In March, insurgents attacked our forces 700 times. \n     In August, they attacked 2,700 times; a 400 percent increase.\n       Fallujah, Ramadi, Samarra and parts of Iraq are now no-go \n     zones, breeding grounds for terrorists, who are free to plot \n     and to launch attacks against our soldiers.\n       The radical Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who is accused of \n     complicity in the murder of Americans, holds more sway in \n     suburbs of Baghdad than the prime minister.\n       Violence against Iraqis, from bombings to kidnappings to \n     intimidation, is on the rise.\n       Basic living conditions are also deteriorating.\n       Yes, there has been some progress. Thanks to the \n     extraordinary efforts of our soldiers and civilians in Iraq, \n     schools, shops and hospitals have been opened in certain \n     places. In parts of Iraq, normalcy actually prevails.\n       But most Iraqis have lost faith in our ability to be able \n     to deliver meaningful improvements to their lives. So they're \n     sitting on the fence, instead of siding with us against the \n     insurgents.\n       That is the truth, the truth that the commander in chief \n     owes to our troops and to the American people.\n       Now, I will say to you, it is never easy to discuss what \n     has gone wrong while our troops are in constant danger. But \n     it is essential if you want to correct the course and do \n     what's right for those troops, instead of repeating the same \n     old mistakes over and over again.\n       I know this dilemma firsthand. I saw firsthand what happens \n     when pride or arrogance take over from rational decision-\n     making. And after serving in a war, I returned home to offer \n     my own personal views of dissent. I did so because I believed \n     strongly that we owed it to those risking their lives to \n     speak truth to power. And we still do.\n       Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own \n     special place in Hell. But that was not--that was not, in and \n     of itself, a reason to go to war.\n       The satisfaction that we take in his downfall does not hide \n     this fact: We have traded a dictator for a chaos that has \n     left America less secure.\n       Now, the president has said that he miscalculated in Iraq, \n     and that it was a catastrophic success.\n       The first and most fundamental mistake was the president's \n     failure to tell the truth to the American people.\n       He failed to tell the truth about the rationale for going \n     to war, and he failed to tell the truth about the burden this \n     war would impose on our soldiers and our citizens.\n       By one count, the president offered 23 different rationales \n     for this war. If his purpose was to confuse and mislead the \n     American people, he succeeded.\n       His two main rationales, weapons of mass destruction and \n     the Al Qaida-September 11th connection, have both been proved \n     false by the president's own weapons inspectors and by the 9/\n     11 Commission.\n       And just last week, Secretary of State Powell acknowledged \n     those facts. Only Vice President Cheney still insists that \n     the Earth is flat.\n       The president also failed to level with the American people \n     about what it would take to prevail in Iraq. He didn't tell \n     us that well over 100,000 troops would be needed for years, \n     not months. He didn't tell us that he wouldn't take the time \n     to assemble a genuine, broad, strong coalition of allies. He \n     didn't tell us that the cost would exceed $200 billion. He \n     didn't tell us that even after paying such a heavy price, \n     success was far from assured.\n       And America will pay an even heavier price for the \n     president's lack of candor.\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\n       At home, the American people are less likely to trust this \n     administration if it needs to summon their support to meet \n     real and pressing threats to our security.\n       In the dark days of the Cuban missile crisis, President \n     Kennedy sent former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to Europe \n     to build support. Acheson explained the situation to French \n     President de Gaulle. Then he offered to show him highly \n     classified satellite photos as proof. De Gaulle waved him \n     away, saying, The word of the president of the United States \n     is good enough for me.\n       How many world leaders have that same trust in America's \n     president today? This president's failure to tell the truth \n     to us and to the world before the war has been exceeded by \n     fundamental errors of judgment during and after the war.\n       The president now admits to miscalculations in Iraq. \n     Miscalculations: This is one of the greatest underestimates \n     in recent American history.\n       His miscalculations were not the equivalent of accounting \n     errors. They were colossal failures of judgment, and judgment \n     is what we look for in a president.\n       And this is all the more stunning, because we're not \n     talking about 20/20 hindsight, we're not talking about Monday \n     morning quarterbacking. Before the war, before he chose to go \n     to war, bipartisan congressional hearings, major outside \n     studies and even some in his own administration, predicted \n     virtually every problem that we face in Iraq today.\n       The result is a long litany of misjudgments with terrible \n     and real consequences.\n       The administration told us we would be greeted as \n     liberators; they were wrong. They told us not to worry about \n     the looting or the sorry state of Iraq's infrastructure; they \n     were wrong. They told us we had enough troops to provide \n     security and stability, defeat the insurgents, guard the \n     borders and secure the arms depots; they were tragically \n     wrong.\n       They told us we could rely on exiles like Ahmed Chalabi to \n     build political legitimacy; they were wrong. They told us we \n     would quickly restore an Iraqi civil service to run the \n     country, and a police force and an army to secure it; they \n     were wrong.\n       In Iraq, this administration has consistently overpromised \n     and underperformed. And this policy has been plagued by a \n     lack of planning, by an absence of candor, arrogance and \n     outright incompetence.\n       And the president has held no one accountable, including \n     himself.\n       In fact, the only officials--the only officials who've lost \n     their jobs over Iraq were the ones who told the truth.\n       Economic adviser Larry Lindsey said it would cost as much \n     as $200 billion. Pretty good calculation. He was fired.\n       After the successful entry into Baghdad, George Bush was \n     offered help from the U.N., and he rejected it, stiff-armed \n     them, decided to go it alone. He even prohibited nations from \n     participating in reconstruction efforts because they weren't \n     part of the original coalition, pushing reluctant countries \n     even further away. And as we continue to fight this war \n     almost alone, it is hard to estimate how costly that arrogant \n     decision really was.\n       Can anyone seriously say this president has handled Iraq in \n     a way that makes America stronger in the war on terrorism?\n       AUDIENCE: No!\n       KERRY: By any measure, by any measure, the answer is no.\n       Nuclear dangers have mounted across the globe. The \n     international terrorist club has expanded. Radicalism in the \n     Middle East is on the rise. We have divided our friends and \n     united our enemies. And our standing in the world is at an \n     all-time low.\n       Think about it for a minute. Consider where we were and \n     where we are.\n       After the events of September 11th, we had an opportunity \n     to bring our country and the world together in a legitimate \n     struggle against terrorists. On September 12th, headlines and \n     newspapers abroad declared that, We are all Americans now.\n       But through his policy in Iraq, the president squandered \n     that moment and, rather than isolating the terrorists, left \n     America isolated from the world.\n       We now know that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, \n     and posed no imminent threat to our security.\n       The president's policy in Iraq took our attention and our \n     resources away from other more serious threats to America, \n     threats like North Korea, which actually has weapons of mass \n     destruction, including a nuclear arsenal, and is building \n     more right now under this president's watch; the emerging \n     nuclear danger of Iran; the tons and kilotons of unsecured \n     chemical and nuclear weapons in Russia; and the increasing \n     instability in Afghanistan.\n       Today, warlords again control much of that country, the \n     Taliban is regrouping, opium production is at an all-time \n     high and the Al Qaida leadership still plots and plans, not \n     only there, but in 60 other nations.\n       Instead of using U.S. forces, we relied on warlords, who \n     one week earlier had been fighting on the other side, to go \n     up in the mountains to capture Osama bin Laden when he was \n     cornered. He slipped away.\n       We then diverted our focus and our forces from the hunt for \n     those who were responsible for September 11th in order to \n     invade Iraq.\n       We know now that Iraq played no part. We knew then on \n     September 11th. And it had no operational ties to Al Qaida.\n       The president's policy in Iraq precipitated the very \n     problem that he said he was trying to prevent.\n       Secretary of State Powell admits that Iraq was not a magnet \n     for international terrorists before their war; now it is, and \n     they are operating against our troops.\n       Iraq is becoming a sanctuary for a new generation of \n     terrorists who could someday hit the United States of \n     America.\n       And we know that while Iraq was a source of friction, it \n     was not previously a source of serious disagreement with our \n     allies in Europe and countries in the Muslim world.\n       The president's policy in Iraq divided our oldest alliance \n     and sent our standing in the Muslim world into freefall.\n       Three years after 9/11, even in many moderate Muslim \n     countries, like Jordan, Morocco and Turkey, Osama bin Laden \n     is more popular than the United States of America.\n       Two years ago, Congress was right to give the president the \n     authority to use force to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. \n     This president, any president, would have needed that threat \n     of force to act effectively. This president misused that \n     authority.\n       The power entrusted to the president purposefully gave him \n     a strong hand to play in the international community. The \n     idea was simple: We would get the weapons inspectors back in \n     to verify whether or not Iraq had weapons of mass destruction \n     and we would convince the world to speak with one voice to \n     Saddam, disarm or be disarmed.\n       A month before the war, President Bush told the nation, If \n     we have to act, we will take every precaution that is \n     possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full \n     power of the United States military. We will act with allies \n     at our side and we will prevail.\n       Instead, the president rushed to war, without letting the \n     weapons inspectors finish their work. He went purposefully, \n     by choice, without a broad and deep coalition of allies. He \n     acted by choice, without making sure that our troops even had \n     enough body armor. And he plunged ahead by choice, without \n     understanding or preparing for the consequences of postwar. \n     None of which I would have done.\n       Yet today, President Bush tells us that he would do \n     everything all over again the same way.\n       How can he possibly be serious? Is he really saying to \n     America that if we know there was no imminent threat, no \n     weapons of mass destruction, no ties to Al Qaida, the United \n     States should have invaded Iraq?\n       My answer: resoundingly, no, because a commander in chief's \n     first responsibility is to make a wise and responsible \n     decision to keep America safe.\n       Now the president is looking for a reason, a new reason to \n     hang his hat on--it's the capability to acquire weapons.\n       Well, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, that was \n     not the reason given to the nation, that was not the reason \n     the Congress voted on. That is not a reason today; it is an \n     excuse.\n       Thirty-five to 40 countries have greater capability to \n     build a nuclear bomb than Iraq did in 2003. Is President Bush \n     saying we should invade all of them?\n       I would have personally concentrated our power and \n     resources on defeating global terrorism and capturing Osama \n     bin Laden.\n       I would have tightened the noose and continued to pressure \n     and isolate Saddam Hussein--who was weak and getting weaker--\n     so that he would pose no threat to the region or to America.\n       The president's insistence that he would do the same thing \n     all over again in Iraq is a clear warning for the future. And \n     it makes the choice in this election clear: more of the same \n     with President Bush or a new, smarter direction with John \n     Kerry that makes our troops and America safer. That's the \n     choice.\n       It is time, at long last, to ask the questions and insist \n     on the answers from the commander in chief about his serious \n     misjudgments and what they tell us about his administration \n     and the president himself.\n       In Iraq, we have a mess on our hands. But we cannot just \n     throw up our hands, we cannot afford to see Iraq become a \n     permanent source of terror that will endanger America's \n     security for years to come.\n       All across this country, people ask me and others, what we \n     should do now every stop of the way. From the first time I \n     spoke about this in the Senate, I have set out a specific set \n     of recommendations from day one, from the first debate until \n     this moment. I have set out specific steps of how we should \n     not and how we should proceed.\n       But over and over, when this administration has been \n     presented with a reasonable alternative, they have rejected \n     it and gone their own way. This is stubborn incompetence.\n       Five months ago in Fulton, Missouri, I said that the \n     president was close to his last chance to get it right. Every \n     day this president makes it more difficult to deal with Iraq, \n     harder than it was five months ago, harder than it was a year \n     ago, a year and a half ago.\n       It's time to recognize what is and what is not happening in \n     Iraq today and we must act with urgency.\n       Just this weekend, a leading Republican, Chuck Hagel, said \n     that, we're in deep trouble in Iraq. It doesn't add up to a \n     pretty picture, he said, and we're going to have to look at a \n     recalibration of our policy.\n       Republican leaders like Dick Lugar and John McCain have \n     offered similar assessments.\n       We need to turn the page and make a fresh start in Iraq.\n       First, the president has to get the promised international \n     support so our men and women in uniform don't have to go it \n     alone.\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n       Last spring, after too many months of delay, after \n     reluctance to take the advice of so many of us, the president \n     finally went back to the U.N., and it passed Resolution 1546. \n     It was the right thing to do, but it was late.\n       That resolution calls on U.N. members to help in Iraq by \n     providing troops, trainers for Iraq's security forces and a \n     special brigade to protect the U.N. mission, and more \n     financial assistance and real debt relief.\n       But guess what? Three months later, not a single country \n     has answered that call, and the president acts as if it \n     doesn't matter.\n       And of the 13 billion that was previously pledged to Iraq \n     by other countries, only $1.2 billion has been delivered.\n       The president should convene a summit meeting of the \n     world's major powers and of Iraq's neighbors, this week, in \n     New York, where many leaders will attend the U.N. General \n     Assembly, and he should insist that they make good on the \n     U.N. resolution. He should offer potential troop contributors \n     specific but critical roles in training Iraqi security \n     personnel and in securing Iraqi borders. He should give other \n     countries a stake in Iraq's future by encouraging them to \n     help develop Iraq's oil resources and by letting them bid on \n     contracts instead of locking them out of the reconstruction \n     process.\n       Now, is this more difficult today? You bet it is. It's more \n     difficult today because the president hasn't been doing it \n     from the beginning. And I and others have repeatedly \n     recommended this from the very beginning.\n       Delay has only made it harder. After insulting allies and \n     shredding alliances, this president may not have the trust \n     and the confidence to bring others to our side in Iraq.\n       But I'll tell you, we cannot hope to succeed unless we \n     rebuild and lead strong alliances so that other nations share \n     the burden with us. That is the only way to be successful in \n     the end.\n       Second, the president must get serious about training Iraqi \n     security forces.\n       Last February, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that--claimed \n     that more than 210,000 Iraqis were in uniform. This is the \n     public statement to America.\n       Well, guess what, America? Neither number bears any \n     relationship to the truth.\n       For example, just 5,000 Iraqi soldiers have been fully \n     trained by the administration's own minimal standards. And of \n     the 35,000 police now in uniform, not one--not one has \n     completed a 24-week field training program.\n       Is it any wonder that Iraqi security forces can't stop the \n     insurgency or provide basic law and order?\n       The president should urgently expand the security forces' \n     training program inside and outside of Iraq. He should \n     strengthen the vetting of recruits, double the classroom \n     training time, require the follow-on field training. He \n     should recruit thousands of qualified trainers from our \n     allies, especially those who have no troops in Iraq. He \n     should press our NATO allies to open training centers in \n     their countries.\n       And he should stop misleading the American people with \n     phony, inflated numbers and start behaving like we really are \n     at war.\n       Third, the president must carry out a reconstruction plan \n     that finally brings tangible benefits to the Iraqi people, \n     all of which, may I say, should have been in the plan and \n     immediately launched with such a ferocity that there was no \n     doubt about America's commitment or capacity in the very \n     first moments afterwards. But they didn't plan.\n       He ignored his own State Department's plan, he discarded \n     it.\n       Last week, the administration admitted that its plan was a \n     failure when it asked Congress for permission to radically \n     revise the spending priorities in Iraq. It took them 17 \n     months for them to understand that security is a priority, 17 \n     months to figure out that boosting oil production is \n     critical, 17 months to conclude that an Iraqi with a job is \n     less likely to shoot at our soldiers.\n       One year ago, this administration asked for and received \n     $18 billion to help the Iraqis and relieve the conditions \n     that contribute to the insurgency. Today, less than $1 \n     billion of those funds have actually been spent. I said at \n     the time that we have to rethink our policies and set \n     standards of accountability, and now we're paying the price \n     for not doing that.\n       He should use more Iraqi contractors and workers instead of \n     big corporations like Halliburton.\n       In fact, he should stop paying companies under fraud \n     investigation or corruption investigation. And he should fire \n     the civilians in the Pentagon who are responsible for \n     mismanaging the reconstruction effort.\n       Fourth, the president must take immediate, urgent, \n     essential steps to guarantee that the promised election can \n     be held next year. Credible elections are key to producing an \n     Iraqi government that enjoys the support of the Iraqi people \n     and an assembly that could write a constitution and yields a \n     viable power-sharing agreement.\n       Because Iraqis have no experience in holding free and fair \n     elections, the president agreed six months ago that the U.N. \n     must play a central role, yet today, just four months before \n     Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls, the U.N. Secretary \n     General and administration officials say elections are in \n     grave doubt, because the security situation is so bad, and \n     because not a single country has yet offered troops to \n     protect the U.N. elections mission.\n       The president needs to tell the truth. The president needs \n     to deal with reality, and he should recruit troops from our \n     friends and allies for a U.N. protection force.\n       Now, this is not going to be easy. I understand that.\n       Again, I repeat, every month that's gone by, every offer of \n     help spurned, every alternative not taken for these past \n     months has made this more difficult and those were this \n     president's choices. But even countries that refused to put \n     boots on the ground in Iraq ought to still be prepared to \n     help the United Nations hold an election.\n       We should also intensify the training of Iraqis to manage \n     and guard the polling places that need to be opened. \n     Otherwise, U.S. forces will end up bearing that burden alone.\n       If the president would move in this direction, if he would \n     bring in more help from other countries to provide resources \n     and to train the Iraqis to provide their own security and to \n     develop a reconstruction plan that brings real benefits to \n     the Iraqi people, and take the steps necessary to hold \n     elections next year, if all of that happened, we could begin \n     to withdraw U.S. forces starting next summer and \n     realistically aim to bring our troops home within the next \n     four years.\n       That can achieved.\n       This is what has to be done. This is what I would do if I \n     were president today. But we can't afford to wait until \n     January and I can't tell you what I will find in Iraq on \n     January 20th.\n       President Bush owes it to the American people to tell the \n     truth and put Iraq on the right track. Even more, he owes it \n     to our troops and their families whose sacrifice is a \n     testament to the best of America.\n       The principles that should guide American policy in Iraq \n     now and in the future are clear. We must make Iraq the \n     world's responsibility, because the world has a stake in the \n     outcome and others should have always been bearing the \n     burden.\n       That's the right way to get the job done. It always was the \n     right way to get the job done to minimize the risk to \n     American troops and the cost to American taxpayers. And it is \n     the right way to get our troops home.\n       On May 1st of last year, President Bush stood in front of a \n     now-infamous banner that read Mission accomplished. He \n     declared to the American people that, In the battle of Iraq, \n     the United States and our allies have prevailed.\n       In fact, the worst part of the war was just beginning, with \n     the greatest number of American casualties still to come.\n       The president misled, miscalculated and mismanaged every \n     aspect of this undertaking and he has made the achievement of \n     our objective--a stable Iraq, secure within its borders, with \n     a representative government--far harder to achieve than it \n     ever should have been.\n       In Iraq, this administration's record is filled with bad \n     predictions, inaccurate cost estimates, deceptive statements \n     and errors of judgment, presidential judgment, of historic \n     proportions.\n       At every critical juncture in Iraq and in the war on \n     terrorism, the president has made the wrong choice.\n       I have a plan to make America stronger.\n       The president often says that in a post-9/11 world we can't \n     hesitate to act. I agree. But we should not act just for the \n     sake of acting.\n       George Bush has no strategy for Iraq. I do and I have all \n     along.\n       George Bush has not told the truth to the American people \n     about why we went to war and how the war is going. I have and \n     I will continue to do so.\n       I believe the invasion of Iraq has made us less secure and \n     weaker in the war on terrorism. I have a plan to fight a \n     smarter, more effective war on terror that actually makes \n     America safer.\n       Today, because of George Bush's policy in Iraq, the world \n     is a more dangerous place for America and Americans; just ask \n     anyone who travels.\n       If you share my conviction that we cannot go on as we are, \n     that we can make America stronger and safer than it is, then \n     November 2nd is your chance to speak and to be heard.\n       It is not a question of staying the course, but of changing \n     the course.\n       I am convinced that with the right leadership, we can \n     create a fresh start, move more effectively to accomplish our \n     goals.\n       Our troops have served with extraordinary courage and \n     commitment. For their sake, for America's sake, we have to \n     get this right. We have to do everything in our power to \n     complete the mission and make America stronger at home and \n     respected again in the world.\n       Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of \n     America.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9401-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9401-S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WIDENING OF THE INCOME GAP\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I draw to the attention of the Senate an \nissue which many of us have been concerned about for some period of \ntime. Now it has reached the front page of some of the leading \nnewspapers of this country, and it is something that is of central \nconcern to families all over this Nation. I refer to the excellent \nopening yesterday of a series by the Washington Post, yesterday's \ncalled ``As Income Gap Widens, Uncertainty Spreads.'' This is an \nenormously interesting column.\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from this column be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Figuring out what the future holds for workers is key to \n     understanding a historic shift in the U.S. workforce, a shift \n     that has been changing the rules for a crucial part of the \n     middle class.\n       This transformation is no longer just about factory \n     workers, whose ranks have declined by 5 million in the past \n     25 years as manufacturing moved to countries with cheaper \n     labor. All kinds of jobs that pay in the middle range--are \n     vanishing, including computer-code crunchers, produce \n     managers, call-center operators, travel agents and office \n     clerks.\n       The jobs have had one thing in common: For people with a \n     high school diploma and perhaps a bit of college, they can be \n     a ticket to a modest home, health insurance, decent \n     retirement and maybe some savings for the kids' tuition. Such \n     jobs were a big reason America's middle class flourished in \n     the second half of the 20th century.\n       Now what those jobs share is vulnerability. The people who \n     fill them have become replaceable by machines, workers \n     overseas or temporary employees at home who lack benefits. \n     And when they are replaced, many don't know where to turn.\n       Robert Boyer retrained in computers after the plant closed. \n     But tech companies told him they wanted five years' \n     experience, not a certificate from a six-month course. So he \n     works for $11.50 an hour at Home Depot, using the wisdom of \n     four decades as plant electrician to help customers pick \n     light bulbs for their remodeled kitchens.\n       Boyer turns angry at any suggestion that the jobs picture \n     is not that bad. ``When these guys get on the boob tube and \n     say there's jobs out there, you just gotta go out there and \n     get them, it makes me want to go out there and grab them by \n     the throat and say, `Where? Where are the jobs at?''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I highlight what this story is really \nabout. I think we will find--I certainly do in my home State of \nMassachusetts and my travels around the country--that this is a reality \ncheck. This story is a reality check of what is happening in cities, \ntowns, urban areas, and rural areas across the country.\n  It says:\n\n       As Income Gap Widens, Uncertainty Spreads.\n\n  I quote the Washington Post:\n\n       The vanishing middle class.\n       Now what middle class jobs share is vulnerability . . . The \n     people who fill them have been replaceable by machines, \n     workers overseas or temporary employees at home who lack \n     benefits, and when they are replaced they don't know where to \n     turn.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       All kinds of jobs that pay in the middle range are \n     vanishing, including computer code crunchers, produce \n     managers, call center operators, travel agents and office \n     clerks.\n\n  And the list goes on, and the article goes on and on about what is \nhappening to middle-income workers in the United States of America at \nthis time.\n  I find that this article is a restatement about what many of us \nbelieve has been happening for some time and trying to make it a point \nto try to do something about it. But we have been rebuffed and the \nideas have been rejected in the Senate, and certainly by the \nadministration.\n  When we are talking about dealing with some of the issues, which I \nwill comment on, we find an administration that says no to an increase \nin the minimum wage, no to extending unemployment compensation, no in \nterms of overtime, all which would have a great impact on the middle \nclass.\n  Now, what do we hear on the other side? First of all, we heard from \nthe President of the United States in New York yesterday: ``The economy \nis strong and is getting stronger.'' This is from a speech the \nPresident made in New York yesterday, even though New York has lost \n240,000 jobs since the President took office.\n  Also yesterday, in New Hampshire, the President said: ``The economy \nof ours is growing.'' New Hampshire's unemployment rate is 32 percent \nhigher than when the President took office. The New Hampshire economy \nhas lost more than 7,000 jobs. But according to the President: ``The \neconomy of ours is growing.'' And according to the President yesterday: \n``The economy is strong and is getting stronger.''\n  And then we see, of course, what the President said at the time of \nthe Republican Convention: ``We have seen a shaken economy rise to its \nfeet.'' Well, how can it be this way? How can the President of the \nUnited States be saying ``the economy is strong and is getting \nstronger'' and then we have these reports here?\n  Well, let's look at the facts. Let's look at what has been happening \nover the period of the recent years. If we look at the recovery the \nPresident talks about, as shown on this chart, the current recovery is \ndepicted by this red line right here in terms of job growth. If you are \nlooking at the recoveries before 1991, you see the job growth that went \nup, as shown here. And if you look from 1991 to 1993, this is the job \ngrowth here. It is basically the Clinton job growth.\n  We see the difference between the Clinton job growth and the Bush job \ngrowth. Make no mistake about it, Presidential leadership makes a \ndifference. Look at the record. During President Clinton's \nadministration, 22 million jobs were added. During President Kennedy's \nadministration, we had one of the longest periods of economic growth \nand price stability that we had in that century up until the time of \nPresident Clinton. So Presidential leadership does matter.\n  We have the President saying: Everything is fine. We are growing \nstronger and stronger. It is not the Democrats who are saying we have a \nreal crisis in the middle class. Here we have one of our national \nnewspapers that is saying exactly what many of us have been saying for \nsome period of time.\n  Now, what are the facts? We can see the economic record. We have lost \n1.7 million private-sector jobs from January of 2001 to August 2004--\n1.7 million jobs lost, not gained but lost, here in the United States. \nWe have gone from 111,600,000 to 109,800,000 jobs.\n  Let's look at what is happening across the country. Here is a chart \nthat shows, under President Bush, unemployment is higher in 45 of the \n50 States. The States that are marked in red on this chart are States \nwith higher unemployment than when Bush took office. The States with \nthe same unemployment as when the President took office are marked in \nyellow. The States marked in green have lower unemployment than when \nthe President took office, which are Louisiana, Nevada, Hawaii, and \nDelaware--four States. For all of the other States, you see the loss of \nover 1 million jobs. We have higher unemployment not only in some \nregions of the country but generally throughout the country.\n  What is happening in terms of the new jobs? As shown on this chart, \nmost new jobs in the Bush economy pay low wages. This is not something \nwe are saying over on this side, the Democratic side. This is the chief \neconomist for Morgan Stanley, who says 81 percent of the growth in jobs \nis in the low-wage industries: janitors, salespeople, movers, \nrepairmen, and drivers. It is interesting, those jobs do not have the \nbenefits. Those jobs do not have the health insurance. Those jobs do \nnot have any kind of sick leave. Those jobs do not have any kind of \nprotection in terms of pensions or anything else. And it is 81 percent \nof the growth in jobs, according to Morgan Stanley. Jobs in the high-\nwage industries--construction jobs, white-collar jobs--are the \nremaining 19 percent. So we have seen that whatever jobs have been \ncreated have largely been at the lower level.\n\n  This chart is from the Economic Policy Institute. It shows the \ndisparity in pay between growing and shrinking industries--$51,270 for \nthe expanding industries, $30,368 for the contracting industries--41 \npercent less. So this is saying essentially what the previous chart \nshowed; and that is, the jobs that are being created even now are still \nnot paying well.\n  Let's see what is happening to the families across the country. These \nare median household incomes. This is what is happening in working \nfamilies over the period from 2000 to 2003. The real purchasing power \nhas gone down some $1,500.\n  So we say, all right, this is the dilemma. You are sure it is a slow \neconomy, but what in the world should we expect? We all have to share \nthis burden, and it is too bad that workers have to share it. What is \nso bad about that? Well, I will show you what is bad about that, and \nthat is, we have seen that productivity is growing 15 times faster than \nwages--workers are working longer, they are working harder, and they \nare producing more, but they are not seeing the benefit in terms of \nwages. They are not seeing it. This is the largest disparity in terms \nof productivity versus wages in the recent\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\nhistory of this country. So the workers are working longer. They are \nworking harder. They are producing more. But do you think that would \nreflect itself in increased wages?\n  And let me show you this chart here. In the Bush economy, we find \nthat corporations are getting a bigger and bigger share of the pie. \nHere is the share of corporate profits having increased by 65 percent \nover workers' wages. This gap here is the largest gap we have had in \nthe postwar period: larger corporate profits, workers with increased \nproductivity, working longer and harder and yet they are still not able \nto make ends meet. These charts are going back to what the Washington \nPost pointed out here: ``As Income Gap Widens, Uncertainty Spreads.'' \nThat is what is happening in the economy.\n  And we can see the difference between this and other recoveries. The \naverage in the last eight recoveries is corporate profits going up 14 \npercent and the workers' wages going up 8.6 percent. But here in the \nBush recovery you have corporate profits going up 39 percent and \nwages--adjusted for inflation--going down by half of 1 percent. There \nit is.\n  We ask: Is this President doing anything about it? What is he doing? \nOpposing an increase in the minimum wage, saying no more overtime for \nmiddle-income families, and no, you are not going to get the \nunemployment compensation you paid into, that you are entitled to as a \nmatter of right.\n  This is an extraordinary chart, where you get, on average, CEOs \nmaking $8.1 million versus the average worker's $26,000. This is \nstartling. It is the average, not the median. It is the average because \nso many of the CEOs make so much more. The point is, the disparity \nbetween the CEOs and the workers is 300 times.\n  Now, it is against that background that we have many being laid off \nand new jobs not paying well, that we have the administration putting a \nlid on any of the efforts we can provide in the Senate in terms of \nunemployment compensation and protecting overtime. And what has been \nhappening out there? What has been happening in the meantime? We know \nthe wages these workers are receiving, if they have been laid off and \nthey get a new job, are not keeping up with the cost of things.\n  Here it is over the period of the last 4 years: Health insurance has \nincreased 59 percent. If the middle income is interested in their \nchildren being able to go to schools and colleges, tuition has gone up \n28 percent. Interestingly, there is no increase in Pell grants, \nabsolutely none, although in January of 2000, when the President was \nrunning for office, he said he would ask for an increase in the Pell \ngrants. We never received that. And in the appropriations this year \nthey will see no increase whatsoever. Housing costs are up 27 percent. \nGas is up 22 percent. Milk is up 13 percent.\n  In my part of the country, in Cape Cod last week, for a gallon of gas \nit cost $4.05. I know it is about $3.23 a gallon in other parts of the \ncountry.\n  You are asking a person to work for a minimum wage of $5.15 and to \nbuy a gallon of milk at $4.05. The administration says they are opposed \nto any real increase. These are hard-working men and women, more than 7 \nmillion of them, many women with children. It is an issue which affects \nmany of those hard-working men and women of dignity.\n  If you look at what has happened in terms of health care costs, the \nconsumer price index has gone up 1.6, 2.4, 1.8, 5.9, and total health \ncare costs cumulatively, 59 percent. One might ask, what in the world \ncan we do about it? One of the things we might be able to do about it \nin terms of drug costs is reimportation. We could do something about \nthat. We have a bipartisan bill. Yet we can't get it on the floor. We \ncan't get an up-or-down vote. Those of us who would support it would go \nfor an hour evenly divided. Let's get accountability. Let's do \nsomething about the cost.\n  When you ask, so you are complaining about the increase in cost, what \nis your idea? One of the ideas is the reimportation of drugs. But no, \nwe can't do that. We have dealt with all the issues of safety. I yield \nto no one in this body in terms of the safety of health care. We are \nunable to permit the Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for \nseniors. We could do something about that. But no, we are denied the \nopportunity. As a result, we have exploding costs that are going out of \ncontrol in terms of health care generally and in terms of prescription \ndrugs--all impacting middle-class families. More and more of them are \nlosing their health care coverage, their security. They haven't got \nwage security. They don't have job security. They don't have education \nsecurity. They don't have health security. This chart illustrates that, \nevery single year, more than a million, from 2000 to 2003. The economy \nis strong? The economy is getting stronger? Everything is OK? Hello.\n  It isn't just those on this side of the aisle who say that this is \nwhat is happening; we have seen this in newspapers all across the \ncountry. All you have to do is visit any town in America. We know what \nthe results are: We have 13 million children hungry or on the verge of \nhunger here in the United States. And the economy is getting stronger? \nEight million Americans are unemployed, and nearly 3 million have lost \nunemployment benefits since Republicans ended the program. Seven \nmillion low wage workers wait 7 years for a minimum wage increase. That \nused to be a bipartisan effort, to have an increase in the minimum \nwage. President Bush 1 signed an increase. President Nixon signed an \nincrease. It was bipartisan for years. But no, we can't even get a vote \non it.\n  When we offer an amendment on one of the bills, what do our \nRepublican friends do? They pull the bill. State Department \nreauthorization, pull the bill; add it onto the reform of welfare, pull \nthe bill down; class action, pull the bill. We don't want to even vote \non it. Imagine that. Imagine not even wanting to vote on it.\n  Six million have lost overtime protection under the new Bush rule. \nLet me give a quick review of who is impacted. These are the \nindividuals who would be impacted: police, nurses. They are our \nhomeland defenders, the first responders. They are the ones whose \novertime is threatened.\n  In the last several days, my colleague and friend Senator Kerry has \noffered a real alternative to the current economic challenges we are \nfacing, that middle-income Americans are facing every single day in \nterms of lost wages, lost jobs, lost health insurance, lost \nopportunities for education. It talks about creating good-paying jobs, \nstrengthening the middle class, and restoring America's competitive \nedge and cutting the deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt of this plan be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Kerry-Edwards Economic Plan\n\n       Under George Bush, America has lost 1.6 million private-\n     sector jobs. The typical family has seen its income fall by \n     more than $1,500. Real business investment and exports are \n     both down under George Bush, the first time we have a decline \n     during a Presidential term in over 70 years. And all George \n     Bush has had to offer are excuses and bad plans that put job \n     creation and the middle class last while favoring special \n     interests.\n       John Kerry and John Edwards believe that America can do \n     better. They have an economic plan that will unleash the \n     productive powers of America's workers and companies, \n     creating millions of good-paying jobs and strengthening the \n     middle class. Their economic plan is built around four basic \n     principles:\n       (1) Create Good-paying Jobs in America\n       End tax breaks for companies creating jobs overseas and cut \n     taxes for 99 percent of taxpaying corporations.\n       A New Jobs Tax Credit to encourage hiring by manufacturers, \n     other businesses affected by outsourcing and small businesses \n     in 2005 and 2006.\n       Level the playing field by enforcing out trade agreements \n     and trade laws.\n       (2) Strengthen Middle-class Families by Cutting Taxes and \n     Lowering Health and Energy Costs\n       Cut taxes for 98 percent of families, including new tax \n     breaks for education, child care, and health care.\n       Cut health premiums by up to $1,000 for families.\n       Provide $25 billion in a State and Local Tuition and Tax \n     Relief Fund.\n       (3) Restore America's Competitive Edge\n       Make America energy independent of Middle East oil.\n       Invest more in research and development, including lifting \n     the ban on stem cell research and making broadband universal.\n       Double the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).\n       Provide a tax cut on up to $4,000 of college tuition and \n     investment in training.\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\n       (4) Cut the Deficit and Restore Economic Confidence\n       Cut the deficit in half in four years by restraining \n     spending growth, paying for all proposals, and eliminating \n     corporate welfare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 10 minutes we are currently in \nare reserved for the Senator from Iowa.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9404-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INSTABILITY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the chaos in Iraq gets worse with every \nweek that goes by. Many key cities are now under the control of the \ninsurgents. Virtually every day we see car bombings, kidnappings, \nassassinations, beheadings. American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are \nbeing attacked and killed at an alarming and escalating rate. But if we \nlisten to the President, what we hear is sugar-coated happy talk.\n  The President says:\n\n       We're making progress. We're making progress.\n\n  He says we have a strong government in Iraq headed by Mr. Allawi. He \nsays that because of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, democracy is spreading \n``like a sunrise.''\n\n  Well, the President may have been a cheerleader in college, but we \nneed more than cheerleading now.\n  Let's be clear: President Bush misled us into this war, and he is \nmisleading us today about where we stand in Iraq. His misguided, \nmismanaged war has become a quagmire with ever-rising body counts and \nno end in sight.\n  Over the weekend, a host of Republican Senators stepped forward to \nurge the President to face the facts and at long last to be open and \nhonest with the American people. On Sunday, Senator Hagel of Nebraska \nsaid:\n\n       The fact is, we're in trouble. We're in deep trouble in \n     Iraq.\n\n  Senator Richard Lugar, distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, criticized what he called ``incompetence in the \nadministration'' that has resulted in a failed Iraq reconstruction \neffort.\n  Senator John McCain said:\n\n       We're not winning.\n\n  Senator Lindsey Graham said that we need to be ``more honest about \nhow difficult it will be'' in Iraq.\n  Ironically, the President's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, \nwarned against the folly of invading and occupying Iraq. On February \n28, 1999, speaking to a group of Desert Storm veterans at Fort Myer, \nVA, the former President told them:\n\n       Had we gone into Baghdad--we could have done it, you guys \n     could have done it, could you have been there in 48 hours--\n     and then what?\n\n  Then the first President Bush continued:\n\n       Whose life would be on my hands as commander-in-chief \n     because I unilaterally went beyond international law, went \n     beyond the stated mission, and said we're going to show our \n     macho? We're going into Baghdad. We're going to be an \n     occupying power--America in an Arab land--with no allies at \n     our side. It would have been disastrous.\n\n  That was former President Bush in 1999.\n  Of course, we heard the same prophetic warnings from Brent Scowcroft, \nJames Baker, and other foreign policy experts. But this President Bush \nand his partner Dick Cheney thought they knew better. So now the \ndisaster that Bush 41 warned against has become a reality under Bush \n43. It is painfully clear that President George W. Bush's wrong \nchoices--in particular, the botched hunt for Osama bin Laden, the \ninvasion of Iraq based on false justifications, the Abu Ghraib torture \nscandal, the alienation of our friends and the world--have been \nprofoundly destructive to America's national interest. They have \ndamaged our traditional alliances. They have undermined our moral \nauthority, and they have all but destroyed our credibility.\n  Worst of all, the actions of this administration have had the \nperverse effect of encouraging, inciting, multiplying the terrorist \nthreat. Exhibit A is Osama bin Laden himself. It has been more than 3 \nyears since the President pledged to ``smoke him out'' of his cave. But \nMr. Bush did not smoke out Osama bin Laden. Instead, the Bush \nadministration got massively distracted by its obsession with Saddam \nHussein. These days, the days responsible for the murder of some 3,000 \nAmericans on 9/11 is ``Osama bin forgotten.''\n  In a press conference Secretary Rumsfeld had on September 10 of this \nyear, he mixed up Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden twice. Here is a \nquote from our Secretary of Defense:\n\n       Saddam Hussein, if he is alive, is spending a whale of a \n     lot of time trying to not get caught and we have not seen him \n     on video since 2001.\n\n  Well, Saddam Hussein, as John Stewart pointed out on ``The Daily \nShow'' last night, is in prison. But he said that twice about Saddam \nHussein. You see, in their minds--in Rumsfeld's mind, Osama bin Laden \nand Saddam Hussein are the same person. He cannot quite distinguish \nthem.\n  The problem is Osama bin Laden has not forgotten us. He and his \nfollowers remain as dangerous today as on September 11, 2001. In July, \nthe administration issued a dire warning that bin Laden and his chief \nlieutenants were directing an al-Qaida effort to launch a catastrophic \nattack in the U.S. before the election.\n  There is broader evidence that the U.S. invasion of Iraq has incited, \nencouraged, and stepped up the recruitment of terrorists around the \nworld. In April, the State Department issued its annual report on \nterrorism, claiming a big drop in terrorist incidents--and success in \nthe war on terrorism. But, in June, the State Department acknowledged \nthis report was grossly incorrect. The State Department acknowledged \nthat, in fact, twice as many people died in terrorist attacks in 2003, \nand terrorism around the world has increased significantly.\n  The objective statistical record is clear: As a consequence of \nchoices made by George W. Bush, America is weaker, America is less \nsecure, Americans traveling abroad are less secure, America is more \nvulnerable. And the professionals--the men and women on the front \nlines--know this is true.\n  Earlier this year, the Army War College published a report that \nconcluded, in so many words, that the administration has bungled the \nwar on terrorism. The report called the war in Iraq ``unnecessary.'' It \nsaid Iraq ``was a war-of-choice distraction from the war of necessity \nagainst al-Qaida.'' As a result of this detour, says the report, the \nU.S. Army is ``near the breaking point.''\n  Who can disagree with these findings? With our military tied down in \nIraq indefinitely, unable to respond to real threats, America is \nweaker, not stronger. We are less secure, not more secure. We are more \nvulnerable, not less vulnerable.\n  I was struck, several weeks ago, by a statement from one of our \ncolleagues, Congressman Doug Bereuter of Nebraska. Mr. Bereuter is vice \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a senior Republican \nmember of the House International Relations Committee. Congressman \nBereuter was a strong supporter of the House resolution authorizing the \nPresident to go to war. But in a letter to constituents, he now says \nthe invasion of Iraq was unjustified and ``it was a mistake to launch \nthat military action.'' He said, ``We are immersed in a dangerous, \ncostly mess, and there is no easy and quick way to end our \nresponsibilities in Iraq without creating bigger future problems in the \nregion and, in general, in the Muslim world.''\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will close by saying America is more \nvulnerable, not less; and we need straight answers from this \nadministration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls the next 30 \nminutes. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9404-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9404-S9406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENT BUSH'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request 14 minutes and I ask the Chair \nto notify me when I have reached the 12-minute mark.\n  Lately, we have heard a lot of politically motivated doom-and-gloom \nspeeches, and we have heard a number of them this morning. I want to \ntalk about a couple of issues discussed on the floor. I want to comment \non our economy and I want to comment about our foreign policy.\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\n  I think the economy is doing well. We would like to see it do better \nin some cases, but I think it is very positive news and we should not \nforget about that. The economy, at the first part of this month, posted \njob gains for each of the last 12 months, creating nearly 1.7 million \njobs since August of 2003. These are the facts. The national \nunemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in August, down .9 percentage \nfrom a peak of 6.3 point in June of 2003, and its lowest rate since \nOctober 2001. At 5.4 percent, the unemployment rate is below the \naverage of the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s. In August, 144,000 new jobs \nwere added. Nearly 1.7 million new jobs were added since August 2003. \nThe unemployment rate over the last year was down in all regions and in \n49 of the 50 States. The manufacturing sector, which was the hardest \nhit by the economic downturn, has added 107,000 jobs since January.\n  View that in the perspective of what we were facing when this \nPresident was first elected to office. We have turned this economy \naround. This President has taken strong action that made a difference \nin moving our economy forward. Now is not the time to turn back. The \nlabor market has improved considerably since shortly after the \nPresident's jobs and growth bill took effect last May. America's \nstandard of living is on the rise. Real aftertax incomes are up by \nnearly 10 percent since December of 2000. Consumer confidence continues \nto be substantially higher than last year.\n  In the second quarter of 2004, the national home ownership rate was \nat an all-time high of 69.2 percent. Minority home ownership set a new \nrecord of 51 percent in the second quarter and is up 2.1 percentage \npoints from a year ago. I am proud to say that I was a Senator who \nsponsored that legislation to encourage home ownership among \nminorities. Core inflation remains low, and mortgage rates remain near \nhistoric lows, making home buying easier and more affordable.\n  We still have a challenge ahead of us and this President is not \nbacking away from it. I don't think we Republicans in the Senate are \nbacking away. We continue to push to make tax relief permanent. The \ntemporary tax relief contributed to the figures I just read off. We \nneed to do more. I think one of the most important things we can do to \ncontinue to see the economy grow is to make tax relief permanent. We \nobviously need to provide training for worker skills and control health \ncosts, and we need to reduce regulations. We have not talked enough \nabout the burden of Government and the downward pressure it has on the \neconomy. We need to reduce regulations. As a small businessman I had to \nlive with regulations. I understand how high taxes and a high rate of \nregulation can impact your ability to do business and create new jobs. \nFrivolous lawsuits are a problem and this Congress needs to address it. \nWe need to adopt a national energy policy and open more jobs overseas.\n  The President has acted decisively to bring us back from recession to \nrecovery. I don't think I need to go over those issues. The basic part \nof it was that he has cut taxes. By cutting taxes, he stimulated the \neconomy, which increased revenue to Colorado, and we are going to have \nincreased revenue to the Federal Government.\n  Let me talk a little bit about foreign policy. A year ago last \nFebruary, President Bush made the courageous decision to overthrow \nSaddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship and bring democracy to Iraq. He \ndid so because Saddam Hussein had refused, over the last 12 years, to \nfully cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. He did so because Saddam \nHussein had brutalized his people for over 25 years. He did so because \nit was the right thing to do and because it had to be done.\n\n  Some of our friends in the United Nations did not approve of his \ndecision. They thought he should have waited; that perhaps Saddam would \ngive in and eventually cooperate, despite his long history of lies and \ndeception.\n  A few friends, such as U.S. Secretary General Kofi Annan, believed \nthe United States should have sought another Security Council \nresolution. It appears Mr. Annan continues to believe this, given his \nremarks last week in which he described the liberation of Iraq as \n``illegal'' and that violated the charter of the United Nations.\n  Even with the benefit of hindsight, it does not make any more sense \nnow than it did then for the United States to have sought a second \nresolution. Resolution 1441 was the 17th--17th--Security Council \nresolution demanding that Saddam Hussein verifiably disarm, respect his \nneighbors, and otherwise comply with the cease-fire from the first Gulf \nWar. It was clear that he violated Resolution 1441 and that he \ncontinued to try to shoot down U.S. warplanes in the United Nations-\nsanctioned northern fly zone and that he was making little or no effort \nto comply with the terms of the 1991 cease-fire. How many more security \nresolutions do we need before it becomes legal?\n  As the Wall Street Journal has eloquently pointed out, if liberating \nIraq was wrong, then Mr. Annan must also believe a number of other \noperations are illegal. Does the Secretary believe NATO's intervention \nin Kosovo, where hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavian Albanians were \nsaved from the genocidal attacks of Milosevic's cronies, was illegal? \nDoes he believe France's recent intervention in the Ivory Coast was \nillegal?\n  It is my hope that when the President speaks today to the United \nNations, he reminds the United Nations that the United States has the \ninherent right of self-defense guaranteed by that body's own charter. \nIt is my hope that with unequivocal certainty, the President reminds \nthe United Nations that his first obligation as President of the United \nStates under our Constitution is to protect our Nation from all \nthreats, foreign and domestic.\n  It is my hope that the President reminds the world's greatest \ndebating body that if the United States had not acted, Saddam Hussein \nwould still be defying the United Nations, would still be seeking to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction, and would still be brutally \nmurdering and torturing his own people.\n  From my perspective, the United Nations should be grateful for the \ndecisive leadership and courage President Bush demonstrated by \nliberating Iraq. It seems to me that the United Nations should be \ngrateful that it now has a real opportunity to help bring democracy and \nfreedom to 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I believe the President made the right decision. He took a stand and \ndid not back down. He held up the value of the Security Council \nresolutions at a time when most were content to see these resolutions \nignored.\n  The President emphasized the value of the lives of the innocent \nIraqis who were repeatedly tortured and routinely murdered when most \nchose to look the other way. He sought to protect our country and \nsafeguard international peace when most refused to act.\n  The President today will ask our friends in the United Nations to \nhelp us in Iraq. That body has a unique opportunity to do something \nextraordinary. They have a limited opportunity to help a nation that \nhas experienced nothing but dictatorship and brutality transition to a \nfreedom-inspired country centered on the rule of law and the democratic \nprocess.\n\n  This coming January, Iraq will hold its first ever national \nelections. I recognize the practical difficulties of such an effort. We \nare constantly reminded by the media that Iraqi insurgents continue to \nlaunch suicide attacks and kill innocent hostages in new and grotesque \nways.\n  It is certainly possible that things will get worse in Iraq before \nthey get better. That does not mean we give up. It does not mean that \nthe majority of Iraqis do not desire freedom.\n  This Thursday, the Iraqi Prime Minister will address a joint meeting \nof Congress. This speech is more than a reminder that Iraq has a \nfunctioning government. It is a statement to Iraqi insurgents that the \nbusiness of promoting freedom will go on. It is a statement to the \nworld that the Iraqi Government is the representative of the Iraqi \npeople.\n  I look forward to Prime Minister Allawi's speech. I believe he will \nbring us new insight into the problems facing Iraq and encourage the \nAmerican people in the ongoing struggle.\n  The United States is making a difference. Iraq is rebuilding. \nInsurgents are being fought with steadfastness and courage. And Iraq \nremains on the path toward freedom. We ask for nothing more.\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\n  I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9406-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9406-S9409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Colorado talked about \nthe economy. Although I want to talk about Iraq, I want to follow up \nthe comments made by the very distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwho talked about all the negative things that are happening to this \neconomy.\n  I find it so stunning that folks can continue to be so negative. \nAmerica has come such a long way from the attacks of 9/11 that took a \ntrillion dollars out of this economy, and the corporate fraud generated \nfrom Enron and WorldCom, and from the recession President Bush \ninherited from the last administration. We cut taxes and we grew jobs, \nover 1.7 million in the last year.\n  We are not where we have to be. The President has said on many \noccasions that as long as one person is out of work, we have work to \ndo, and we do that work and do it here, passing legislation such as \nclass action reform, medical malpractice reform, the JOBS bill and the \nEnergy bill, many of the legislation being filibustered, being blocked \nby my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  One point that comes up again and again is that in spite of the \nsteady stream of job numbers, now there is an argument made they are \nnot quality jobs. I note that the facts belie that assertion. Three-\nquarters of the new jobs created, for instance, in May were in the \nindustry categories that pay an hourly rate in excess of the overall \naverage hourly rate in the private sector.\n  Inflation-adjusted hourly earnings increased 2.37 percent during the \nfirst 3\\1/2\\ years of the Bush administration, compared with only a \n0.13-percent increase during the same period of time in the first \nClinton administration. Per capita aftertax disposable income adjusted \nfor inflation has increased 7.1 percent since President Bush took \noffice, well above the 5.2-percent increase during the same period of \nthe first Clinton administration.\n\n  I could go on and on. The fact is, this economy is moving forward. \nThe fact is, housing home ownership is at an all-time high. The fact \nis, the tax cuts have made a difference, and yesterday there are still \nthose who would like to somehow have the American public believe that \nall news is bad news.\n  I think the biggest challenge this economy faces is from the \nnaysayers who keep saying again and again how bleak things are and you \nthen undermine confidence and that, Mr. President, hurts the economy.\n\n\n                        ``60 Minutes'' Documents\n\n  One other note. My friend, the Senator from Iowa, was on the floor, \nand I note that he and a number of others had some very harsh words \nabout the President based on something that was in a ``60 Minutes'' \nreport which we now know was not true. Dan Rather came on last night \nand noted that he no longer has confidence in the documents that would \nallow us to continue vouching for them. These are documents related to \nthe service of the President in the National Guard. He noted that ``we \ndid use the documents.'' He said, ``We made a mistake in judgment, and \nfor that I am sorry.''\n  I hope my colleagues, who had such harsh words for the President \nbased on those documents, will come forward and express the same \nsentiment that Mr. Rather expressed.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  My colleagues also somehow would have us believe the world would be \nbetter today, would be a safer place if Saddam Hussein were still in \npower. I find that stunning. I find that striking.\n  My colleague from Colorado expressed a hope that I share: That the \nPresident go before the U.N. today and reiterate the inherent right of \nthe United States of self-defense.\n  My colleague from Colorado challenged some of the statements of \nSecretary General Kofi Annan about the U.S. effort in Iraq. He noted \nand I note that the Secretary's comments were both factually wrong and \nill advised. The fact is, Saddam Hussein violated 16 U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions. Saddam Hussein is the one whose actions were \nillegal, reiterated again and again by the United Nations. The fact is, \nthe United States took our case to the United Nations on more than one \noccasion, and the final example on November 8, 2002, the U.N. Security \nCouncil unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1441.\n  This resolution declared that Iraq was in material breach of its \nobligations to cooperate with inspectors who were looking into Saddam's \nefforts to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n  The resolution warned of serious consequences if Iraq ignored its \nlast chance to comply, but Saddam did not comply. I repeat, Saddam \nHussein is the one whose actions were illegal. The fact is, Saddam \nHussein's list of other offenses is a long one and does not compare \nfavorably with documents such as the U.N. charter and the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This is a man who twice invaded his \nneighbors, used weapons of mass destruction against his own people and \nthe people of Iran, who killed tens of thousands of political \nopponents, tortured thousands of political opponents and ordinary \ncitizens. These were the illegal actions, and we should be glad they \nare all over once and for all.\n  The fact is, the U.N. did not have credibility with Saddam Hussein's \nregime. It never succeeded in enforcing its own resolutions or gaining \nunfettered access for weapons inspectors. Worse yet, it allowed a well-\nmeaning humanitarian program to devolve into a money-making operation \nfor Saddam and his cronies throughout the world. The U.N. Oil for Food \nProgram became a personal bank account for Saddam Hussein in which, by \na GAO report estimate, he got at least $10 billion--that is with a \n``B''--for his own personal use.\n  Right now, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, is looking into that $10 billion theft, that $10 billion fraud, \nthat $10 billion corruption, and checking to see where that money went, \nhas it been used to fuel an insurgency, has it been used to impact the \npolicies of some nation states that did not allow the Security Council \nto vigorously oversee and enforce that program the way it should have \nbeen done.\n  No, there is nothing wrong or illegal about liberating 25 million \npeople from tyranny, and there is certainly nothing illegal about \nfighting for their freedom and liberty today.\n  Regardless of the U.N. Secretary General's comments, America will \nremain a supporter of the U.N. and many multilateral organizations. It \nis in our interest. More often than not, we can accomplish greatness \nwhen we work together. The U.N. can offer great promise or cooperation \nin peacekeeping and humanitarian work and shining a light in dark \nplaces, efforts that are often more effective when many are united \nrather than when countries go it alone. But we are not going it alone \nin Iraq. We have over 30 nations that are sacrificing with us. The \nfailure of the United Nations to enforce its resolutions against \nSaddam, the failure of the United Nations to act vigorously to genocide \nthat is going on in Darfur and the far region of Sudan, the failure of \nthe United Nations to do nothing more than talk when brutality and \noppression shows its ugly face around the world undermines confidence \nin the United Nations. That puts the United Nations in a position where \nmany are comparing it now to the League of Nations, a place where \npeople just talked but never acted. Sometimes real leadership means \nhaving the courage to do what is necessary and not just what is \npopular.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President said there is a \ndifference between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting \nto the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip \nto defend the security of our country. While the United States and its \nallies have carried the burden of freedom's work, we cannot ignore the \nfact that soldiers and might cannot do the job alone. I understand that \ndiplomacy is crucial to world order. It should not descend into finger-\npointing and gainsaying, especially at a time when so much is at stake \nand we ought to be joining together, not pointing fingers. It is the \nterrorists in Iraq who want to deprive the citizens of that country \ntheir basic human rights.\n  What Saddam Hussein could not take from them the terrorists are \nhoping to\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\nsteal. What Saddam Hussein did not do to terrorize the people of that \ncountry, what he did not finish, the terrorists will do and are doing. \nThey are continuing that. Saddam killed, murdered, and tortured as many \nIraqis he could who did not agree with him, and probably a few who did, \nand the terrorists hope to finish off the Iraqis he did not get to.\n  In spite of that, in spite of the insipid rhetoric of those who wish \nto be President who feel a gust of wind gives them the moral authority \nto change their stand on a war time and time again, America must hold \nits ground because on that ground stands the promise of a free and \nliberated Iraq.\n  Iraq is preparing to hold its first truly democratic election. Prime \nMinister Allawi, who will have a chance to address us in the coming \ndays, is working to get control throughout the country. He is trying to \ncounter a clear effort by terrorists to turn Iraq back into a nation of \nfear.\n  The Prime Minister is also trying to get out from under Iraq's heavy \nforeign debt and create an environment for jobs and for hope. Coalition \nmembers, together with Iraqi forces, are working daily to create a \nbetter future for the people of Iraq, and at the same time protect the \nsafety of our soldiers and civilians serving in that country.\n  The world is a better place without Saddam in power. That is a \nreality. If one cannot grasp that concept, then they cannot grasp any \nconcept. If anyone in this body, or anyone of this body, believes \nSaddam Hussein, dictator of Iraq, murderer of women and children, \ntormentor of his neighbors, plotter of destruction, mercenary of the \nworld, is better for the world in office than out of office, they \nshould heed the words of the junior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, who had this to say during the Democratic primaries:\n\n       Those who doubted whether Iraq or the world would be better \n     off without Saddam Hussein, and those who believe we are not \n     safer with his capture, don't have the judgment to be the \n     President or the credibility to be elected president.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was right then. In spite of his \nchanging positions, those words last year still ring true today.\n  Today, there are those who embolden terrorists in Iraq. They have \npointed their fingers at us and said: You are to blame for the \nterrorism insurgency in Iraq.\n  The day after 9/11, there were those across the world who pointed \ntheir fingers at us and said: You are to blame for the destruction of \nyour homeland.\n  These statements are absurd. Somebody tell me how the hundreds of \nhorrified boys, girls, babies, mothers, and fathers in that Russian \nschool were responsible for the terrorists who tormented and killed \nthem. Somebody tell me how the Nepalese contractors, 12 of them, who \nwere slaughtered as though they were nothing more than cattle were \nresponsible for their deaths. Somebody tell me how the American \ncitizens who had their heads sawed off on a videotape while sick, evil \nmen listened to their screams of horror were somehow responsible for \ntheir death.\n  There are those who say things are not going as well as they could be \nin Iraq. We know they are right, but let the first person come forward \nwho will say that it will be going better in Iraq if we let Mohamed al \nSadr or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi be in charge.\n  Now is not the time for those with the courage of the meek to come to \nthe rescue of the strong. Now is the time for strong, determined \nleadership to work with our allies, those who agreed with our efforts, \nand those who did not, to bring this world together.\n  Our President, the leader who has liberated 50 million human beings \nand has stood resolute when even the strongest among us would look for \na way out, goes to the U.N. today. He goes there not as an adversary of \nthat august body but as an ally of the civilized world. He goes to \nstand with the world, those who have suffered from the terrorists, \nthose who have fought them, and those who fear them.\n  He goes to the U.N. not preaching the gospel of global despair but of \nthe obligation of a mighty nation to not only fight those with guns \nwith guns, but to bring peace to so many others who simply hope and \npray that their children will live to see a better day.\n  He will stand with those who stood with us in the liberation of Iraq, \nand with those who stood against us, because this President knows that \nas important as it is to sometimes lead even when others are not \nprepared to follow, it is important to walk together when many will \nagree to do so.\n  It is important for us to mind the words of China's U.N. Ambassador, \nwho opposed the war, who said:\n\n       I think all of us have views on the Iraqi war. I think \n     definitely the views are different among council members. \n     What is important now is to help achieve peace and stability \n     in that country.\n\n  There will be better days in Iraq, and there will be worse days. \nThere will be better days in the war on terror and, God willing, there \nwill be far fewer worse days. But whatever the future brings, we must \nstand with this President and with this nation and its soldiers and \ndiplomats, and we must on bended knee pray that our efforts bear the \nfruit of a more prosperous and more peaceful world.\n  Let me finish with this. Yesterday, I missed my first major vote as a \nMember of this body. At home, before I left Minnesota for Washington, I \nattended the wake of the son of one of the folks who works in my \noffice, one of my staff, Bart Cedergren. His son David died in Iraq.\n  While the cause of death remains unclear, let there be no doubt that \nhe died in the cause of freedom and liberty for the people of Iraq and \nthe people of America.\n  As I stood there contemplating the loss of the life of this young man \nand the loss of his life from those who loved him, as I stood there \ntrying to comfort a father who did more to comfort me and those around \nhim, I was once again reminded of the fact that freedom is never free.\n  Petty Officer 3rd class David A. Cedergren, 25, who was assigned to \nthe Second Marine Division Marine Forces Atlantic, did not join the \nmilitary to fight war or kill people. He joined it to bring peace and \ncomfort to those afflicted and tormented. David was a medic. He was \ntrained to be a licensed nurse, his heart was filled with compassion. \nYesterday, as I watched those whom he loved and those who loved him and \nhis Navy comrades who stood there side by side, all grieved in his \npassing, I saw in their grief great pride in this young man. He liked \nthis Nation. He did not join this war on terror to fight a war of \nkiller people. He didn't ask for this war to be fought. We joined it \nand we lead it to bring peace and comfort to the afflicted and the \ntormented. May God bless America and David Cedergren and that we \nprevail.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the \nRepublican time in this morning session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the next 60 minutes of morning business for \ndebate only is under the control of the Democratic leader or his \ndesignee and the final 60 minutes under the control of the majority \nleader or his designee.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I been allotted under the \nagreement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I saw this morning in the Hill newspaper \nan attack by the Speaker in which he said, in response to a reporter's \nquestion, that ``al-Qaida would operate better if Kerry were elected \nPresident.''\n  Two weeks ago today, the Vice President said, ``It is absolutely \nessential that eight weeks from today on November 2 we make the right \nchoice because if we make the wrong choice\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\nthen the danger is that we will get hit again and we will be hit in a \nway that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United \nStates.''\n  Mr. President, this is dangerous talk. It is dangerous talk for \neither side to suggest we will be attacked if the other is elected. I \nremind my Republican friends that when we were attacked on September \n11, we on the Democratic side did not say it was because Republicans \nwere in control. That would have been wrong. We did not do that. \nInstead, we stood shoulder to shoulder, we stood united, we all agreed \non an attack on Afghanistan, and we all supported an all-out attack on \nal-Qaida because it was al-Qaida that attacked the United States.\n  The President of the United States, when he was running for office, \nsaid he would be a uniter and not a divider. But now this President and \nthis administration are dividing us in the most fundamental way. I \nbelieve that is a dangerous tact. It is a mistake.\n  Only the President of the United States can stop this kind of talk. I \nurge him to do so, to rein in the Vice President, to rein in the \nSpeaker, because when this election is over, we need to stand united.\n  The debate we need to have is how best to defend our Nation from \nterrorist attack. It is important for us to recall what happened on \nSeptember 11. When we saw these images of the attack on the World Trade \nCenter, when we saw the smoke rising from the Pentagon, we were under \nattack. But it is important for us to remember who attacked us. It was \nnot Iraq. The attackers were al-Qaida led by Osama bin Laden, not Iraq \nled by Saddam Hussein. As evil as Saddam Hussein was and is, he was not \npart of the September 11 attack. Here is the man who should be the \ntarget, the primary target of the United States. This is Osama bin \nLaden, the leader of al-Qaida. Al-Qaida are the ones who attacked the \nUnited States. Al-Qaida are the ones we have a responsibility to bring \nto account.\n  President Bush said in convening his Cabinet at Camp David just a few \ndays after the 9/11 attacks, ``There is no question about it, this act \nwill not stand. We will find those who did it. We will smoke them out \nof their holes. We will get them running and we will bring them to \njustice.'' That is what President Bush said just days after the 9/11 \nattack. It is now 1106 days after that attack--1106 days after the \nattack on the country, and we have still not gotten Osama bin Laden. We \nstill have not kept the primary focus on al-Qaida. Instead, the \nPresident diverted our attention and launched an attack on Iraq.\n  This is from the March 29 edition of USA Today. It says this:\n\n       In 2002 troops from the 5th Special Forces group who \n     specialized in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt \n     for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish cultures.\n\n  Mr. President, let's get this straight. It was not Iraq that attacked \nus. It was al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is led by Osama bin Laden, not Saddam \nHussein. And yet this administration shifted the focus from going after \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida and instead shifted special forces to the \nhunt for Saddam Hussein. He replaced those special forces in \nAfghanistan with units that were experts in Spanish culture.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The CIA meanwhile was stretched badly in its capacity to \n     collect, translate and analyze information coming from \n     Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it \n     took specialists away from Afghanistan to ensure Iraq was \n     covered.\n\n  The former Secretary of Navy in the Reagan administration says this \nwas one of the biggest blunders, strategic blunders in modern memory. \nWe attacked the wrong target. That is his conclusion. That is the \nSecretary of Navy in the Reagan administration saying we attacked the \nwrong target. We have to have a debate in this country about how best \nto defend America. The first thing we have to get straight is who \nattacked us and who is preparing to attack us again. It was al-Qaida, \nnot Iraq.\n  There were no Iraqis on board the planes that attacked on September \n11--not one. There is no evidence that Iraq was behind the attack on \nSeptember 11. It was al-Qaida led by Osama bin Laden.\n  This administration has diverted its attention from finishing \nbusiness with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and diverted our resources, \ndiverted our attention to Iraq and Saddam Hussein. I believe that was a \nmistake.\n  I voted against authorizing this administration to launch this attack \nbecause, as I said on the night of our vote, I did not believe it was \nin the national security interest of the United States to attack Iraq \nand open up a second front before we finished with the first. The first \nhad to be with the people who attacked us; that was al-Qaida led by \nOsama bin Laden, not Iraq led by Saddam Hussein.\n  This is an article that appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer last \nyear. It says:\n\n       Some senior officials concede that the Iraq war also \n     diverted resources from two problems that could prove to be \n     even more pressing than Iraq was: Rooting out the remnants of \n     Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorism network and confronting \n     Iran. A senior intelligence official who spoke on condition \n     of anonymity said that the CIA reassigned to Iraq more than \n     half of the operatives tracking al-Qaida in Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan. As a result, U.S. forces were not able to pursue \n     bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders as aggressively.\n\n  I believe this is a strategic mistake of significant proportion. \nAgain, our primary target has to be al-Qaida led by Osama bin Laden. \nInstead, the President shifted resources from the hunt for Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida to a hunt for Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n  Again, as bad and as evil as Saddam Hussein was and is, he should not \nhave been the primary target of the American military. Instead, we \nshould have focused, I believe, like a laser on the people who attacked \nus and who are planning to attack us again; that is, al-Qaida led by \nOsama bin Laden.\n  This article concludes saying:\n\n       Al-Qaida's continuing threat has shown that the Department \n     of Homeland Security raised its terrorism alert level Tuesday \n     after bombings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco.\n\n  It is not just these articles. It is not just intelligence officials. \nWe look to the Bush administration's own Web site, the State Department \nWeb site. This is very interesting. Thirty days after the September 11 \nattack, the State Department had this on their Web site:\n\n       Countries where al-Qaida has operated--\n       This is 30 days after the attack on the United States. This \n     is on the State Department's Web site. Here are the countries \n     they list where al-Qaida was active. They list Albania, \n     Algeria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bosnia, India, and Iran. There is \n     no Iraq. There is no Iraq. There is no Iraq. This is a report \n     signed by the President. This is after the attack. There is \n     no mention of Iraq being a locale for al-Qaida.\n\n  But it is not just the State Department. The President himself tried \nto correct the record last year after the Vice President was asserting \nand I think fundamentally confusing people suggesting that Iraq and al-\nQaida were involved in the September 11 attacks.\n  The President seeking to correct ``reports no evidence of Hussein tie \nto 9/11.''\n  In the article, it says:\n\n       President Bush said today that he had seen no evidence that \n     Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 terrorist \n     attacks, as the White House tried to correct an assertion \n     that Vice President Cheney left extremely murky on Sunday. \n     Mr. Cheney on Meet the Press was asked about polls that \n     showed a majority of Americans believe that Mr. Hussein had \n     been involved in the attack.\n\n  This is what Mr. Cheney said: ``I think it is not surprising that \npeople make that connection.''\n  Asked whether the connection existed, Mr. Cheney said: ``We don't \nknow. He described Mr. Hussein's reported connections to al-Qaida, \nconnections that American intelligence analysts say were not very deep. \nMr. Bush, asked by a reporter today about that statement, said: ``No. \nWe have had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved in September \n11, a far more definitive statement than the Vice President's.''\n  That doesn't end the evidence. The evidence is powerful with respect \nto the question of who is behind September 11. It was al-Qaida led by \nOsama bin Laden, not Iraq led by Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 bipartisan \ncommission said this:\n\n       The intelligence reports describe friendly contact and \n     indicate some common themes on both sides, ``hatred of the \n     United States.'' But to date we have seen no evidence that \n     these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a \n     collaborative operational relationship,\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\n     nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated \n     with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out attacks against \n     the United States.\n\n  That is the report of the 9/11 Commission.\n  It doesn't end there. The Secretary of State was just recently on \n``Meet the Press.'' This was in the early days of this month. He said \nhe ``had seen nothing that makes a direct connection between Saddam \nHussein and that awful regime and what happened on 9/11.''\n  We have all kinds of evidence that al-Qaida was not linked to Iraq in \nthe September 11 attacks or that Iraq was not a link to al-Qaida in the \nSeptember 11 attacks. The evidence is overwhelming that al-Qaida, led \nby Osama bin Laden, led those attacks.\n  I believe deeply that our strategy must be to focus like a laser on \nthose who attacked us. We ought not to allow ourselves to get diverted \ninto this attack on Iraq. We have 10 times America's resources in Iraq \nas we have in Afghanistan.\n  We are 1106 days after the attacks on this country and the President \nhas failed to do what he said he would do in holding al-Qaida and Osama \nbin Laden to account. Osama bin Laden is still at large. His top \nadviser, al-Zawahiri, is at large. This murderous ally of theirs \nbeheaded an American yesterday, and we have diverted resources from the \nhunt from those monsters to go after Saddam Hussein in Iraq when the \nevidence is overwhelming that Iraq was not involved in the September 11 \nattack.\n  What doesn't add up here? What doesn't make sense? The Secretary of \nthe Navy in the Reagan administration says we attacked the wrong \ntarget. I believe that is correct. We should have kept our focus on \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida and not have been diverted to Saddam \nHussein and Iraq.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that there is additional evidence as \nwell. Our own Intelligence Committee has made findings. For example, \nConclusion 96 of the Senate Intelligence Committee says:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency's assessment that to date \n     there was no evidence proving Iraqi complicity or assistance \n     in an al-Qaida attack was reasonable and objective.\n\n  That is our Intelligence Committee led by Republicans on a bipartisan \nbasis concluding there wasn't complicity by al-Qaida and Iraq, that \nthere was not Iraqi complicity or assistance in an al-Qaida attack. Our \nIntelligence Committee concluded that was reasonable and objective.\n\n  Similarly, conclusion 93 says:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency reasonably assessed that \n     there were likely several instances of contacts between Iraq \n     and al-Qaida throughout the 1990s, but that these contacts \n     did not add up to an established, formal relationship.\n\n  If we are going to be effective in this war on terror, we have to get \nthe facts right. The facts are, al-Qaida attacked America, not Iraq. \nThe facts are, we are 1106 days after that attack, and Osama bin Laden \nand his chief lieutenants are still out there threatening America and \nAmericans. This President diverted our attention and our resources from \nrunning down al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden to an attack on Iraq and \nSaddam Hussein. That was a mistake, and the sooner we admit to it and \nthe sooner we get about the business of tracking down those who \nattacked us, the better off our country will be and the safer we will \nbe. That is my strong, deep belief. Whoever wins this election, I \nbelieve we have to reorient the resources of America into going after \nthose who attacked us. It was al-Qaida, not Iraq. It was al-Qaida, led \nby Osama bin Laden, not Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein. That is what our \n9/11 Commission tells us. That is what the Secretary of State is \nsaying. That is what the intelligence agencies are telling us. Yet this \nadministration--this administration--made a series of decisions, \nprofound decisions, decisions of enormous consequence, and diverted \nresources and attention from going after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida \nto going after Saddam Hussein and Iraq.\n  I know many people believe, despite all the evidence to the contrary, \nthat somehow Iraq was deeply involved in the September 11 attack. There \nis just no evidence to support that. My own conclusion was, and is, \nthis was the wrong war at the wrong time. And the overriding obligation \nof those of us who are in a position to affect U.S. decisionmaking--the \noverriding obligation and responsibility that we have--is to defend \nthis country and to do so effectively.\n  We know al-Qaida is plotting, right now, to again attack our country. \nWe ought to focus like a laser on stopping them. We ought to focus like \na laser on holding al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden to account. We should \nnever have shifted our resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden and \nal-Qaida leaders to the hunt for Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It was a \nmistake, and we have to be big enough to say it was a mistake and move \non and remember who it was that attacked us and use the awesome \nresources of this country to go after those who are plotting to attack \nus again.\n  We have to get these facts right. We have to reduce the confusion out \nhere, when a majority of the American people thinks Iraq was behind the \nattacks of September 11 and we know full well that is not the case.\n  The President and Vice President of the United States have a heavy \nresponsibility. They are the leaders of this country. They are the \nleaders of the free world. They have an obligation, a solemn \nobligation, to make certain that the United States focuses on those who \nattacked us--not to confuse the issue, not to distract us from those \nwho are responsible for the loss of nearly 3,000 American lives.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to talk about these things when you are \njust weeks before an election and not have a political component to the \ndebate and the discussion. But we, I believe, as a nation, need to have \na full and vigorous debate on how we best defend this Nation. My strong \nbelief is that we need to keep the focus on the people who attacked \nAmerica on September 11, and it was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, \nnot Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein. The evidence is overwhelming.\n  We need to refocus the efforts of the awesome American military on \nhunting down Osama bin Laden, on hunting down his chief allies and \nholding them to account. That is the best way to send a signal of \nAmerican resolve and determination and American unwillingness to accept \nthe vicious attack on our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There are time allocations that have been assigned for the remaining \n27 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes if there is time \navailable. If not, I would appreciate it if the Chair could indicate \nwho has been designated the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota has 10 \nminutes, and the Senator from Arkansas has 15 minutes of the time. \nThere is 26 minutes remaining, but of those, 25 has been allocated.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is my understanding, through staff, that Senator \nLincoln will not be coming to the floor at this time. So if there is no \nobjection, I ask unanimous consent to use the time of the Senator from \nArkansas. And if she comes to the floor, I will certainly yield to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9409-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9409-S9411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the announcement of a \ndramatic increase in the Medicare Part B premium for seniors and the \nconcern the people of Michigan have about trying to pay a 17.5-percent \npremium increase for next year. Just a day after President Bush touted \nhis efforts to help our seniors and the disabled cope with increased \nmedical expenses, his administration announced the largest premium \nincrease in Medicare's history, dating back to 1965.\n  Unfortunately, nothing has been done about record increases in the \ncost of health care over the last 4 years. Now we see the largest \npremium increase, a 17.5-percent increase. We have\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\nseen it consistently going up since 2001. It is time to say enough is \nenough.\n  Seniors are only going to see about a 3-percent increase in their \nSocial Security cost of living. Yet the Part B premium comes directly \nout of that track. So instead of getting at least a 3-percent increase \nto help pay for food and the mortgage and utility bills, prescription \ndrugs and so on, they will actually see a reduction of 14.5 percent in \nwhat they receive through Social Security.\n  This is absolutely unacceptable. Unfortunately, instead of helping, \nCongress and this administration have pushed through a Medicare plan \nabout which CMS Administrator McClellan has acknowledged that about a \nsixth of this year's premium increase results from the billions that \nMedicare is paying private health plans to encourage them to offer \nprivate health insurance. So what we see are conscious decisions that \nwe made that have caused this increase to be as high as it is. I \nbelieve they were the wrong decisions, the wrong choices.\n  It doesn't make sense and it is not fair that the millions of seniors \nwho enjoy and want to stay in traditional Medicare--about 89 percent of \nseniors right now have chosen traditional Medicare over Medicare+Choice \nor being in an HMO--have to subsidize the big private health insurance \ncompanies and HMOs and the 11 percent of the seniors and disabled who \nhave the ability or have the choice, even, to be in an HMO.\n  Moreover, we have heard time and time again that the private plans \nare less efficient than traditional Medicare. I have shown charts on \nthe floor as we have debated the Medicare prescription drug bill. We \nhave seen the Congressional Budget Office analysis. In fact, we heard \nit again last week when the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \nreported that CMS pays Medicare private health plans an average of 107 \npercent of what it costs to care for the same beneficiaries under \ntraditional fee-for-service programs.\n  At a time when we are looking at great concerns about the long-term \nsolvency of Medicare, looking at these huge increases that have \noccurred for seniors related to the premiums for Medicare, we are \nhearing from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that CMS is \npaying private plans an average of 107 percent of what it costs to care \nfor beneficiaries under traditional Medicare.\n  This makes absolutely no sense, no matter how you look at it. \nAccording to the report, Medicare payments to private plans cost 16 \npercent to 23 percent more than traditional plans. So, basically, we \ncan be spending up to 23 percent more on the approach of privatizing \nMedicare. That is what it is; this is a strategy to privatize Medicare, \nwhich the majority of seniors have not asked for, they have not chosen, \nand they don't want; and the icing on the cake is it costs up to 23 \npercent more.\n  I ask, if HMOs are so much better and more efficient, why do they \nneed the extra dollars? I am certainly not opposed to HMOs. I have \nparticipated in the past, as my mother has, when she was on Medicare \nand when Medicare HMO was available in our community. She got dropped, \nunfortunately, when they chose to leave. Certainly, this is not a \ndiscussion about whether HMOs provide an important service or quality \nservice.\n  My concern is, within the context of Medicare, why, if they are so \nmuch better and more efficient, are we providing them more money? The \ndebate on privatization was that somehow Medicare is going broke, the \ntrust fund is going to run out of money; therefore, we have to \nprivatize Medicare. And exactly the opposite result has occurred as we \nhave begun to privatize Medicare. Premiums for seniors are going up \nfaster than at any other time in our history. We hear from independent \nreports that it costs anywhere from 16 percent to 23 percent more to \nprivatize Medicare than to keep it the way it is. With higher \nadministrative costs, in fact, private plans are more costly than \nregular Medicare. So we are told they need subsidies because it costs \nmore to administer them.\n  Again, the whole point is to be more efficient, stretch the dollars \nfarther, lower costs, so we can provide better prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors and other kinds of preventive care they need, and \nthat Medicare remains solvent and healthy for the future. Older \nAmericans are staggering under the relentless increases in the cost of \ntheir health care and prescription drugs. We have all heard the \nstories. More older Americans will face harsh choices in meeting basic \nneeds of health, food, housing, and paying utility bills. Meeting those \nchallenges will be even more difficult as percentage increases in \nMedicare premiums greatly outpace the increases for Social Security. \nThe increase will be especially painful because Social Security \npayments again are expected to rise less than 3 percent. I say \n``expected'' because we don't know how much or how little Social \nSecurity payments will be yet.\n  Yet, this year, this administration decided to release the Medicare \nnumbers the Friday right before Labor Day, right before the weekend \nwhen the news was focused on a hurricane. That is some holiday for \nmillions of seniors who have labored their whole lives. We learned the \nOMB moved up the release of this huge increase by 6 weeks. In fact, we \nhear today in an article that the internal administration memo reveals \nthat the unprecedented 17-percent increase in Medicare premiums seniors \nwill pay in 2005 was scheduled for release October 22. It was scheduled \nfor release on October 22, along with Social Security COLA payments.\n  Obviously, somebody looked at this and said: This is the largest \nincrease in the history of the program. We want to make sure it is done \nas quietly as possible. So they chose the Friday before the Labor Day \nweekend, late in the afternoon, in the middle of a hurricane, to \nrelease the numbers.\n\n  OMB received the premium notice from HHS on September 1 and cleared \nit for release only 2 days later. As I said, for the last at least 10 \nyears, they have done it in October along with Social Security.\n  We are not going to only talk about premium increases here today. We \nhave the ability to do something about it. I am proud to be doing \nsomething about this, saying enough is enough; the portion of this that \ncomes from privatizing Medicare needs to be removed and we need to put \nthese premiums back in line with Social Security.\n  We know health care costs are going up for everyone--every family and \nevery business. In a larger sense, we need to be addressing that as \nwell, which we can do with the cost of prescription drugs. We can bring \nit to the floor and pass an effort to open the border and lower the \ncosts in half by allowing pharmacists to do business safely with \npharmacists in Canada and other places. There are other strategies. \nThere are things we can do to address the broader issue of health care \nand we need to be doing them.\n  But while this is happening, we should not be saying to our seniors, \nsaying to someone on Medicare, that instead of addressing these issues, \nwe are going to require you to pay an extra-large increase because of a \npolicy made here to privatize Medicare that, in the face of all \nevidence, shows the administrative costs are higher and the costs of \nproviding the kinds of care are higher. We now have one more report \nsaying that. In the face of all objective evidence, the Congress and \nthe President have moved forward to want to privatize Medicare, anyway, \nsaying it will lower prices, when in fact it has resulted in the \nlargest premium increase for seniors and the disabled in the history of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  I believe this is wrong. So I have introduced S. 2780, Keeping the \nPromise of Medicare Act, with 11 of my colleagues. My bill would cap \nthe Part B premium at the same level as the cost-of-living adjustment \nso that seniors do not see real cuts in their Social Security benefits. \nIn other words, we would at least keep seniors whole, moving in the \nright direction while we deal with these other issues, in terms of \nrising health care costs that need to be and must be addressed.\n  We need a sense of urgency about this issue. Health care is not \noptional. This is one of the most urgent issues a family addresses. It \nis the most urgent cost right now that businesses across the country \nare facing. Yet we do not see that sense of urgency, even though I know \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have concerns, have knowledge \nabout this, and want to see something happen. We can do better than \nthat. We can do better for our seniors through\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\nMedicare. We can do better for businesses that are desperately asking \nus for help. We can do better for our families, for every worker being \nasked to pay more for health care, or losing their job because the \ncompany cannot keep their health care plan and their jobs. There is \nmore we can do, much more. I urge my colleagues to join with me in one \nstep, S. 2780, Keeping the Promise of Medicare Act. We can, at minimum, \nstart by saying to our seniors we are going to make sure you are not \nburdened with the costs of paying for these policies to privatize. We \nwill keep you whole by capping this increase at the same level as the \ncost of living for Social Security. I hope we will vote on this bill \nbefore we leave and have the same sense of urgency about it that those \npaying their bills have every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Michigan. I am \na proud cosponsor of her legislation. She has been a true champion for \nseniors and affordable prescription drugs, and she continues that \nleadership today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9411-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9411-S9412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, yesterday Senator John Kerry told the \nAmerican people the truth about Iraq, the truth about the past, the \ntruth about the present, and the truth about the future. President \nBush, Vice President Cheney, and other administration apologists \ncomplain he did not show enough optimism. Senator Kerry decided that \nhonesty was more important than false optimism.\n  President Bush and Vice President Cheney have not been honest about \nIraq from the beginning. They have not been honest about Iraq with this \nSenate, not with the House, nor with the American people. John Kerry \ngave us yesterday what we need: honesty about Iraq.\n  He was not alone in the last few days. I salute my Republican \ncolleagues--five of them--for their honesty about the situation in \nIraq. It cannot be easy to tell the American people the truth and to \nstand up to an administration of their own party which is not telling \nthe truth. They are remarkable American patriots who recognize, as \nSenator Robert C. Byrd, the great senior Senator from West Virginia, \nhas reminded us, that we serve with Presidents of the United States, \nnot under them.\n  We are elected separately to serve independently and to exercise our \nown best judgments about what is best for our respective States and for \nour United States.\n  Listen to what five of our Republican Senators have said recently. \nOne said that President Bush's rosy pronouncements about the situation \nin Iraq ``are not as straight as we would want them to be.''\n  Another stated:\n\n       A crisp, sharp analysis of our policies is required.\n\n  A third, upon noting that of the $18.5 billion Congress appropriated \nfor Iraq's reconstruction a year ago, only $1 billion has been \nexpended, called this ``the incompetence in the administration.''\n  A fourth Republican Senator stated the other day that he may not vote \nfor President Bush in November, to which another Republican Senator \nreplied:\n\n       What I like about him is that he can be a Republican \n     Senator and, at the same time, he is unsure about our \n     Republican President. He is a breath of fresh air in \n     politics.\n\n  As he is. And we need also a breath of fresh air in the White House, \nalong with fresh words of truth which we received yesterday from \nSenator Kerry.\n  The response of the Bush White House to these honest assessments by \nSenator Kerry and by our Republican Senate colleagues has been to \nattack them and blame everyone else. President Truman said when he was \nPresident, ``The buck stops here.'' With this President, it is ``the \nblame starts here''--blame those who opposed this war from the \nbeginning, as I did; blame those who question his bungling of the \nrunning of Iraq after our courageous Armed Forces won the country in 3 \nweeks and still die daily because Iraqis will not take responsibility \nfor their own country. And now he blames his political opponent for \ntelling the American people the truth about Iraq, the truth that he has \nconsistently withheld.\n  I am not clear exactly about what we are supposed to be optimistic. \nCertainly not the report of the President's own National Intelligence \nCouncil which, according to an Associated Press story last week, \n``presented President Bush this summer with three pessimistic scenarios \nregarding the security situation in Iraq, including the possibility of \na civil war there before the end of 2005.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, how are we to view the continuing violence \nin Iraq, the murders of American soldiers as they stand guard in a \ncountry that its own citizens are unwilling or unable to guard for \nthemselves, or the American citizens hired to work there who are being \nkidnapped and beheaded? Tell the 138,000 American soldiers who are \ncourageously serving their country, risking and some losing their \nlives, and wondering when are they coming home. I say to those who tell \npatriotic dissenters that they are not supporting our troops--the \nprintable part is, if you want to support our troops, bring them home \nalive soon, not in 10 or 20 years, as Senator McCain has recently \npredicted.\n  Make Iraqis protect and defend their own country. That is what people \ndo in a democracy. That is what people do in any form of stable \nnational government: They impose law and order in their own cities. \nThey provide public safety on their own highways. They defend their own \nnational borders.\n  Over a year ago, in August of 2003, the Bush administration claimed \nthat 95 percent of Iraq was peacefully occupied and operating normally. \nNow we see daily reports that violence is spreading and becoming more \nmurderous. The Iraqi Prime Minister claims that ``foreign terrorists \nare still pouring in,'' a common cry to rally Americans behind the \nfallacy that their sons and daughters must die in Najev and Baghdad so \nwe will not die in New York and Boston. He says more troops are needed \nto win. Following the party line, he says: We need more participation \nfrom other countries.\n  We needed more participation from other countries 2 years ago when \nCongress was stampeded as part of the 2002 midterm election strategy to \nvote a blank check for warmaking based on completely false information \nfrom the Bush administration, including the President and the Vice \nPresident themselves.\n  We needed more participation from other countries when the United \nStates and Great Britain bilaterally invaded Iraq in 2003. Or when the \noperation of that country failed to begin 3 weeks later. We need it \nnow. Now that President Bush has made a mess of the situation in Iraq, \nare there any international volunteers?\n  How about participation from the people of Iraq against the \nsupposedly ``5,000 to 10,000'' insurgents, 95 percent of whom we are \ntold are Iraqis who do not like the presence of the United States \nthere. On paper, we were told over almost a year ago by the Secretary \nof Defense that there were 206,000 Iraqi militia and army military \npersonnel who were being trained or had been trained--206,000 we were \ntold. Last week, the Secretary of Defense admits that only half of that \nnumber have actually been trained.\n  We are told that less than $1 billion of the $5 billion that Congress \nappropriated 1 year ago for security training has been expended. And \nthat is why the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee said over the weekend that this is the incompetence of this \nadministration. The buck stops there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have 2 minutes to \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Democratic time remains--3 minutes \n43 seconds.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask that I may have 2 minutes of that time to complete \nmy remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, the buck stops in the White House. The \nblame starts there and it ends there. Senator John Kerry is not \nresponsible\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\nfor this war. Congress is culpable to some extent, but is not \nresponsible for it. President Bush is responsible. Now that things are \ngoing badly and getting worse--and I say that not because it is \npessimism, I say that because it is the truth. John Kerry told the \nAmerican people the truth. President Bush should start doing the same.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            [From AOL News]\n\n             Intelligence Report Offered Bleak View of Iraq\n\n                     (By Katherine Pfleger Shrader)\n\n       Washington (Sept. 16).--The National Intelligence Council \n     presented President Bush this summer with three pessimistic \n     scenarios regarding the security situation in Iraq, including \n     the possibility of a civil war there before the end of 2005.\n       In a highly classified National Intelligence Estimate, the \n     council looked at the political, economic and security \n     situation in the wartorn country and determined that--at \n     best--a tenuous stability was possible, a U.S. official said \n     late Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The \n     document lays out a second scenario in which increased \n     extremism and fragmentation in Iraqi society impede efforts \n     to build a central government and adversely affect efforts to \n     democratize the country.\n       In a third, worst-case scenario, the intelligence council \n     contemplated ``trend lines that would point to a civil war,'' \n     the official said. The potential conflict could be among the \n     country's three main populations--the Sunnis, Shiites and \n     Kurds.\n       It ``would be fair'' to call the document ``pessimistic,'' \n     the official added. But ``the contents shouldn't come as a \n     particular surprise to anyone who is following developments \n     in Iraq. It encapsulates trends that are clearly apparent.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes still under \nthe control of the Democrats.\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nyielding back his time.\n  Shortly, I will be making a unanimous consent request to move certain \nlegislation to conference, the Charitable Giving Act that passed the \nHouse, or the CARE Act that passed in the Senate. These two bills, very \nsimilar in nature, were passed earlier in this session, actually last \nyear--both were passed last year--to try to help those organizations \nthat are out on the front lines meeting the needs of our society. These \nare nonprofit organizations across America. The President refers to \nthem as ``arms of compassion,'' those who meet human service needs, \nthose who meet educational needs, our not-for-profit sector, which are \na vitally important part of what makes America tick and what makes our \ncountry the great envy of the world in the sense that we have such \nstrong communities, we have such strong voluntarism, we have such \nstrong commitment to our neighbor.\n  These community organizations have seen, particularly in light of the \ndecline in the stock market in the early part of this decade, with some \nof the problems we have had with our economy early in the decade, the \namount of charitable giving decline. So as a result, to respond to \nthese pressing needs, and actually to make the Tax Code, I would say, \nmore equitable, we put forward a bipartisan bill offered by Senator Joe \nLieberman and me that passed 95 to 5. Support for this bill is pretty \noverwhelming. In the House, it passed 408 to 13, and in the Senate it \npassed 95 to 5. So there is strong support to try to help these \ncharitable organizations meet the needs of those in our society.\n  Unfortunately, we have run into a roadblock. The roadblock is there \nare differences between the House and Senate bills. We would like to \nsit down and work out those differences in conference and move to a \nfinal solution to help these nonprofit organizations. We have been \nblocked repeatedly on the Senate floor from appointing conferees on a \nbill that is virtually noncontroversial, that has almost passed \nunanimously in both Houses, different versions, but we have not been \nable to do so.\n  On eight occasions I have come to the Senate floor and asked for \nconsent to do what we do as a normal course of record, which is to sit \ndown with the House in a conference and come up with a bill to be voted \nup or down by both the House and Senate. We have had objections to it. \nIn fact, we have had eight objections by the Democratic leadership; 7 \ntimes Senator Reid objected, and the most recent one Senator Daschle \nobjected. I am going to offer another one today.\n  We are approaching the end of the session. We are approaching a point \nwhere all the work that has been done on this legislation is going to \ncome to an end. There are 1,600 groups supporting this legislation. \nThere are 1,600 national nonprofit organizations that have come forward \nand said: We want this to be passed.\n  Not only that, Senator Daschle himself said in an op-ed--which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rapid City Journal, Feb. 15, 2002]\n\n                    Compromise Good for SD., America\n\n                        (By Senator Tom Daschle)\n\n       Washington--Sept. 11 filled all of us with an overwhelming \n     sense of grief. But like other human tragedies, Sept. 11 also \n     taught us something important about ourselves. It reawakened \n     in Americans a sense of generosity and civic duty. There was \n     a heartfelt outpouring of altruism across the country as \n     Americans united to provide assistance to the victims of \n     Sept. 11.\n       It is important to continue building on this generous \n     spirit by creating living memorials to the victims of \n     September 11--not just in New York and Washington, but in \n     Sioux Falls and Rapid City, in Newell, Faith, Elk Point and \n     every community across South Dakota and America. We can do \n     this by embracing President Bush's call to build on the \n     important partnership between the federal government and \n     community-based and faith-based organizations.\n       President Bush has been working with Democrats and \n     Republicans in Congress to promote charitable giving and \n     encourage community and faith-based groups. On Feb. 8, the \n     president and a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled the \n     Charity Aid, Recovery and Empowerment Act--or CARE Act--that \n     will harness the goodwill of Americans and turn this goodwill \n     into good works.\n       I strongly support this faith-based initiative, and commend \n     President Bush and Sen. Joseph Lieberman for their joint \n     leadership on an issue that is so close to their hearts and \n     so important to our nation.\n       Community and faith-based organizations do not seek to \n     replace government. There will always be a need for programs \n     like Social Security, Medicare or Head Start. What this \n     proposal seeks to do is strengthen the partnership whereby \n     charities and government can work side-by-side to meet some \n     of the great unmet needs of our nation.\n       South Dakotans know the good works charities perform. They \n     have seen success stories. Sioux Falls Promise works with \n     community and religious leaders and educators to meet the \n     needs of children and young people. In Rapid City, Catholic \n     Social Services provides adoption services and family \n     counseling, while in Sioux Falls Lutheran Social Services \n     runs one of the best immigrant assistance programs in the \n     country. In other communities in our state and across the \n     country, religious-based charities tutor and mentor children, \n     give shelter to battered women and children, help young \n     people find jobs, and feed the hungry by running soup \n     kitchens and food pantries.\n       The bipartisan faith-based initiative announced by \n     President Bush will help meet unmet needs in our communities \n     by providing tax incentives to businesses and individuals to \n     give money to charities, by simplifying the process by which \n     charities can qualify for tax exempt status, and by providing \n     technical assistance for community and faith-based groups.\n       In the wake of Sept. 11, it will provide a framework and \n     incentives for Americans to take up arms against enemies here \n     at home, including poverty, illiteracy, hunger and \n     homelessness.\n       The CARE Act isn't a Republican or a Democratic plan. It is \n     a bipartisan proposal that strikes the right balance between \n     harnessing the best forces of faith in our public life \n     without infringing on the First Amendment. It reflects a \n     broad concept of public service and builds on programs \n     sponsored by presidents from John F. Kennedy to President \n     Bush's own father. Most importantly, it is representative of \n     what we can accomplish in Washington when we put partisanship \n     and politics aside and focus on what matters. I\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\n     look forward to working with President Bush to get this \n     proposal signed into law.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. He said himself to the Rapid City Journal in an op-ed \nin South Dakota, talking about how good legislation this was:\n\n       The CARE Act isn't a Republican or Democratic plan. It is a \n     bipartisan proposal that strikes the right balance between \n     harnessing the best forces of faith in our public life \n     without infringing on the First Amendment . . . I look \n     forward to working with President Bush to get this proposal \n     signed into law.\n\n  It is nice that the Democratic leader said that he is looking forward \nto it being signed into law, but he has done everything to stop it from \nactually becoming law by standing up and objecting to this legislation \ngoing to the conference committee so we can work out differences.\n  Many of those differences are going to be tough to work out. I will \nadmit, some of the funding issues for social service block grant funds, \nsome of the issues with respect to how much tax relief we are going to \ngive to those who contribute to nonprofits, are going to be difficult \nissues to deal with, and there are going to be compromises that are \ngoing to be needed. There are going to be some things that Republicans \nare not going to be happy with in this compromise. There are going to \nbe some things that Democrats are not going to be happy with in the \ncompromise. But we need a vehicle to be able to sit down and work out \nthese differences because people are not going to be able to get the \nbenefits of this legislation, and they are profound benefits, unless we \nact.\n  Just to go through very quickly what the benefits are, there is a \nprovision to encourage food donations. This is a very important part of \nmeeting the needs of the hungry in America. Yes, we have Federal \ndollars that go for that purpose, but as my colleagues know, the vast \nmajority of the food that is distributed through food pantries, soup \nkitchens, or missions comes from private donations. That is where the \nvast majority of the food comes from.\n  Yes, we do provide some Federal assistance to America's Second \nHarvest, to other organizations, but the vast majority comes from \ndonations. There is an area of the law that candidly does not \nencourage, because of the Tax Code, some purveyors of food to give \ntheir surplus food for the hungry in America. So we changed that \nprovision of the law. We believe--not we--America's Second Harvest \nbelieves that 878 million meals will be provided, as a result of this \nprovision, for hungry Americans over the next 10 years. This is not a \nsmall amount. This is not a minor, trivial matter.\n  For those who care about hunger in America, and as someone who was a \nsponsor of the bill in the Senate that passed, the Good Samaritan Food \nDonation Act, I care a lot about America's Second Harvest and others \nwho have the food necessary to be able to meet the needs of the hungry \nin America.\n  Individual development accounts--Senator Lieberman, Senator \nFeinstein, myself, and others have been working on this for years to \ntry to help low-income Americans have the opportunity to accumulate \nwealth, to have savings and investment, to help them to get a college \neducation, to get a GED, or to have the opportunity to own a home or to \nstart a business, 300,000 matched savings accounts, matched with \nGovernment and private dollars to help low-income individuals save, to \nbuild wealth.\n  We have heard the President talk about an ownership society. This is \na very important part of that ownership society in this bill. There is \n$2 billion of educational resources through what is called an IRA \ncharitable rollover. People have IRAs, and some people who have IRAs \ncandidly have a lot of money, and they do not need that money for \nretirement. If they want to give it to a charity, they are heavily \npenalized if they do. This will allow them to roll over their IRA. The \nbiggest beneficiaries of this approximately $3 billion that we believe \nwill be contributed will be educational institutions. Colleges, \nuniversities, private schools, maybe charter schools, and other \neducational institutions will benefit from this provision, and that is \nwhy all of the public universities and private universities in the \ncountry are for this provision and believe it can be a great help to \neducating our children and keeping the cost of education down.\n  Eighty-six million lower and middle-income Americans will benefit \nfrom the nonitemized deduction. What does that mean? Two-thirds of \nAmericans do not itemize, period. They fill out the short form, the \n1040EZ. We have a certified public accountant in the Chair, and he can \nexplain this better than I can, but I will do my best.\n  Right now, if someone is one of these two-thirds of Americans who \ncontribute to their church, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, they \ncannot deduct the contribution that they made; whereas, if one \nitemizes, they can. So what we are trying to do is to provide some \nencouragement for people who do not have complex tax forms to give \nmoney to these organizations. That is what this nonitemized deduction \nfor charitable giving is about. Eighty-six million lower- and middle-\nincome Americans will do that, and it will be billions of dollars in \nincreased donations as a result of it.\n  As Joe Lieberman said--we had a press conference recently--what is \nleft in this bill is all good. There is nothing bad. There is nothing \ncontroversial or that would be disagreed upon. There is disagreement on \nhow to pay for this. There is disagreement on how much of this we want \nto do. There is disagreement as to how much we are going to have in \ndirect Government assistance to nonprofit organizations, social service \nblock grant funds. All of that is a controversy, but all of it is an \nargument on how much good we want to do, or how the focus should be.\n  The idea that we cannot get a discussion on how we can help those in \nneed in our society, how we can help those organizations that want to \nhelp those in need, and get that into a form in which we can resolve \nthese differences and come to a solution, to me, is very discouraging.\n  I have met with Senator Daschle from South Dakota. I have asked him \nto allow us to go to conference, and the Senator from South Dakota \nbasically said: You have to agree before we go to conference to \neverything I want in this bill. If you don't agree with everything I \nwant in this bill, then you can't go to conference.\n  What is the point of conference? If we have to do exactly what the \nSenator from South Dakota wants, to write this bill exactly how he \nwants it or we can't get a bill, that is hardly the kind of bipartisan \ncooperation that we have seen in getting this bill to the point it is \nright now. This is not the way legislating works. It is not my way or \nthe highway from the minority. It is not my way or the highway to the \nAmerican people, who would like to see some help for those in need in \nour society. You either do it the way I want to as the Democratic \nleader of the minority in the Senate, not the way the President would \nlike to do it, nor the way the House would like to do it, nor how the \nSenate majority would like to do it, but how the Senator from South \nDakota would like to do it himself. That, to me, is not bipartisanship. \nThat is not reaching across the aisle to make things happen in a \npositive direction for an area in the country that is in need.\n  I am willing to compromise. I have said to the Senator--in fact, I \nsaid to the Senator from South Dakota that I am willing to make \nreductions in areas of this bill that I care most about, and I am \nwilling to give in areas that I care probably less about. I am willing \nto make that compromise, but it is not all or nothing. It can't be all \nor nothing. That is what we are being told. To me, that is an insult to \nthe very people we are attempting to help and certainly not in keeping \nwith the comments of the Senator from South Dakota that he made in \nRapid City. I understand how he would say those things in South Dakota. \nBut here in Washington, DC, it is a very different story. It is not a \nstory that says to those who are not-for-profit organizations that want \nto help, that need these resources and are in need, to not come and \napply because we are going to deal with you exactly how this bill is \ngoing to be written.\n  This bill has been written in more of a bipartisan fashion than any \nbill I have ever been involved with in the Senate or in the House where \nI served. This is all good, the Senator from Connecticut said.\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\n  I am hopeful we will have an opportunity to place this good \nlegislation in a situation where we can forge a compromise that will \ngive us not everything I want, not everything the Senator from \nConnecticut wants, not everything the Representative in the House who \nis leading the effort on the House side wants, not what others want, \nbut that we can arrive at a compromise in a bipartisan way to allow \nthis bill to provide remedies for the needs of our society by getting \nthis bill passed and signed into law.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 7\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 7, the charitable giving bill, and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, that the substitute amendment, which is the text of S. 476, \nthe Senate-passed version of the charitable giving bill, be agreed to; \nthat the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; further, that the Senate insist \non its amendment and request a conference with the House; that the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 3 to 2; and \nthat any statements to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I can conclude and then I would be \nhappy to let the Senator speak, I will submit for the Record a letter \nfrom Senator Lieberman and I to the conferees on the FSC/ETI bill. We \nbelieve this is an important enough measure that we should pass it this \nyear. If we are not able to go to conference and work out differences, \nSenator Lieberman and I may ask the conferees on this tax bill to \nplease consider the Charitable Giving Act as part of the FSC/ETI \nconference. I hope if this is not the vehicle, we can get it to \nconference another way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2004.\n       Dear Conferees: We are writing on behalf of the charitable \n     community, large and small, across this country seeking to \n     aid families and better their neighborhoods and communities \n     by helping those in need. As you know, both the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives have passed legislation in this \n     Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support that provides \n     significant additional incentives for charitable giving \n     around the country and additional resources for efforts to \n     help those in need including innovative Individual \n     Development Accounts (IDAs), increased Social Services Block \n     Grant (SSBG) funding, and the Compassion Capital Fund. The \n     Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment Act (CARE) passed the \n     Senate on April 9, 2003, by a vote of 95-5. The House of \n     Representatives passed companion legislation, the Charitable \n     Giving Act, on September 17, 2003, by a vote of 408-13.\n       Since both the Senate and the House have strongly supported \n     charitable incentives, and since both the Senate and House \n     FSC-ETI (JOBS) bills include charitable reforms which limit \n     existing practices, inclusion of a package of charitable \n     incentives in the FSC-ETI conference is appropriate and \n     within the scope of the conference for this Congress. \n     Furthermore, we believe that any revenue raised through \n     constructive reforms impacting charities should be dedicated \n     to expanding charitable giving incentives in order to help \n     those in need.\n       We strongly urge the conferees to work with the many \n     sponsors and supporters of the CARE Act in the Senate and the \n     Charitable Giving Act in the House to include the significant \n     provisions shared by both bills and full and fair \n     consideration of those that differ--for the benefit of all \n     Americans. The time has come to expand the tools of \n     generosity and increase resources for those in need in a \n     bipartisan fashion.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look \n     forward to working with you in this important effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Santorum,\n     Joseph Lieberman,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just came to the floor after having \npresented an award to Senator Gordon Smith. The Suicide Prevention \nNational Organization gave him an award, which is the No. 1 award that \nthis organization can present. Gordon Smith's son took his own life at \nage 22. We passed in the Senate in recent days--in fact, on Garrett \nSmith's birthday--the Garrett Smith Suicide Prevention Act.\n  The reason I mention that is that matter was passed and is going to \nbecome law. The President will sign it any day.\n  As a result of what I suggest to my friend from Pennsylvania happened \nin this instance, we are not objecting to the passage of this bill. We \nhave never objected to the passage of this bill. We are simply saying \nthat it be handled in the way the Garrett Smith legislation passed, and \nlet the House take whatever action on it and we bring it back. If we \nlike what they have done, we will take it; if not, we will amend it and \nsend it back to them.\n  We have had numerous bills enacted into law without using a \nconference to negotiate differences between the House and the Senate. I \nsay numerous; I don't say several. I say numerous. I have not counted \nthese, but I assume there are about 100 pieces of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The time is under the control \nof the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak in response to the Senator from Pennsylvania for up to 10 \nminutes. I will be happy if the Senator wants me to speak afterwards, \nwhatever he wants me to do. I know we have a recess to take place at \n12:30. I want to give fairness, and I should have the opportunity to \nrespond.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada may wish to speak \nafter I speak. I will be covering some of the same ground. I will be \nmaking a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator allow me to respond to him and Senator \nSantorum's unanimous consent request following his statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if there is \nto be an agreement soon, I would like to be a part of that agreement. I \nwould like to offer a unanimous consent request to set a date for a \nvote on the reimportation of prescription drugs. If we reach an \nagreement, I would like to be a part of that so I can offer a unanimous \nconsent request that the Senate be able to consider that issue.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am going to object to giving some leeway to the Senator \nfrom Nevada to give some kind of response because we are going to be \nasking unanimous consent. But I have listened for the last 2\\1/2\\ hours \nto comments from the other side that I have not been able to respond \nto. To give unlimited additional time to the other side to again make \ncomments that we obviously would like to comment on, too, isn't \nreasonable at this point in time. We are already into the time of the \npolicy meetings, so we are extending beyond that time. We are having to \ntake that time in order to use our allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9414-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9414-S9417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1261\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of talk by my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle about jobs and workers. But I have to \ntell you that their actions don't match their words. It is a little \ndisingenuous to come talk about jobs and then block a job training \nbill.\n  I point out one very important program we have that helps American \nworkers improve their skills and get a new or better job so they can \nmake a better life for themselves and their families. It is the \nnation's job training program created under the Workforce Investment \nAct. This job training legislation would help over 900,000 unemployed \nworkers each year get back to work.\n  We keep talking about jobs and work, but we haven't been able to get \nthis important bill into conference.\n  If the other party really wanted to provide working families with the \nhelp they need, they would be a lot less talkative, and they would be a \nlot more active when it comes to moving this bill on job training to \nconference and enacting it into law.\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\n  This obstruction by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhurts our workers, it hurts our businesses, and it hurts our ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  Let us look at the facts. The economy has shown 12 straight months of \njob gains. Last month, payroll employment increased by 144,000 jobs. \nNearly 1.7 million new jobs have been created over the past year. The \nunemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for regular order.\n  Mr. ENZI. I believe under regular order that for our time we have up \nto 60 minutes, that there was no set time for adjourning for the policy \ncommittees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I say to the Democratic whip that the time is \nnow controlled by the Republicans. We are under a unanimous consent \nagreement that time was divided between the two sides. There is 41 \nminutes 19 seconds on the Republican side.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the Chair. I thought we were going out for \nour recess. So how much time is left for the Republicans?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 41 minutes 8 seconds on the \nmajority side. There is no time left on the minority side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize for interrupting my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have laid the groundwork for the economic \nrecovery we are experiencing today. President Bush's economic policies \ncontinue to create new jobs and move the economy forward. This all adds \nup to good news for the American people; not good news if you do not \nhave a job. But this is a job-training program I am talking about so \nyou can get a job, or if you have a job and want a better job, you can \nget skills improvement. We have weathered the storm and we are poised \nto enter a new period of prosperity.\n  However, I have to caution you about some serious roadblocks that \nstand in the way of prosperity for our workers and businesses alike. \nThe first roadblock is a gap between the skills our workforce has and \nthe skills our employers need. The second roadblock is the Democrats' \nobstruction of the job-training legislation that will help close this \nskills gap.\n  First I will talk about the skills gap so you can understand just how \ndamaging the Democrats' obstruction is to our workers and our economy.\n  It may surprise you to learn that many good jobs in this country will \nremain unfilled because employers cannot find workers with the skills \nthey need. This skills gap is not about politics; it is about education \nand training; it is about demographics; it is about America's \ncompetitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  This chart shows the expected labor force and labor force demand from \n2002 to 2031. You can see the line with the boxes on it which shows the \nlabor that is going to be needed. You can see the other less-increasing \nline that shows the labor that will be available. You can see the gap \nwe will have between the number needed and the number available. We \nwill not have enough workers to fill our jobs and we will not have \nenough workers with the right skills for those jobs. And we do not \nright now.\n  According to a 2003 survey by the Center for Workforce Preparation, \nan affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, half of the employers \nreported difficulty in finding qualified workers. The problem is \ngreatest for small employers. Small business--our greatest source of \neconomic growth--cannot create jobs if they do not have skilled workers \nto fill them.\n  The gap between the demand for high-skilled workers and the supply \nwill only widen in the future. Looking ahead 2 years, only 30 percent \nof the employers surveyed by the Center for Workforce Preparation \nbelieve the skills of their workers will keep pace. As policymakers, we \ntoo must look ahead to the growing skills gap that demands our \nattention and our action now.\n  Another chart shows the projected skilled- and unskilled-worker gap \nin 2010 and 2020. In 2010, the skilled-worker gap will be 5.3 million; \nby 2020, it will be 14 million. The unskilled-worker gap will move from \n1.7 million in 2010 to 7 million in 2020. That is 7 million total by \n2010, and 21 million total by 2020.\n\n  This skills gap blocks the way to better jobs and better lives for \nAmerican workers and their families. This skills gap also threatens the \nability of American businesses to compete in a more complex, global \neconomy. In the book called ``The Jobs Revolution,'' by Steve \nGunderson, Robert Jones, and Kathryn Scanland, they describe the impact \nof this skills gap:\n\n       Every unfilled job translates to products and services we \n     cannot deliver to the global market and, therefore, dollars \n     we cannot return to the U.S. economy. Almost certainly, jobs \n     unfilled in the U.S. will go elsewhere and not return.\n\n  Now, we can change this outcome. We can keep jobs and prosperity in \nAmerica. But we must act now to close the skills gap by improving our \neducation and our job training system.\n  When Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the \nSenate Banking Committee, he said:\n\n       [W]hat will ultimately determine the standard of living in \n     this country is the skill of the people.\n\n  Why is effective workforce training so important? Because in an \nincreasingly knowledge-based economy, people--their talent and their \nideas--make the difference. People are a company's most important \nresource. The skills and ingenuity of the American workforce will drive \nour economy in the 21st century and beyond. If we want to keep high-\npaying jobs in America, our challenge is to equip our workers with \nskills the global economy demands.\n  We used to manufacture buggy whips. We do not make them anymore, or \nhardly any of them. The workers who made buggy whips had to learn new \nskills. The new economy creates new jobs and those new jobs demand new \nskills.\n  We cannot turn back the clock. To quote again from ``The Jobs \nRevolution'':\n\n       We'll never return to the days before satellites hovered \n     over the globe and the Internet wove us together. We need to \n     go forward, guided by a plan that reflects a new set of \n     American priorities. The plan will marry education and \n     employment. In the old, pre-revolutionary model, we went to \n     school for a dozen or more years and then we went to work. \n     After this revolution we'll need to keep learning to keep \n     working. Education and re-education will be the dominant \n     strategy by which we land and hold our jobs.\n\n  Unfortunately, the current workforce development system is not up to \nthe task. It is not effectively equipping our workers with the relevant \nskills. Without any action, technology and other advances will outpace \nthe ability of American workers and businesses to update skills needed \nto compete.\n  We must improve the Nation's job-training system under the Workforce \nInvestment Act to better prepare American workers for the good jobs of \ntoday and tomorrow. Only a systematic reform of our Nation's job-\ntraining system will enable American workers and businesses to compete \nand succeed in the global economy.\n  There is good news. We have a bill that does this. It is a bipartisan \nbill that reauthorizes and improves the Nation's job-training system. \nIt will help retrain workers to fill the jobs needed in this country \nnow and in the future. It will link workforce development with \neconomic development, recognizing that job training and job creation go \nhand in hand. It will partner the public workforce system with private \nsector employers--including small businesses--and with training \nproviders to better prepare workers for high-wage, high-growth jobs.\n\n  The good news is that we have bipartisan legislation that does all of \nthis--legislation that passed out of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee unanimously, legislation that passed on the floor of \nthis Senate last November unanimously. That does not happen with \ncontroversial bills. Where is the bill now?\n  Here is the bad news. Here is the roadblock. The Democrats will not \nlet us send this important job-training bill to conference. They are \nstopping progress by refusing to appoint a conference committee, which \nis a committee made up of both Republicans and Democrats who would meet \nwith Republicans and Democrats from the House to work out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate versions of the bill--a \nvery common procedure in past years, obviously not in this year.\n  This is an important jobs bill, a bill that will help American \nworkers and\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\nbusinesses, and it is being held hostage to election year politics. If \nwe really care about keeping good jobs in this country, we need to send \nthat job-training legislation to conference and then to the President \nto become law.\n  I owe my constituents more. I think we all do. We owe the American \npeople an open legislative process, a process they expect and deserve \nfrom us. This is not just an academic question of Senate rules and \nprocedures. A bill that would help put Americans back to work or find \nbetter jobs now lies in legislative limbo. Whether a company decides to \nopen a plant in Cheyenne or China depends upon a qualified local \nworkforce. A skilled workforce can make the difference between success \nand failure in the new, global economy. It will make the difference for \nour workers, for our companies, and for our future.\n  There is an American dream. It is to have a family, a nice home, and \na good job to support that home and family.\n  Prior to my coming to the Senate, my wife and I owned some shoe \nstores. As a small-business owner, I saw firsthand the impact of job \ntraining in achieving that dream. We had an employee, a Vietnam \nveteran, who went to work through a workforce training course and ended \nup managing and then buying two stores from us. He is an example of \nwhat you can do with effective job training if you teach workers to \ndream at the same time.\n  We have to give workers and businesses the tools to turn those dreams \ninto reality. Job training under the Workforce Investment Act can turn \nthe dream into reality for millions of American workers. By blocking \nlegislation that improves job training, my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are blocking the way to new and better jobs for American \nworkers. They are blocking the pathway to prosperity for American \nfamilies and American companies.\n  The job training bill known as the Workforce Investment Act is a \ncentral part of a combination of Federal education and training \nprograms that provides lifelong learning for the workforce of today and \ntomorrow. In this technology-driven global economy, everyone is a \nstudent who must adapt to changing workforce needs by continuing to \npursue their education. In turn, Congress must ensure that education \nand job training are connected to the needs of business, including \nsmall business, now and in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to allow the \nappointment of conferees to the job training legislation known as the \nWorkforce Investment Act. The cost of this obstruction is the loss of \nimportant legislative efforts that will benefit the American people as \nit harms the integrity of the legislative process itself. I hope our \nbipartisan efforts on this bill can continue. I hope regular order is \nrestored to the appointment of conferees so we can craft the final \nversion of legislation. If we wanted to keep good jobs in this country, \nthe Democrats would agree to send this important bill to conference.\n  And a conference isn't the last opportunity to obstruct or to \nfilibuster. After the conference, if the Democrats don't like the \nresults they participated in--and that is a key part to this, in \nconference both sides participate, as I mentioned before--then they can \nfilibuster. This is embarrassing because we passed it unanimously last \nNovember. We asked for more job training last November. It is almost \nNovember again. And in fact, if a conference committee were appointed, \nthere isn't time for that, it would be a bipartisan effort. It would be \ncontinuing work on the job force because there isn't anything a \nconference committee now could do that could affect this election. They \nhave already held out long enough to affect this election and to \nrestrict jobs in the economy.\n  I am pushing for a conference committee that could meet, that could \nresolve the small differences there are between the House and Senate \nbills. We have already talked about what those are and what the changes \nwould probably be. I resolved about six of the issues that were brought \nup before, and we are down to some very minor ones. They need to be \nfixed by a conference committee.\n  There is no reason a conference committee should not have been \nappointed last year--not this year, but last year. This should have \nbeen worked out and people should already be in training for these \njobs--900,000 of them a year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the House \nmessage to accompany H.R. 1261, the job training bill, also known as \nthe workforce investment legislation, which is at the desk; provided \nthat the Senate insist upon its amendment, agree to the request for \nconference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio \nof 5 to 4.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, this bill has already \npassed. We are waiting for the House to get together on an amendment to \nsend back to us. As I indicated, we have passed numerous bills by using \nthis procedure. My dear friend, the Senator from Wyoming, for whom I \nhave the greatest respect, is crying these big crocodile tears. We have \npassed numerous bills by doing the very same thing, sending a bill over \nto the House. This can be done without a conference.\n  I repeat for the third time, I have the greatest respect for the \nintegrity of the Senator from Wyoming. I am sure if we shook hands on a \ndeal he would go to whatever bounds necessary to fulfill that \nagreement. But I have to say that on the most important bill, the \nhighway bill, another Senator and I shook hands, a Republican with me, \nindicating that if this bill is going to go to conference, if there was \nsomething in it he didn't like, then I wouldn't sign my name to the \nconference and vice versa. That was done in a personal meeting between \nmyself and the other Senator. Then it was put in writing by the two \nleaders confirming the agreement we had reached.\n  Suddenly, we are told all bets are off. That deal is no good. So the \nconference is going on with none us of attending. There are meetings \ngoing on, but we are not part of the conference.\n  This is what has happened around here. That is the embarrassment. The \nconference process I have been involved in for 22 years has been turned \non its head. Conferences are called in name only. You don't know what \nconference is being held, where it is being held, because you are not \ntold. And not only that, what happens to many of these bills is other \nitems are inserted that have nothing to do with the issue about which \nthe conference is taking place.\n  I know the sincerity of the Senator from Wyoming. We know the \nimportance of this legislation. We want it to pass also. But it has \npassed. We want it to be signed into law. The best way to accomplish \nthat is to do what we have done on so many different bills that have \nbeen enacted into law without using the conference to negotiate the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate; that is, to work it out \nbetween the two bodies. We have done it many times. We can do it on \nthis.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am deeply disappointed. I am not surprised that the other \nside objects to sending this important jobs training bill to \nconference. I am a little disappointed in the comments I just heard \nwhich try to give some credibility to my not being trusted. I don't \nremember any handshake I have made on any bill that hasn't turned out \nto be that way. I was not a part of that transaction.\n  I am on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a comment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I want the record to be spread: I accomplished directly the \nopposite of what I wanted. I would never, ever question at any time the \nveracity, the honesty, the handshake of the Senator from Wyoming. Out \nof courtesy, because the other Senator was not on the floor, I did not \nwant to mention his name. But it had no reference to you. We had a \nsituation where Senator Daschle and I agreed to a conference on a \nhandshake and, in my opinion, the handshake meant nothing.\n  It had no bearing whatsoever on the Senator from Wyoming. I want the \nSenator from Wyoming to know--everybody in Wyoming--I have never known \na more ethical person in Government than the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. I assure \npeople that the Health, Education, Labor,\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nand Pensions Committee is one of the more controversial committees of \nthe Senate. If I didn't have some credibility of following through on \nthe things I have talked about in the process, that would not have \ngotten out of committee unanimously, had that not had the same kind of \nconfidence on what I would do if a conference committee were appointed. \nAnd we talked about what kind of differences there are. The House had \nalready passed their bill. If they didn't have some confidence in me \nthat what I had said would happen would happen, it would not have \ngotten through the Senate floor unanimously. That doesn't happen often \nwith Health, Education, Labor, and Pension bills.\n  This has been a very important bill for the workforce of America, and \nwe had great agreement and cooperative work on it, recognizing what \nwould probably be done in conference committee. Now, we could probably \nsend this over four or five times to the House--which there is not time \nto do--and resolve some of the differences in each of those. Had I \nknown this was going to happen, I would have started that process much \nearlier so we would have had time to send an important bill like this \nback and forth.\n  The way this has always been done with the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee bill--that is the committee I have been on ever \nsince I got here--is that we held conferences. Yes, some of them had a \nlot of animosity, but we worked them out and got bills finished. When \nyou have difficult issues, the best thing is for people to sit down \nwith each other. I have always invited the other side to any conference \ncommittee I have been on, and we have listened to both sides. What we \nhave usually come up with, instead of one side or the other, was a \nthird way. That is what ought to be done on this bill.\n  We ought to be reaching an agreement so we can get 900,000 people a \nyear trained to fill the skills gap we were talking about before. We \nare not just going to have a lack of jobs, we are going to have more \njobs than we can fill--provided we have people trained to fill them. If \nwe don't train the people, those jobs are going overseas and we will \nnever see them again. It has been critical for this year, the year that \nis just about over. We cannot afford to do this again next year and \nwait a year or 2 years to reach an agreement to get people trained for \njobs. That is what is happening.\n  If we have to go until the first of the year, all these bills start \nall over again. Everybody's ideas come back in again, we redraft and \nstart again, and we get to conference--maybe. But there is no assurance \nof that. We are at the point where we can have a conference committee. \nIf we have a conference committee, then there can be agreement or \ndisagreement. If there is disagreement, there is an opportunity to \nfilibuster at that point. Senators who cannot filibuster a bill through \nthe rest of the session, as short as it is going to be now, probably \nought to be worried about their senatorial capability.\n  Our workers and our companies deserve more than election year \npolitical obstruction. They deserve the tools needed to keep American \nworkers and businesses the best in the world. They deserve to see us \nact in a bipartisan manner and send this bill to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remaining time on \nthe Republican side?\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, first, I am proud to be in the Senate. I \nhave always been proud to be a part of our political system. It is a \nremarkable privilege to participate in this system of ours. I have run \nfor Statewide election 11 times, since I was in my midtwenties. I must \nsay there are times when I see and hear things in American politics \nthat fill me with disgust.\n  Two years ago, we had a colleague, Max Cleland, who sat in that desk \nnear the door. Max Cleland was charged in his campaign with lack of \ncommitment to our country's national security. They ran an ad against \nMax Cleland that had an image of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. \nThis is a man who left three limbs on the battlefield. He sat in this \nChamber missing two legs and an arm. Back home on television, he was \naccused of not standing up for this country's national security. It \nstretches my threshold of forgiveness to excuse those who do that to \nsomeone like Max Cleland, who went to Vietnam, came back, and wrote a \nbook entitled ``Strong at the Broken Places.'' He ran for the Senate to \nbecome a U.S. Senator, only to be attacked that he was not somehow \nstanding up for the national security interests of this country. Shame \non them.\n  This Sunday, I saw that ugliness again raise its head. It is the \nworst of American politics, in my judgment. This is a newspaper called \nthe Rapid City Journal. I have it because this comes from a neighboring \nState of\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\nmine. On Sunday, Republican challenger John Thune accused Democratic \nSenator Tom Daschle of encouraging America's enemies and damaging U.S. \ntroop morale with a headline, ``Emboldening the Enemy?''\n  For those who engage in this kind of politics, attacking the \nDemocratic leader in the Senate as emboldening the enemy, encouraging \nAmerica's enemies, and damaging U.S. troop morale, the Rapid City \nJournal says, all I can say is, shame, shame. Is there decency left in \nAmerican politics? There was not in the attack on Max Cleland, a man \nwho nearly died on the battlefield, and there is not in this \nunforgivable attack on the Democratic leader in the Senate.\n  Does anyone really believe that which occurs here, that the actions \nof the Democratic leader embolden the enemy, encourage America's \nenemies, and damage U.S. troop morale? It is so disgusting to see the \ntactic of questioning someone's commitment to their country, \nquestioning someone's patriotism, or when someone says a critical word, \nsuggesting somehow that they are giving aid and comfort to America's \nenemies. That is not what ought to be the best in this democracy. It is \nthe worst in American politics. The shrill, ugly, corrosive, relentless \nattacks in this political system ought to stop. There is so much to be \ndone. Obviously, I support my colleague, Senator Daschle.\n  There is reason to have an aggressive debate in our State to the \nsouth about a range of issues. But there is no reason, no excuse for \nthe challenger in that race to be suggesting the Democratic leader here \nin the Senate, my colleague and friend Senator Daschle, somehow is \nencouraging America's enemies and damaging U.S. troop morale. That is \nnot below the belt, that is below the radar screen of American \npolitics. My hope is that the American people, my hope would have been \nthat the citizens of Georgia, and my hope certainly is that the \ncitizens of the United States see it for what it is. It is an outrage, \nand this country should not stand for it. This country is about, in my \njudgment, aggressive, open debate. There is an old saying: When \neveryone is thinking the same thing, no one is thinking very much.\n\n  But we have people around today who believe if you raise any \nquestions at all, you are somehow unpatriotic. What a load of nonsense.\n  I came into American politics and into this political system proud of \npolitics and the way we make decisions. John F. Kennedy used to say \nthat every mother kind of hopes her child might grow up to become \nPresident as long as they are not active in politics.\n  He was kidding, of course. Politics is an honorable venture in this \ncountry. It is the way we have made decisions for over 200 years. There \nis nowhere else like this place on this globe. We spin around the Sun \nwith 6 billion of us and somehow through divine providence we landed \nright here right now. What a wonderful event for us. It is our job to \nbe caretakers of a political system, a democracy that is the most \nsuccessful in the world. There is plenty of reason for us to have \naggressive debates. Aggressive debate is wonderful. It is invigorating \nand refreshing to our democracy. But this is not aggressive debate. \nThis is the worst of American politics. I hope it stops.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, may I direct a question to my colleague?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to respond or yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I want to express my agreement with the observations \nexpressed by my friend and colleague from North Dakota about the tenor \nof some of the recent attacks directed toward my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Daschle. This is beyond anything we have witnessed in \nAmerica politics in more than a generation, and perhaps ever, to have \nan attack in a political campaign essentially accusing a leader of the \nSenate of conduct bordering on treason.\n  I think Senator Daschle put it well, that based on good values in the \nway we tend to see things, the observations of this gentleman ought to \nlead to a trip to the woodshed for the despicable nature of the \nobservations. I believe it would be hard to find anyone in the Senate--\nI am sure my colleague from North Dakota would agree with me, Senator \nDaschle being the only veteran in that particular race, someone who \nserved in the Vietnam era--would Senator Dorgan agree with me that \nthere is virtually no one in the Senate of either party who has been \nmore committed to living up to our obligations to our veterans, to the \nsafety, equipment, and resources of our men and women in uniform? I ask \nthis question of my colleague from North Dakota, as the father of a \nyoung man, my oldest son who served in combat in both Afghanistan and \nmost recently in Iraq, a member of the 101st Airborne, my son, who is a \nvery big supporter, a very vocal supporter of Senator Daschle and the \nimportance for the sake of our military and our national security of \nour State of reelecting him to this important position. But can you \nthink of anyone who has done more, who has provided more leadership, \nhas been more vocal in support of our troops and our military and our \nNation's defense than Senator Daschle?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Daschle is an Air Force veteran. He is a patriot. \nHe is someone who has a strong record on national defense and national \nsecurity issues. He doesn't need me to come to the floor to defend him. \nI come to the floor only because I am disgusted at this sort of \nnonsense. This represents the worst of American politics. If you want \nto have a debate about energy, taxes, foreign policy, name it, have \nthat debate. But don't accuse your opponent of somehow not standing up \nfor the interests of this country. Don't accuse your opponent of giving \naid and comfort to the enemy. That is beneath, in my judgment, \nthoughtful politics. That is the kind of thoughtless and low blow in \npolitics that is uncalled for. The only reason I came to the floor is I \nam disgusted by this.\n  I am part of this political system and I have always in my campaign \ntried to wage a positive campaign. When challenged, I am aggressive, no \nquestion about that. But I hope no one is accusing me of the low road \nbecause I never take the low road. I believe this is about a positive \nfuture of jobs and hope and opportunity for the American people. There \nis so much to talk about and so much to do. In my judgment, it betrays \nrather than serves the public interest in this country to be somehow \nquestioning the patriotism or questioning the commitment of a Member of \nthis body, especially the leader of our caucus, questioning the \ncommitment of the leader to the ideals and goals of this country and \nsaying instead that somehow what the leader of our caucus has done is \nto give aid and comfort to the enemy or to embolden the enemy, as the \nheadline states. That is not what we should expect from our political \nsystem or the candidates who are in that political system.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The Senator has accurately described a political season where \nmeanness is the order of the day. He has pointed out this element in \nthe race in South Dakota. I have seen it in my State of Florida \nrecently, interestingly, in the Republican primary, meanness where the \ntruth doesn't matter, where you can be opponents, but you don't have to \nbe enemies, and it is there nevertheless. It is time for the people of \nthis country to say that is enough. We are killing our own democratic \ninstitutions with the smut and dirt and untruths, and it is time to \nstop.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has the floor. I would like to \nask a question of the Senator from Florida. To make the Senator's point \nclear, however, I ask, is it not true that the Senate race to which the \nSenator is referring was a race between two Republicans, one backed by \nthe President and the other running on his own, former Congressman \nMcCollum? And the viciousness--I have read editorials from the State of \nFlorida which dealt with Martinez's campaign against this good man, \nCongressman McCollum, and the same applies to South Dakota. The same \ncrew that is trying to demean Senator Daschle demeaned Congressman \nMcCollum. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say to the Senator that sadly Mr. McCollum, \nformer Congressman, who ended up second in the Republican primary, a \nfellow I have known since high school and\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nwho has some very high principles, because he announced that he was in \nfavor of the hate crimes bill, was labeled, as reported in the St. \nPetersburg Times, as ``the new darling of the homosexual extremists'' \nas a means of trying to cut him down in a Republican primary.\n  This has absolutely gotten out of control and I am afraid we are \ngoing to see more of the same as we come into the general election. It \nis exasperating. It is not the American way. We have seen this time \nafter time. My goodness, what do we have to expect in the Presidential \nrace in the next 6 weeks?\n  That is my response to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair state what the matter before \nthe Senate is at this stage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business for debate \nonly.\n  Mr. REID. And the time is not divided between now and 3 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. Following that expiration of time, how is the time \nallocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order in place.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9419-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTING IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the statement \nof my dear friend from New Mexico about voting and all that he thinks \nis wrong with our system. I would be happy to look at his legislation. \nBut it seems to me around here what we should be dealing with is giving \npeople the opportunity to vote more easily rather than making it more \ndifficult.\n  I think it speaks volumes that when you look at the States that have \nsame-day registration, the turnout is much bigger. We have one State \nwhere there is no registration, and the vote there, of course, is even \nhigher. In those instances where you have same-day registration and you \nhave no registration, with all the modern computerization, all the ways \nof checking, there has not been a single case of fraud reported, to my \nknowledge. So I think what we should try to do is make it easier for \npeople to vote, not harder. I heard my friend, if I understood his \nstatement, say that there are some people out registering lots and lots \nof people. Well, good. Good. We need more people like that.\n  I am very disappointed in the State of Nevada. I have tried for years \nto get the system changed. But, in Nevada, we cut off registration a \nmonth before the primary election, and then we cut it off a month \nbefore the general election. Just when people are interested in voting, \nwe cut them off. And the county clerk says: Oh, it's so hard for us to \nget all the records in order. That is silliness. With all the modern \ntechnology we have, it is easy.\n  The reason it is hard is people like to know who they have who voted \nfor them last time or voted against them. They do not want to make a \nbig impression on getting new people into the system. It is easier to \ndeal with what you have, and it is wrong.\n  We started off after the Civil War with rules to keep people from \nvoting. We need to get out of that mindset.\n  We need to make it easier for people to vote, and one way to do that \nis to have either same-day registration or even no registration. There \nare plenty of ways of checking to see if people are trying to vote \nfraudulently.\n  In the State of Oregon, people vote by mail. They do not have polling \nplaces in Oregon, and it works out just fine. The State of Washington \nalso does a lot of their balloting by mail. It works out fine. Those \ntwo States decided they wanted to do what they could to increase voter \nparticipation, not cut back on it. We need to do more of that rather \nthan all these laws that are going to throw people in jail if they \nregister wrong people. I think there are so many different ways of \nchecking to make sure you have an honest election that you do not need \nto have all these punitive measures that are proposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9419-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 APOLOGY TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from Florida wants to \nspeak. I certainly want to give him that ability. But I just want to \nsay this: The Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. Senator \nDaschle is a veteran who has served in the U.S. military. He is a \nperson who has dedicated much of his legislative life to helping people \nwho have served in the military.\n  There are a lot of people who can take responsibility for dealing \nwith Agent Orange, but Senator Daschle, who is a Vietnam-era veteran, \nknows about Agent Orange, and he has worked tirelessly to get things \ndone in that regard.\n  I have worked with him on concurrent receipts. He has been a big \nadvocate of concurrent receipts. He is a person who has almost single-\nhandedly taken care of TRICARE, to make sure that National Guardsmen \nand reservists are treated more fairly with medical care.\n  To think that in any way this good man has somehow emboldened the \nenemy--and that is in the way of a fundraising letter--is not very \ngood. I know the man running against Senator Daschle. I like him. I am \njust terribly disappointed that he would allow people to use him the \nway they have. That Senator Daschle has emboldened the enemy is unfair. \nIt is outrageous. And I think that Congressman John Thune should \napologize to the people of South Dakota for suggesting that Tom Daschle \nhas emboldened the enemy. I assume he is referring to these nameless, \nfaceless, evil people who are committing this war on terror, who are \nexecuting this war on terror.\n  Senator Daschle has somehow emboldened the enemy, these nameless, \nfaceless people who are killing innocent women and children, and \nothers? I think not. And I say John Thune, whom I have the highest \nrespect for, should return the dignity to his person and disavow this \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, my family has been in Florida \nfor 175 years, and I do not remember in all of the history books where \nmajor hurricanes have happened back to back. It has happened with \nlesser hurricanes, but I think the record book was shattered when three \nlarge, major hurricanes in a row have battered our State over the \ncourse of a 6-week period: first Charley, then Frances, and now Ivan.\n  As I flew in a National Guard helicopter last Friday with the \nGovernor over the Barrier Islands, I saw there were no sand dunes \nanymore in the Barrier Islands of Pensacola Beach. The sugary white \nsand of the beaches and those sand dunes had been washed across the \nentire Barrier Island from the Gulf of Mexico to Pensacola Bay. And \nfrom the air, it appeared as if the entire Barrier Island was washed in \nwhite. There were structures standing, but the structures were usually \nthe newer ones built according to the new building codes. And as we are \nhearing in the reports out of Alabama, those structures were even \nuprooted on their foundations and have to be destroyed. If it was an \nold structure, that old structure is history.\n  For not only the howling winds of 138 miles an hour, but the tidal \nsurge of the water that came with the hurricane winds--water that then \nwashed up into the very large Pensacola Bay, even taking out major \nsections of the Interstate 10 bridge--we did some quick mathematical \ncalculations and figured that a wall of water at least 40 feet\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\nhigh would have had to hit that bridge, positioned some 12 miles from \nthe gulf up Pensacola Bay. It would take 40 feet of water to have \nenough pressure to raise the sections of Interstate 10's bridge off of \nthe pilings and deposit them in the bottom of Pensacola Bay. And in \nmany other sections of the bridge, the same effort moved it 3 and 4 \nfeet on top of the pilings.\n  Even at the end of Pensacola Bay, some 20 to 25 miles from the Gulf \nof Mexico, the wave of water was so fast and so furious that as to the \nfour-lane highway, US 90, that rings the shore of Pensacola Bay on that \nfar northern end, two lanes of those four lanes were washed out at the \nbridgeheads and thus, is complicating the rescue efforts, the \nrebuilding efforts because of traffic not being able to get to \nPensacola, with only two-way traffic open on one of those lanes that \nhad been spared.\n\n  We are finding out once again, because we keep coming with emergency \nappropriations for Federal disaster relief, that hurricanes can be \nquite costly, as we have known over the years. It was my freshman year \nin the Congress in 1979 that I voted for my first disaster relief, \nwhich was in response to the eruption of Mount St. Helens in the State \nof Washington covering so much of that State with soot and ash. But \nthat is in part what a Federal Government is for--to respond in times \nof emergency and disaster.\n  So, too, we have seen the President request $2 billion for the first \nhurricane and disaster relief--that won't take care of all of the \nrelief for Charley--and another $3.1 billion was requested for Charley \nand Frances. That certainly won't take care of those two storms because \nthere is another billion dollars of agricultural relief that is going \nto be needed that the President did not request. But we haven't even \ngotten to the third hurricane, Hurricane Ivan. As we speak, those \ncalculations are being made. This Congress is going to have to respond.\n  Last week I had a colloquy with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Alaska. He assured me and \ngave me his commitment that he would proceed on the agricultural relief \nwith regard to Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Charley in the \nconference on the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Huge parts of \nthe $65 billion-a-year agricultural industry in Florida have been \ndestroyed--citrus, both orange and grapefruit; the nursery industry, \nincluding the fern industry, of which Florida is one of the major \ngrowers of ferns; vegetables; fruits; cattle; dairy cows that dried up \nbecause they could not be milked since there was no electricity to \noperate the automatic milking machines. You can go on down the list of \nall the agricultural commodities that were hit as well as the equipment \nthose farmers owned.\n  But now with Ivan in the panhandle, we are going to have additional \nagricultural losses, particularly from cotton and peanuts. I dare say \nthat will be shared with the State of Alabama, perhaps with Georgia, as \nIvan raced across the southern United States after it had made landfall \nat the Florida-Alabama border.\n  It is interesting that in our State, having been put in hurricane \nmode for 6 weeks, people began to recover from one blow and then here \ncomes another blow. In fact, the people in the center part of the State \non the first two storms were hit twice where the two storms passed and \nhappened to cross--Charley from southwest to northeast, Frances from \nsoutheast to northwest. And they crossed their paths in the center of \nthe State.\n  Then along comes Ivan. At one point we even thought the State of \nFlorida might be spared. It looked as if it was going to be bearing \ndown on, Lord forbid, New Orleans, which is lower than sea level, or \nMississippi where so many of the establishments there, including the \ngaming industry, are on floating boats. You can imagine the wreckage \nthat would have caused.\n  But it shifted to the east, bearing down on the Florida-Alabama line, \nwith the winds coming off in a counterclockwise rotation off of the \nGulf of Mexico, in its most fierce fury, on to the shores of that \nsouthern Alabama coastline and northwestern Florida coastline.\n  That is a part of our State that has a great deal of the national \nassets of our U.S. military. Ninety percent of the buildings at the \nPensacola Naval Air Station had severe damage. At Whiting Field, where \nNavy pilots and Marine pilots and Coast Guard pilots and Air Force \npilots, both fixed wing and helicopter, are trained, all of the hangars \nsustained major roof damage with the roofs being ripped off of those \nlarge structures. So, as we have responded after the other two \nhurricanes with special appropriations to fix up those military \nfacilities so they can get back in the business of training our young \nmen and women so they can defend this country, so, too, we are now \ngoing to have to address those particular needs even as far east on \nthat Florida panhandle as Eglin Air Force Base which had its major \ntower completely taken out of commission.\n  The Senate will hear me, over and over, advocating and trying to \narticulate the needs for a State that is in crisis, a State that has \nbeen hit not once but three times by the hard and savage blows of \nMother Nature.\n  Floridians are a hardy lot. Floridians have endured hurricanes \nbefore. Floridians will do it this time. In the meantime, let's have \nthe Government do one of the things that it does best--respond to the \nneeds of its people when the needs of the people are so desperate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \ncharged under the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I have spoken often about Vladimir Putin's \n``creeping coup'' against the forces of democracy and market capitalism \nin Russia. It is with regret that I note today that the coup is no \nlonger creeping--it is running full steam ahead. President Putin is \ncrassly using the horrific Beslan attack to consolidate autocratic \nrule. The people of Russia, no safer because of the Kremlin's power \ngrab, will ultimately pay the price. Their freedom and the future of \nRussia as a democratic state are at stake.\n  The terrorist attack on a school in Beslan illustrated once again the \nugly face of extremism that will stop at nothing--not even the \ndeliberate killing of schoolchildren--in pursuit of its political aims. \nLike millions of others around the world, this terrible event moved my \nheart, and I offer my sympathy to the families who have suffered so \ngrievously throughout the ordeal. As with all deaths in terrorist \nattacks, nothing anyone does can bring back the lost. It is the duty of \npolitical leaders to remember the fallen by taking steps to ensure that \nsuch attacks do not again occur.\n  And yet Mr. Putin chose the immediate aftermath of this attack not to \naddress the root causes of Chechen terrorism, nor to take meaningful \nsteps that would enhance the safety and security of the Russian people. \nInstead, he used the attack as an excuse--an excuse to consolidate \npower and further remove the Russian people from democracy.\n  President Putin has announced that, because Russia faces terrorist \nthreats, significant changes within the government are required. In the \nbroadest sense, he is right. In the midst of the Beslan hostage \nstandoff, government officials repeatedly lied about what was happening \ninside the school. The military was unable to rescue people and could \nnot coordinate a response. Furthermore, recent accounts indicate that \nduring the near-simultaneous bombing of two Russian passenger aircraft, \nthe suicide bombers bribed their way through checkpoints and onto the \nplanes. These problems stem from the\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\nKremlin's lack of transparency, the government's lack of \naccountability, and from widespread corruption and ineptitude. And so a \nreasonable observer might guess that the Kremlin seeks governmental \nchange that addresses these problems. But a reasonable observer would \nbe wrong.\n  Instead, Mr. Putin has proposed changes that would concentrate his \npersonal power and nearly extinguish the embers of democracy in his \ncountry. His allies have told journalists that the president planned \nfor months to centralize political authority, and merely took advantage \nof the Beslan seizure to unveil the decision. And, as the Washington \nPost has pointed out, he has not removed security officials who have \nfailed to prevent repeated terrorist strikes over several years.\n  The total effect of President Putin's new proposals would be to move \nRussia a long way down the road to autocratic rule. He would eliminate \nthe popular election of Russia's 89 regional governors, and instead \nappoint them himself. He would eliminate independent members of \nparliament, so that Russians could vote only for political parties \nrather than specific candidates, Political parties--such as like the \npowerful one headed by Mr. Putin--would determine the slates. In last \nDecember's elections, district races accounted for every independent \nand liberal now serving in the Duma. Under Mr. Putin's plan, these \nraces would be abolished. I speak of all of these ideas as \n``proposals'' because the electoral changes require parliamentary \napproval. But that should not be difficult--Mr. Putin's party controls \nmore than two-thirds of the seats.\n\n  As shocking as these recent moves are, they are simply the latest and \nmost egregious in a long string of antidemocratic actions. In his time \nin power, Mr. Putin has tried to eliminate independent media by \nimposing restrictive laws. These have led to the takeover or arbitrary \nclosing of all independent national television channels. The \ninternational media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders ranked 166 \ncountries in its annual World Press Freedom report. Russia came in \n148th. Last year, five reporters were killed under suspicious \ncircumstances, and many reporters were harassed, imprisoned, or \nphysically beaten.\n  But the media is not the only sector to fear the wrath of an \nincreasingly authoritarian Kremlin. Mr. Putin has asserted control over \nRussia's energy industry and used government power--including \nimprisonment--against executives who oppose him. The world has watched \nwith concern over his single-handed attempt to put Russia's largest \nprivately held oil company out of business. And, having lost their \nrights to free speech and press and to engage freely in an open market, \nthe people of Russia are now on their way to losing the right to vote.\n  The Kremlin's imposition of old-style central control will not make \nthe people of Russia safer, it will merely curtail their freedoms. But \nterrorism in Russia does not result from too much freedom. If anything, \nit stems in part from the Kremlin's reluctance to address the \nlegitimate aspirations of the Chechen people for autonomy or \nindependence. Moving in the opposite direction, increasing central \ncontrol and decreasing the say of citizens in how their nation is \ngoverned, will do nothing but aggravate the problems for which Mr. \nPutin proposes solutions.\n  Sadly, many Russians have responded to the Kremlin's new proposals \nnot with outrage but with fearful plaudits. Regional leaders--many of \nwhom may lose their jobs when they are replace by Kremlin appointees--\nhave nevertheless praised Mr. Putin's power grab. The Tass news agency \nran a headline last week entitled ``Regional leaders hail Putin's \nlatest moves as a panacea for all Russia's ills.'' This kind of \nresponse is eerily familiar, a reminder of the ridiculous propaganda \nfed to the Russian people and the world by the Soviet police state. I \nthough that the Russian people have moved beyond this sordid past, \nthrowing off the shackles of oppression and ushering in a new day of \nfreedom. I will bet that the people of Russia though the same. But \nobviously Mr. Putin and the Kremlin have other ideas.\n  As the world's beacon of freedom and democracy, the United States \nmust make clear our fierce opposition to the path that Russia's \nleadership is currently on. As much as we value Russia's cooperation in \nother areas of our bilateral relationship, they will have little \nmeaning if Moscow reverts to it old ways. Mr. Putin, the world is \nwatching your next move.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today at the United Nations the \nPresident of the United States painted a pretty picture of the \noccupation of Iraq. But the President's picture was far from reality. \nThe reality is the situation facing our soldiers, the very limited \nIraqi security forces, and, importantly, the Iraqi people.\n  The reality is that today Iraq is in flames. A horrifying wave of \nviolence has struck yet again, targeting the Iraqi police, Government \nleaders, innocent civilians, and our very own troops. The death toll in \nIraq continues to mount. As of today, more than 1,030 American troops \nhave died in this war, a war that should not have been fought, a war \nwhich was wrong in the beginning, wrong today.\n  More than 700 Iraqi police have perished in the short time since the \nforce has existed. The numbers of civilians killed in President Bush's \npreemptive war is unknown. They may never be known. But it numbers in \nthe thousands--the widows and the orphans who have been left alone, the \ntears that have been shed.\n  Who is responsible for this bloodshed in Iraq? Is it a small group of \nreligious radicals, or the secret agents of Osama bin Laden, or \nterrorists who might otherwise sneak out onto the streets of New York \nCity? No, no, and no. An ever growing pile of press reports indicates \nthat the insurgency is larger and more broad than the White House will \nadmit.\n  On Wednesday, September 15, the Wall Street Journal reported that \n``Iraq's once highly fragmented insurgent groups are increasingly \ncooperating to attack U.S. and Iraqi government targets, and steadily \ngaining control of more areas of the country.''\n\n  That was the Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, September 15.\n  Meanwhile, the Commander in Chief, President Bush, seems to be in the \ndark about the worsening situation in Iraq. Faced with the spread of \nviolence in Iraq, the President continues to speak of Iraq as a country \nof free people. But what liberty, what liberty, is there to be enjoyed \nwhen the police are being killed by the scores, the chances of a \npeaceful election have been thrown out the window, and many Iraqis are \ntoo afraid to send their children to school?\n  One must begin to question whether the President is getting the bad \nnews about what is happening on the streets of Baghdad and Fallujah or \nif he is simply ignoring it. Surely the Commander in Chief has a \nresponsibility, has the obligation, to change his strategy when it has \nbeen proven a failure. Instead, the White House blindly insists that \nthe problems of Iraq will sort themselves out if we simply maintain a \nresolve to stay the course. Did the American people really want to stay \nthe course that has resulted in the deaths and the injuries of \nthousands of our troops?\n  Now the President wants to spend another $3.4 billion in \nreconstruction funds to again try to bolster the same Iraqi security \nforces that have been outgunned and inadequately trained to take on the \ninsurgents in Iraq. This is even more evidence, is it not, even more \nevidence that the administration had no plan, that the administration \nhas no plan for postwar Iraq, other than to throw more money at the \nproblem and hope for the best.\n  As the cost of the war continues to spin out of control, we must \nremember that last fall the Bush administration promised that its \nrequest for the biggest foreign aid package in half a century would \nbring security and stability to Iraq. The White House got enough \nMembers of Congress to vote for $18.4 billion to buy that pig in a \npoke, and the President got unprecedented flexibility to spend that \nreconstruction\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\nmoney almost as he sees fit. Has that reconstruction money helped to \nget our troops out of harm's way? Has it helped to bring our men and \nour women home? No. In fact, our troops are under a greater number of \ndaily attacks now than they were when the President asked for his \nmassive foreign aid program.\n  As the President wants to spend more and more money in Iraq, our \ntroops are getting sucked ever deeper into the bloody quicksand of the \nMiddle East. Most astonishing yet, the White House has not held anyone \nin the administration accountable for the mess that has become Iraq. It \nis business as usual in the White House bubble.\n  The Pentagon botched plans for postwar Iraq as if there ever were \nany, and the shame of Abu Ghraib has further turned world opinion \nagainst the United States. But instead of holding someone at the \nDepartment of Defense accountable for those mistakes, the Vice \nPresident said that we have the ``best Secretary of Defense the United \nStates has ever had.''\n  The CIA failed to detect Osama bin Laden's plot to attack New York \nCity and Washington, DC, and then it produced faulty intelligence that \nthe White House used to take our Nation to war against Iraq.\n  The White House misled the American people. It is a war we should \nnever have fought. It was wrong from the beginning; it is wrong today.\n  Instead of holding someone at the CIA accountable for those mistakes, \nthe President praised the former CIA Director as ``a strong leader on \nthe war on terrorism.''\n  The U.S.-run occupation government in Iraq mistakenly disbanded the \nIraqi Army, bungled the management of $18.4 billion in reconstruction \nfunds, and turned a blind eye to the rising flames of anti-Americanism \nin Iraq.\n  Instead of demanding accountability for mistakes made by the \nCoalition Provisional Authority, rumors abound that its former head, \nAmbassador Paul Bremer, could be up for a promotion to Secretary of \nState.\n  How about that? He didn't have time, he said, to come back before the \nAppropriations Committee of the Senate--I was there and asked him. No. \nHe said he didn't have time. I will not have time when the time comes \nto vote for him as Secretary of State if such nomination is ever \npresented to this body.\n  For all the mistakes that have been made in President Bush's \nunprovoked war on Iraq under the doctrine of preemption, which is \nunconstitutional on its face, and therefore it is fundamentally flawed, \nnot a single administration official has been held accountable for the \nmess that Iraq has become. Not a single administration official has \nbeen called to step aside for the mistakes they have made. In fact, the \nonly senior administration official the White House has seen fit to \nfire is the former Secretary of the Treasury, who dared to question the \nfiscal responsibility of more massive tax cuts. If this President \ncannot hold his advisers accountable for their mistakes, then the \npeople should hold this President accountable for his poor judgment.\n\n  The situation in Iraq has been elevated beyond a crisis. The White \nHouse plan for holding Iraqi elections in January 2005 is shaky and \nbecoming more so with each new attack on our troops. Instead of \ndemonstrating the leadership to bring more countries in to assist in \nrebuilding Iraq, the President pays lipservice to international help.\n  The President has only proposed to sink more taxpayer money into the \nsame failed policies that brought us to this point. We are falling \ndeeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. The President has \nfailed to act to counter the surge in violence that is costing the \nlives of our men and women in uniform.\n  How long can this bumbling by the White House go on? How long must \nour troops be tied down in Iraq? How long will we struggle without a \nplan to end the spreading violence? How long will it take for our \ncountry to turn away from this dead-end policy created by the dead-\nbrained thinking in this White House?\n  How long, Mr. President? How long?\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I present the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, let me take a moment of personal privilege to \nthank my colleagues for allowing me last night's unanimous consent \nagreement to appear on the floor of the Senate in traditional clothing \nof a Cheyenne chief.\n  This is a very special day in the lives of all Native Americans, and \na very special day in my life, too. I would hope my fellow Senators \nwould have time to visit our Nation's newest Smithsonian jewel--the \nNational Museum of the American Indian.\n  I have just come from speaking at the opening and ask unanimous \nconsent that my remarks at that opening be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNational Museum of the American Indian Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \n                           September 21, 2004\n\n       Senator Dan Inouye, my friend and colleague, to whom we owe \n     so much, often says that Washington is a city of monuments \n     and yet, there is not one monument to the Native people of \n     this land. This magnificent structure is that monument and in \n     it we will tell our story.\n       Indeed it is a monument to the Mimbres, the Anasazi, the \n     Toltecs and Hopewell, the Chacoans, the Mayans and hundreds \n     of other cultures now long gone, who lived in communities \n     called Tikal, Tenochtitlan, Cahokia and a multitude of other \n     enlightened communities while European cities were in their \n     infancy.\n       They were communities inhabited by farmers and doctors, \n     teachers and craftsmen, housewives and soldiers, priests and \n     astronomers, who with all their collective wisdom could not \n     have known that earth mother would someday be called real \n     estate. They knew not alcohol or drug abuse, Tuberculosis or \n     Cholera, Smallpox or Aids or even the common cold. How much \n     we can learn from them.\n       It is a monument to the millions of Native people who died \n     of sickness, slavery, starvation and war until they were \n     reduced from an estimated 50 million people in North and \n     Central America to just over 200,000 souls in the United \n     States by 1900. Only 400 years after the old world collided \n     with their world, the Native people of this land became \n     America's first endangered species.\n       In spite of this sad truth, this beautiful structure is \n     also a monument to the 190 thousand American Indian Veterans \n     who served with honor and courage in our armed forces, \n     defending a nation that was founded on religious freedom, yet \n     practicing their own was often against the law. They \n     faithfully carried out the orders of the Commander in Chief, \n     even though before 1924, they could not legally vote for him \n     because they were not considered citizens.\n       It is a monument to our elders, who as children, were taken \n     from their loved ones and placed in boarding schools that \n     often had the adage: ``kill the Indian to save the child.''\n       All too often they were beaten for speaking their Native \n     language or praying to their Creator. All too many chose \n     suicide as their only alternative, but those who endured \n     though shorn of their hair and stripped of their dignity were \n     never shorn of their spiritualism or stripped of their pride. \n     They are our mothers and fathers.\n       It is a monument to a people who were here before the birth \n     of a boy king in Egypt called Tutankhamen and before the \n     Greek poet Homer wrote the Iliad and before Caesar watched \n     Roman chariots race in the Circus Maximus and before Christ \n     walked the hills near the Sea of Galilee.\n       It is a monument to their gifts to humanity. Native \n     Americans are much more than a sum of gifts. They are more \n     than squash and tomatoes, corn and beans and potatoes, \n     pumpkins and peanuts, and all the medicines derived from \n     plants that began as Indian lore and are now used to save \n     lives around the world.\n       Their supreme gift to the world, in my view, even surpasses \n     the treasures you will see in this beautiful building. It was \n     a unique system of self-governance never before tried in the \n     monarchies of Europe or Asia. It is called Democracy. It was \n     a system copied from the Council Fires of the Iroquois \n     Confederacy by Benjamin Franklin and penned for a new \n     fledgling United States of America. It is still used by this \n     Nation and is copied, in part, by almost every emerging \n     Democracy in the world.\n       This system was best described by President Abraham Lincoln \n     as a government of the people, by the people and for the \n     people.\n       And last, we open this monument to all the dreamers who \n     helped make today come true.\n       As I leave public office in a few short months, I am \n     reminded of a stanza from the\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\n     Navaho chant of The Beauty Way. The Navaho people sing:\n\n     In the House of Long Life,\n     There I wander,\n     In the House of Happiness,\n     There I Wander,\n     Beauty is before me and behind me,\n     Beauty is above me and below me,\n     Beauty is all around me,\n     With it I wander,\n     In old age traveling,\n     With it I wander,\n     On the beautiful trail Am I,\n     With it I wander\n\n       Thanks to the efforts of all those assembled today and so \n     many more, we celebrate the opening of this house of \n     happiness, this house of long life and walk the trail of \n     beauty.\n       To all our Native American friends here today I say: the \n     sacred hoop has been restored. The circle is complete. And \n     the Hopi prophecy of the reemergence of the Native People has \n     come true.\n       It is now my great honor to introduce the man who, in my \n     view, is singularly the most responsible for this magnificent \n     structure.\n       He is my friend, my colleague, and my mentor.\n       Among Native Americans--whether they be from Hawaii, the \n     lower 48 or Alaska he is without peer.\n       His quiet demeanour and gentle way, his leadership and \n     perseverance, his record as a military hero, and his years of \n     service as a United States Senator are well known to all.\n       Among our Native People he is known as a warrior chief \n     among warriors.\n       Please help me welcome this great American--Senator Dan \n     Inouye of Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9423-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAREWELL TO MY SENATE COLLEAGUES\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In addition, Mr. President, since I am retiring at the \nend of this term, after 22 years in public office, let me say in all \nhonesty that, regardless of party, I have never in my life met a more \ndedicated, caring group of men and women, who are not only my \ncolleagues but also my friends. We may have our disagreements, but in \neach our own way, we know in our hearts that we are trying our best to \ndo the right thing for our Nation. And I think we probably all agree \nthat the more we adhere to the teachings of the Good Book, as we have \nbeen admonished many times, the less we would need a law book.\n  The people of Colorado have honored me for allowing me to represent \nthem in our Nation's Capital--not long by some standards, of course. \nBut I have to tell you, on each sunlit morning as I drive to work, or \neach moonlit night, particularly in the wintertime after a fresh snow, \nand I view the dome of this great building as the first or last thing I \ndo in my workday, I am just thrilled that I was here for a while and it \nwas a part of my life.\n  And now I have to tell you how much I admire and respect my \ncolleagues. Their friendship and guidance is more than I can ever \nrepay. Each is very special to me, and I certainly will not forget \nthem. Surely, when newly elected freshmen are sworn in 100 years from \nnow, and they come on this floor and open the desks and read the \nbottoms of drawers and the names of all the Senators who have \nhistorically been sworn in before them, they will see the names of \nSenator Robert Byrd, Senator Ted Stevens, Senator Dan Inouye, Senator \nTed Kennedy, and Senator Domenici of New Mexico, and they will already \nknow when they read those names they are reading the names of Members \nwho have served in this body for most of their adult lives and both \nmolded the history of this Nation and set a standard of commitment to \nexcellence for all to follow.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not thank the unsung heroes \nof this body, and those are the hard-working staff people without whose \ndedication many of us simply would not get much done. I salute them \nbecause they are not only our employees, but they are our partners in \nfinding solutions in a world that becomes more complicated with each \npassing decade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9423-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9423-S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

There will now be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe fiscal year 2005 Legislative Branch appropriations bill. I am \ngrateful for the support of my chairman, Senator Stevens, and the \nranking member of the full committee, Senator Byrd. Thanks, also, to \nthe ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Dick Durbin, who has \nbeen very supportive of the process in crafting the bill and has been a \nlongtime friend since our House days together in the other body.\n  Their support of this bill has helped us put together legislation \nthat I am very proud of, that provides adequate funding for the Senate \nand its critical support agencies, such as the Capitol Police and the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  This is my last year as chairman of the subcommittee, and I am \npleased this bill is moving forward.\n  Mr. President, this bill totals $2.46 billion in budget authority, \njust $8 million--less than one-half of 1 percent--\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nover the current year budget. Together with the House items that are \nincluded in the House-passed legislative branch bill, H.R. 4755, the \nbill will meet its allocation of $3.575 billion in budget authority.\n  Reductions totaling $332 million have been made to legislative branch \nagencies in order to meet the allocation. While this is a very tight \nallocation, all legislative branch agencies would be able to maintain \ncurrent or near current staffing levels and cost-of-living adjustments, \nand uncontrollable price-level increases would be accommodated.\n  The major change from last year's bill is the reduction in funding \nfor some major construction projects, such as the Capitol Visitor \nCenter and the Capitol Powerplant.\n  For the Senate, funding would total $725 million, $12.6 million over \nthe current budget, which is about 2 percent. Reductions to the request \nlevel have been made to reflect more accurate estimates of spending, as \nwell as funding certain fiscal year 2005 request items through \nreprogramming of fiscal year 2004 reprogrammings.\n  Funding for the Capitol Police would total $227 million, $7 million \nabove the current budget. In addition to these funds, the committee \ndirected a reprogramming of prior year funds for a total of $240 \nmillion for the Capitol Police in fiscal year 2005. This budget would \nenable the Capitol Police to maintain the current level of sworn \nstaffing and hire 50 additional civilian staff for critical \nadministrative functions.\n  The additional use of Capitol Police overtime since August has been a \nsignificant drain on their resources and may require us to find \nadditional funds for the Capitol Police when we meet with the House \nwith conference.\n  For the Architect of the Capitol, $308 million is recommended, a \nreduction of $32 million below the current budget and $171 million \nbelow the request. The recommendation reflects the need to eliminate \nlower-priority projects or items which can be deferred. It also enables \nthe Architect to focus efforts on the completion of the Capitol Visitor \nCenter.\n  The bill does accommodate the $39 million Library of Congress' \nstorage module project at Ft. Meade, which is desperately needed to \nmeet burgeoning storage needs and is a top priority for the Librarian.\n  For the Capitol Visitor Center, $7.6 million is included for start-\nup/transition to operations costs.\n  Moving to the Library of Congress, the bill includes a total of $544 \nmillion, $21 million above the current level and $17 million below the \nrequest. Current staffing levels are provided for, as well as increases \nfor the Veterans History Project, the Culpeper Audio-Visual \nConservation Center, which will begin to come on line in 2005, and \nsecurity equipment and IT system maintenance.\n  For the Government Printing Office, the subcommittee recommendation \nis $120.7 million, $30 million below the request. The reduction is \nattributable primarily to eliminating the $25 million request for GPO's \n``transformation efforts.'' While we support GPO's efforts to \nrestructure itself into a 21st century government information office, \nGPO has yet to submit a comprehensive plan for these funds.\n  The recommendation for the Government Accountability Office totals \n$470 million, $12 million above the current level but $10.5 million \nbelow the requested level.\n  Finally, the Open World Leadership Program would be funded at the \ncurrent level of $13.5 million.\n  Before I yield the floor to my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, who I have enjoyed the company of for so many years in both the \nHouse and the Senate, let me tell you in his presence, he has been an \nabsolute delight to work with. I look forward to coming back as a \nprivate citizen many years in the future to renew our friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I begin by not only thanking Senator \nCampbell for his leadership on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nLegislative Branch over the last 2 years but by congratulating him on \ntoday's events commemorating the opening of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian. This is an opening that was long overdue. I know he \nhas played a personal role, with Senator Inouye and many others, in the \nrealization of this dream.\n  It is my understanding--and he has probably made reference to it--\nthat there is the largest gathering of Native Americans and Indians in \nthe history of Washington, DC, taking place on the Mall at this moment. \nMany of them were on the planes as we came to Washington. You could \ntell they were brimming with pride over the recognition they have \nreceived, a recognition which is long overdue.\n  Senator Campbell has been a great leader in so many respects for his \nState of Colorado and for the Nation. But he has really played an \nimportant role in the conversation and dialog of the Senate. He has \nbeen a steady and reliable voice speaking for Native Americans. He \ncomes today to the floor of the Senate in tribal dress; I am sure proud \nof his heritage. When I got up this morning, I thought I would pick a \ntie that might be noticed. My guess is, in comparison to the chairman \nof the subcommittee, they won't even know I was here today.\n  I will say this: We are proud that he has made such a great \ncontribution. I know this museum means so much to him personally.\n  He is going to be greatly missed as he enters his retirement. I wish \nhim the best of luck. I only hope he will take an occasional break from \nvisiting with his grandchildren and ride his Harley Davidson back to \nWashington to visit with us from time to time. He will certainly be a \nwelcome guest when he does.\n  The fiscal year 2005 Legislative Branch appropriations bill which we \nare considering today is comprehensive, thorough, and fair, especially \nin light of the tight funding constraints we are operating under. Our \nallocation does not allow us to begin a variety of construction \nprojects throughout the complex, but all safety-related projects are \nfully funded, as they should be.\n  I thank Chairman Campbell for including me as a partner in each step \nof the process. The highlights of the bill have already been alluded to \nby the chairman. There is no point in revisiting them. I thank him \nespecially for two or three. One particular project, the Library of \nCongress Adventures of the American Mind, means a great deal to my \nState of Illinois and many other States and to many teachers. What we \nare doing is opening up the vast resources of the Library of Congress \nto be used as teaching tools across America in classrooms far and wide, \nin small towns as well as big cities. Without exception, every teacher \nI have spoken to is literally amazed at what is there in terms of \nprimary documents easily accessible to teach children about the \ngreatness of this country and to educate them to be better informed and \nmore competitive in the 21st century.\n  Before I wrap up today, I thank Carrie Apostolou of the majority \nstaff as well as Terry Sauvain, Drew Willison, and Nancy Olkewicz of \nthe minority staff, and Pat Souders from my personal staff for all \ntheir hard work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Open World Leadership Center\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Open World Program has grown from a \npilot program in 1999 to a robust program, not only in Russia but in \ncountries in both the former Soviet Union and the Baltics. I am \ngrateful to Dr. James Billington's continued leadership of Open World, \nas well as to my Senate colleagues who serve with me on the board of \nthe center and who take the time to meet with Open World delegations in \nthe United States.\n  Open World has brought over 8,000 participants to 1,254 communities \nin all 50 States. I am pleased that my home State of Alaska has \nwelcomed many delegations and strengthened ties between Alaskans and \nRussian in the Far East. I want to note that the GAO reviewed Open \nWorld from top to bottom this year and noted both the broad \nparticipation it has achieved in Russia. The GAO team traveled to \nRussia and interviewed a number of participants to determine its \nimpact. GAO reported that ``Most delegates viewed their program \nexperience very favorably and . . . have taken concrete steps to adapt \nwhat they learned from their U.S. visits to the Russian environment.''\n  Last year we asked Open World to expand its operations to new \ncounties, including strategic allies for the U.S. defense interests, \nsuch as Uzbekistan. I\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\nwould like to ask my colleagues, Senator Campbell and Senator Durbin, \nif they would like to comment on Open World's expansion.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. As co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have had a \nlong-standing interest in the progress of the countries of the former \nSoviet Union toward democracy and rule of law. Open World's staff \nworked very closely with the Helsinki Commission staff to bring \nBelarusian leaders from the parliament and judiciary to the United \nStates last February. It would be helpful for the Open World staff to \ncontinue to work closely with the Helsinki Commission staff given their \nunique expertise in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The \ndelegates had very useful programs both in Washington, DC and in \nFlorida, meeting with our congressional colleagues, State Department \nofficials, Federal judges and prosecutors. As a group the delegation \nleft with a new-found focus on building relations with the United \nStates and a genuine understanding of both transparency in our \ngovernment and separation of powers. Open World demonstrated that it \nsuccessful model could be applied outside Russia. I am also grateful \nfor the genuine involvement of American communities and families in \nbuilding the ties that are at the heart of the Open World Program. I \nwould like to see Open World continue its important work in Russia but \nenable us to utilize this flexible and cost-effective program as a \nvaluable tool for American diplomacy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to join my colleagues, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Cambell, in recognizing the important contribution that Open \nWorld has made on many fronts. Open World is unique in its place within \nthe legislative branch. When I supported the expansion to the Baltics, \non the eve of new nations such as Lithuania joining NATO and the \nEuropean Union, I hoped that the program would strengthen ties between \ncountries such as Lithuania and Ukraine that enjoy enormous diaspora \npopulations in America and remain the focus of efforts by U.S. citizens \nto build democratic institutions in these countries. Open World has \nbrought three groups from Lithuania--mayors, representatives of the \nmedia, NGO leaders--each of whom has traveled to 10 States including \nIllinois. I know firsthand from the United States Ambassador to \nLithuania, Steve Mull, invaluable it has been to have the opportunity \nto nominate young Lithuanian leaders for Open World and to see them \nreturn home with concrete ideas to develop Lithuania's local \ngovernmental structures, particularly in its rural areas. I thank \nSenator Stevens and Senator Campbell for their leadership in expanding \nOpen World. I have been pleased to support it and commend it to my \ncolleagues as an invaluable partner to those of us in the Congress \ninterested in foreign policy issues across the board.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleagues for their interest and support. In \naddition to the groundbreaking work that you have described in Belarus \nand the Baltics, I would like to point out that the Russian Federation \nhas many areas with predominantly Muslim populations--Chechnya, \nTatarstan, Baskortostan, Ingushetia--areas where Stalin deported more \nthan a million people from the North Caucasus to Siberia and Central \nAsia. I suggested to my fellow board members on Open World that we \nfocus, in particular, on these regions for 2004. We also launched a \npilot in Uzbekistan at the same time. In a matter of months, Open World \nhad found U.S. hosts and selected young leaders from these key regions; \n500 leaders traveled from the Russian Muslim republics and 100 from \nUzbekistan. The strength of Open world and its future lies with its \nability to take a simple, cost-effective model rooted in our American \ncommunities, values, and hospitality and adapt to new countries of the \ngreatest strategic interest to the United States.\n  In 2003 Congress authorized expansion of Open World to 14 new \ncountries. a number of these--Armenia, Georgia, Belarus, Moldova, \nKazakhstan--warrant their own program. I hope that we can work with our \nHouse colleagues to maintain sufficient funding for Open World to \ncontinue its success, while not diminishing terribly the important work \nit must continue to do in Russia--as important now as when I first \nhelped establish the program in 1999.\n  With my colleagues support, I would like to ask Dr. Billington and \nthe staff of Open World to explore the possibility of expansion of the \nprogram to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These countries are crucial to \nU.S. interests. Recognizing that these nations lay outside the present \nscope of Open World, I am offering legislative language that would \nallow the Board of Trustees and staff to explore the feasibility of \nexpanding the program and reporting back to the Senate and House \nappropriations Committees within 90 days. Dr. Billington is the \nLibrarian of Congress, in addition to his role as chairman of the Open \nWorld board. The Library's expertise in CRS and through its overseas \noffices will be of great assistance to Open World in responding to this \nrequest.\n  I want to thank Dr. Billington for his continued leadership. I also \nthank my colleagues, Senator Campbell and Senator Durbin, for their \ninterest in Open world and appreciation for the important work it has \naccomplished.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the pending Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2005, S. 2666, as reported by the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations provides $3.688 billion in budget \nauthority and $3.808 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2005. Of these \ntotals, $113 million is for mandatory programs in fiscal year 2005.\n  The bill provides total discretionary budget authority in fiscal year \n2005 of $3.575 billion. This amount is $403 million below the \nPresident's request, it matches the 302(b) allocations adopted by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and is $50 million more than fiscal \nyear 2004-enacted levels excluding fiscal year 2004 supplemental \nappropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n S. 2666, 2005 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                     [Fiscal Year 2005, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority...................      3,575        113      3,688\n    Outlays............................      3,696        112      3,808\nSenate Committee allocation:\n    Budget authority...................      3,575        113      3,688\n    Outlays............................      3,696        112      3,808\n2004 Enacted:\n    Budget authority...................      3,525        108      3,633\n    Outlays............................      3,520        107      3,627\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................      3,978        113      4,091\n    Outlays............................      3,887        112      3,999\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................      3,537        113      3,650\n    Outlays............................      3,690        112      3,802\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...................          0          0          0\n    Outlays............................          0          0          0\n2004 Enacted:\n    Budget authority...................         50          5         55\n    Outlays............................        176          5        181\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...................       -403          0       -403\n    Outlays............................       -191          0       -191\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...................         38          0         38\n    Outlays............................          6          0          6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nBishop Gregory Palmer to the Board of Directors of the United States \nInstitute of Peace. It has now been over a year since Bishop Palmer was \nofficially nominated on September 16, 2003. On that date, the Senate \nofficially transmitted our paperwork to the White House.\n  The reason I recommended this distinguished spiritual leader for this \nimportant position at the U.S. Institute of Peace is that I strongly \nbelieve that Bishop Palmer would work to promote a just peace in the \nworld. I don't think that there is anyone in this Chamber who would \ndisagree that we need more advocates for peace in this time of \ninternational crisis.\n  I know Bishop Palmer well. He is a native of Philadelphia, PA. He \ngraduated from The George Washington University and received a master's \nin divinity from Duke University. His father is a minister in \nPhiladelphia.\n  Bishop Palmer came to Des Moines, IA, on September 1, 2000, and he \nhas had a profound influence in our State ever since.\n  Bishop Palmer has had a distinguished career of service. He has \ntaught at the pastor's school in Burundi, and serves on the Senegalese \nTask Force of the Global Ministries. He also served as President of the \nInterdenominational Ministerial Alliance.\n  In March of this year, Bishop Palmer received the 10th Annual Bishop \nMaurice J. Dingman Peace Award. This award recognized Bishop Palmer's \ncommitment to peace and social justice. The award was presented by the \nIowa Catholic Peace Ministry.\n  One of the ways Bishop Palmer has turned Scripture into deeds is by \nstarting the Matthew 25 Ministry throughout Iowa. This ministry heeds \nthe call of Matthew 25:31-46 to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and \ncare for the sick. Bishop Palmer has provided services to our Iowa \ncommunities most in need--from English classes for immigrants to soup \nkitchens for the hungry. These laudable acts, in my view, are the works \nof a man truly committed to fostering peace and social justice.\n  I could go on and on at great length about Bishop Palmer's good \nworks, but I know that my floor time is limited. It is, however, very \nclear that Bishop Palmer would make an outstanding addition to the \nboard of directors of the\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\nU.S. Institute of Peace; therefore, I was deeply disappointed and \nsurprised that Bishop Palmer's nomination to the U.S. Institute of \nPeace has been stalled at the White House for over a year now, and his \nname was not included in the nominations to be considered by the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  I am hopeful that the White House will reconsider and send his \nnomination to the HELP Committee before Wednesday, tomorrow, when we \nare due to act upon other nominations. We have one nomination that has \ncome down to be renominated to the U.S. Institute of Peace. I am \ncertain this person will have no problem being renominated. But I was \nvery surprised, as I said, and disappointed that Bishop Palmer's name, \nwhich has been at the White House for 1 year now--1 year his nomination \nhas been sitting there, and I know of no opposition to Bishop Palmer. \nAs I said, he is head of the Methodist Church for the entire State of \nIowa. He is known nationally and internationally. I cannot think of a \nmore qualified person to be on the board of the U.S. Institute of \nPeace.\n  I am quite upset with this, and I hope that the White House will \nreconsider this nomination. It would not take but just about half an \nhour to transmit his name here, and I wish they would do that before we \nmeet tomorrow so we can report his name out and get Bishop Palmer on \nthe board of directors as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the world of politics, every election \nseems to test the bottom when it comes to mudslinging. I am afraid this \nyear's election contest is no exception, and it is plummeting hitherto \nuncharted depths.\n  Some of the things that have been said on both sides I am sure on \nreflection are going to be the source of some embarrassment, and some \nof the actions taken by both campaigns will be regretted in the future. \nBut there is one particular element in this debate in the Presidential \ncampaign that I find particularly bothersome. It relates to statements \nthat have been made by Vice President Cheney, by the Speaker of the \nHouse, Dennis Hastert, and by Members of the Senate, and others, \nrelative to the patriotism of candidates for office and relative to \nquestions as to whether the American people, by casting their vote one \nway or the other on November 2, are somehow inviting terrorism to \nstrike America.\n  Vice President Cheney, at a political rally in Des Moines, IA, \nTuesday, September 7, said:\n\n       It's absolutely essential that 8 weeks from today, on \n     November 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the \n     wrong choice, then the danger is that we'll get hit again and \n     we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the \n     standpoint of the United States. And we'll fall back into the \n     pre-9/11 mindset, if you will, that in fact these terrorist \n     attacks are just criminal acts and that we're not really at \n     war.\n\n  This quote by the Vice President received a lot of attention. The \nclear suggestion by the Vice President is that if the American people \nshould not vote for President Bush, they are inviting a terrorist \nattack. That is an outrageous statement. I think it is one that, \nfrankly, Vice President Cheney on reflection might not have made. Would \nit be appropriate to argue that since the terrorists attacked the \nUnited States while he was serving as Vice President, they saw weakness \nin the Bush-Cheney administration? I would not make that preposterous \ncharge. I do not believe anyone can. And yet here we have the Vice \nPresident suggesting that if you do not vote to reelect President Bush, \nyou are inviting a terrorist attack on the United States.\n  Just last Saturday in DeKalb, IL, the Speaker of the House, Dennis \nHastert, was quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't have data or intelligence to tell me one thing or \n     another, (but) I would think they would be more apt to go \n     (for) somebody who would file a lawsuit with the World Court \n     or something rather than respond with troops.\n\n  Speaker Hastert said that of John Kerry.\n  Asked by reporters whether he believed al-Qaida could operate better \nwith Kerry in the White House, Hastert replied:\n\n       That's my opinion, yes.\n\n  I think this is a new low in American politics. For us to suggest \nthat either major political party would field a candidate who would in \nany way knowingly or unknowingly compromise the security and safety of \nthe United States I believe is a charge that must be backed up with \nsolid evidence if it is ever going to be leveled. In this case, Speaker \nHastert said, ``I don't have data or intelligence to tell me one thing \nor another. . . .''\n  The reason I believe this is important is that when we reach the \npoint in a campaign when the Vice President suggests that a vote for \nJohn Kerry invites a terrorist attack on our country, and the Speaker \nof the House, after acknowledging he has no information to support his \nstatement, joins Mr. Cheney with the chorus of ``vote for Bush or \ndie,'' not to be outdone--and let me make it clear, I put ``vote for \nBush or die'' in quotes. That is my statement. I am not attributing \nthat to either of those individuals. So we have a situation where this \nhas become a standard charge in the campaign at the highest levels.\n\n  There was a time in American politics when people were circumspect \nabout even raising the issue of the fact that the former Governor of \nIllinois, Adlai Stevenson, had been divorced. In the 1950s, it was not \nreally considered to be appropriate to raise that in the national \ndebate, although there were certainly a lot of rumors and murmuring in \nthe background.\n  Now we see the debate on the Presidential level reaching what I think \nare new depths, where at the highest levels questions are being raised \nas to whether John Kerry would, in fact, defend the United States \nagainst a terrorist attack. I think that is a troubling development.\n  These are not the only statements that have been made. This morning \non the Fox News Channel one of my colleagues, whom I work with on a \nregular basis, Senator Hatch of Utah, raised the same issue. Others \nhave as well.\n  We saw in the debate last Saturday where John Thune, a former \nCongressman of South Dakota, was debating Senator Tom Daschle, the \nDemocratic minority leader. In the course of their debate, he argued \nthat the fact Tom Daschle had been critical of the Bush \nadministration's policies in Iraq ``emboldened the enemy.'' John Thune \nsaid that Tom Daschle's words emboldened the enemy.\n  What we have reached is the point where any criticism of our foreign \npolicy leads to the charge that we are not being patriotic, leads to \nthe charge that we would not stand up to defend America, and leads to \nthe charge that in some respects the terrorists would be emboldened by \nthose comments and our troops would be demoralized.\n  So what does that tell us? If Members of the Senate on either side of \nthe aisle stand up and are critical of our policy in Iraq, are they to \nbe targeted then as somehow selling out America, somehow guilty of \ntraitorous comments? That is what we can draw from these comments made \nby Republican leaders as well as Republican candidates.\n  Yet Senator Harkin made a statement earlier in the day which noted \nthe obvious. Even Republican Senators are being critical today of our \npolicy in Iraq. This last Sunday, Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican of \nNebraska, said, in reference to Iraq: The fact is, we are in trouble. \nWe are in deep trouble in Iraq.\n  Do we embolden the enemy by being critical of our policy in Iraq? I \ndo not think so. I think it is part of the normal political discourse \nwhich one expects in a democracy.\n  Similarly, Senator Richard Lugar, the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, a friend of mine and colleague from the \nState of Indiana, criticized what he called the incompetence in the \nadministration that has resulted in the failed Iraq reconstruction \neffort.\n  Does he embolden the enemy, demoralize the troops, by pointing out \nthese shortcomings in American foreign policy? He is a Republican \nSenator. I have\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\nnot heard Vice President Cheney or any others criticize Senators such \nas Lugar or Hagel for making these comments.\n  Senator John McCain said recently: We are not winning. Senator \nLindsey Graham said that we need to be ``more honest about how \ndifficult it will be'' in Iraq.\n  The list goes on, and the list tells me that Senators of good \nconscience on both sides of the aisle feel an obligation to disagree \nwith the President on foreign policy when they have an honest \ndisagreement and to suggest that changes in foreign policy or changes \nin military policy are important for the security of America.\n  I do not know if Vice President Cheney or the Speaker of the House \nwould criticize the fact I have been openly critical of some of the \nmilitary decisions that have been made since the invasion of Iraq. When \na man comes into my office and tells me his son is a military policeman \nin Iraq and because he cannot be issued body armor he and his wife were \nraising money at home to buy the body armor and send it to their son, I \ncame to the floor to criticize that. Of the billions of dollars we have \nsent in preparation for this war, one would think it obvious that body \narmor would be one of the first things issued to our soldiers. In this \ncase, it was not.\n  I was critical of the administration, critical of our policies, \ncritical of foreign policy and military policy. Would Vice President \nCheney argue that I am giving comfort to the enemy by suggesting that? \nI certainly hope not.\n  When we found that our Humvees were sitting targets for homemade \nbombs and rocket-propelled grenades, that we had been remiss in failing \nto equip our Humvees in Iraq with armor plating on the sides to protect \nour soldiers, many of us came to the floor and made that point, wrote \nletters to the administration, forced a change in policy, which \nresulted in more and more of these Humvees being reconstructed, refit \nwith armor to protect the troops.\n  Does the fact we were critical of the administration raise some \nquestion as to whether we are demoralizing the troops? Exactly the \nopposite occurred. When the Humvees arrived with the armor, our troops' \nmorale went up. They had a chance to survive the attack. They did not \nhave it before.\n  So Members of Congress--from Senator Kerry, through Republican and \nDemocratic Senators alike--have a moral obligation to raise those \nissues where they disagree with this administration on foreign policy \nor military policy, whether they are on the Republican side of the \naisle or the Democratic side of the aisle. This debate which we have \nseen disintegrate and descend to the levels that I have referred to \nneeds to come to an end.\n  This is not the first time those in the highest levels of political \noffice in Washington have questioned the patriotism of others in \npolitical office, have questioned whether they have the national \nsecurity of America paramount in their mind. The same thing occurred in \nthe 1950s. A Republican Senator from Wisconsin named Joe McCarthy went \nabout throwing charges at people right and left that they were not \nloyal to America; that they were, in fact, communist. He destroyed a \nlot of people. He destroyed a lot of careers in the process.\n  There came a time in the course of the Army hearings with Senator \nMcCarthy where finally one voice spoke out. That voice turned to \nSenator McCarthy and said: Have you no shame?\n  The same question needs to be asked of those who are throwing around \nso loosely these charges that either John Kerry, John Edwards, or Tom \nDaschle do not have the best interests of the United States at heart in \neverything that they do.\n  I disagree many times with my colleagues on the floor when it comes \nto foreign policy, military policy, and many other issues. Yet I have \nnever and will never ever question their patriotism. I believe that is \nbeyond the pale of ordinary political discourse. It has now become \ncommon conversation in this Presidential campaign.\n  On November 2, the voters will have the opportunity to ask the \ncandidates who use these low tactics, Have you no shame?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today our Appropriations Committee held a \nhearing and listened to distinguished individuals as to their views on \nthe recommendations for intelligence reform. At that time, we were \nprovided a statement which is entitled ``Guiding Principles for \nIntelligence Reform'' dated September 21, 2004. It is signed by the \nfollowing persons: former Senator David Boren, former Senator Bill \nBradley, former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, former Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen, former CIA Director Robert Gates, former \nDeputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre, former Senator and Presidential \ncandidate Gary Hart, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former \nSenator Sam Nunn, former Senator Warren Rudman, and former Secretary of \nState George Shultz.\n  I do call it to the attention of all Senators in connection with this \ncurrent review of the 9/11 Commission recommendations on intelligence \nreform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``Guiding Principles for \nIntelligence Reform'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Guiding Principles for Intelligence Reform\n\n       America's security depends on strengthening our \n     intelligence collection and analysis. Debate is under way on \n     intelligence reform, and harnessing the energy of an election \n     season is a healthy way to assure the issue receives the \n     attention it deserves. Racing to implement reforms on an \n     election timetable is precisely the wrong thing to do. \n     Intelligence reform is too complex and too important to \n     undertake at a campaign's breakneck speed. Based on our \n     experience in both the executive and legislative branches of \n     the U.S. government and on both sides of the political aisle, \n     these are the basic principles we believe should guide any \n     reform effort:\n\n\n                         Identify the Problems\n\n       Rushing in with solutions before we understand all the \n     problems is a recipe for failure. Only after a full \n     appreciation of the Intelligence Community's problems--and \n     its strengths--can sensible decisions be made about reform, \n     including whether to restructure. Moreover, reform will have \n     to be comprehensive to succeed. Addressing this or that \n     shortcoming--however grave--in isolation will fail to produce \n     the improvement in intelligence capabilities our nation's \n     security demands.\n\n\n             Strengthen the Intelligence Community's Leader\n\n       The individual responsible for leading the Intelligence \n     Community must be empowered with authority commensurate with \n     his or her responsibility. Specifically and crucially, future \n     leaders must have the ability to align personnel and \n     resources with national intelligence priorities. Whether we \n     maintain the Intelligence Community's current structure or \n     create a new one, we must ensure that the Intelligence \n     Community's leader has the tools to do his or her job.\n\n\n                   Separate Intelligence from Policy\n\n       A fundamental principle for Intelligence Community reform \n     must be that the intelligence community remains independent \n     from policymakers. Nothing could be more important to a \n     healthy national security structure. When intelligence and \n     policy are too closely tied, the demands of policymakers can \n     distort intelligence and intelligence analysts can hijack the \n     policy development process. It is crucial to ensuring this \n     separation that the Intelligence Community leader have no \n     policy role. Otherwise, an Intelligence Community leader's \n     voice could overwhelm those of Cabinet secretaries and the \n     National Security Advisor and deprive the President of the \n     benefit of robust, informed policy debate. A single \n     individual with the last word on intelligence and a say in \n     policy as well could be a dangerously powerful actor in the \n     national security arena-using intelligence to advocate for \n     particular policy positions, budget requests, or weapons \n     systems that others lacked the knowledge to challenge.\n       For this reason, the leader of the Intelligence Community \n     should not work inside the White House; he or she should be \n     at arm's length from the policy process, not at the \n     President's right hand. Nor should the leader become an \n     instrument of diplomacy or policy formulation; his or her \n     role should be to support others in these functions. \n     Similarly, Intelligence Community reform must not rob Cabinet \n     secretaries of their own ability to assess intelligence by \n     centralizing the bulk of assessment resources; the \n     secretaries must be able to turn to their own analysts for \n     independent perspective and be able to task the Intelligence \n     Community leader for input to the policymaking process. \n     Finally, to protect against an unhealthy mixing of functions, \n     we believe the person who is chosen to lead the Intelligence \n     Community should be broadly acceptable to both parties and \n     chosen for his or her substantive or management expertise.\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\n                    Improve the Quality of Analysis\n\n       Intellectual conformity and failure of analytical \n     imagination have been the major culprits in most intelligence \n     breakdowns, from our failure to predict accurately India and \n     Pakistan's nuclear tests, to our misjudgment of Saddam \n     Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. Improving the \n     quality of the analysis on which policy makers rely must \n     therefore be a top reform priority. The best analysis emerges \n     from a competitive environment where different perspectives \n     are welcomed and alternative hypotheses are encouraged. \n     Intelligence reform must institutionalize these traits in the \n     analytical process. To preserve their independence, analysts \n     must be insulated from policy and political pressure. \n     Finally, we must not only concern ourselves with the \n     appropriate structure of intelligence analysis, we must also \n     address the critical shortage of human expertise in critical \n     fields. Funding for programs to address this deficiency is \n     dangerously low and the trust funds for the National Security \n     Education Program will be fully depleted within the next two \n     years unless Congress acts.\n\n\n               Ensure More Effective Information-Sharing\n\n       Intelligence Community players have overwhelming cultural \n     and bureaucratic incentives not to share their information \n     with each other or with those outside the community. These \n     include a natural impulse to hoard information to protect \n     turf, and a deeply ingrained passion for secrecy. Domestic \n     agencies and foreign agencies, in particular, traditionally \n     have resisted sharing information with each other. Yet our \n     nation has learned with painful clarity that failure to \n     share, coordinate, and connect available intelligence can \n     have devastating consequences. The next time an FBI special \n     agent suspects an Arizona flight trainee is an al Qaeda \n     terrorist, the Intelligence Community needs to know. Reform \n     must fundamentally alter agency incentives and culture to \n     require sharing. This must include addressing the excessive \n     emphasis on secrecy and classification that inhibits \n     constructive, timely information flows, while continuing to \n     respect the need to protect genuine sources and methods.\n\n\n                        Protect Civil Liberties\n\n       Collection of intelligence is inherently intrusive; spying \n     on fellow citizens carries with it great potential for abuse. \n     Even as we merge the domestic and foreign intelligence we \n     collect, we should not merge responsibility for collecting \n     it. Intelligence reform might well create a single strategic \n     coordinator of domestic and overseas collection on cross \n     border threats like terrorism, but exclusive responsibility \n     for authorizing and overseeing the act of domestic \n     intelligence collection should remain with the Attorney \n     General. This is the only way to protect the rights of the \n     American people upon whose support a strong intelligence \n     community depends.\n\n\n    Preserve Situational Awareness for Tactical Military Operations\n\n       As we have seen from the skies over Bosnia to the sands and \n     cities of Afghanistan and Iraq, tactical intelligence and \n     situational awareness are indispensable to our military's \n     unparalleled operational success. Any successful intelligence \n     reform must respect the military's need to maintain a robust, \n     organic tactical intelligence capability and to have rapid \n     access to national intelligence assets and information.\n\n\n         Assure Clarity of Authority for Clandestine Operations\n\n       The war on terrorism has blurred agency roles for some \n     critical national security activities. The Department of \n     Defense now performs more clandestine and intelligence \n     operations than in the past; meanwhile, the CIA's Directorate \n     of Operations engages more in traditional military functions, \n     such as the successful campaign in Afghanistan. Authority for \n     these newer roles is murky, and there are sometimes \n     disparities in the type or level of approval needed for an \n     operation, depending on who performs it. The new challenges \n     we face mandate a wide range of tools and creative approaches \n     to intelligence. But establishing absolute clarity of chain \n     of command, oversight, and accountability for clandestine \n     operations is essential.\n\n\n                   Reform Congressional Oversight Too\n\n       Intelligence reform will not succeed unless Congressional \n     oversight of the Intelligence Community becomes more \n     effective as well. Rather than relying on review of agency \n     submissions and after-the-fact investigation of failures or \n     abuses, Congress should reach out periodically to test and \n     assure the Community's health. Whether meaningful legislative \n     oversight demands a major overhaul of committee structure or \n     merely a change of philosophy, Congressional reform is as \n     vital as changes affecting the Executive Branch.\n       Elections are a perfect time for debate, but a terrible \n     time for decision-making. When it comes to intelligence \n     reform, Americans should not settle for adjustments that are \n     driven by the calendar instead of common sense; they deserve \n     a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to these critical \n     issues. If, as seems likely, Congress considers it essential \n     to act now on certain structural reforms, we believe it has \n     an obligation to return to this issue early next year in the \n     109th Congress to address these issues more comprehensively. \n     We hope the principles we've suggested will help shape \n     serious discussion of reform.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was at that hearing this morning when \nHenry Kissinger made his presentation, and I was extremely pleased that \nit was a bipartisan and balanced presentation. Instead of fingers being \npointed or accusations being made about what we ought or ought not do \nin a post-9/11 Commission era, what Henry Kissinger said was, caution. \nIn a political year that is ripe with political innuendo, be careful \nwhat you create because you might not like it after the fact, that \nrecreating the intelligence community of this country and of this \ngovernment is tremendously important, but it needs to be done well so \nwe don't get the wrong results.\n\n  I think all of us recognize the dysfunctional character of our \nintelligence community and the results that it yielded, and why there \nwas a 9/11, and why a 9/11 Commission was developed, and why we are \nworking now in the Governmental Affairs Committee to try to craft and \nchange the character of that intelligence community.\n  It was a very positive hearing this morning. I was pleased by the \nbipartisan approach, which will disallow any candidate out there from \nopportunistically pointing a finger and saying you are or you are not \ndoing something in the right manner. It was well presented this \nmorning.\n\n\n                  Measure Read the First Time--S. 2823\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that S. 2823 is at the desk, \nand I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2823) to provide for adjustment of status of \n     certain foreign agricultural workers, to amend the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act to reform the H-2A worker \n     program under that Act, to provide a stable, legal \n     agricultural workforce, to extend basic legal protections and \n     better working conditions to more workers, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for its second reading, and in order \nto place the bill on the calendar under provisions of rule XIV, I \nobject to further proceedings on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will receive its \nsecond reading on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank you for that process.\n  What I have just done will result in placing the Agricultural Job \nOpportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--the AgJOBS bill, or S. 2823--\non the calendar for future consideration by this Senate. There is a \ngreat deal of work that has not been done by the Senate this year. The \nissue of immigration reform, especially that affecting well over 1.5 \nmillion undocumented agricultural workers of our Nation, is, in my \nopinion, a critical issue.\n  In a post-9/11 era, what we have said about our country, and what our \ncitizens are saying, is pretty straightforward. They are saying control \nthe borders, identify those who are within, and arrest those who are \nundocumented or illegal or who might perpetrate harm to this Nation.\n  I agree with those very fundamental principles that retain the \ncharacter and the integrity of our country. But what we are also \nfinding in a post-9/11 era is that our negligence as a country, our \nresponsibility as legislators in failing to produce a workable \nimmigration policy, has resulted in between 8 million and 12 million \nundocumented foreign nationals in our country. Many of them--frankly, \nmost of them--are hard-working human beings who have contributed a \ngreat deal to our country and to our country's economy.\n\n  In the area of the agricultural economy, that is especially true. In \nthe agriculture of Idaho and most of our States in the Nation, \nundocumented workers play a very significant role in the normal \nprocessing and functioning of agriculture itself, the production of the \nfood and fiber that make it to the shelves of the supermarkets and the \ntables of the families across our country. We now attempt policy that \ntightens our borders, but we also need to recognize our immigration \nproblems will not be solved by simply wanting to penalize. Instead, we \nneed to manage; controlling and shaping a better system;\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\nunderstanding the importance of that workforce to the Nation on the one \nside, and on the other side, recognizing the sheer humanitarian \ncharacter and responsibility we have as Senators and as those who form \npublic policy.\n  Last year, on the United States-Mexican border, over 300 people died \ntrying to make it across the border to identify with a job in this \ncountry. Many of them died of heat or lack of water in the deserts of \nArizona and New Mexico near Mexico. That is a tragedy in its own right \nand a crisis in the making. But it is a tragedy that is a result of bad \nlaw that doesn't function well, and a law that will not function well \nuntil we adjust it and change it. That is why in working with all the \ninterested groups over the last 5 years, Ted Kennedy, Chris Cannon and \nHoward Berman in the House, and I have produced the legislation that is \nat the desk. It has been vetted well. It has the support of a \ntremendous community of interest, from growers and employers on one \nside to agricultural workers on the other side. It has the support of a \nhistoric, bipartisan, and diverse national coalition. It is a bill that \nshould be considered by this Congress. It is a bill that will pass the \nSenate because we now have over 60 cosponsors. It is a bill whose time \nhas come, but is it is a bill that possibly will not find time this \nyear simply because of the shortness left in this session and the work \nthat is necessary to be done?\n  I have worked with the leader and will continue to work with the \nleader to see if we can't find that window of opportunity to vote our \nexpression on this most important issue, this year, sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I have chosen this rule XIV process to make the legislation current \nat the desk to start the process to see if we might find that window of \ntime in which to debate and vote on what I think is one of America's \nmost important issues: immigration reform, controlling our borders, \nidentifying undocumented people in this country, doing background \nchecks, and the vetting of their character which is necessary to \ndetermine whether they are here and constructive, or whether they are \nhere with a destructive thought in mind, a destructive thought against \nU.S. citizens, as we found on 9/11 a few years ago. Bringing the \nundocumented out of the shadows not only helps these workers who add to \nthe economy and pay taxes, but it also would help our homeland \nsecurity.\n  Many of us are determined to deal with this issue now. If we don't \ndeal with this now, there is no question in my mind that I and others \nwill make it a No. 1 issues in the next session of Congress. This is an \nissue that legislators cannot turn their backs on. It is an issue that \ncries out for resolution.\n  I believe S. 2823 is a proper solution to a major segment of that \nvery large problem in this country.\n  I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9430-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9430-S9432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I found today to be a rather startling \nday by virtue of the news we have heard about what is happening with \nour troops in Iraq, what is happening to those who are in battle, those \nwe are asking to carry on the battle for, let me call it, the \nliberation of Iraq, the opportunity to turn that society into a \ndemocratic society. This was brought to me by virtue of a couple of \nthings that happened.\n  First, I participated with colleagues in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee markup of intelligence reform. It is a task that I and so \nmany others on the committee, and throughout this body, take very \nseriously. We are upset about what happened on 9/11. We just \ncommemorated the third anniversary of that horrific day. I went to a \ncommunity in New Jersey, Middletown, NJ, and spoke to a group that \nincluded survivor families of 9/11. Thirty-seven of their residents \nlost their lives on that terrible day.\n  I walked around the memorial walk they established and saw pictures \nplaced on granite stones of those who perished, with messages of love \nand longing for fathers who died, for brothers, for sisters, and for \nmothers who were killed that day, murdered. It digs further into the \nsearing memory of that fateful day.\n  It reminds all of us about what our responsibilities are to try and \nget this country back on an even keel and to stop mourning the loss of \nyoung people because though we struggled hard to turn out our bill on \nintelligence reform this day, we did not complete it. But there is a \nfair degree of optimism that we will come to at least an initial \ndescription of what the intelligence-gathering mechanism might be.\n  Then this afternoon I heard President Bush say something that I found \nalmost incomprehensible, extremely disturbing about our Nation's \nintelligence-gathering system. A few hours after the President spoke at \nthe United Nations about why we went it alone in Iraq, President Bush \nwas asked by a reporter about a CIA report that he received last month \non the deteriorating situation--as a matter of fact, I believe it was \nin July--the deteriorating situation in Iraq which could even lead to a \nfull-blown civil war.\n  The President dismissed the CIA report and said it was ``just \nguessing.'' Just guessing. Imagine, we are over 1,000 deaths, thousands \nof injuries, many of them very serious--if one wants to see how \nserious, go down to Walter Reed Hospital and interview some of those \nwho survived these attacks and see how they feel about what is taking \nplace.\n  We are just guessing? The CIA is just guessing? If the President \nthinks our Nation's intelligence system is just guessing, then we are \nin trouble. The President's comments are a frightening sign that he is \nnot living in reality and that he continues to ignore the truth about \nwhat is happening on the ground in Iraq.\n  I am going to quote what the President said this day, September 21:\n\n       The CIA laid out a--several scenarios that said, life could \n     be lousy, life could be OK, life could be better, and they \n     were just guessing as to what the conditions might be like.\n\n  Talk about casual dismissal of the trauma that family after family \nacross this country faces. Over 33 former residents of New Jersey paid \nwith their lives, all young. When I talk to those families or go to a \nfuneral, there is such distress and grief.\n  I talked briefly before about these granite markers in a memorial \nbuilt in Middletown, NJ. All of these granite memorials had legends or \nquotes from the family like ``Daddy, I miss you''--quotes that were so \ntender. One said, ``If love could have kept you alive, we would be \nhaving a good time right now.'' They are the saddest things.\n  The reality is that these are not gravestones. These are granite \nmarkers done very gracefully throughout a walkway in this park with, \nagain, a marble plate on top, an inscription from a family member, and \na picture of the individual. Several men were pictured in tuxedoes. I \nthink the idea was to say that life was so full and so happy for these \nfamilies.\n  When we look now at where we are, we see the President suggesting \nthat maybe the CIA is just guessing as to what conditions might be \nlike. President Bush ignored some intelligence reports he did not like \nbefore he went to war. Now when intelligence contradicts him, he \ndismisses the content of the report as mere guessing.\n  When the Central Intelligence Agency sends the President a report \nthat lays out three scenarios for Iraq with the most rosy, the status \nquo, an average of 87 attacks a day against our troops, 1,035 dead to \ndate, the President dismisses it as guesses? What an insult to the \npeople in our country and to those families. I would like the President \nto stand in front of some of those survivors and say: Your son died. It \nis terrible. We made mistakes. The CIA was just guessing about what \nmight be.\n  Look at where we are. Look at what is taking place. Today's \nWashington Post has a story about the comments of a general who defends \nthe pace of the Iraqi training. Army LTG Walter Sharp, speaking to \nreporters at the Pentagon, also disputed the accuracy of some of the \nDemocratic Presidential nominee's new criticism of the pace of training \nfor Iraqi police.\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\n  I had the opportunity to visit in March with several other Senators--\nSenator Levin of Michigan; Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia; \nSenator Reed, who trained very thoroughly in the military at West \nPoint; and Senator Bingaman--and the situation looked grim at that \ntime. It was said that we are going to turn over governing to an \ninterim council of Iraqis, and then we are going to have a vote in \nJanuary of next year that would determine the more or less permanent \nstructure at least for the next term of leadership in the country. Here \nwe have these boldfaced statements that say he believes that based on \nwhat we will be able to do, there will be local control for the \nmajority of the country by the end of December. Control is not just a \nmatter of having Iraqi security forces in place, but also an assessment \nof the ability of local political leaders to govern and to oversee \neconomic reconstruction efforts.\n  When I was in Iraq with four of my colleagues and we went to a police \nacademy where they were training those who would soon be police \nofficers, if memory serves me correctly, the pace was that they would \ntrain about 80 in 6 weeks. Since they needed over 50,000 more, I did a \nquick calculation and came up with the conclusion that it would be many \nyears before they filled the full complement of those necessary. Then \nwe find out that a lot of these people are entirely unqualified to take \nthese tests: no driver's license, no capacity to read or write, no \nunderstanding of what the assignment is, a lot of washouts. Then they \nsay by January the Iraqis are going to be able to take over? It is not \nfair. It is not fair to say these things because everybody knows it is \nnot the truth by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n  The President has to stop ignoring the crisis our troops face in \nIraq. He has to begin to speak in the real world, with real words, \nwhere things are not always good, where serious problems need to be \naddressed.\n  I find it so offensive that someone who served his country, received \nthree Purple Hearts, a Silver Star, and a Bronze Star--now, I wore a \nuniform and I know what those medals mean. They mean a lot. I did not \nearn any, but I tried to do the job I knew best. I served in World War \nII. I was 18 when I enlisted. I know those medals are only given when \nthe qualifications are attested to by medical officers who look at a \nwound and say, yes, this wound deserved the recognition of a Purple \nHeart, three of them. And now we want to talk about, well, how deep was \nthe wound, was there any blood. When someone loses their hearing in \nbattle, maybe there is no blood, but there is no hearing. It is still a \nwound, and a very serious one.\n  After going to a funeral of a young man from New Jersey at Arlington \nCemetery, I went to Walter Reed afterward to meet with some of those \nwho had survived battle. There was one young man there who was \nsightless. He was there with his wife, and he said to me: Senator, I \nwill not be able to see my 28 month old daughter again, but I just want \nto hold her. He said: I am going to try my best to get along in life. \nIt was painful to witness, but imagine how painful it is to be the \nvictim.\n  It is hypocritical when we compare the service of John Kerry, though \nhe was critical after the war, but he had the decency and the courage \nand the honor to serve his country when he was called on to do it. He \ndid not question why, he did not question live or die, he said: I will \ndo my duty to the best of my ability. The President's record does not \nindicate the same interest in serving. As a matter of fact, I saw a \nreproduction of an application for service in the military that said: I \ndo not choose to serve in combat. He checked it off. That is all right. \nEverybody has a right to make those choices. But then to blacken \nsomeone else's character who did it and try to humiliate that \nindividual so that he looks like he is unpatriotic, that he wants \nSaddam Hussein in there? It is atrocious. It is not honest. It is \nscandalous, and that is what is happening.\n  I offer a plea. Let President Bush and Vice President Cheney talk \nabout what they want to do for the country, talk about when we can see \nan end. They talk about John Kerry not having a plan for getting us out \nof Iraq. Has anybody heard President Bush's plan for getting out of \nIraq? No one. Smoke and mirrors, the ugliest type. One need only turn \non the television, pick up the newspaper, listen to the radio and know \nthings are falling apart in Iraq. We have heard it confirmed by \ndistinguished colleagues from that side of the aisle, people who fought \nbravely, were in battle, know what it is like to see comrades die or \nescape with their lives, wounded in the process. They don't think \nthings are going well. Look at the statement of Senator Hagel of a \ncouple of days ago, or Senator McCain's statement. We see they see a \ngloomy picture ahead.\n\n  Today saw the second day of beheading of two Americans, savagery the \nlikes of which we should never witness--cutting off a man's head.\n  I know one thing. This vulgar language has to stop. Shame on the \nPresident of the United States for belittling the record of someone who \nserved so well and who did what he had to do, as his country requested \nit. If he had objections, he had objections, but it was after he \nserved. It was after he was wounded three times and after he got the \nSilver Star for valor and after he got the Bronze Star for valor. It \nwas afterward, but he served. First he did the thing he had to do. That \nbrings a different level of experience than someone who only talks \nabout how soft he is on defense. Patriotism? To suggest he is not a \npatriot? To suggest he would rather see Saddam Hussein in place? It is \noutrageous and the American public should not believe it.\n  I call on veterans, who belong to whatever association, who served in \nwhatever war, whether it was those who are still alive from World War \nI, World War II, Vietnam, Korea: Veterans, stand up and object. Don't \nlet them say that about our comrade in arms. Don't let them question \nwhether the wound was deep enough. You want to offend 270,000 people \nwho got Purple Hearts in Vietnam? Should we go back and remeasure the \ndepth of those wounds, see how much blood was let because they were hit \nby enemy fire?\n  It is not fair. I hope veterans across this country will disavow that \nkind of talk, that kind of suggestion, that kind of innuendo about \nsomeone who fought and disagreed with the policy--who first fought and \nthen disagreed--in this sinister game being played by those who would \nchallenge the heroism in the award of those medals which were certified \nby John Lehman, Secretary of the Navy, and another by the senior \nadmiral in charge of the fleet in Vietnam. To challenge whether those \nmedals were properly awarded is an outrage.\n  I think it is time to face up, tell the truth, discuss the issues and \nstop the name calling. Especially stop the accusation that someone who \nlost three limbs--as in the case of Max Cleland, who was defeated in \nhis reelection attempt because it was said that he was soft on \ndefense--wasn't patriotic enough. Maybe they were suggesting it is too \nbad he didn't lose the fourth limb. These are outrageous statements.\n  No, we cannot conduct ourselves like this. The American people see \nthe hypocrisy. What it says is, if you can dismiss the truth and \nreplace it with lies, replace it with distortion, replace it with \ninsult, that is a way to build character for our young people. I defy \nthat kind of performance, that kind of suggestion. It should not \nhappen.\n  I am disturbed by the fact that two Americans had their heads cut \noff, punishment for something we don't understand. They were trying to \nbring democracy to a country that right now is not prepared for \ndemocracy. But we insist that that is what they want. Their country is \nbeing destroyed by insurgents. Their lives are being destroyed. However \nmany we have lost, the Iraqis have lost far more.\n  The insurgents are intimidating those who would serve in the military \nand the Iraqi force. They are removing the incentive for those who want \nto be in law enforcement. They are totally intimidating those forces \nwho would stand up and fight. Yet we continue to paint the rosy \npicture, like the President did a year ago May when he said ``bring \nthem on.'' They brought them on, all right. They brought them on as we \nnever wanted to see them.\n  We have to stop this character assassination and these attacks. I \nhope we can muster the courage to do it in this place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ramey\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SSG \nRichard Ramey, from Perry Township, in Stark County, OH. He died on \nFebruary 8, 2004, when his convoy was attacked in Mahmudiyah, Iraq--a \nvillage 20 miles south of Baghdad.\n  Richard lived life well. He made good choices. He never took the easy \npath. He never shied away from a challenge.\n  That is what drew him to the military. He pursued a career as a \nsoldier knowing the possible dangers. Richard took on one of the most \nrisky jobs in the Army. He took on the responsibility of explosive \nordnance disposal. This meant, simply, that if someone found a bomb on \nthe side of the road, or in a building, or anywhere, Richard's task was \nto disarm it.\n  Many of us would wonder why he volunteered for such a dangerous \nposition. But Richard would have a simple answer. He did it to protect \nand ensure the safety of his comrades and the Iraqi people. He did it \nbecause he was never afraid to do what needed to be done.\n  Richard was born on November 6, 1976, to loving parents, Jerry and \nJulie Ramey. Jerry can still remember looking at Richard when he was in \nthe hospital baby room. He could not help but laugh at Richard's curly \nbrown hair with its frosted tips.\n  As a boy, Richard was known for hanging around the Perry Township \nfire station where Jerry was a volunteer fire investigator. Richard \nloved the excitement of the fire station and being there spending time \nwith his dad.\n  At Perry High School in Massillon, OH, Richard made a lasting \nimpression on all who met him. English teacher and assistant football \ncoach Bob Kilpatrick remembered Richard as:\n\n       A good guy--a solid citizen. He came to class with his work \n     done, came to practice ready to practice, and came to the \n     game ready to play.\n\n  Richard was a great football player with an even greater work ethic. \nAs an offensive guard and tackle, he was known for his hard hitting and \ndetermination to play despite an injury to his shoulder. Richard's \ncoaches remember that even at practices in the summer heat, he would \nalways be smiling.\n  Speaking of smiling, Richard was known for his sense of humor. One \ntime, he described eggs as ``liquid chickens'' to his teacher--a \nproclaimed vegetarian. The teacher swore off eggs shortly thereafter.\n  Richard loved the outdoors. He loved to camp, hike, explore caves, \nand climb. He especially loved to fish. Richard's friends fondly recall \nhow he always caught bigger fish than they did no matter what kind of \nbait they used or what kind of fishing pole they had.\n  Richard had the same passion for the military that he did for the \noutdoors. Even as a youngster, Richard's parents knew he would join the \nmilitary. On Halloween, he would dress up as Rambo or G.I. Joe. Friends \nremember that at sleepovers, Richard would make them watch his favorite \nmovie, ``Red Dawn''--a film about foreign armies taking over the United \nStates.\n  In third grade, Richard's teacher asked the students to write a \nsentence about what they wanted to do when they grew up. Richard \nresponded, ``I will go to war and fight if I have to''--a motto he \ncarried with him throughout his all too short life.\n  After high school, Richard joined the Army and entered the service on \nhis mother's birthday. He carried on the military tradition of his \nfamily. His dad served 4 years in the Navy, and grandfather Bernard \nRichard, Sr. fought in World War II, notably at the Battle of the \nBulge.\n\n  While Richard's mother knew that her son would follow his beliefs and \ndo what he felt he needed to do, all she asked was that he call her \nevery week--and he did. She said that ``Richard loved to do his job. No \nmatter where it would take him. He really felt deeply that he wanted to \nprotect people who couldn't protect themselves.'' She understood that \nit took a special person to do what Richard did.\n  Richard's comrades loved him. They trusted him with their lives. And \nthey had fun together. SSG Max Voelz, a member of Richard's unit, \nremembers the stories Richard would tell and the pranks he loved to \nplay on people. In one instance, Richard filled an officer's room with \nballoons from the floor to the ceiling.\n  Richard served at the White House, in Kosovo, and in Egypt before his \nunit was transferred to Iraq. While in Iraq, he witnessed several \ntragic events. In December, Richard watched helplessly as one of his \ncomrades and closest friends was killed while trying to defuse a bomb. \nClearly shaken and understandably ``numb,'' Richard called home for \nsupport from his parents. Shortly thereafter, Richard found himself in \nclose proximity to another exploding bomb. Shrapnel hit his face and \nruptured his eardrum. Through it all, Richard's unit became very close. \nThey were family, both at home and in Iraq.\n  Despite these difficult times, Richard did not lose sight of his \nultimate goal--to help those who could not help themselves. And that is \nwhy he was determined to continue his career in the military. While \noverseas, he enlisted for 6 more years and was looking forward to his \nnext assignment in Alaska. His mom and dad were planning on driving him \nthere.\n  Richard Ramey always will be remembered for his bravery and \ndedication to helping make the world a safer place. In the words of his \nfather, Richard lived 80 years in 27--and in those 27, he made a \ndifference.\n  In Massillon, OH, this past February, hundreds of soldiers, \nfirefighters, police, Boy Scouts, sailors, and family and friends paid \ntheir final respects to this American hero. Outside the church and \nalong the funeral possession, many more braved the cold to show their \nsupport to the Ramey family by waving flags and holding signs. At Perry \nHigh School, a memorial plaque and photograph hangs in the hall as \ntribute to the school's brave alumnus.\n  Richard will forever live on in the hearts and minds of all those who \nhad the privilege of knowing him, including his parents Jerry and \nJulie, sister Sarah, and brother-in-law, Nicholas. The Reverend Thomas \nDyer, who spoke at Richard's funeral service, said it best:\n\n       [Richard] goes on in our memory with the powerful lesson to \n     each one of us--to make of ourselves the best we can--to make \n     a difference in our home and community.\n\n  Indeed, Richard made the best of himself and, in doing so, made a \nvery real, very lasting difference in this world.\n\n\n               Staff Sergeant Lester ``Buddy'' Kinney, Ii\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young Ohioan who lost \nhis life in the service of our country--a young Ohioan who dedicated \nhimself to preserving the safety of his family, his friends, the Iraqi \npeople, and his fellow Americans.\n  Army SSG Lester Kinney II was known to his family and friends by a \nnickname that exemplified his outlook on life, as well as the way he \ntreated all who had the privilege of knowing him--and that nickname was \n``Buddy.''\n  Buddy was born on February 28, 1976, and grew up in Muskingum County, \nOH. His mother, Barbara, fondly remembers his love for animals, classic \ncars, Johnny Cash, and blue-grass music. As a young boy, Buddy loved to \nplay pranks on people, especially on Halloween, greatly increasing the \npopularity of his family's Zanesville home on the holiday.\n  Buddy attended John Glenn High School, where he played baseball and \nbasketball. Described as ``everybody's kid,'' Buddy was the kind of guy \nyou wanted on your team. He was always a team player. And he was always \nin a good mood and could get along with anyone--and everyone. People \nliked Buddy Lester. As his former high school principal, Gary Lucas, \nsaid:\n\n       Everybody would be glad to have him as their son. He's the \n     kind of kid you'd be glad to take home to meet your parents.\n\n  After graduating from high school in 1994, Buddy enlisted in the \nArmy. His mother recalled that Buddy had always liked the ``Be All You \nCan Be'' commercials and was determined to join the Army from the time \nhe was just 8 years old.\n  Buddy Kinney served in Afghanistan for most of 2003, where he earned \na number of awards and decorations for his service and leadership. \nThese include the Bronze Star, Expert Infantry Badge, Combat Infantry \nBadge, Army Service Ribbon, Army Commendation Medal, Good Conduct \nMedal, Parachutist Badge, Jumpmaster, and Air Assault Badge.\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\n  As a section leader in Afghanistan, Buddy was proud that after more \nthan 150 movements in that dangerous country, none of the soldiers \nunder his direction were ever injured.\n  Clearly, Buddy was one of this country's finest soldiers. However, he \nwas more than just a great soldier--he was a family man and a model big \nbrother.\n  Kurtis Bennett loved his big brother. He looked up to him. He \nrespected him. He wanted to be like him. When Kurtis' father passed \naway, Buddy became the male figure in his life. Kurtis quickly learned \nthat he could count on his brother Buddy for anything.\n  Kurtis fondly remembers how supportive Buddy was of his decisions. \nWhen Kurtis graduated from high school, he told his big brother that he \nwas thinking of taking a year off before going to college. Buddy \nthought that was a good idea. However, the military recruiters came \ncalling and Kurtis decided to sign up. Buddy was proud of his younger \nbrother and helped him decide on joining the Army because of the \nopportunities it would provide. Buddy was only a phone call away when \nKurtis went through basic training. When the two were serving overseas, \nKurtis would make sure to call his brother whenever he could.\n  Buddy Kinney had big plans for his life. He married the love of his \nlife, Marisa, on November 24, 2001. Though their married life together \nwas short, it was rich and meaningful. He loved Marisa dearly.\n\n  Buddy's military career also brought him great fulfillment and \nmeaning. He made 58 jumps as paratrooper, only 2 jumps away from \nearning a gold star above his parachute wings. He was known for making \nthe best of his opportunities. While stationed in Alaska, Buddy learned \nto ski, and while in Hawaii he learned to surf. Buddy was proud of his \nservice and believed in what he was doing.\n  After his service in Iraq, Buddy was hoping to become a warrant \nofficer and a helicopter pilot. But, tragically, Lester ``Buddy'' \nKinney's dreams were cut short. This country lost one of its finest on \nJanuary 27, 2004, when a roadside bomb exploded while Buddy was \nconducting a dismounted patrol near Iskandariyah, Iraq. He had been \nassigned as the section leader to Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 505th \nParachute Infantry Regiment, based out of Fort Bragg, NC.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Buddy's family and some of his friends \nat a service held in his honor. Each remembers Buddy's smiling face and \npositive attitude. I was particularly moved by a letter that his \ncomrades from their service in Afghanistan wrote. It read in part:\n\n       We could not ask for a better friend or leader. From the \n     dusty mountains of Afghanistan to the hot, flat desert of \n     Iraq, we will always have a seat open for you.\n\n  We will always have a place for Buddy in our hearts. He will be \ncherished forever in the memories of his beloved wife Marisa, mother \nBarbara, stepfather Jack, brother Kurtis, sister Jodi, grandmother \nNita, and many aunts, uncles, cousins, comrades, and friends.\n  Lester ``Buddy'' Kinney is an American hero, and may we always \nremember the sacrifice he made for us and for our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TALENT).

Mr. President, it is after Labor Day so the campaign \nrhetoric is in full bloom. One thing we have already heard and continue \nto hear is this charge of a ``do-nothing'' Congress. And in yet another \ngreat paradox unique to this town, we find those who complain that the \nSenate is not driving ahead and are themselves the roadblock to \nprogress.\n  For a year and a half we have seen a stall ballgame for the ages, an \neffort to run out the clock on this session practically before it \nbegan. We have seen unprecedented obstruction by a determined minority. \nSadly, tactics not employed since the founding of the Republic have \nbecome commonplace in this body. We have seen tactics employed not only \nagainst highly controversial items but against noncontroversial, \nbroadly supported items, too.\n  The CARE Act, which provides numerous tax improvements to assist and \nempower those who run, contribute, and benefit from our charitable \norganizations passed the Senate 95 to 5. No Democratic Senator voted \nno. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to let \nthis bill go to conference and, therefore, it lies near death.\n  Fortunately, I understand that the IDEA bill, which reforms and \nenhances the funding of education for disabled children--which passed \nthe Senate 95 to 3--may well be going to conference tonight. If so, \nthat is excellent movement in the right direction.\n  The Workforce Investment Act, which authorizes the worker training \nprograms for young people, dislocated adults, veterans, Native \nAmericans, seasonal workers, and migrant workers, passed the Senate \nlast year by unanimous consent. No one objected. Yet this bill also has \nnot been able to go forward. Think about it. Bills virtually with no \nvoiced opposition are being stopped by a silent and shadowy force, and \nthe American people are being denied better jobs, better education, and \na more compassionate society all because of a pattern of obstruction.\n  I think the practitioners of this obstruction owe an explanation to \nthe American people as to why they are blocking these widely supported \nbills that they previously voted for on the Senate floor.\n  Fortunately, the majority leader's extraordinary effort and patience \nhas enabled much to be done in spite of the obstruction. We have passed \ntax cuts to get the economy going again, and it sure is going again. We \nhave passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit that is giving seniors \nan immediate helping hand with a full comprehensive benefit to start in \nabout 15 months. We have passed a Do-Not-Call Registry and the Healthy \nForest Act, the partial-birth abortion bill, and the NATO enlargement \ntreaty. But that was last year. What about this year?\n  We passed into law a pension relief and stabilization plan for \nprivate sector businesses, workers, and their retirees. We passed into \nlaw a BioShield Act to improve countermeasures from biological, \nchemical, and other terrorist attacks. We passed into law the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act and also a Defense appropriations bill, as well \nas a supplemental for operations in Iraq.\n  So much has been accomplished, but much more can and should be done. \nI call on our colleagues to allow us to move forward on the Workforce \nInvestment Act and CARE right now so we can have an America with \nworkers trained for the modern workplace, a better educational \nenvironment for our children, and a more compassionate safety net for \nour citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make a brief statement. I have \nalready spoken today on the issue Senator McConnell has presented to \nthe body. It was done earlier today by the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania on the CARE Act, a bill that the minority wants to \nbecome law. But as I said to the Senator from Pennsylvania through the \nChair, there are other ways of doing this than to conference. I have a \nlist of a series of bills that have passed in this body, have been \nnegotiated between the House and the Senate, and that did not go to \nconference. I don't know the exact number, but scores of bills passed. \nThe same thing could be done with the CARE Act. The same could be done \nwith the Workforce Investment Act.\n  I say to my distinguished counterpart, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, that the risk for Republicans is\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\nthat their strategy may just be too obvious. The majority has become so \nunyielding at times that it seems more devoted to tagging Democrats \nwith the obstructionist label than getting legislation passed. Bills \nhave been abandoned rather than let Democrats have the votes on \namendments they demand, such as a minimum wage increase or rules \nprotecting workers' rights to overtime. The complaints about Democrats \nignore the fact that internal Republican differences also cause delays.\n  I have on a pair of Allen Edmonds shoes today. They are shoes that \nare made in the United States. President Bush wears these shoes. So \ndoes Senator Kerry. They are one of the few shoe manufacturers left in \nAmerica. The reason I mention that is that the chief executive of the \ncompany, John Stollenwerk, is upset because, as a result of our doing \nnothing on the FSC bill, he is now paying 19-percent penalties. And to \nthis day, even though we agreed to go to conference, the House has not \nappointed conferees.\n  I say to my friend with all sincerity, we need not find fault. Let's \nfind a way to work together. Let's impose our goodwill upon the Speaker \nof the House and have him appoint conferees to the FSC bill so that we \ncan still have shoes made in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of bills to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Bills Enacted Into Law Without Using a Conference To Negotiate \n          Differences in Language Between the House and Senate\n\n\n              108th Congress (as of May 6, 2004--24 bills)\n\n       H.R. 1584, Clean Diamond Trade Act; H.R. 1298, AIDS \n     Assistance; H.R. 733, McLoughlin House National Historic Site \n     Act; H.R. 13, Museum and Library Services Act; H.R. 3146, \n     TANF Extension; H.R. 659, Hospital Mortgage Insurance Act; \n     H.R. 1516, National Cemetery Expansion Act; H.R. 3365, \n     Military Family Tax Relief Act; S. 313, Animal Drug User Fee \n     Act; S. 1768, National Flood Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act; H.R. 1828, Syria Accountability and \n     Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act; S. 459, Hometown Heroes \n     Survivors Benefits Act.\n       H.R. 2297, Veterans Benefits Act; S. 877, CAN-SPAM Act; \n     H.R. 100, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; H.R. 1006, Captive \n     Wildlife Safety Act; H.R. 1012, Carter G.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the opening of \nthe National Museum of the American Indian, the first national museum \ndedicated to the preservation, study, and exhibition of the life, \nlanguages, literature, history, and arts of the first residents of the \nAmericas. This museum works in collaboration with the native peoples of \nthe western hemisphere to protect and foster their cultures by \nreaffirming traditions and beliefs, encouraging contemporary artistic \nexpression, and empowering the Indian voice. And since it was designed \nprimarily by Native Americans, it is truly a first-hand look at both \nthe history and future of indigenous American culture.\n  Fittingly, it is not a traditional museum, but rather a unique, \nliving space, located in close proximity to nature. The building's \ndesign reflects the solar calendar and equinoxes, with an eastern \norientation and entrance. Historical native stories are shared through \nthe representation and interpretation of Indian cultures as living \nphenomena throughout the hemisphere. The NMAI is rich with imagery, \nconnections to the earth, and historical meaning.\n  Washington state can be particularly proud of its tribes, which are \nwell-represented. For example, an exhibit about original Native \nTreaties includes the 1855 Treaty of Neah Bay, which allowed the Makah \nTribe to take whales from ``accustomed grounds and stations.'' An \nexhibit about the contemporary lives of American Indians contains items \nfrom our very own Yakama Nation including a carton of Chief Yakama \napples, a jar of Broken Spears pickled asparagus and a poster for the \nYakama Nation Beauty Pageant.\n  Native Americans from other parts of the country who now call \nWashington State home also played important roles in designing this \nstunning new space. Johnpaul Jones, an architect of Choctaw and \nCherokee heritage who lives in Seattle, was one of four project \ndesigners, and helped design and shape this museum to make it a dynamic \nplace for all Americans to explore the contributions of American \nIndians to our culture.\n  Preston Singletary, a Tlingit artist who also lives in Seattle, \ncontributed a piece to the exhibit ``Our Universe,'' which focuses on \nAmerican Indian cosmology and the spiritual relationship between the \ntribes and nature. His piece, a sand-carved glass, depicts the \nnorthwestern coastal legend of the ``Raven Steals the Sun.''\n  Today, as we welcome this wonderful new museum, let us also remember \nthat as a nation, we must do more to fulfill the promises our country \nmade to our native peoples. As a Senator who represents 29 tribes and a \nmember of the Indian Affairs Committee, I will continue to work to see \nour nation meet these obligations, and to celebrate the contributions \nof Native Americans to our great Nation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today our Nation marks the grand opening \nof the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian. This new museum, the \nfirst museum opening on the National Mall since 1987, is truly \nspectacular, with awe-inspiring architecture, striking landscaping, and \nremarkable holdings that richly reflect the range of Native American \nculture and traditions. By opening this museum, we have finally \nrecognized the contribution of Native people to our Nation. This \nrecognition is long overdue.\n  The museum is not simply about the history of the American Indian, it \nis also a forward-looking museum, which\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nrecognizes the vitality of tribal life throughout the world. This \nvitality is clearly evident in my State of Wisconsin, which is home to \neleven federally recognized tribal governments: the Brad River Band of \nLake Superior Chippewa Indians, the Forest County Potawatomi Indian \nCommunity, the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, the Lac Courte Oreilles \nBand of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Lac du \nFlambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the \nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of \nWisconsin, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, the \nSokaogan Chippewa (Mole Lake) Community of Wisconsin, the St. Croix \nChippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the Stockbridge Munsee Community of \nWisconsin.\n  I am proud to represent the members of Wisconsin's tribes, many of \nwhom are gathering here to support and participate in this important \noccasion. The influence of the Native Americans who have lived in \nWisconsin for so many years is evident in the names of our cities and \ntowns, lakes and rivers, and counties and parks. Wisconsin's native \npeoples' traditions are part of who we are and these vibrant \ncommunities make vast contributions to Wisconsin's culture.\n  Congress authorized the Smith- sonian's National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian on November 28, 1989 with passage of the National \nMuseum of the American Indian Act. I congratulate my colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, who championed the creation \nof this museum as a member of the other body, and the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for their vision in writing the legislation \nthat made this museum a reality.\n  The Museum opens today with a celebration that is expected to draw as \nmany as 20,000 Native Americans to Washington. Many are calling the \ngrand opening today the largest tribal gathering in history.\n  I commend the Congress and the Nation for finally recognizing our \nNative people and their past, present, and future contributions to \nAmerica's culture, history, and tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9435-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PEACE IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I submit an amendment in the form of \na substitute to S. 2781. I want to thank the majority leader for his \nsupport of our efforts to authorize assistance for the Darfur crisis \nand a final peace in Sudan. I also want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Biden for his cooperation in \nintroducing the bill, as well as in refining its language.\n  Our Committee recently held a historic hearing on Sudan. In that \nhearing Secretary Powell declared Sudan and the Janjaweed responsible \nfor genocide. This important event reinforced congressional concern for \nAfrican affairs and pursuing peace in Sudan.\n  Senator Biden and I have improved S. 2781 in the pending amendment by \nclarifying several elements. These improvements include an update to \nlanguage that directly reflects the comments of Secretary Powell in his \ndeclaration of genocide in the Sudan. Further, the amendment clarifies \nthat neither of the regions administered by the Government of Sudan nor \nthe SPLM will be authorized to receive assistance unless the President \ncertifies that they are complying with specific requirements.\n  Finally, upon receipt of the testimony and reports from Secretary \nPowell and the State Department, as well as the recent eyewitness \naccount of the USAID Administrator Natsios, we want to redouble our \ncommitment to support the African Union Mission in Sudan. The value of \nthe reports from the small African Union Observer Force now in Darfur \nis evident and the international community must recognize its own \nresponsibility in enabling the African Union to continue in this \nassertive and positive role. In my view the bill states that the United \nStates should provide, to the extent practicable, all assistance \nnecessary to ensure the African Union Mission in Sudan is capable of \ncarrying out its mandate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislative \ninitiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9435-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9435-S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMARKS TO THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, at the invitation of the Council \non Foreign Relations and the family of the late Paul Warnke, I gave the \nsecond annual Paul Warnke Lecture on International Security here in \nWashington. I spoke to the council about the ongoing efforts here in \nthe Congress to address the issue of the reform of the intelligence \ncommunity as recommended by the 9/11 Commission and others.\n  I told the council that to my mind, at least as important as the \nstructural reforms of our intelligence community, and arguably even \nmore so, is the need to protect the independence, objectivity and \nintegrity of intelligence analyses. Too many times in our past, \nincluding most recently in the Iraq war, intelligence has been \nmanipulated and politicized to support a specific policy.\n  I am willing to support the creation of a more powerful National \nIntelligence Director with greater authority over intelligence budgets \nand personnel, but only if this increased power is used to help ensure \nthe accuracy, independence, objectivity and integrity of intelligence \nanalyses, and not used to promote policy. I don't want a National \nIntelligence Director to be a more powerful ``yes man'' for the \nadministration in power.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nspeech to the Council on Foreign Relations on September 13, 2004, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Remarks of Senator Carl Levin at the Paul Warnke Lecture on \n       International Security at the Council on Foreign Relations\n\n       Thank you, Alton [Frye, Presidential Senior Fellow Emeritus \n     at the Council on Foreign Relations]. Your connection with \n     the Council since 1972 makes you a more enduring figure in \n     Washington than just about anybody besides Senator Byrd.\n       It is a pleasure to be back at the Council, and an honor to \n     be giving the second annual Paul Warnke Lecture on \n     International Security. Paul was a great public servant and a \n     tireless advocate for a wise and balanced approach to \n     international security. I know there are some members of the \n     Warnke family here, and I want to start by acknowledging \n     their presence and thanking them for joining in the \n     invitation to me.\n       Tonight I want to share some thoughts with you on the \n     reform of our Intelligence Community, which is topic number \n     one in the Senate right now. My remarks are subtitled ``No \n     more slam-dunks please, where nuance is needed.''\n       With the end of the Cold War the greatest threats we face \n     are from terrorists. We are less likely to be attacked by \n     nations and armies with tanks and missiles, and more likely \n     to be attacked by terrorists with bombs in trucks or strapped \n     to their bodies.\n       Since terrorists are not deterred by the threat of their \n     own destruction, and because terrorist networks are so \n     diffuse, accurate intelligence is absolutely essential to \n     preventing terrorist attacks.\n       The release of the 9/11 Commission's Report fueled a debate \n     about how our intelligence community should be reformed to \n     better respond to the terrorist threat. This is a debate we \n     need to have. But in taking on structural reform involving \n     stove-pipes and budget authority, we should not lose sight of \n     the fundamental problem that was dramatically demonstrated \n     not by the pre-9/11 intelligence failures but by the pre-Iraq \n     War intelligence failures.\n       The intelligence failures before 9/11 related to \n     intelligence agencies not using information they had and not \n     sharing that information with others. The Report of the 9/11 \n     Commission retold the story of people in the CIA and FBI, for \n     instance, who failed to do their jobs in sharing information. \n     And that Report noted the failure to hold anyone accountable. \n     But there is no evidence in the more than 500-page 9/11 \n     Commission Report that those failures were caused by \n     inadequate budget power in the Director of Central \n     Intelligence or his lack of authority to hire and fire \n     intelligence personnel in other agencies than the CIA.\n       The failures to use and share intelligence have begun to be \n     corrected with the formation of the Terrorist Threat \n     Integration Center (TTIC). Coordination and sharing might be \n     further enhanced by creation of a National Intelligence \n     Director.\n       The massive intelligence failures before the Iraq War were \n     of a totally different kind. To a significant degree, they \n     were the result of the CIA shaping and manipulating \n     intelligence to support Administration policy. The CIA's \n     errors were all in one direction, invariably making the Iraqi \n     threat clearer and sharper and more imminent, thereby \n     promoting the Administration's determination to remove Saddam \n     Hussein from power. Nuances were dropped; a slam-dunk was the \n     assessment.\n       The CIA was saying to the Administration and to the \n     American people what it thought the Administration wanted to \n     hear.\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\n       The problem of intelligence being manipulated and \n     politicized is not new. Forty years ago, Secretary of Defense \n     McNamara claimed classified communications intercepts \n     supported passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was \n     used by President Johnson as the legislative foundation for \n     expanding the war in Vietnam.\n       Those intercepts proved later to be very dubious. \n     Regardless, the presidential decision had been made, and so \n     intelligence was used to support that decision.\n       Intelligence was heavily manipulated by CIA Director \n     William Casey during the Iran-Contra period. The Iran Contra \n     Report cited evidence that Director Casey ``misrepresented or \n     selectively used available intelligence to support the policy \n     he was promoting.''\n       The Iran Contra Report urged strongly that ``The gathering, \n     analysis, and reporting of intelligence should be done in \n     such a way that there can be no question that the conclusions \n     are driven by the actual facts, rather than by what a policy \n     advocate hopes these facts will be.''\n       Former Secretary of State George Shultz, in his memoir \n     Turmoil and Triumph, recalled Director Casey's actions and \n     concluded that ``The CIA should have nothing to do with \n     policy. You have to keep objectivity in analyses.''\n       History repeated itself with the pre-war Iraq intelligence. \n     Before the war, top administration officials asserted that \n     Saddam Hussein definitely had weapons of mass destruction and \n     had close links to the al Qaeda terrorists who had attacked \n     us on 9/11.\n       The President said in March of 2002 that ``[Saddam Hussein] \n     possesses the world's most dangerous weapons.''\n       The Vice President in August of 2002 said ``. . . we know \n     that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear \n     weapons. Many of us are convinced that Saddam will acquire \n     nuclear weapons fairly soon.''\n       National Security Advisor Rice said on September 8, 2002 \n     that ``We do know that there have been shipments going . . . \n     into Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes that really are \n     only suited . . . for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge \n     programs.''\n       A few weeks later, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said that \n     ``Very likely all they need to complete a weapon is fissile \n     materials--and they are, at this moment, seeking that \n     material--both from foreign sources and the capability to \n     produce it indigenously.''\n       On September 19th, 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld said that \n     Saddam Hussein ``has, at this moment, stockpiles of chemical \n     and biological weapons, and is pursuing nuclear weapons.''\n       Regarding al Qaeda links to Saddam Hussein, President Bush \n     made the unqualified link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein \n     on September 25th, 2002, when he said ``you can't distinguish \n     between al-Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on \n     terror.''\n       Following those kind of strong public statements of senior \n     administration leaders, qualifications and cautious words in \n     previous Intelligence Community reports were dropped, and \n     intelligence was shaped more and more to reflect and support \n     the certainty of the administration's policy statements.\n       For instance, on February 11, 2003, DCI Tenet publicly \n     stated, as though it were fact, that Iraq ``has provided \n     training in poisons and gases to two al-Qaida associates.'' \n     However, in his then-classified testimony on September 17, \n     2002, which reflected the underlying intelligence analysis, \n     Director Tenet acknowledged that the information on training \n     was ``from sources of varying reliability.'' The underlying \n     intelligence also acknowledged that the information was ``at \n     times contradictory.'' As the Senate Intelligence Committee \n     report makes clear, DCI Tenet's public testimony could lead \n     people to believe incorrectly ``that the CIA believed the \n     training had definitely occurred.''\n       That Senate Intelligence Committee 500-page unanimous \n     report set out dozens of instances like that where the CIA or \n     its leaders made statements about Iraq's WMD which were \n     significantly more certain than the underlying classified \n     intelligence reporting or than their previous classified \n     statements.\n       The first overall conclusion of that Senate Intelligence \n     Committee report is that ``Most of the major key judgments in \n     the Intelligence Community's October 2002 National \n     Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iraq's Continuing Programs for \n     Weapons of Mass Destruction, either overstated or were not \n     supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting.''\n       The CIA's efforts to support Administration policy instead \n     of doing what they are supposed to do--which is to inform \n     Administration policy makers--wasn't limited to WMD issues. \n     DCI Tenet also helped support the Administration's contention \n     that Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda were closely linked, or as \n     President Bush had said on September 28, 2002, ``each passing \n     day could be the one on which the Iraqi regime gives \n     anthrax or VX nerve gas or someday a nuclear weapon to a \n     terrorist group.'' This took a special contortion on DCI \n     Tenet's part because the CIA's then-classified analysis \n     was that there were no significant links between Saddam \n     Hussein and al Qaeda.\n       Here is some background on that: on October 7, 2002, at our \n     request, the CIA in a letter to the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee declassified its assessment and indicated Iraq was \n     unlikely to provide WMD to terrorists, and that providing WMD \n     to terrorists would be an ``extreme step'' for Saddam \n     Hussein, likely to be taken by him only in response to an \n     attack against him by us. However, DCI Tenet told the New \n     York Times that there was ``no inconsistency'' between the \n     views in that CIA letter and the President's views on the \n     subject. His statement was clearly incorrect, but it \n     supported the Administration by trying to blur the \n     inconsistency. The Senate voted on the authorization to use \n     force a few days later on October 11.\n       And the CIA went along with the Administration's repeated \n     references to a reported meeting in Prague between an Iraqi \n     intelligence officer and the lead hijacker in April of 2001. \n     At a hearing in February of this year, I asked Director Tenet \n     about that alleged meeting. He told me that the CIA had ``not \n     gathered enough evidence to conclude that it happened,'' and \n     that ``I don't know that it took place. I can't say that it \n     did.'' What he neglected to say, again bending over backwards \n     to protect Administration policy, was that the CIA did not \n     believe the meeting had happened. He finally acknowledged \n     that publicly a few weeks ago when the CIA said that there \n     was an ``absence of any credible information that the April \n     2001 meeting occurred.''\n       Again, in all of these cases, and many others, where public \n     statements of the CIA varied from the underlying classified \n     intelligence before the war, the Iraqi threat became clearer \n     and more dire and the presence of WMD more certain. In public \n     statements and reports, the CIA leadership had effectively \n     become a political arm of the White House. There is no other \n     explanation which has any ring of truth.\n       That is not the only rational inference. It also has some \n     explicit evidentiary support. You remember the scene in Bob \n     Woodward's book, Plan of Attack, after the Intelligence \n     Community's case regarding Iraqi WMD was presented to the \n     President in the Oval Office on December 21st, 2002:\n       ``Bush turned to Tenet. `I've been told all this \n     intelligence about having WMD and this is the best we've \n     got?'\n       ``From the end of one of the couches in the Oval Office, \n     Tenet rose up, threw his arms in the air. 'It's a slam-dunk \n     case!' the director of central intelligence said.\n       ``Bush pressed. `George, how confident are you?'\n       ``Tenet, a basketball fan who attended as many home games \n     of his alma mater Georgetown University as possible, leaned \n     forward and threw his arms up again. `Don't worry, it's slam-\n     dunk!''\n       George Shultz's admonition about the fundamental need to \n     separate intelligence from policy as the only way to obtain \n     objective and independent intelligence, had been dramatically \n     proven again. Other experts have reminded us of this point.\n       Former DCI Judge William Webster told the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee a few weeks ago that:\n       ``With respect to relations with the president, while the \n     leader of the intelligence community must be the principal \n     advisor on intelligence to the president, he must work hard--\n     very hard--to avoid either the reality or the perception that \n     intelligence is being framed--read ``spun''--to support a \n     foreign policy of the administration.''\n       Former chief weapons inspector David Kay put it this way \n     before the Senate Intelligence Committee:\n       ``Intelligence must serve the nation and speak truth to \n     power even if in some cases elected leaders chose, as is \n     their right, to disagree with the intelligence with which \n     they are presented. This means that intelligence should not \n     be part of the political apparatus or process.''\n       How does all of this affect the pending consideration of \n     intelligence reform? I have the good fortune (I guess) to be \n     the only Senator to serve on all three Senate Committees \n     which are considering intelligence reform legislation issues. \n     We have held about 10 hearings since the 9/11 Commission \n     report was presented, and are expected to have legislation \n     prepared for the Senate by October. Most of the focus so far \n     has been on fixing the pre-9/11 type failures; that is, the \n     failures of information sharing and coordination.\n       To my mind, at least as important as the structural \n     reforms, and arguably even more so, is the need to protect \n     the independence, objectivity and integrity of intelligence \n     analyses.\n       I am willing to support the creation of a more powerful \n     National Intelligence Director, with greater authority over \n     intelligence budgets and personnel, but only if this \n     increased power is used to help ensure the accuracy, \n     independence, objectivity and integrity of intelligence \n     analyses, and not used to promote policy. I don't want a \n     National Intelligence Director to be a more powerful ``yes \n     man'' for the Administration in power.\n       One way to promote more objective and independent \n     intelligence is to put Congress on a roughly equal basis with \n     the executive branch as a primary consumer of intelligence. \n     The National Intelligence Director and the entire \n     Intelligence Community must understand that their analyses \n     are just as much for Congress as for the President. It also \n     means that senior intelligence leaders should be subject to \n     Senate confirmation. And it surely means that the National \n     Intelligence Director should not be established in the \n     Cabinet or in the Executive Office of the President.\n       And giving both the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the House \n     and Senate Intelligence Committees the power to obtain \n     documents and initiate investigations--much\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\n     like the current Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of \n     the Governmental Affairs Committee--would also strengthen \n     congressional oversight.\n       The bottom line is that terrorism is currently our number \n     one threat, and intelligence is our most essential tool to \n     deal with that threat. Before we create a stronger National \n     Intelligence Director, in a position which has too often \n     produced intelligence shaped to promote policy, we must take \n     steps to ensure that a strengthened National Intelligence \n     Director--and indeed our entire Intelligence Community--is \n     free to provide objective, independent intelligence analyses. \n     Our future security depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9437-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a very \nspecial family from my home state of West Virginia. I am delighted that \nPam and Morgan Lacefield of Moundsville, WV, will be recognized later \nthis month as ``Angels in Adoption,'' a special award created by the \nCongressional Adoption Caucus.\n  I would like to take a moment to tell you more about Pam, Morgan, and \nthe entire Lacefield family. Pam and Morgan Lacefield are the proud \nparents of nine wonderful children. This large, loving bunch is typical \nof many: they are involved in a host of sports and activities. They do \nhomework. They enjoy family meals together. There is one quality, \nhowever, that makes the Lakefield family special: Pam and Morgan have \nadopted every one of their nine children. It is not surprising that \nsuch a loving couple would also run a shelter for homeless animals with \nno where else to turn.\n  In 1991, Pam and Morgan were managing a successful group of \nrestaurants that they owned while also raising two children, whom they \nhad previously adopted. They soon became aware of four siblings who \nwere in need of a loving permanent home and who did not want to face \nseparation. Pam and Morgan adopted them, too, bringing to six the total \nnumber of children in their home under the age of five. Later, they \nadopted another ``sibling group'' of three children, and they have been \non the go ever since!\n  True leaders in their community, Pam and Morgan have been involved in \na number of charitable organizations within West Virginia, and were \nnamed West Virginia Parent Teachers' Association's Partners in \nEducation for 1999-2000. And, eleven years after adopting their first \nsibling group, Pam and Morgan opened a ``no-kill'' animal shelter, \nwhich they named Webark Estates. Their examples of selflessness and \ncommitment have not been lost on the youngest members of their family--\neach of their children now helps at the shelter in some capacity, and \nit has become a labor of love for all of the Lacefields. It is a lucky \nchild who can claim over 20 dogs and 80 cats as his pets, and it is a \nluckier child still who can claim Pam and Morgan Lacefield as parents. \nAs you can see, they are clearly ``angels.''\n  The Angels in Adoption Award recognizes individuals like the \nLacefields who open their hearts and homes to children in foster care. \nOn September 23, the Lacefields and other Angels will come to \nWashington in order to be recognized for their good works. The \nLacefield family and the other Angel in Adoption nominees from around \nthe country can help inspire everyone to continue efforts to ensure \nthat every child has a safe, healthy, and permanent home and that, for \nsome children, this is only possible through adoption.\n  I have worked for many years in bipartisan coalitions to promote \nadoption and improved services for abused and neglected children. While \nthese issues rarely command headlines, they change the lives of \nchildren and families across our country. People like the Lacefields \nand programs like Angels in Adoption remind us of the importance of our \nadoption and child welfare programs. In 1997, Congress passed the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act to ensure that a child's health and \nsafety are paramount, and to express the belief that every child \ndeserves a permanent home. Since then, adoptions from foster care have \nnearly doubled. While this is wonderful news, more than 100,000 \nchildren remain in foster care. As the Lacefields and other adoptive \nparents would tell us, we clearly have more work to do.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to have had this opportunity to tell \nyou more about the Lacefield family. I have long believed that the \npeople of West Virginia are its greatest resource; individuals such as \nthe Lacefields prove this point again and again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9437-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORTING CHILDREN IN CRISIS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter be printed in the Record.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: I am writing on behalf of the membership \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong \n     support for S. 2760, the ``Public Safety Officers' Defense \n     Act,'' which will restore balance to the criminal justice \n     system by ensuring a reasonable and timely Federal review of \n     State convictions for the murder of a law enforcement \n     officer.\n       This issue is of particular importance to the F.O.P. \n     because we have, tragically, first-hand knowledge of how such \n     delays affect the families of slain officers. One case in \n     particular always comes to mind--the slaying of Philadelphia \n     Police Officer Daniel Faulkner on 9 December 1981. He was \n     murdered in cold-blood by Wesley Cook, who is better known by \n     his alias, Mumia Abu-Jamal. This killer was convicted of \n     murder and sentenced to death by a jury in July 1982. After \n     exhausting nearly all State appeals, and having had two \n     appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court rejected, Faulkner's \n     murderer filed a petition for habeas corpus in October 1999. \n     Just days after marking the twentieth anniversary of Danny \n     Faulkner's death, Judge William Yohn of the United States \n     District Court for\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\n     the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued a ruling \n     upholding the conviction, but threw out the death sentence on \n     a technicality. The case was appealed to the U.S. Third \n     Circuit Court of Appeals on 28 December 2001. While the case \n     remains on the docket, Danny's killer is alive and on death \n     row. As his widow Maureen will tell you, this is not justice.\n       Your legislation would require that, following State court \n     and U.S. Supreme Court certiorari reviews are completed, \n     district courts review cases within fifteen months and \n     circuit courts rule within 120 days. This means that, absent \n     the granting of a full review of the case by the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, that Federal review of cop-killers' appeals would be \n     completed, in most cases, within a two year period.\n       The bill also incorporates an existing provision of the \n     Federal habeas statute that is used to determine whether a \n     defendant may file a successive petition or seek a new \n     evidentiary hearing in Federal court. Thus, once a convicted \n     cop-killer's case arrives in the Federal courts, they would \n     only be able either to offer new evidence of innocence or to \n     give a good reason why he failed to present such evidence \n     earlier, thus barring defendants from simply relitigating \n     evidence that already was presented or should have been \n     presented at trial.\n       Assaults on law enforcement officers, including those which \n     result in the death of the officer, are on the rise, and so \n     is the length of time a convicted cop-killer will remain on \n     death row while his appeals are processed. The murder of a \n     law enforcement officer is a heinous crime--every State that \n     has the death penalty allows juries to impose on those \n     convicted of killing an officer. And yet, if the death \n     penalty is not imposed in a reasonable amount of time, after \n     all the requirements of due process are met and guilt is \n     certain, then it does not have any meaning, either as a \n     deterrent or a punishment. Your legislation correctly \n     addresses this problem for what most recognize to be one of \n     the most serious crimes--killing a cop.\n       On behalf of the more than 318,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I applaud you for your leadership on this \n     issue and look forward to working with you and your staff to \n     see it signed into law. If I can be of any further \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive \n     Director Jim Pasco at my Washington Office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9438-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY DRUM AND BUGLE CORPS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the commendable \nrecord of the Air Force Academy Drum and Bugle Corps. The Air Force \nAcademy Drum and Bugle Corps was established in 1959, as a unit of the \nAir Force Academy Band. The Corps was made up of enlisted musicians and \nincluded six drummers, nine buglers, a drum major and a noncommissioned \nofficer in charge. The mission of the Corps was to act as a relief \ngroup for the Air Force Academy Band. Activities of the band included \nplaying for the cadet morning and evening chow formations and to \npractice marching. This addition to the Air Force Academy Band helped \nto complete musical requirements for the cadet wing military \nformations.\n  Within 2 years of its formation the Air Force Academy Drum and Bugle \nCorps was increased to 38 members, and its mission was extended \nnationwide to include concerts, field exhibitions, music festivals, and \nvarious military ceremonies. The Corps entertained audiences from coast \nto coast with a blend of precision drill and musical pageantry. In \n1972, the Enlisted Corps was disbanded and students from the Air Force \nAcademy formed the Cadet Drum and Bugle Corps, which continues the \ntradition of providing musical support of cadet wing activities, as \nwell as participation in community activities nationwide.\n  I take this opportunity to thank the distinguished members of the Air \nForce Drum and Bugle Corps for their dedication and commitment to the \nAcademy and to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9438-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              VA AND UF JOIN FORCES TO HELP STROKE VICTIMS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the Department of \nVeterans' Affairs, VA, has a long and distinguished history of \ncollaboration with various universities across the country. No such \npartnership has yielded more successful results than that between the \nMalcom Randall VA Medical Center, VAMC, in Gainesville, FL, and the \nUniversity of Florida, UF. In keeping with their long history together, \nthese two notable institutions announced on July 6, 2004, that they \nwill be working together to help stroke victims.\n  The Translational Research in Rehabilitation Initiative, as it has \nbeen named, is a $2.7 million effort to improve the lives of those who \nhave suffered from strokes and other brain injuries. Its goal is to \ndrastically shorten the time between scientific discovery and the \ndevelopment of therapies used for the treatment of these patients. \nCurrently, an average of 17 years go by before discoveries in clinical \ntrials are routinely incorporated into medical treatment.\n  Previous thinking was that the mature nervous system could not be \nrepaired after injury. Since 1990, however, scientists have known this \nis not true. As such, the joint initiative will utilize the advanced \nskills of UF scientists and physicians to translate discoveries from \nanimal research into quicker ways of reconstructing the damaged human \nnervous system. With VA's assistance, UF also will recruit three new \nfaculty members, whose goal will be to accelerate brain-injury research \nto find combinations of drugs and rehabilitation therapies that will \nhelp stroke victims.\n  The project is an extension of research that began 1999 with Leslie \nGonzalez-Rothi, Ph.D., a neurology professor associated with UF's \nEvelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Institute and program director \nof the Brain Rehabilitation Research Center at the Gainesville VAMC. \nThat year, Dr. Gonzalez-Rothi obtained the first rehabilitation \nresearch and development grant from VA to start the Brain \nRehabilitation Research Center. At the center, UF scientists study \ncombinations of drugs and rehabilitation techniques in people who have \nsuffered strokes, focusing their efforts on rehabilitating patients and \nteaching them to relearn lost abilities. This new mission will explore \nthe ways doctors can actually help heal the injury and is part of the \nJuly renewal of a 5-year, $4.25 million rehabilitation research and \ndevelopment grant to the center. In addition to the grant, the \nGainesville VAMC will provide nearly 4,000 square feet of laboratory \nspace in its medical center to support the effort.\n  This new partnership between VA and UF is a shining example of what \nVA can and will accomplish through its impressive research \ncapabilities, especially with the help of its university affiliates. \nThe strides that result from the Translational Research in \nRehabilitation Initiative will significantly improve patient care for \nthe entire Nation, making a difference in the lives of veterans, as \nwell as the general public. I am very proud that this project is being \nconducted in my home State of Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9438-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9438-S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN HONOR OF MASTERFOODS USA CHICAGO PLANT 75TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I offer congratulations to \nMasterfoods USA on the 75th birthday of their candy plant in Chicago, \nIL. Masterfoods is the U.S. division of Mars, Incorporated.\n  Chicago is America's candy capital. Since 1929, the hard-working \nfolks at the Masterfoods plant in Chicago have been making our world \nsweeter.\n  The plant is the birthplace of the world's best-selling candy bar--\nthe Snickers bar as well as home to other favorites, including the \nMilky Way and 3 Musketeers bars. Today, the Masterfoods USA Chicago \nplant produces 20 percent of all Masterfoods USA candy bars about 30 \nmillion bars a day.\n  Much like Chicago, the Masterfoods plant has been in a constant state \nof renewal and investment, and is as contemporary today as it was when \nit opened in 1929. Built on a site that was previously a golf course, \nthe plant is unlike other factories, with a picturesque, high-windowed \nSpanish-style structure featuring a rich red tile roof and tinted \nwalls.\n  When it opened in 1929, the plant employed about 200 workers. Today, \nthe plant employs about 500 associates, 10 percent of whom have a \nrelative who formerly worked there. There are even three people working \nat the plant today who are third-generation plant associates.\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\n  Beyond creating and retaining jobs, Masterfoods USA is committed to \ncommunity involvement. Each year at Halloween, more than 500 costumed \nchildren from the surrounding neighborhood converge on the plant to \ntrick-or-treat. The company also donates equipment to Chicago Shriners \nHospital for Children and provides 25 district police stations with \ncandy for community outreach. In all, the Masterfoods USA Chicago plant \nassists more than 100 community programs each year. This is a company \nthat has not just been an employer, it has also been a good neighbor.\n  Today I wish to honor the 75th birthday of the Masterfoods USA \nChicago Plant. Their success is a point of pride for Chicago and the \nState of Illinois. May their future be as sweet as their past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9439-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BEALE AIR FORCE BASE: AIR FORCE EXCELLENCE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Beale Air \nForce Base as the United States Air Force winner of the 2004 Commander \nin Chief's Installation Excellence Award. This award recognizes the \noutstanding efforts of the people who operate and maintain Department \nof Defense installations and who best utilize their resources to \nsupport the mission. In recognition of this prestigious accomplishment, \nTeam Beale has been awarded $1 million for quality of life \nimprovements.\n  The Commander in Chief's Installation Excellence Award recognizes the \nbest United States Military installations worldwide, demonstrating \ninnovative programs that help sustain excellent base operations. Each \nbase was evaluated in the following categories: improving work \nenvironment or physical plant; improving quality of life; enhancing \nproductivity of the work force; increasing customer satisfaction or \nimproving customer service; encouraging bottom-to-top communication and \nteam problem solving; promoting unit cohesiveness and recognizing \noutstanding individual efforts; and, promoting environmental safety, \ncompliance, remediation, and stewardship.\n  In fiscal year 2003, Team Beale established itself as the benchmark \nfor the United States Air Force. Teamwork was Beale's cornerstone among \nthe core units, associate units, and the civilian community as they \nembraced the Installation Commander's motto, ``One Team, One Fight.'' \nBeale Air Force Base put intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \non the offensive with an unprecedented 3,450 sorties, 1,175 combat \nmissions, and 13,300 combat hours during Operations Enduring and Iraqi \nFreedom. Team Beale led coalition forces in battle space preparation \nand time-critical targeting by producing more than 89,000 imagery \nproducts and 25,000 special intelligence products for two combatant \ncommanders.\n  In addition to Beale's history-making, record-breaking contributions \nto the United States' combat efforts, it also worked to improve in \nother areas. Beale Air Force Base took a lead role in its $180 million \nhousing privatization efforts for 1,344 homes in conjunction with $114 \nmillion in base-wide improvements and $56 million in RQ-4A Global Hawk \nbed down initiatives. In recognition of their outstanding performance, \nindividual and team awards included: United States Air Force Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award; United States Air Force Maintenance \nEffectiveness Award; United States Air Force Twelve Outstanding Airmen \nof the Year Award; United States Air Force Explosives Safety Plaque; 33 \nAir Combat Command award; United States Strategic Command's Omaha \nTrophy; and, Eight Numbered Air Force awards.\n  The men and women of Beale Air Force Base have set the Air Force \nstandard for installation excellence. By embracing the Air Force core \nvalues of ``Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All \nWe Do,'' Team Beale used creative innovations to establish themselves \nas the best of the best. It is with great pleasure that I congratulate \nBeale Air Force Base on the receipt of the prestigious Commander in \nChief's Installation Excellence Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9439-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ALBERT M.

I commemorate Mr. Deshur as a prominent \nleader, businessman, and philanthropist, who has long served the \ncommunity of Milwaukee.\n  Mr. Deshur, as a lifelong community leader and self-made man, has set \nthe standard for integrity, pride, conscientiousness, reliability, \nhonesty and character, while at the same time always maintaining a \nsense of balance through his earnestness and sense of responsibility to \nprovide for the community around him.\n  In honor of Mr. Deshur's 90th birthday, I acknowledge his many \ncontributions to the City of Milwaukee. In 1948, Mr. Deshur founded the \nDeshur Homes company in Milwaukee, WI, where he currently serves as \nchairman of the board. Through his hard work and dedication, he has \nbeen responsible for master planning and developing over 2,000 acres of \nland, building more than 7,000 single-family homes, and developing many \nmulti-family and commercial projects. Twelve years later, Mr. Deshur \nfounded the Hampton State Bank, located in Milwaukee, where he served \nas president and chief executive officer providing thousands of \ncustomers a bank they could trust. His commitment to the city has \nprovided the people of Milwaukee great opportunities that would not \nhave been possible without his vision.\n  Mr. Deshur has also been an active philanthropist for children's \ncauses, including the Albert and Ann Deshur Rainbow Day Camp at the \nJewish Community Center of Milwaukee. He is a prominent member of the \nJewish community of Milwaukee, founding member and major benefactor of \nTemple Shalom and a generous and consistent supporter of the Milwaukee \nJewish Federation for many years.\n  I thank Mr. Deshur for his many contributions to the city of \nMilwaukee and I join his many friends and family in celebration as we \nhonor Mr. Deshur on his 90th birthday.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize and share with \nmy colleagues an important milestone for Cordell Bank National Marine \nSanctuary. The sanctuary will observe its 15th anniversary on October \n2.\n  Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary was established in 1989 when a \nHouse joint resolution was signed by the President. I was pleased to be \nan original cosponsor of the resolution which was sponsored by \nCongressman Doug Bosco.\n  The sanctuary encompasses 530 square miles of marine waters, off the \ncoast of Point Reyes National Seashore, about 45 miles north of San \nFrancisco. The boundary includes a unique granite bank, the Cordell \nBank, and is located along the continental shelf.\n  The sanctuary encompasses exceptional and diverse marine life, both \nabove and below the surface, providing a home for resident marine \nspecies and a destination feeding ground for many migratory marine \nmammals, fish and seabirds.\n  Twenty-six marine mammal species live in the waters of Cordell Bank \nNational Marine Sanctuary as do over 250 fish species. It is among the \nmost important feeding grounds in the world for the endangered Humpback \nand Blue whales. It also serves as a crucial foraging area for \nresident, migratory and seabound birds. In fact, Cordell Bank National \nMarine Sanctuary is otherwise known as the ``Albatross capital of the \nNorthern Hemisphere.''\n  In the 15 years since the sanctuary was established, threats to the \nCordell Bank and other points along our coast have grown. California's \npopulation has continued to increase near the coast, and oil and gas \nexploration proposals continue to threaten our marine ecosystems.\n  Because of these threats, I believe preserving and celebrating our \nprotected areas off the California coast is particularly important. \nSince the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary was established, the \nsanctuary's\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\nresources have grown with it, providing better protection for the \nsanctuary's future. Staff has increased from one to five and a half \nfull time employees. The staff now has an office, a sea-bound vessel, \nmonitoring programs, an advisory council and a new management plan to \nserve the sanctuary and its mission into the future.\n  I applaud everyone who has worked to protect the marine ecosystems of \nthe Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, and I wish the sanctuary \nstaff and volunteers many years of ongoing success in protecting the \nCalifornia coastal environment. Please join me in celebrating the 15th \nAnniversary of Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9440-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOROTHY HUGHES: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I honor and share with my \ncolleagues today the memory of a very special woman, Dorothy Hughes of \nMarin County, who died July 25, 2004. She was 80 years old.\n  Dorothy Hughes was born on her parents' sheep ranch in Woodland, CA \nin 1923. As a young girl, she attended the Hamlin School in San \nFrancisco and in 1943 she graduated from Stanford University. She went \non to earn her master's degree in European history at California State \nUniversity at Sacramento.\n  Dorothy Hughes was a lifelong champion of humanitarian causes. \nEnvisioning a ``world that works for all of us,'' she campaigned \ntirelessly for peace and social justice. Dorothy also deeply felt the \nneed to ensure decent health and social services for her community, and \nher unwavering dedication left a legacy of community-based health \norganizations in Marin County. In addition to founding the Campaign for \na Healthier Community for Children, Marin Suicide Prevention Center and \nMarin Family Action, she also served as executive director of the Marin \nAssociation of Mental Health for more than two decades. Throughout her \nlife, Dorothy remained committed to her convictions, often in the face \nof powerful opposition.\n  Dorothy Hughes was recognized numerous times for her invaluable \ncontributions to the community. The Human Rights Commission's Martin \nLuther King, Jr. Humanitarian Award, and induction into the Marin \nWomen's Hall of Fame are among the many honors she received.\n  A dynamic figure in Marin County, Dorothy touched countless lives \nduring the 35 years she resided there. She was a deeply-loved member of \nthe community whose courage and conviction inspired others, and she \nwill be greatly missed. We take comfort in the knowledge that future \ngenerations will benefit from Dorothy's dedication, vision and \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9440-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9440-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9440-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT DECLARING THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n     RESPECT TO PERSONS TO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT \n                            TERRORISM--PM 95\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to provide for the redesign of the reverse of the \nLincoln 1-cent coin in 2009 in commemoration of the 200th anniversary \nof the birth of President Abraham Lincoln; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor \nAbraham Lincoln in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth, by issuing a \nseries of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic \nof the 4 major periods of his life, in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and \nWashington, D.C. The bill would also provide for a longer-term redesign \nof the reverse of 1-cent coins so that after 2009 they will bear an \nimage emblematic of Lincoln's preservation of the United States as a \nsingle and united country.\n  Abraham Lincoln was one of our greatest leaders, demonstrating \nenormous courage and strength of character during the Civil War, \nperhaps the greatest crisis in our Nation's history. Lincoln was born \nin Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, \nand led the Nation in Washington, D.C. He rose to the Presidency \nthrough a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and \ncommitment to the United States.\n  Adhering to the belief that all men are created equal, Lincoln led \nthe effort to free all slaves in the United States. Despite the great \npassions aroused by the Civil War, Lincoln had a generous heart and \nacted with malice toward none and with charity for all. Lincoln made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an \nassassin's bullet on April 15, 1865. All Americans could benefit from \nstudying the life of Abraham Lincoln.\n  The ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary \nof Lincoln's birth, making the front design by sculptor Victor David \nBrenner the most enduring image on the nation's coinage. President \nTheodore Roosevelt was so impressed by Brenner's talent that he was \nchosen to design the likeness of Lincoln for the coin, adapting a \ndesign from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier. In the nearly 100 \nyears of production of the ``Lincoln cent,'' there have been only two \ndesigns on the reverse: the original, featuring two wheat-heads, and \nthe current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n  On the occasion of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth and the 100th \nanniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, we should recognize \nhis great achievement in ensuring that the United States remained on \nNation, united and inseparable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2818. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to ensure \nthe same requirements that apply to voters who register by mail also \napply to voters who do not register in person with an officer or \nemployee of a State or local government entity, and to provide for \nincreased penalties for fraudulent registration in cases involving 10 \nor more violations; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the 2004 election is quickly \napproaching, and all Americans must be assured that when they cast \ntheir ballots, they will do so with the knowledge that the United \nStates has done everything possible to ensure the election will be \nfair. Therefore, I rise today to introduce a commonsense election \nreform bill that will amend the law to add additional simple steps that \nwill help ensure the integrity of the voting process and increase \ncriminal penalties for those who knowingly and willfully commit fraud \nin voter registration.\n  There is a recent court decision in New Mexico that has taken the \nplain reading of a very clearly written statute and has turned it on \nits head. The statute says:\n\n       (4) a statement informing the applicant, that: (a) if the \n     form is not submitted in person by the applicant and the \n     applicant is registering for the first time in New Mexico, \n     the applicant must submit with the form a copy of a current \n     and valid photo identification, utility bill, bank statement, \n     government check, paycheck or other government document that \n     shows the name and address of the applicant--\n\n  I stress again, ``in person.''\n\n       (b) if the applicant does not submit the required \n     identification, he will be required to do so when he votes in \n     person or absentee.\n\n  I submit the statute could not be clearer. However, in a bizarre \ncontortion of logic, the New Mexico Secretary of State has determined \nthat a third party can register 10, 100 or 1,000 voters. As long as \nthat third party shows up in person at the county clerk's office, the \nactual voter does not have to show identification. Have we ever heard \nof anything more ridiculous?\n  I believe the root cause of this problem is the recent proliferation \nof 527s that have begun to pop up throughout the country, largely \nuncontrolled and unregulated. These 527s have taken unlimited financial \ncontributions from individual and other private sources to conduct \nvoter mobilization drives and other activities. I am not against \nregistering as many as we can, but this and the ruling seem to me to \nleave many voters to be unfairly treated because their vote may be \nwiped out by those who have not followed the State statute.\n  While no one will argue against a laudable goal, as I indicated, of \nincreasing voter registration and voter turnout, the unintended \nconsequence of these activities I have described can be immense. The \npaid volunteers of these 527s are largely untrained, not familiar with \ncommunities in which they are working, nor are they familiar with the \nrealities of election laws. In many cases, the volunteers are being \npaid by the number of people they are able to register. This has \nresulted in certain voters being registered two or more times at \nmultiple addresses under multiple names.\n  My hometown paper, the Albuquerque Journal, has published stories \nabout minors receiving voter registration cards in the mail as well as \nstories about paid volunteers telling convicted felons they have \nunlimited ability to register and vote. County clerks have also said \nthey have been inundated with thousands of incomplete or illegible \nforms.\n  While no one can be sure of the exact effect of these 527s and what \ntheir effect will be on voter fraud in registration and in casting \nvotes, the bill I am introducing today will amend the Help America Vote \nAct, called HAVA, by extending the identification requirements to \nindividuals who have not themselves registered in person with their \ncounty clerk. In addition, it will enhance the penalties for \nindividuals who knowingly and fraudulently register 10 or more people \nto vote.\n\n  I know many people will believe my intentions in introducing this \nlegislation are partisan. Skeptics will say my motive is political. But \nvoter fraud is not about partisanship or politics; it is about \nfairness. Voter fraud is not a political act; it is a criminal act.\n  Voting is the most important duty and responsibility of our citizens. \nOther reform issues have received a lot of attention, but I believe it \nis imperative to focus our attention on the fundamental issue of \ncasting votes honestly and fairly. The Help America Vote Act, which we \npassed in 2002, and\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nthe hundreds of new State laws that implement it fail to provide \nadequate uniform systems that verify voter identity, as I have \nindicated, or by court interpretation wipe out the protections that \nmight be contemplated by clear and unambiguous statutes.\n  Requiring a voter to provide identification prior to voting is not an \nunreasonable imposition, given the responsibility and possibilities \nthat are attendant to not doing that are truly monumental. Simple and \nstraightforward reforms, such as the one I am proposing, will make it \neasier to vote but harder to cheat. Showing the American public that we \nare serious about elections and those who might seek to do it \nimproperly will go a long way toward restoring confidence in the \nregistration and balloting process.\n  I have already indicated that I sent the bill to the desk for \nappropriate referral.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2818\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is a fundamental and incontrovertible \n     right under the Constitution.\n       (2) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by reaffirming that the right \n     to vote is a fundamental right under the Constitution.\n       (3) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by reaffirming that the \n     United States is a democratic government ``of the people, by \n     the people, and for the people'' in which every vote counts.\n       (4) There is a need for Congress to encourage and enable \n     every eligible American to vote by eliminating procedural \n     obstacles to voting.\n       (5) There is a need to counter discrimination in voting by \n     removing barriers to the exercise of the constitutionally \n     protected right to vote.\n       (6) There is a need to ensure that voter registration \n     processes fairly incorporate every eligible American seeking \n     to exercise the right to vote.\n       (7) Participation in the electoral process is a fundamental \n     civic responsibility in which all eligible Americans should \n     be encouraged to actively participate.\n       (8) There is a need to ensure that every eligible American \n     seeking to exercise the right to vote has access to the \n     electoral process through a uniform system of voter \n     registration that includes each voter's personal registration \n     with an appropriate State or local government election \n     entity.\n       (9) Congress has authority under section 4 of Article I of \n     the Constitution of the United States, section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, and section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States to enact legislation to \n     address the equal protection violations that may be caused by \n     unfair voting systems.\n       (10) Congress has an obligation to ensure that the States \n     and localities improve election administration and to ensure \n     the integrity of full participation of all Americans in the \n     democratic election process.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide education to students in grades 8, 9, and \n10 about the importance of higher education; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the Higher Education Preparation Program Act of 2004, which \nis legislation designed to expand higher educational opportunities for \nAmerican students. There is no doubt as to the benefit of receiving a \npost-secondary education. The level of education that individuals \naccumulate has an important influence on their experience in the labor \nmarket. According to 2002 U.S. Census Bureau statistics on educational \nattainment and earnings, the mean earnings of men with a bachelor's \ndegree is $63,354, while the mean earnings of men with a high school \ndegree is $32,363. This is a difference of more than $30,000 or 97 \npercent.\n  In recent years, there have been clear signs that more Americans are \npursuing higher education opportunities. In June 2002, USA Today \nreported that 63 percent of high school graduates go to college \nimmediately after graduation, the highest percentage in U.S. history. \nYet not all of the news on college graduation rates has been good. Only \n18 percent of African Americans and 11 percent of Hispanic high school \ngraduates earn a bachelor's degree by their late twenties, compared to \n33 percent of whites according to the National Center for Education \nStatistics (NCES) in 2001. Further, in 2000, NCES reported that 22 \npercent of low-income, college qualified high school graduates do not \npursue post-secondary education, compared to 4 percent of high-income \ngraduates.\n  As I travel through Pennsylvania, I still hear from too many middle \nschool and high school students that they do not have the preparation \nnecessary to enroll in higher education institutions. On a recent trip \nto the Commonwealth, I joined Andrew McKelvey--the founder of the \nMcKelvey Foundation--to announce federal funding for entrepreneurial \nscholarships to rural, low-income Pennsylvania high school graduates. \nDuring that trip, I talked to Mr. McKelvey regarding the need to not \nonly ensure access to funding for students to pursue higher education, \nbut the need to both inform students about the importance of higher \neducation, as well as prepare students for the application process.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Higher Education Preparation \nProgram Act of 2004, will help to educate middle school and high school \nstudents in grades 8, 9, and 10, about higher education opportunities. \nThis bill will create a program which will both provide students with \ninformation on higher education opportunities and prepare students for \nthe process of applying to institutions of higher education by \nproviding access to higher education preparation instruction. The \navailability of information on higher education opportunities makes an \nenormous difference to students contemplating continuing their \neducation at the undergraduate level.\n  My legislation will provide a grant to a nonprofit organization to \ndevelop a core curriculum to be taught in the classroom to equip middle \nand high school students with the appropriate skills and knowledge to \npursue post-secondary education. Given the importance of higher \neducation, it makes sense to prepare students for the undergraduate \nprocess as part of their\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nclass instruction to ensure that all students have access to the \nnecessary information to attain their goals. To this end, middle \nschools and high schools participating in the program would dedicate \none hour each week of their classroom activity to higher education \npreparation of students utilizing the core curriculum.\n  Additionally, I seek to create a network of intensive academic \nsupport for students by encouraging public-private partnerships to \nemphasize the importance of higher education. Partnerships with private \nentities create a unique opportunity for middle schools and high \nschools to supplement and enhance the core curriculum by offering \nappropriate enrichments, including guest speakers, videos and web-based \nservices. For example, through these partnerships, middle school and \nhigh school students will gain first-hand knowledge of the skills that \nbusinesses are seeking by having the opportunity to speak with business \nleaders, as well as perhaps tour local facilities. This will underscore \nthe significance and importance of higher education for students as \nthey embark on their future career paths.\n  To implement this initiative, my bill would authorize $10 million \nannually for fiscal years 2005 through 2010, for a nonprofit \norganization to develop a core curriculum which has as its cornerstone \nhigher education preparation, as well as to establish this higher \neducation preparation demonstration project. Under this project, five \nState educational agencies would be awarded federal funding to offer \nhigher education preparation programs using the core curriculum in \nmiddle and high schools with historically low rates of student \napplication and admission to post-secondary institutions.\n  It is my hope that this Act will ensure that students who wish to \nenroll in a higher education institution will have access to the tools \nand resources necessary to help them plan for undergraduate study. We \nmust take this step to encourage students to pursue their educational \ngoals especially those who might not otherwise have this opportunity. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this Act, and urge its \nswift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2820. A bill to ensure the availability of certain spectrum for \npublic safety entities by amending the Communications Act of 1934 to \nestablish January 1, 2009, as the date by which the transition to \ndigital television shall be completed, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nsupport the Nation's finest: our police, fire fighters and other \nemergency response personnel. The ``Spectrum Availability for \nEmergency-response and Law-enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency \nServices Act,'' otherwise known as ``The SAVE LIVES Act.'' This bill is \ndrafted in response to the 9-11 Commission's Final Report, which \nrecommended the ``expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum \nfor public safety purposes.''\n  To meet this recommendation, the SAVE LIVES Act would set a date \ncertain for the allocation of spectrum to public safety agencies, \nspecifically the 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band that Congress \npromised public safety agencies in 1997. This is a promise Congress has \nyet to deliver to our Nation's first responders. Now is the time for \nCongressional action before another national emergency or crisis takes \nplace. Access to this specific spectrum is essential to our Nation's \nsafety and welfare as emergency communications sent over these \nfrequencies are able to penetrate walls and travel great distances, and \ncan assist multiple jurisdictions in deploying interoperable \ncommunications systems.\n  In addition to setting a date certain, this bill would provide funds \nfor public safety agencies to purchase emergency communications \nequipment, require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) to study whether additional \nspectrum is necessary to support emergency communications systems, \nauthorize a DHS program promoting interoperable emergency \ncommunications systems, provide funds to ensure no consumers' \ntelevision set goes ``dark'' due to public safety's use of this \ntelevision spectrum, mandate labeling of all analog television sets to \nbetter prepare consumers for the digital transition, support a consumer \neducation program on digital television and required the FCC to \ncomplete its outstanding digital television proceedings.\n  The 9-11 Commission's Final Report found, ``The inability to \ncommunicate was a critical element at the World Trade Center, Pentagon \nand Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites, where multiple agencies \nand multiple jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at \nthree very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and \nadequate communications among public safety organizations at the local, \nstate, and federal levels remains an important problem.'' This bill \nwould improve public safety interoperability and capability as quickly \nas possible.\n  However, the 24 MHz of spectrum promised to public safety \norganizations is currently being used by the television broadcasters, \nand will not be available until the broadcasters complete the \ntransition to digital television. At a recent Senate Commerce Committee \nhearing, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Michael K. \nPowell stated that absent intervening legislation broadcasters may not \nbe able to vacate this spectrum for ``decades'' or ``multiples of \ndecades.''\n  Therefore, this bill would set a firm deadline for the completion of \nthe digital television transition: December 31, 2008. This date ensures \nthat this spectrum would be available for use by police, fire fighters \nand other first responders no later than January 1, 2009. Is this soon \nenough? No, I wish it could be sooner. But after hearing testimony from \nChairman Powell, public safety organizations and broadcasters at a \nrecent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I decided that a December 31, \n2008 date presents the most reasonable deadline providing numerous \nbenefits to consumers and public safety organizations, including: 1. \nAdequate time for public safety agencies to begin building their \ninteroperable communications networks to operate in the 700 MHz band; \n2. Sufficient time for the government to auction some of the remaining \nspectrum in the 700 MHz band to raise funds for the purchase and \ninstallation of new interoperable public safety communications \nequipment; 3. The certainty that manufacturers need to warrant the \ndevelopment and build-out of interoperable public safety communications \nequipment for use in the 700 MHz band; 4. Preparation time for \nconsumers and the government to get ready for the completion of the \ndigital transition, including time to purchase more digital television \nsets and time for the government to implement a subsidy program to \nensure no television sets go ``dark'' on January 1, 2009; 5. A seamless \ntransition period where all television stations migrate at once to \ndigital broadcasting; and, 6. Sufficient time for the FCC to complete \nits outstanding proceedings regarding the digital television \ntransition.\n  In addition to setting a firm date for public safety's use of the \nspectrum, the bill would require the FCC, in consultation with DHS, to \nconduct a study to assess public safety organizations' future \ncommunications needs, including the need for additional spectrum, the \nneed for a nationwide interoperable broadband mobile communications \nnetwork, the ability of public safety organizations to use broadband \nand narrowband applications, and whether other first responders such as \nhospital and health care workers should be included in a nation-wide \ninteroperable communications system. If our Nation's first responders \nneed more spectrum to perform their work safely, then Congress should \nensure that more spectrum is available at the same time the public \nsafety organizations begin preparing to use the promised 24 MHz. This \nallows for efficiency and ensures that public safety organizations will \nnot be subjected to multiple implementations of new communications \nequipment.\n  This bill would also ask the FCC to study the advisability of \nreallocating some of the spectrum in the 700 MHz band for unlicensed \nwireless broadband uses. Unlicensed wireless broadband has many \nprospective benefits to our\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\nNation and allows the potential for pervasive connectivity nationwide. \nThe bill would require the FCC to report back to the Senate and House \nCommerce Committees within one year of the bill's enactment on both \nstudies' findings; however, nothing in the bill would preclude the FCC \nfrom taking action with respect to spectrum for unlicensed uses before \ncompletion of its report.\n\n  The SAVE LIVES Act would authorize one of the President's top E-\nGovernment initiatives: DHS' Wireless Public SAFEty Interoperability \nCOMMunications Program, commonly referred to as SAFECOM. This program \nserves as the umbrella program within the Federal Government to \ncoordinate the efforts of local, tribal, state and Federal public \nsafety agencies to promote effective, efficient and interoperable \nwireless communications. SAFECOM has been moved between the Department \nof Justice and the Department of Treasury and now resides at DHS. By \nauthorizing SAFECOM within its rightful place, DHS, it ensures the \nprogram will remain available to assist our Nation's first responders \nand localities.\n  SAFECOM has served as a consultant to many states and localities \nassisting with the development of their interoperable emergency \ncommunications systems. However, most importantly, SAFECOM has \ncompleted the development of critical standards for public safety \ncommunications equipment mandating interoperability, which is now \nincluded as a condition on all monies provided to localities by the \nFederal Government for public safety communications equipment. This \nshould provide for greater national interoperability and decreased \ncosts for localities. Recognizing the need for a centralized office to \nhandle all aspects of emergency communications planning, the \nAdministration created SAFECOM and this bill would authorize it.\n  Additionally, this bill would appropriate auction revenues from the \nsale of returned analog broadcast spectrum to create a subsidy to limit \nthe disruption of broadcast services to the public, especially for \nthose who rely exclusively on over-the-air broadcast television. The \ntotal cost of this subsidy program is not to exceed $1 billion. This \nmay sound like a great deal on money, especially to a fiscal \nconservative like myself; however, it is only a small portion of the \nrevenues it is believed the auction of this spectrum will generate. And \nmost importantly, it is a small cost to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to over-the-air television. Local television broadcasting is \ntruly an important part of our homeland security and often an important \ncommunications vehicle in the event of a national, regional or local \nemergency.\n  The New America Foundation testified before the Commerce Committee in \nJune 2004 that the auction of the analog television spectrum can be \nexpected to yield between $30-to-$40 billion in revenue to the \nTreasury. Last week in testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, \nFCC Chairman Powell stated that he has heard estimates as high as $70 \nbillion. Based on these projections, the $1 billion to fund a consumer \nsubsidy program would be less than three percent of the total expected \nauction revenues from the analog television spectrum.\n  One billion may even be more than enough to assist the 17.4 million \nover-the-air consumers because this figure assumes that digital-to-\nanalog converter boxes will retail for approximately $75 per box in \n2008. Last week, Motorola testified that they would introduce a \ndigital-to-analog converter box for $67 per unit in the near term. \nMotorola calculated that such a price per unit would cap the cost of \nproviding converters at less than $840 million nationwide to all over-\nthe-air consumers. This week Zenith Electronics announced that the \ncompany intends to retail digital-to-analog converter boxes at $50 to \n$70 per unit within four years.\n  The bill would also establish the parameters for the subsidy program, \nrequiring the program to be developed by the Department of Commerce in \nconjunction with the Office of Management and Budget and established no \nlater than January 1, 2008. The bill would require the program to give \npriority to funding equipment or services to low income viewers, to \noffer these viewers technology neutral options and to be conducted at \nthe lowest feasible administrative cost.\n  The bill would also authorize any remaining funds from the subsidy \nprogram, along with other auction monies, to be used to establish a \ngrant program to provide public safety organizations with emergency \ncommunications equipment so these groups can begin using the 24 MHz of \nspectrum by January 2009. The specific amount would be determined by \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget and be based on a \nNational Baseline Interoperability study currently being conducted by \nSAFECOM. This study is currently being performed to determine the \nprecise amount that is already being provided by the Federal government \nto local and regional public safety organizations for the purchase of \nnew communications equipment and for the funding of emergency \ncommunications training.\n  There are numerous grant programs throughout the Federal government, \nhowever no agency has ever studied how much money from how many grants \nis being provided to localities. After this study is completed, as \nrequired by this legislation by December 31, 2005, the Federal \ngovernment will best know how much money is necessary to ensure that \npublic safety organizations have the equipment necessary to immediately \nbegin using the 700 MHz spectrum in January 2009.\n  At the September 8, 2004 Senate Commerce Committee hearing, a \nrepresentative of public safety organizations testified, ``There also \nneeds to be expanded funding for equipment, and more extensive planning \nand cooperation among public safety personnel at all levels of \ngovernment. This includes local governments who must interoperate with \ntheir neighbors and with overlapping jurisdictions, regional \nauthorities covering large metropolitan areas and sometimes crossing \nstate borders, states through their State Interoperability Executive \nCommittees (SIECs), and the Federal Government.'' This bill would \nrespond to such requests from public safety organizations and \nlocalities. Just providing spectrum to public safety is not enough. \nWithout funds to purchase new equipment, this spectrum may sit fallow \nafter being vacated by the broadcasters. This would be an unfair result \nto broadcasters, public safety organizations and American citizens.\n  In pursuit of educating consumers about the digital television \ntransition, the bill would require, after September 30, 2005, the \nlabeling of all analog television sets to communicate to buyers that \nthe purchase of additional equipment may be necessary after December \n31, 2008. The bill would also require retailers to post the same \ninformation at the store.\n  Also in an effort to educate consumers about the digital television \ntransition, the bill would require, within one year of enactment, that \nthe Department of Commerce report back to the Senate and House Commerce \nCommittees any recommendations on an effective program to educate \nconsumers about the digital television transition; the need, if any, \nfor Federal funding, and the duration of such a program. Lastly, the \nbill would require the FCC to issue a decision on some remaining DTV \nproceedings, including a proceeding on whether cable or satellite \ncompanies should be required to carry broadcasters' multi-cast channels \nand whether broadcasters should have additional public interest \nrequirements as part of the DTV transition.\n  Specifically, the 9-11 Commission's Final Report gave Congress clear \ndirectives: accelerate the availability of spectrum for public safety \nand provide more spectrum for public safety. Public safety \norganizations have stated that neither of these goals can be met \nwithout increasing funding for public safety. This legislation charts a \ncourse to achieve all three of these objectives without stranding over-\nthe-air television consumers.\n  As you may be aware, Senator Lieberman and I introduced S. 2774 \nearlier this month implementing the 9-11 Commission's final \nrecommendations, including the recommendation that Congress should \nsupport H.R. 1425, ``The Homeland Emergency Response Operations Act,'' \ncommonly known as ``The HERO Act.'' The HERO Act would set an earlier \ndate of December 31, 2006 for the return of this spectrum. Senator \nLieberman and I included this language in our bill S. 2774.\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\n  After introducing S. 2774, I heard criticisms from some consumers and \nbroadcasters that the HERO Act was flawed as it did not ensure \ncontinued over-the-air broadcast television service. Public safety \norganizations also remained skeptical that they would have the funds \nnecessary to purchase equipment to operate on the newly acquired \nspectrum. Therefore, last week, as Chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nI held a Committee hearing to examine the benefits and shortcomings of \nthe HERO Act, and whether there are other policy proposals that could \nachieve the same result, providing spectrum and equipment expediously \nto public safety organizations, without potentially forcing some \ntelevision broadcast stations to go ``dark.''\n  I heard testimony that in order to meet the HERO Act's December 31, \n2006 deadline, at least 40 broadcast stations, and possibly more, \nbroadcasting on this spectrum would be required to vacate. In many of \nthese markets, there is no available spectrum for station relocation, \nmeaning this legislation may force some stations, including many \nSpanish language stations, to cease over-the-air broadcasting possibly \nharming consumers. As the CEO of PAXTV, a broadcaster who broadcasts on \n17 of these 40 affected stations, aptly stated, ``Our money was \ninvested on the basis that we would be treated equally with all \ntelevision stations during the transition. The [HERO Act] discriminates \nagainst us.''\n  I heard testimony from public safety representatives that the 24 MHz \nwas not enough, that more spectrum and more funds were needed to ensure \nadequate interoperable emergency communications systems are in place to \nensure the safety of first responders and the public. Chief Devine of \nthe Missouri State Highway Patrol stated, ``Inadequate spectrum leads \nto congested channels and interference among licensees, potentially \nblocking life-saving radio communications and generating confusion \nduring critical incidents. Additional spectrum capacity would alleviate \nthat congestion and allow for much faster `ramping up' of \ncommunications capability when major emergencies occur.''\n  In an effort to expediously retrieve the spectrum for the Nation's \nfirst responders, to preserve over-the-air television accessibility to \nconsumers and to ensure the adequate funding of both, I urge the \nenactment of The SAVE LIVES Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 2821. A bill to reauthorize certain programs of the Small Business \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small \nBusiness Reauthorization and Manufacturing Assistance Act of 2004,'' \nthat reauthorizes programs administered by the Small Business \nAdministration under the Small Business Act and the Small Business \nInvestment Act of 1958, and contains significant improvements to SBA \nprograms.\n  I am confident that the bill before us will accelerate our efforts to \nwork with the other body to resolve outstanding issues that are \nblocking passage of a larger Small Business Administration \nreauthorization bill. It is my hope Congress can send a final bill to \nhelp small businesses to the President for signature before the close \nof the 108th Congress.\n  The bill before us contains many provisions that are substantively \nsimilar to the Small Business Administration 50th Anniversary \nReauthorization Act of 2003, S. 1375, which was passed by the Senate on \nSeptember 26, 2003.\n  The fundamental purpose of the SBA is to ``aid, counsel, assist, and \nprotect the interests of small-business concerns.'' The methods for \ncarrying out the mandates set forth by Congress include a wide array of \nfinancial, procurement, management, and technical assistance programs \ntailored to encourage small business growth and expansion. As the \neconomy continues to recover and grow, it is essential that Congress \nsend a message that affirms long-term stability in the programs the SBA \nprovides to the small business community.\n  In the 50-year period since the establishment of the SBA, there have \nbeen many revisions and additions to the methods and organizational \nstructure used by the SBA to respond to the evolving needs of the small \nbusiness. This bill I introduce today builds on those changes.\n  Since 1953, nearly 20 million small business owners have received \ndirect or indirect help from one of the SBA's lending or technical \nassistance programs, making the agency one of the government's most \ncost-effective instruments for economic development.\n  SBA's current loan portfolio of more than 200,000 loans worth more \nthan $45 billion makes it the largest single supporter of small \nbusinesses in the country. In this year alone, lenders have made 83,912 \nloans to small businesses in the SBA's two major loan programs, with a \ntotal value of $16.5 billion.\n  Moreover, the SBA's Small Business Investment Company program's \ncurrent portfolio of more than 16,900 financings with an initial \ninvestment amount of $17.2 billion makes it the largest single equity-\ntype backer of U.S. businesses in the Nation. Since 1958 the venture \ncapital program has put more than $42.3 billion into the hands of small \nbusiness owners, and this year it has produced investments of more than \n$2.6 billion in small businesses.\n  The SBA estimates that thus far in the current fiscal year its loan \nand venture capital programs have provided small businesses with $19.7 \nbillion in various forms of financing, and have allowed small \nbusinesses to create or retain 716,144 jobs.\n  In my home State of Maine, almost 2,500 SBA loans have been made \nsince 1999, for a total of over $288 million, to small businesses that \nmight not have qualified for loans through lending channels not \nsupported by the SBA.\n  Each year, there are 3 to 4 million new business start-ups and one in \n25 adult Americans are taking steps to start a business. These small \nbusiness owners now want to make plans for the future, including \ndecisions that will create approximately two-thirds of all net new jobs \nand help sustain local communities, according to a recent survey by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business.\n  Over the last five years the SBA's programs and services have helped \ncreate and retain over 6.2 million jobs. According to the SBA, the \n$65.5 billion awarded to small businesses in Federal prime and \nsubcontracts in FY 2003 will create or retain close to 500,000 jobs.\n  The SBA also estimates that reauthorizing the agency will result in \nthe creation or retention of an estimated 3.3 million jobs over the \nnext 5 years. During that same period, the SBA and its programs are \npredicted to support over 1 million jobs through prime contracts and \nsubcontracts.\n  In September 2003, the Senate unanimously passed a bill that I had \nintroduced to reauthorize for 3 years the SBA and its programs, the \nSmall Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n2003. However, the other body has been stalled for almost a year in its \nconsideration of legislation to reauthorize the SBA.\n  In a highly competitive and dynamic economy, too much is at stake for \nsmall firms, and the economy as a whole, to let this legislation \nlanguish. With passage of a new multi-year reauthorization bill, we \nwill ensure that the SBA is well-positioned to help small businesses. \nClearly, this is not the time to delay legislation that directly \nbenefits the backbone of our economy, and our hope for the future--the \nsmall firms that are most responsible for putting people to work.\n  With the close of the 108th Congress rapidly approaching, the time to \nact is now!\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the benefit of small \nbusinesses, our economy, and our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2822. A bill to provide an extension of highway, highway safety, \nmotor carrier safety, transit, and other programs funded out of the \nHighway Trust Fund pending enactment of a law reauthorizing the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just this week--and this is only Tuesday--\nthe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \nknown as AASHTO, which is comprised of the transportation leaders from \nthe 50 States--the State of Missouri has a\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\ndirector of the department of transportation, the State of Ohio has a \ndirector of the department of transportation, the State of Nevada does; \ntheir titles may vary a little bit, but that is their job; that is who \nthis AASHTO is composed of, among others--they have called this week \nupon Congress to immediately pass a ``well funded, six year \nreauthorization'' of the Nation's transportation program. I agree with \nthem. But as you know, this program expired a year ago and the States \nhave been operating under a series of short-term extensions. This has \ndisrupted their construction programs, delayed safety improvements, and \ninterrupted funding to transit operators.\n  The fact is, we are not going to have a 6-year reauthorization bill \nthis year for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that we \npassed, as the Presiding Officer knows, a bill that was advocated for \nand supported by the senior Senator from the State of Missouri, a bill \nthat passed this House by a huge margin, a bill that created funding at \na level of $318 billion over the period of time of the bill. That bill \ndid not increase the Federal deficit a skinny dime, not anything. It \nwas a good bill, and we were stunned to learn that the President wanted \na bill at a much lower level, some $250-odd billion. Why? I have spoken \nto some of his closest friends around here, and they have not got a \nreason for that.\n  We have now some in this body who are bowing to pressure from the \nWhite House and are trying to write a bill at $284 billion, which is \n$28 billion more than what the President said he would agree to. Both \nof these are well below the spending limits called for by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation as to what they need, what their analysis \nis, and that which is sought by the entire transportation industry.\n  Not only do we have a resolution from AASHTO, the transportation \ndirectors, but we also have a letter from the United States Conference \nof Mayors which is quite clear and basically says the same thing. We \nalso have a resolution from the Association of Metropolitan Planning \nOrganizations.\n  In the absence of a well-funded, multiyear reauthorization bill, the \nNation's State transportation officials have called for at least a 6-\nmonth extension of the current program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution dated September 20, 2004, \nfrom the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials be printed in the Record, along with the documents I spoke of \nfrom the United States Conference of Mayors and the Association of \nMetropolitan Planning Organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Policy Resolution PR-06-04\n\n       Whereas, rescission of previously apportioned contract \n     authority has become commonplace in recent appropriations \n     bills, and\n       Whereas, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century, authorizing funding for federal-aid highway, transit \n     and highway transit safety programs, expired on September 30, \n     2003;\n       Whereas, the AASHTO Board of Directors passed a resolution \n     on May 16, 2004 calling for prompt enactment of a well-\n     funded, six-year reauthorization bill;\n       Whereas, the Congress has not yet passed a well funded, \n     six-year reauthorization bill;\n       Whereas, further extensions are intolerable and have the \n     following negative impacts on the Nation's transportation \n     system: Disruption to the construction program, adverse \n     effects on transportation decision making, safety \n     improvements delayed, funding disruptions to grant \n     recipients;\n       Whereas, prompt enactment of such a bill before the \n     adjournment of the 108th Congress remains the top priority of \n     state departments of transportation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, if Congress determines that an extension is \n     absolutely necessary, then it should be for six months to \n     avoid a series of disruptive and harmful shorter term \n     extensions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That such extension should provide for funding at \n     levels higher than FY 2004; and be it further\n       Resolved, That immediate reauthorization of the highway and \n     transit program at maximum funding levels is urgently needed \n     and preferable to any extension; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a six-month extension of the federal-aid \n     highway and transit programs should, to the maximum extent \n     possible, apportion highway funds to the States through the \n     existing core highway programs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2004.\n     Hon.

Jeffords,\n     Ranking Member, Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Conferees: In August, The United States Conference of \n     Mayors met in Chicago, Illinois for a special leadership \n     meeting to release its updated 4-point policy agenda for \n     keeping America Strong: Mayors '04 Metro Agenda for America's \n     Cities.\n       A major cornerstone of that agenda is transportation \n     investment of no less than $318 billion over six years for \n     the reauthorization of the nation's surface transportation \n     law (TEA-21) to build a 21st Century Transportation system \n     with modern transit, bridges, large-scale transportation \n     infrastructure projects, and metro highway systems with new \n     technologies that link major metro areas, cut the time people \n     spend in traffic, create more jobs, and move goods and \n     services more productively.\n       Should Congress determine an extension is necessary to meet \n     an investment of $318 billion over six-years, the nation's \n     mayors urge the adoption of a simple extension of no less \n     than six months avoiding disruption to the transportation \n     program occurring under short-term extensions.\n       Maintaining the Conference's support for a $318 billion \n     transportation bill requires continued balanced \n     transportation investment in our metropolitan areas \n     including:\n\n\n                    public transportation investment\n\n       Recognizing that public transportation reduces congestion, \n     the nation's mayors urge no less than $56.5 billion for \n     public transportation to stimulate a dramatic expansion of \n     high-capacity public transit systems, including light rail, \n     heavy rail, commuter rail, and bus service.\n       Funding for the transit program from the general fund and \n     the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund should be \n     guaranteed and we support maintaining current federal-local \n     matching shares for the transit program as authorized under \n     ISTEA and TEA-21.\n       Oppose efforts to increase funding for the highway program \n     by reducing funding for the transit program by maintaining \n     the 20% transit-80% highway share.\n       Support the historical funding allocation of 40% for rail \n     modernization, 40% for the new starts program and 20% for the \n     bus and bus facilities program as included in H.R. 3550.\n       Recognizing that cities throughout the United States are \n     embracing less expensive, fixed guideway transit projects \n     like streetcars, trolleys and bus rapid transit, we support \n     the establishment of a new Small Starts Program with modified \n     Federal rules to expedite these projects.\n\n\n                 metropolitan infrastructure investment\n\n       Acknowledging that 32 percent of our major roads are in \n     poor condition and 29 percent of the nation's bridges are \n     structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, we urge you \n     to fund the core highway programs at no less than the $261.5 \n     billion identified in the Senate bill.\n       Recognizing that it is difficult for localities and states \n     to dedicate adequate resources to build, rebuild, or repair \n     large-scale infrastructure projects addressing freight and \n     goods movement, safety, and aging and congested \n     transportation infrastructure, we urge no less than $6.6 \n     billion for ``Projects of National and Regional \n     Significance.''\n\n\n                        environmental investment\n\n       The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ) \n     should be funded at the Senate's $13.4 billion level in \n     response to the growing number of non-attainment areas \n     designated under the 8-hour ozone and fine particulate matter \n     standards.\n       Oppose efforts designed to divert CMAQ funds to other \n     purposes, undermining commitments to metropolitan areas to \n     fund the clean air mandate. Recognizing that metropolitan \n     areas are struggling with the contamination of drinking water \n     and the cleanup of streams, rivers, lakes and ponds from \n     stormwater discharge, including oil, grease, lead and \n     mercury, the nation's mayors support the establishment of a \n     Highway Stormwater Discharge Mitigation Program as designed \n     in S. 1072.\n\n\n                 safety and increased public investment\n\n       Recognizing that safe routes for bicycles, walking and \n     other non-motorized transportation choices are still \n     inadequate in many metropolitan areas, the nation's mayors \n     support the Safe Routes to School program as designed and \n     funded H.R. 3550 and also support maximum funding for \n     Transportation Enhancements.\n       We urge you to support the metropolitan planning fund \n     provision in the Senate bill that would increase the take \n     down for metropolitan areas from 1 percent to 1.5 percent. We \n     believe this adjustment will enhance clean air efforts, \n     increase public involvement and will improve congestion \n     relief efforts.\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\n oppose transportation technology innovation and demonstration program \n    provision that preempts local and state rights-of-way authority\n\n       We urge you to oppose the Transportation Technology \n     Innovation and Demonstration Program provision in S. 1072 \n     (Section 2105 (a)(5)) and H.R. 3550 (Section 5205 (g)(4)) \n     that preempts a local or state government from enforcing its \n     rights-of-way management rules on companies seeking to \n     provide Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems.\n       We urge you to respect the unimpeded right of local \n     government as owners/trustees of the rights-of-way to manage \n     their rights-of-way and to receive compensation, including \n     collection of all costs, including recovery of reasonable \n     rent, for the rights-of-way by companies seeking access to \n     the rights-of-way to provide Intelligent Vehicle Highway \n     Systems.\n       Transportation is a top priority for America's mayors. \n     Transportation is an economic stimulus. It creates jobs and \n     helps ensure that metropolitan economies thrive and in turn \n     the nation's economy.\n       The United States Conference of Mayors would be pleased to \n     supply additional information to further your assessment of \n     these issues before the conference committee. With strong \n     backing from mayors across the nation on these issues, we \n     stand ready to work with you on the reauthorization of TEA-\n     21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Resolution of the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations \n                     Transportation Reauthorization\n\n       Whereas, The Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st \n     Century, authorizing federal funding for highway and transit \n     programs, expired on September 30, 2003; and\n       Whereas, the Congress has not yet passed a well-funded six-\n     year reauthorization bill; and\n       Whereas, the last extension funds transportation projects \n     through September 24, 2004, nearly the end of the federal \n     fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) develop \n     their long range plans and Transportation Improvement \n     Programs based on the expectation that predictable funding \n     will be distributed for core programs, as has consistently \n     been done in the first four TEA-21 extensions; and\n       Whereas, ongoing extensions impede quality planning; and\n       Whereas, after the 2000 census, 46 new MPOs were created \n     without additional funds distributed to MPOs: Now, let it be\n       Resolved That the Association of Metropolitan Planning \n     Organizations (AMPO) urges Congress to promptly pass either a \n     multi-year fully funded bill or a one-year extension, bearing \n     in mind the needs of MPOs; and be it further\n       Resolved That money in the extension should be distributed \n     by formula to core programs and earmarks should be deferred \n     until reauthorization legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That core program funding should be spent for its \n     intended purpose and not flexed into other areas, \n     particularly CMAQ and STP suballocated to TMAs; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved That Congress and the Administration take \n     corrective action in order to ensure that the calculation for \n     the allocation of FHWA metropolitan planning (PL) funds and \n     urban attributable suballocated funds includes the minimum \n     guarantee amount for the FY 2005 apportionment, whether a \n     multi-year bill or a one-year extension is passed.\n\n  Mr. REID. As this Congress draws to a close, there continue to be \nlarge obstacles standing in the way of a well-funded, multiyear \nreauthorization. For this reason, I have joined with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Bond in a bipartisan effort and have introduced this \nday a clean 6-month extension of the highway, transit, and highway \nsafety programs. It certainly is my hope this would provide State and \nlocal officials with the predictability they need to effectively manage \nour transportation system.\n  I remain committed to working in a bipartisan way to achieve a \nsuccessful reauthorization of the Nation's surface transportation laws. \nI hope we can move forward on this 6-month extension.

Res. 430\n\n       Whereas the prevalence of runaway and homeless youth in the \n     United States is staggering, with studies suggesting that \n     between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 young people live on the \n     streets of the United States each year;\n       Whereas running away from home is widespread, with 1 out of \n     every 7 children in the United States running away before the \n     age of 18;\n       Whereas youth that end up on the streets are often those \n     who have been thrown out of their homes by their families, \n     who have been physically, sexually, and emotionally abused at \n     home, who have been discharged by State custodial systems \n     without adequate transition plans, who have lost their \n     parents through death or divorce, and who are too poor to \n     secure their own basic needs;\n       Whereas effective programs supporting runaway youth and \n     assisting young people in remaining at home with their \n     families succeed because of partnerships created among \n     families, community-based human service agencies, law \n     enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and \n     businesses;\n       Whereas preventing young people from running away and \n     supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family, \n     community, and national responsibility;\n       Whereas the future well-being of the Nation is dependent on \n     the value placed on young people and the opportunities \n     provided for youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and \n     abilities necessary to develop into safe, healthy, and \n     productive adults;\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and its members \n     advocate on behalf of runaway and homeless youth and provide \n     an array of community-based support services that address the \n     critical needs of such youth;\n       Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard provides crisis \n     intervention and referrals to reconnect runaway youth to \n     their families and to link young people to local resources \n     that provide positive alternatives to running away; and\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and the National \n     Runaway Switchboard are co-sponsoring National Runaway \n     Prevention Month to increase public awareness of the life \n     circumstances of youth in high-risk situations and the need \n     for safe, healthy, and productive alternatives, resources, \n     and supports for youth, families, and communities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 2004 as \n     ``National Runaway Prevention Month''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 431--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONSIDER AND TAKE \n    APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE GROWING THREATS POSED BY \nCONDITIONS IN BURMA UNDER THE ILLEGITIMATE RULE OF THE STATE PEACE AND \n                          DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold, \nMrs. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \nCorzine) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations;\n       Whereas the National League for Democracy, headed by Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, is the legitimately elected political \n     leadership in Burma;\n       Whereas the ruling State Peace and Development Council, \n     headed by General Than Shwe, and its affiliated organizations \n     continue, through a variety of means, to violate the human \n     rights and dignity of the people of Burma through murder, \n     torture, rape, forced relocation, the employment of child \n     soldiers, the use of forced labor, and the exploitation of \n     child laborers;\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council has \n     detained over 1,300 prisoners of conscience, including \n     National League for Democracy leaders and supporters of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas, under the repressive rule of the State Peace and \n     Development Council, the situation in Burma poses an \n     immediate and growing threat to the Southeast Asia region, \n     including through the unchecked spread of HIV/AIDS, the \n     illicit production of, and trafficking in, narcotics, \n     trafficking in persons, and alleged efforts to purchase \n     weapons from North Korea, China, and Russia;\n       Whereas, at the 58th session of the United Nations General \n     Assembly, a resolution was adopted by the General Assembly \n     that expresses grave concern about the ongoing systematic \n     violations of human rights inflicted upon the people of Burma \n     and calls on the\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\n     State Peace and Development Council to release all political \n     prisoners, respect the results of the national elections in \n     1990, and restore democracy to Burma; and\n       Whereas the National League for Democracy has called upon \n     the United Nations Security Council to intervene on behalf of \n     the people of Burma: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United Nations Security Council should immediately consider \n     and take appropriate actions to respond to the growing \n     threats posed to the Southeast Asia region by conditions in \n     Burma under the illegitimate rule of the State Peace and \n     Development Council, including the threats posed by \n     widespread human rights violations, the unchecked spread of \n     HIV/AIDS, the illicit production of, and trafficking in, \n     narcotics, trafficking in persons, and alleged efforts by the \n     State Peace and Development Council to purchase weapons from \n     North Korea, China, and Russia.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I submit, along with some fellow \nmembers of the unofficial, bipartisan Senate Burma Caucus, a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the United Nations Security \nCouncil should immediately consider and take appropriate actions to \nrespond to the growing threats posed by the State Peace and Development \nCouncil (SPDC) in Burma to its immediate neighbors and the entire \nregion.\n  What are these threats? The unchecked spread of HIV/AIDS that is \nfurther aggravated by the SPDC's use of rape as a weapon of war against \nthe people of Burma, particularly ethnic women and girls; the illicit \nproduction and trafficking in narcotics, which destroys the lives of \nAsian youth and families; trafficking in persons and brutal crackdowns \non ethnic minorities that create significant populations of internally \ndisplaced persons and refugees; alleged efforts to purchase weapons \nfrom North Korea, the People's Republic of China and Russia.\n  For the past decade, we have know that the SPDC poses a clear and \npresent danger to the people of Burma, including democracy leader and \nNobel Peace Prize recipient Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and other senior \nmembers of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Resolutions, \nstatements and reports by the U.S. State Department, the United \nNations, the European Nation (E.U.), and human rights organizations \nhave repeatedly documented and condemned brutal human rights violations \ncommitted with impunity by the SPDC.\n  Today, there is no question that Burma's myriad problems are no \nlonger the internal affair of a handful of psychopathic generals in \nRangoon.\n  Last May, the NLD called upon the U.N. Security Council to intervene.\n  Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Kingdom, and the \nAdministration, who are scheduled to take over chairmanship of the \nCouncil in October and November, respectively should heed their call.\n  In Burma, time now favors the democrats. With the international \ncommunity's continued vigilance, appropriate pressure can be placed on \nthe SPDC before they assume chairmanship of the ASEAN in 2006 to secure \na meaningful path toward reconciliation that includes the full and \nunfettered participation of the NLD. If the Security Council takes up \nthe matter of Burma, significant strides will be made toward democracy \nand justice in that country.\n  It is an understatement to say that I am disappointed with the E.U.'s \ndecision to allow ``low level'' participation by the SPDC in the \nupcoming ASEM meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. Such action serves only to \nprolong the suffering of the Burmese people, including the hundreds \ncurrently languishing in prisons for peacefully championing the \nprinciples of freedom and justice, and the three NLD youths recently \narrested for the ``heinous'' crime of gathering signatures on a \npetition calling for Suu Kyi's release from house arrest.\n  With France, Spain and Portugal reportedly clamoring to derail the \ntoughening of sanctions against Burma, it is only fair to ask: When \nwill they act to support the democrats of Burma?\n  It is time the world's democracies make 2006 the ``Year of \nDemocracy'' in Burma.\n  I want to recognize Senators Feinstein, McCain, Mikulski, Feingold, \nLeahy, and Dole for their support of the resolution, and freedom and \njustice in Burma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by William Ashton that \nappeared in the Irrawaddy on the SPDC's efforts to procure weapons be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Arms Keep Coming--But Who Pays?\n\n                          (By William Ashton)\n\n       Burma's ruling State Peace and Development Council, or \n     SPDC, has been at pains over recent months to tell the \n     international community that it is devoting a considerable \n     effort to implementing a new ``road map'' to multi-party \n     democracy and introducing measures for a more open economy. \n     The military government has also claimed major advances in \n     promoting education and public health, and in developing the \n     country's civil infrastructure.\n       The Rangoon regime can certainly point to an increase in \n     diplomatic activity, and show visitors to Burma many new \n     roads, buildings and dams. However, the SPDC's statements \n     continue to ignore the fact that, for the past 15 years, a \n     large proportion of its central budget-probably between 35 \n     and 45 per cent each year-has been allocated to the armed \n     forces, or Tatmadaw. This does not include significant \n     allocations to the defense sector from off-budget sources and \n     unofficial payments that never appear in the national \n     accounts. Also, while an increasing proportion of Burma's \n     annual defense expenditure is now used to pay for recurring \n     personnel and maintenance costs, a high percentage is still \n     devoted to the acquisition of new arms and equipment from \n     abroad.\n\n                      Continued Military Expansion\n\n       When the armed forces took back direct political power in \n     1988, they launched an ambitious defense expansion and \n     modernization program. Since then, the regime has \n     consistently spent a greater proportion of central government \n     outlays on defense than any other country in the Asia-Pacific \n     region. The Burmese armed forces have doubled in size, making \n     them the second largest in Southeast Asia and, by some \n     calculations, the 15th largest in the world. New command and \n     control structures have been put in place, and capabilities \n     in key support areas like intelligence, communications and \n     logistics have been substantially upgraded. The country's \n     military infrastructure has also been improved. In addition, \n     the Burma Army has acquired a wide range of tracked and \n     wheeled armor, towed and self-propelled artillery, air \n     defense weapons, transport, small arms and communications \n     equipment. The air force has taken delivery of more than 150 \n     helicopters, fighters, ground attack, transport and training \n     aircraft. The Burma Navy too has expanded dramatically, with \n     new corvettes, missile patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels \n     and riverine craft.\n       Given its enormous expansion since 1988, the massive influx \n     of arms and equipment since then, and the difficulties of \n     keeping its current inventory fully operational, it might be \n     expected that the Tatmadaw's acquisition programs would now \n     be slowing down. Yet, over the past 18 months, there has been \n     clear evidence that the Rangoon regime continues to give its \n     highest priority to the development of Burma's military \n     capabilities.\n       While some of the SPDC's more ambitious projects, such as \n     the planned acquisition of strategic weapon systems, have \n     reportedly been shelved for the time being, other major \n     contracts have gone ahead. China remains Burma's principal \n     source of military technology but, despite an arms embargo \n     imposed by its traditional suppliers, the regime has managed \n     to find a number of new vendors.\n\n                            Arms Deliveries\n\n       A survey of arms deals with Burma over the past 18 months \n     has revealed the following:\n\n\n                                 China\n\n       Rangoon is locked into a continuing close logistical \n     relationship with Beijing, due to the need to maintain all \n     the arms and military equipment purchased from China, at an \n     estimated cost of billions of dollars, since 1988. However, \n     the SPDC is interested in acquiring even more arms, and new \n     weapons and consignments of materiel continue to be \n     delivered. There have been reports of 200 heavy-duty trucks \n     crossing the China-Burma border, and of shipments of \n     unspecified ``air force weapons'', multiple rocket launchers \n     and possibly artillery. There were also reports in March 2004 \n     that the Burma Army was negotiating yet another arms deal \n     with China, this time to buy obsolescent weapons being phased \n     out by the People's Liberation Army. In addition, there have \n     long been rumors that Burma has been negotiating with China \n     for the purchase of combat helicopters, minesweepers, anti-\n     ship missiles and sea mines.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n       Rangoon's developing relationship with Pyongyang has gone \n     well beyond the small arms ammunition purchased in 1990, and \n     the sixteen 130mm artillery pieces acquired by the SPDC in \n     1998. For example, in 2003 a team of North Korean technicians \n     was sent to Rangoon to install surface-to-surface missiles on \n     some new Burma Navy vessels. In addition, discussions have \n     taken place between Rangoon and Pyongyang over the purchase \n     of a small submarine, and possibly even a number of SCUD \n     short-range ballistic missiles. Late last year there were \n     even suggestions that North Korea was assisting Burma with \n     the construction of a nuclear reactor, raising the specter of \n     the Rangoon regime one day acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\n                                 India\n\n       As part of a renewed effort to get closer to Burma, India \n     has provided the Tatmadaw with a range of weapons, ammunition \n     and equipment. In May 2003 the Indian Defense Ministry \n     confirmed that it had sold the Tatmadaw eighty 75mm howitzers \n     (or ``mountain guns''). Also, India has reportedly sold \n     mortar and artillery ammunition to Rangoon, and advanced \n     communications equipment. A Burmese military delegation \n     visiting India in early 2004 said that the Tatmadaw welcomed \n     further arms deals. The Indian Defense Minister has stated \n     that New Delhi is keen to sell Burma naval vessels. A \n     demonstration by Indian combat aircraft in Burma this year \n     prompted speculation about future sales to the Burma Air \n     Force.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n       The Russian language press stated in late 2002 that the \n     Ukraine had contracted to provide Burma with some 36D6 radar \n     systems. In mid-2003 it was reported that the Ukraine had \n     sold the Tatmadaw 50 T-72 main battle tanks. In February \n     2004, a Ukrainian-flagged ship made a secret delivery to \n     Rangoon, probably of air defense weapons. Also, in May 2003, \n     one of the Ukraine's leading arms exporters signed a contract \n     with Burma worth US $500 million, to provide the Rangoon \n     regime with components for 1,000 BTR-3U light armored \n     personnel carriers. Over the next ten years these vehicles \n     will be supplied in parts, and assembled in a new, purpose-\n     built factory in Burma. More arms deals between Rangoon and \n     Kiev are likely.\n\n\n                                 serbia\n\n       In December 2003, Serbian language sources claimed that \n     Rangoon had contracted with Belgrade to buy a number of \n     ``Nora'' self-propelled howitzers. The cost of these weapons, \n     which are marketed by Jugoimport-SDPR, is unknown. In \n     addition, in March 2004 about 30 Serbian engineers arrived in \n     Burma to repair and upgrade the Burma Air Force's 12 Soko G-4 \n     jets, which were purchased from the Republic of Yugoslavia in \n     the 1990s. These aircraft have been grounded for several \n     years, due largely to a lack of spare parts.\n\n\n                                 russia\n\n       In late 2002 the SPDC purchased eight MiG-29B-12 air \n     superiority combat aircraft and two dual-seat MiG-29UB \n     trainers from Russia, at a reported cost of about US $130 \n     million. All these aircraft were delivered to Burma by the \n     end of 2003. In addition, in July 2002 Rangoon signed a \n     contract with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) \n     for the construction of a nuclear reactor in Burma. While the \n     project has encountered major problems, probably due to its \n     cost, it may still go ahead. It is likely that the shipments \n     of Russian military equipment detected in southern Burma in \n     April 2003, which were thought to be components for the \n     reactor, were in fact deliveries of a new communications \n     system.\n\n\n                                slovakia\n\n       According to a news report dated October 2003, the Unipex \n     Company of Slovakia is currently being investigated for \n     taking part in the illegal export to Burma of machines for \n     the manufacture of ``artillery grenades'' (possibly rocket \n     propelled grenades).\n       It is likely that other contracts have been signed but not \n     yet been made public. The frequent visits to Rangoon of North \n     Korean and Ukrainian cargo vessels over the past 18 months, \n     and the measures taken to hide the nature of their cargoes, \n     strongly suggests that other deliveries of arms and equipment \n     have occurred. Several eastern European countries are keen to \n     sell arms to Burma. Also, countries like Singapore, Pakistan \n     and Israel maintain close links with Rangoon. All have weapon \n     systems that are on the Tatmadaw's wish list. In the past, \n     these factors have often led to substantial sales of weapons, \n     military equipment and dual use goods to Burma, and related \n     training contracts.\n\n\n                            paying the bill\n\n       In considering the financial implications of these sales, \n     several factors need to be borne in mind. Not only does the \n     regime need to cover the initial purchase price of these \n     arms, but it faces the continuing costs of keeping them \n     serviceable, providing facilities to house them, buying spare \n     parts to maintain them and training people to repair and use \n     them. The latter often includes sending selected military \n     personnel overseas for specialized training, and in a few \n     cases supporting foreign experts resident in country. Some of \n     these costs can be paid in local currency, but they still \n     constitute a heavy drain on Burma's precious foreign exchange \n     reserves. The regime is still able to earn hard currency \n     through the export of gas, gems, timber, agricultural produce \n     and other natural resources, but its economy is facing major \n     problems. These have not been helped by the new sanctions \n     imposed by the U.S. in June 2003, after a government mob \n     violently attacked democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu \n     Kyi.\n       In the past, some of these costs have been met through \n     trade deals, under which Burma has paid for part of its \n     contracts with primary goods like rice and teak. North Korea \n     and Russia, for example, have accepted such commodities in \n     part payment for arms and military equipment. Even the \n     Russian nuclear reactor could be paid for in part through \n     barter arrangements. Also, for strategic and other reasons, \n     some arms suppliers have been very generous in their terms. \n     For example, China has repeatedly offered the Rangoon regime \n     special ``friendship prices'' for arms, and overlooked \n     deadlines for the repayment of loans. The Ukrainian firm \n     selling Burma APCs has probably provided vendor financing of \n     some kind.\n       Even so, given the regime's current debts, its continuing \n     need for foreign logistical support, and its latest \n     acquisitions, the investment required now and in the future \n     will be huge for a country like Burma. These costs must \n     inevitably be carried at the expense of other sectors of the \n     government that are desperate for scarce resources.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \na resolution submitted yesterday by Senator McConnell and myself that \nurges the United Nations Security Council to respond to the growing \nthreats posed to the Southeast Asia region by conditions in Burma under \nthe rule of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).\n  I have been proud to work with Senator McConnell to raise awareness \nabout the situation in Burma and to put pressure on the SPDC to respect \nthe wishes of the Burmese people, restore democracy, and release from \nhouse arrest the leader of the National League for Democracy and Nobel \nPeace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi. Congress has acted decisively in \nsupport of these efforts by passing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003 to impose a complete ban on Burmese imports for one year \nand renewing that ban this past July.\n  There is still much work to be done. The threat posed by the military \njunta goes beyond Burma's borders and extends to the entire Southeast \nAsia region. The SPDC has committed numerous human rights abuses and \ndetained over 1,300 political prisoners. It has allowed the spread of \nHIV/AIDS to go unchecked. It has engaged in the illicit production and \ntrafficking of narcotics. It has engaged in the trafficking of human \nbeings. It has attempted to purchase weapons from North Korea, China, \nand Russia.\n  The international community simply cannot afford to ignore these \nthreats any longer. Inaction will only strengthen the regime in Rangoon \nand foster greater instability in the Southeast Asia region. This \nresolution simply encourages the United Nations Security Council to \nconsider the situation in Burma carefully and take appropriate action.\n  While I am proud that the United States has acted in support of \nfreedom and democracy in Burma, we need the help of our friends and \nallies to put pressure on the SPDC to change its behavior and respect \nthe wishes of the Burmese people and the international community. I \nurge my colleagues to support the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9455-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3664.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as \n     envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), and \n     in the Machakos Protocol of 2002, is in jeopardy.\n       (2) Since 1989, the Government of Sudan has repeatedly \n     engaged in and sponsored orchestrated campaigns of attacking \n     and dislocating targeted civilian populations, disrupting \n     their ability to sustain themselves, and subsequently \n     restricting assistance to those displaced in a coordinated \n     policy of ethnic cleansing that is most recently evident in \n     the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (3) In response to 2 decades of civil conflict in Sudan, \n     the United States has helped to establish an internationally \n     supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to \n     the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan \n     signed June 5, 2004.\n       (4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was \n     negotiating for a final countrywide peace, enumerated in the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, \n     it refused to engage in any meaningful discussion with regard \n     to its ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region of \n     Darfur.\n       (5) It was not until the international community expressed \n     its outrage, through high level visits by Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell and others, and through United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1556 of July 30, 2004, that the Government \n     of Sudan agreed to attend talks to bring peace to the Darfur \n     region.\n       (6) The Government of the United States, in both the \n     executive branch and Congress, have concluded that genocide \n     has been committed and may still be occurring in Darfur, and \n     that the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear \n     responsibility for the genocide.\n       (7) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     has identified massive human rights violations in Darfur \n     perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, \n     which the Commissioner stated may constitute war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n       (8) Evidence collected by international observers in the \n     Darfur region between February 2003 and September 2004 \n     indicate a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese \n     civilians in a scorched earth policy, from both air and \n     ground, that has destroyed African Sudanese villages, killing \n     and driving away its people, while Arab Sudanese villages \n     have been left unscathed.\n       (9) As a result of this coordinated campaign, which \n     Congress and the executive branch have declared to be \n     genocide, reports indicate tens of thousands of African \n     Sudanese civilians killed, the systematic rape of thousands \n     of women and girls, the destruction of hundreds of Fur, \n     Masalit, and Zaghawa villages and other ethnically African \n     populations, including the poisoning of their wells and the \n     plunder of crops and cattle upon which they sustain \n     themselves.\n       (10) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, 1,400,000 people have been displaced in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan, of whom over 200,000 have been forced to \n     flee to Chad as refugees.\n       (11) The Government of Sudan conducted aerial attack \n     missions and deadly raids across the international border \n     between Sudan and Chad in an illegal effort to pursue \n     Sudanese civilians seeking refuge in Chad.\n       (12) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths \n     directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government \n     sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the \n     Government of Sudan has restricted humanitarian and human \n     rights workers' access to the Darfur area, primarily through \n     bureaucratic and administrative obstruction, in an attempt to \n     inflict the most devastating harm on those displaced from \n     their villages and homes without any means of sustenance or \n     shelter.\n       (13) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the \n     Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, \n     shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region is estimated \n     by the World Health Organization to be resulting in up to \n     10,000 deaths per month and, should current conditions \n     persist, is projected to escalate to thousands of deaths each \n     day by December 2004.\n       (14) The Government of Chad served an important role in \n     facilitating the Darfur humanitarian cease-fire (the \n     N'Djamena Agreement dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur \n     region between the Government of Sudan and the 2 opposition \n     rebel groups in Darfur (the JEM and the SLA) although both \n     sides have violated it repeatedly.\n       (15) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the \n     plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees by providing \n     assistance to them even though such assistance has adversely \n     affected their own means of livelihood.\n       (16) The cooperation and inclusion of all Sudanese is \n     essential to the establishment of peace and security \n     throughout all of Sudan.\n       (17) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in \n     regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the \n     crisis in Darfur, by convening talks between the parties and \n     deploying several hundred monitors and security forces to the \n     region, as well as by recognizing the need for a far larger \n     force with a broader mandate.\n       (18) Despite the threat of international action expressed \n     through United Nations

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is the way we should proceed. This is \nexcellent. I have confidence in Judd Gregg, the chairman of the \ncommittee. I don't agree with him lots of times, but he is a man who \nbelieves in the procedures we have established here many years ago. I \nam confident this will be a very successful conference.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased that we have been \nable to finally get to conference on IDEA. We hope the conferees will \nbe successful shortly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are going to \nconference on the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. This is the landmark Federal law that sets national \nstandards for special education, and defines the rights of children \nwith disabilities in our public schools.\n  We have ahead of us the key challenge of modernizing this important \nlaw to meet today's demands and to ensure that the rights of children \nwith special needs truly are protected. Disabled does not mean unable. \nWe must do everything possible to ensure that children with \ndisabilities have the same opportunities to learn as other children.\n  I want to thank our committee chairman, Senator Gregg, for his \nleadership in guiding through the Senate a strong bipartisan bill to \nmeet that challenge. I look forward to working closely with him, \nChairman John Boehner, Congressman George Miller, and our other \ncolleagues on the committee to produce a final bill that parents can \nsupport and that will enjoy bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/21/senate-section/article/S9468-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9468-S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
