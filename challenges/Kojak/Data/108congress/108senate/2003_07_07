Mr. President, today the Senate returns from the Fourth of \nJuly recess, and I do hope everybody had a safe and restful period. As \nI announced before the recess, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session. The next scheduled rollcall votes will begin tomorrow \nat 11:45 a.m.\n  The first vote will be on the confirmation of David Campbell to be a \nU.S. District Judge for Arizona. The second vote will be invoking \ncloture on the nomination of Victor Wolski to be a judge for the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims.\n  I would like to take a minute or two to talk about this month's \nschedule. We are now entering a very busy legislative session for the \nSenate. There is much work to be done, and we have only 4 weeks to do \nthat. One major focus for the Senate this month will be the \nappropriations process. Senator Stevens will be working hard to prepare \nthe spending bills for floor action, and we will be scheduling these \nfor floor action throughout the month.\n  In addition, this month we will complete consideration and passage of \nthe Energy bill. Both consideration and passage will be before the \nAugust recess. I am committed, along with Chairman Domenici, to pass an \nenergy bill that will enhance our country's national energy security. \nThere are many remaining amendments, as we all know, to debate and \ndispose of, but I do want to be clear: We must pass a bill as soon as \npossible to establish a clear national energy policy which will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  Third, we have a lot of remaining work to do on executive \nnominations, especially judicial nominations. I urge my colleagues \nagain to allow the Senate to work its will on these nominations and \ngive them an up-or-down vote. I will continue to schedule consideration \nof nominations as they become available with the hope that we can move \nforward and give the individuals their due process. Advice and consent \nmeans allowing Senators an up-or-down vote on the President's \nnominations.\n\n  Fourth, today we will begin to address the crisis of medical \nliability. Prior to the recess we attempted to reach consent to begin \nconsideration of S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003. We are in \ndesperate need of medical liability reform in this country, and now is \nthe time for us to act. Unfortunately, there was an objection prior to \nthe recess to proceeding to this bill. Today if we are unable to reach \nthat consent, it would be my intent to move to proceed to that bill and \nfile cloture on the motion if that is necessary. If that is the case, \nthe vote would occur on Wednesday of this week. Senator McConnell will \nbe here later this afternoon to discuss the medical malpractice crisis.\n  Also this week we will consider other authorization measures, \nincluding the State Department authorization. Chairman Lugar has \nindicated the bill will be ready for the floor this week. We hope we \nwill be able to complete action on this important bill in a day or two.\n  These are just a few of the issues we will be addressing during this \nlegislative session. A lot of that will be done this week. To get our \nwork done, it is going to take the cooperation of all Senators. We will \nschedule these items for consideration from Monday through Friday. \nHaving said that, I alert Members they should prepare for full days of \nvoting that includes Mondays and especially Fridays. That includes this \nFriday. Senators should arrange their schedules accordingly and plan to \nbe here in the Senate each day of the week unless I specifically say we \nare not having votes.\n  I do want to thank my colleagues for their attention and look forward \nto work together with them in a collaborative way in what will be a \nvery busy 4 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/07/senate-section/article/S8869-5", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8869-S8870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader for the \ninformation he has just given us about the schedule for the month of \nJuly. Obviously, we do have a lot of important work to do. Having dealt \nwith the difficulties of having to put in full days, including votes on \nMondays and Fridays, I know it is not always well received. It has to \nbe done in order to achieve these very important pieces of legislation \nthat need to be acted on in July.\n  I especially thank the leader for going forward with the legislation \non medical liability reform, the Patients First Act. In my own State of \nMississippi, we have a health care catastrophe on our hands. Doctors \nare losing their coverage. They are leaving the State. And they are \ngetting out of specialty services such as in the case of an OB/GYN. \nThey are getting out of obstetrics. It is causing a huge problem along \nthe Mississippi gulf coast where we have over 500,000 people. We are \ndown to three neurosurgeons. We did have seven. We have two fully \nstaffed trauma facilities in that area, only two. And with only three \ndoctors now, on weekends we are really stretched very thin. If we lose \none more neurosurgeon, we will not be able to keep those two trauma \nfacilities operative.\n  We also have a problem in getting an adequate number of orthopedic \nsurgeons. As Dr. Frist knows, you have to have an orthopedic surgeon \navailable also for trauma services. We recently attracted a doctor from \nSt. Louis, MO who wanted to raise his family in a smaller community. He \nis an outstanding doctor. He was paying $70,000 a year for his medical \nliability insurance when he left St. Louis. He came to our State. \nWithin 6 months his coverage went up to $150,000 a year. This is an \nAfrican American doctor, highly qualified, desperately needed there in \nthe Pascagoula-Moss Pt., MS area. I am afraid he is not going to be \nable to stay with that kind of problem.\n  This is a huge problem. Some of my friends I went to law school with \nare saying: Let the States handle this problem. Some States have done a \npretty good job. California has done an exemplary job. I believe this \nlegislation is pretty closely patterned after the California example.\n  Some States have done some good work but other States have done \nnothing or very little. My own State, while the legislature wrestled \nwith it, made some progress but it has not been nearly enough. My \nfriends in the bar say this is a States rights issue, more or less. But \nin this case there is no question that this is driving up health care \ncosts across the board. Doctors will tell you that they are ordering \nadditional procedures--defensive medicine, if you will--and it is \nclearly affecting how much Medicare is costing.\n  I have heard astronomical numbers, and I will verify them before I \nspeak on this issue tomorrow or the next day as to exactly how much the \nimpact of this excessive lawsuit activity against doctors and the \nmedical professions and the hospitals is driving up the cost of \nMedicare. There is no question--you might say the States have a right \nto do this and can handle it, or tort reform, or product liability \neven; but in this case there is no question that it has a Federal \nramification that is costing us lots of money.\n  We are trying to do the right thing for Medicare beneficiaries. We \nare trying to put prescription drugs in there but we need reform and we \nhave to find some ways to reduce the costs that are being paid out by \nMedicare. This is one way to do it.\n  I am excited that we are going forward with this bill. I don't know \nif we can get enough votes to stop a filibuster but that is not the \nimportant thing. The important thing is that we have a crisis \ndeveloping in America in health care delivery and the medical liability \narea, and so I think we should take it up and let's have the vote--and \nwe may have to have more than one vote.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  The other thing I want to do is pick up on what the leader said about \njudicial nominations. I continue to be concerned that we are in the \nprocess of setting a precedent, where judges can be defeated by \nfilibuster. That has not been the rule. That has not been done--there \nis maybe one instance that you can point to in 200 years. In that case, \nI think it is a very fragile argument because the nominee, Abe Fortas, \nwas debated for only 10 days, and there were ethical problems that \ndeveloped and his name was withdrawn. We didn't do it during the \nClinton years.\n  A lot of delays are involved when you are talking about how Senators \nreact, and sending a blue slip to indicate their preference on judicial \nnominations, and there were concerns and a lot of problems. But not one \ntime did we defeat a judge by filibuster. I had to file cloture, I \nthink, six or seven times but in each case we either vitiated it or had \na vote on cloture and then went straight to the vote. We completed \naction on those judges.\n  I don't think we should have a litmus test that involves one issue, \nor a few issues, because I make the case repeatedly that I voted for \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, even though I knew that philosophically I \nwould not agree with her. On a lot of issues I strongly disagreed with \nher. But she was qualified by education, experience, temperament, and \nethics. She had a right, I believe, to have an up-or-down vote. She got \none and she was confirmed, and I voted for her.\n  On two of the other nominees, I believe for the Ninth Circuit, Berzon \nand Paez, I felt very strongly that they should not be on that circuit \ncourt bench. But, again, they came through the committee, we debated \nthem on the floor, there was an attempted filibuster, which I opposed, \nand we voted on them. I voted against them but they got a vote. They \nwere confirmed and they now serve on the judiciary.\n\n  I think the leader has tried very diligently to find a way to get \naway from these filibusters, even though we still have two. I think we \nhave had five or six votes on cloture on Miguel Estrada, and I think we \nhave had two on Priscilla Owen. But I hear there may be filibusters on \nother qualified men and women, as well as the minorities that are going \nto be affected by this--especially in the case of Miguel Estrada.\n  So we have to find a way to get away from this. There is even talk \nnow that maybe we should have recess appointments. I don't think that \nis a good precedent either. I spoke against it on the floor when \nPresident Clinton did it, so how can I now say it is OK? But if we \ncontinue down this trail of filibustering judges, there will be a \nreaction. There will have to be additional action.\n  The leader has introduced a bill that has been reported out of the \nRules Committee that would be very careful. After 12 days, you could \nfile cloture, and then it would be 60 votes required; the second \ncloture, 57; the third cloture, 54; and finally, only 51 after \nbasically what would take a full month. I think that is a very long, \nprotracted, and unnecessary process but it, again, shows good faith on \nthe part of the leader to find a way to get ourselves out of this \nprecedent.\n  I think we will all rue the day if we do this. Yes, we have all \nramped up the difficulty in confirming judges on both sides with a \nnumber of men and women, perhaps unfairly. But we are taking a huge \nleap and really undermining the process for confirming Federal judges \nif we allow filibusters to stand. We must find a way in the next couple \nof months to work through this. I call on my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, let's let cooler heads prevail and pull back from this \nprecipice that we are standing on and find a way to give these judges \nan up-or-down vote. I believe we will be better as an institution and \nthe judiciary will be better if we avoid this problem.\n  I have been thinking about these issues over the past week when I \nhave been at home. I particularly was confronted everywhere I went with \nthe problem of doctors in my State of Mississippi, and to be able to \nkeep the doctors in practice, keep them from retiring and leaving the \nStates, we must act in this area.\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before we left for the Fourth of July \nrecess, we passed historic legislation to improve Medicare, to \nstrengthen Medicare, and to offer for the first time a prescription \ndrug benefit through the Medicare Program for our seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities. We worked hard in that endeavor to \nproduce a bipartisan consensus, working together on both sides of the \naisle, with this common mission, this common goal, and we succeeded.\n  We were successful in passing a bipartisan bill that for the first \ntime since 1965, in the history of Medicare, offers access to this new \nprescription drug benefit, and at the same time reforms, modernizes, \nand strengthens Medicare in a very significant way. Both individuals \nwith disabilities and seniors collectively, 40 million people, will \nhave health care coverage that in the future will be responsive to \ntheir needs in order to achieve that goal of health care security after \nthe age of 65 or, if you are an individual with a disability, in the \nnear future.\n  It is responsive to them directly but also in a way that will allow \nthe Medicare Program to take advantage of the great innovations in \ntechnology, in new prescription drugs that can make people's lives \nbetter, which will improve the quality of life.\n  I mentioned the fact that this was bipartisan legislation. I think it \nis important that we showed a spirit of cooperation in taking on an \nissue many people in the United States thought would be too partisan \nand too political. We addressed it in a bipartisan fashion with the \nleadership of Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus in a way that was \nreasoned, showed common sense, and that accomplished that goal of \nsignificant modernization while at the same time adding a new benefit. \nWe identified the issue. We tackled it head on, and we delivered a bill \nthat reflected the priorities of both sides of the aisle.\n  That demonstrated to me, and I think to the American people, that \neven in a very evenly, closely divided Senate, if we share a common \ngoal we can indeed move America forward on issues that are important to \nthe American people.\n  Coming back from recess, we will very shortly begin the conference \nwhere once again both sides of the aisle will work together, the Senate \nand the House, to fashion a final product that will be a resolution of \nthe differences between that House and Senate bill. I am confident in \nthat process we will have the same resolve and determination in meeting \nthat goal, that we will be able to bridge those differences, and \ndevelop a strong bill that can be supported in a bipartisan way and \nsigned by the President of the United States. Both Chambers are \ncommitted to accomplishing this, to doing it right, and to getting it \ndone.\n\n\n                      Presidential Trip to Africa\n\n  I do want to comment on the President's trip to Africa. I commend \nPresident Bush for his bold leadership and his personal, as well as \ngovernmental--meaning the Senate, the House, and the executive branch--\ncommitment to the pressing needs of Africa. President Bush will be \nleaving this afternoon for Africa to see firsthand the opportunities, \nand indeed the challenges, that exist on that continent.\n  Approximately once a year I have had the opportunity, since being in \nthe Senate, to go to that continent, to a range of countries, several \nof which he will be going to. The countries I usually go to are the \nSudan, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. He will visit a range of other \ncountries.\n\n  I think it is important for members of the executive branch as well \nas Members of this body and the House of Representatives to go \nfirsthand and see the ravages that occur as a product of this little \nvirus, HIV/AIDS, to see the impact of malaria, to see the impact of \nresistant tuberculosis and, at the same time, to look at the issues \nthat surround the security of those nations as well as international \nsecurity.\n  The President's trip will highlight a positive, substantive agenda \nthat the administration has put on the table. Part of that agenda and \nvision is this AIDS initiative which we addressed in the Senate a \nlittle over a month ago, a 5-year, $15 billion commitment that this \nbody passed and was ultimately signed by the President. This global \nHIV/AIDS initiative is the largest international public health \ninitiative on a single disease, a single entity, in the history of this \ncountry.\n  I look forward to taking a delegation of U.S. Senators to Africa \nsometime in August--next month--to advance our collective effort in \nthis regard.\n  As I mentioned earlier in opening the Senate, we have a very \nchallenging month ahead with medical liability, with energy, with the \nappropriations process, which will be well underway in a few days, with \nthe judicial nominees, with State Department authorization. There is a \nlot to accomplish. I am confident we can meet the goals I set out this \nafternoon. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make this \none of the most productive sessions thus far.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

I look forward to the very \nimportant debate on this truly national crisis, and I encourage Members \nwho want to speak to come to the floor today. We will be debating this \nlegislation today as well as tomorrow. We encourage Members to come to \nthe floor today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is perhaps no more vexing \nchallenge confronting this Congress than improving the quality and \naffordability of health care for all our citizens.\n  Just a few weeks ago, this Senate took historic action to strengthen \nand modernize Medicare by providing seniors new choices and adding a \nprescription drug benefit. During the past year, this Senate passed \nlegislation to provide new resources to the scientists at the National \nInstitutes of Health and to strengthen our Nation's defenses against \nthe threat of bioterrorism.\n  While we shouldn't minimize the importance of these initiatives, the \nSenate has not addressed one of the most fundamental problems limiting \nAmerican access to quality health care; that is, reforming our Nation's \nflawed medical liability system.\n  Our current medical liability system encourages excessive litigation, \ndrives up costs, and is literally scaring doctors out of the medical \nprofession. All too often, these lawsuits result in exorbitant \njudgments that benefit personal injury lawyers more than they \ncompensate injured patients. I am pleased that the Senate will soon \nconsider legislation, the Patients First Act, authored by Senator \nEnsign, to address many of these shortcomings.\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\n  As we debate this legislation over the next several days, Members \nwill use some complex actuarial terms such as ``combined loss ratios,'' \n``asset allocation,'' and ``the McCarran-Ferguson Act'' to illustrate \ntheir points. While they may be important, I believe it is more \nimportant that we recognize this is a real crisis facing real families.\n  Let's look first at this photo of Tony and Leanne Dyess with their \nfamily. This picture was taken prior to July 5 of last year. On that \nevening, Tony was critically injured in a car accident while on his way \nhome from work in Gulfport, MS. Immediately after the crash, Tony was \nrushed to Garden Park Hospital, right there in Gulfport, suffering from \nserious brain injuries that required immediate medical attention.\n  Tragically, nearly all of the specialists capable of treating this \ntype of head injury had left Gulfport because of the medical liability \ncrisis and none was available to treat Tony Dyess.\n  Tony had to be airlifted to University Medical Center in Jackson, MS. \nSix excruciating hours passed before he received the surgery he needed \nto relieve the swelling in his brain. As Dr. Frist can explain to us, \nevery minute is critical when treating patients who have experienced \nserious brain trauma.\n  While the doctors in Jackson saved Tony's life, they were unable--\nunable--to prevent him from suffering permanent brain damage. As a \nresult, Tony will require constant care and medical attention for the \nrest of his life.\n  The Senate was fortunate to hear from Leanne Dyess when she testified \nbefore a joint HELP-Judiciary Committee hearing on the medical \nliability crisis earlier this year. I thank her for her willingness to \nshare her story with the American people and ask unanimous consent that \nher testimony be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let's consider the case of Melinda \nSallard. This is a picture of Melinda Sallard and her daughter. They \nlive in Arizona.\n  In 2002, the administrators at Copper Queen Community Hospital in \nBisbee, AZ, were forced to close their maternity ward because their \ndoctors' insurance premiums had risen by 500 percent.\n  A few months later, Melinda awoke at 2 o'clock in the morning with \nsharp labor pains. Since her local hospital stopped delivering babies \nbecause of the medical liability crisis, Melinda and her husband were \nfaced with a 45-mile drive to Sierra Vista in order to reach the \nnearest hospital with a maternity ward. As many of us who are parents \nknow, babies do not always wait for the hospital, particularly when \nthat hospital is almost an hour away.\n  Melinda gave birth to her daughter in a car on a desert highway \nheading to Sierra Vista. When the newborn was not breathing, her \nlevelheaded mother cleared the child's mouth and performed CPR. After \nresuscitating the infant, Melinda wrapped her in a sweater, and the new \nfamily completed the journey to Sierra Vista. Thankfully, both mother \nand daughter survived. However, it is unacceptable that expectant \nmothers should be forced to drive past a perfectly good hospital and \ndrive 45 miles through the desert to deliver a child.\n\n  Unfortunately, these are not isolated anecdotes but just a few \nexamples of the impact runaway litigation is having on patients in \nevery corner of our country. Patients across America--from the Pacific \nNorthwest to the Southeast, from New England to the desert Southwest--\nare facing a medical liability crisis.\n  As many of our colleagues will recall, I offered an amendment to the \ngeneric drug legislation just last year that included some very modest \nmedical liability reforms. During that debate, I called our colleagues' \nattention to this map produced by the American Medical Association. At \nthat time, the AMA had identified 12 States, those States that are \ndepicted on the map in red--this was a little over a year ago--as \nexperiencing a medical liability crisis. The States shown on the map in \nyellow were ones at that time with significant problems which were \nnearing a crisis.\n  As I am about to illustrate, the situation has grown worse in the \npast year. The AMA reports there are now 19 States experiencing a \nmedical liability crisis, with the addition of Wyoming just today.\n  Unfortunately, my own State of Kentucky is one of those States now \nfacing a medical liability crisis. Knox County Hospital in \nBarbourville, KY, which is in the eastern part of our State, recently \nannounced it would no longer deliver babies because its doctors could \nno longer handle the malpractice premiums. The hospital averaged about \n200 deliveries per year. These mothers-to-be will now be forced to \ntravel an additional one-half hour through Kentucky's mountain roads to \nthe next closest hospital.\n  Not surprisingly, these expectant mothers are upset. One mother-to-be \ntold the Lexington Herald Leader: ``To have to see someone new at the \nlast moment is just horrible. You develop a close bond with your \ndoctor, almost like family. You don't want a stranger.''\n  In another part of our State, Dr. Susan Coleman, up in Danville, was \nforced to give up delivering babies after her premiums doubled from \n$44,000 a year to $105,000 a year--even though she has never lost a \njury verdict or paid an out-of-court settlement. More than two-thirds--\n84 of 120--of Kentucky's counties have either one or no obstetricians \nwho will deliver babies.\n  This crisis has hit Kentucky's teaching hospitals as well. These \nvaluable institutions not only train our future doctors, they also \ntackle many of the most difficult medical procedures. Earlier this \nyear, the University of Louisville Obstetrics Department was just days \naway from closure because it could not find insurance for its doctors.\n  As I travel through Kentucky, I am approached frequently by doctors \nwho plead for reforms we are proposing today. Some have already packed \nup their practices and moved across the river to Indiana, which has \nmedical liability reforms. Many more doctors are thinking about \nfollowing them.\n  Kentucky is now one of these States facing a medical liability \ncrisis. So, Mr. President, Kentucky now goes from yellow to red.\n  Let's talk about Connecticut. This year, 28 OB/GYNs in Connecticut \nannounced they could no longer afford to deliver babies because of \nrising medical liability premiums. According to the Connecticut State \nMedical Society, each doctor would deliver approximately 100 babies a \nyear. This means that 2,800 Connecticut patients must now find new \ndoctors because of the medical liability crisis.\n  Dr. Sally Crawford of Norwich, CT, provides a compelling example. She \nretired from medicine this year at age 55 because she could no longer \nafford her medical liability premiums. She had never been sued, but her \nliability insurance premiums became so expensive, they cost her \n$124,000 a year.\n  Dr. Jose Pecheco's insurer stopped offering medical liability \ninsurance, so he shopped around for a new policy. When he learned that \na new policy with ``tail'' coverage would cost him $150,000 a year, he \ndid what Dr. Crawford did; he retired.\n  Why are insurance premiums for doctors rising? They are rising \nbecause the size of jury verdicts and settlements is rising at an \nalarming rate. According to the Hartford Courant, the average payment \nmade of one of the State's major insurers to resolve claims increased \nfrom $271,000 in 1995 to $536,000 in 2001. When so many experienced \nphysicians such as these take early retirement or curtail services, it \nis not surprising that the AMA has now designated Connecticut a crisis \nState. So Connecticut goes from yellow to red. Connecticut is now a \nState in crisis.\n  Let's take a look at North Carolina. Time magazine recently featured \nthe story of Dr. Mary-Emma Beres, a family practitioner in Sparta, NC, \nwho had always loved delivering babies. However, when she learned her \nmalpractice premiums were about to triple, she was forced to give up \nher calling. Now Sparta is left with one obstetrician for difficult \ncases, and some women who need C-sections must now take a 40-minute \nambulance ride to the next nearest facility.\n  We have heard several examples about escalating premiums that cause \nsome doctors to retire early, but what impact is the medical liability \ncrisis having on doctors at the beginning of\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\ntheir careers? The same article in Time features the story of Martin \nPalmeri, a medical student at East Carolina University. He had his \nheart set on a career in obstetrics, but after witnessing a medical \nliability trial in North Carolina, he decided ``the risks of the \nspecialty were greater than the rewards.'' He is now considering a less \nrisky specialty.\n  The crisis has hit North Carolina hospitals particularly hard. \nAccording to McNeary Healthcare Services, small rural hospitals in \nNorth Carolina experienced an average increase in liability premiums of \n180 percent in 2002 alone.\n  The crisis is impacting patient access to emergency care in Cabarrus \nCounty. The county's Level III trauma center was facing possible \nclosure this year when its 17-member emergency medical group was faced \nwith an 88-percent increase in premiums for reduced coverage. It is no \nwonder that North Carolina is facing a medical liability crisis, and \nNorth Carolina now moves from a yellow State to a red State, a State in \ncrisis.\n  Like Kentucky and North Carolina, the AMA has recently added Arkansas \nto its list of States facing a medical liability crisis. In Ashdown, \nAK, the emergency room at the Little River Memorial Hospital was in \ndanger of closing when it could not find an insurance carrier. It was \nonly able to stay open after obtaining new insurance coverage at a 300-\npercent increase in premiums. According to a recent survey by the \nArkansas Medical Society, 90 percent of doctors have practiced \nexpensive and often unnecessary defensive medicine; 80 percent of \ndoctors are less willing to perform high-risk procedures; 71 percent of \nphysicians surveyed in Arkansas stated they were considering early \nretirement; and one-third of Arkansas physicians are considering moving \ntheir practices.\n\n  Doctors in Arkansas who want to care for the State's frailest \npatients are in a particularly difficult bind. There are currently no \ninsurers writing new policies for doctors who treat nursing home \npatients, and those doctors who have coverage report a whopping 1,000-\npercent increase. Let me say that again: There are currently no \ninsurers, none, in Arkansas writing new policies for doctors who treat \nnursing home patients, and those doctors who have coverage report a \nwhopping 1,000-percent increase.\n  Why? Jury awards and settlements are rising faster than insurers can \nraise their premiums to meet these increased costs. From 1992 to 2000, \nthe amount that doctors and insurers paid out in jury verdicts and \nsettlements tripled, but then it doubled again in 2001. In that year, \nfor every $1 an Arkansas medical liability insurer received in \npremiums, it had to pay out $1.61 in jury awards and settlements. \nArkansas, as you can imagine, is now confronting a medical liability \ncrisis. So Arkansas moves from a yellow State, which indicates a State \nwith problems, to red, indicating a State in crisis.\n  Next we turn north to Missouri. This April, St. Joseph Health Center \nin Kansas City was forced to close its trauma center when its \nneurosurgeons decided to leave. Last April, Overland Park Regional \nMedical Center in suburban Kansas City closed the only trauma center \never in suburban Johnson County, KS. This means residents of southern \nKansas City and the millions of motorists who pass through on I-35 or \nI-70 have limited access to a trauma center in an emergency. Now \ncritically injured patients in Kansas City must be transported to \neither the University of Kansas Medical Center or the Medical Center of \nIndependence, but even that may not be for long. Because of exorbitant \nmedical liability premiums, the two neurosurgeons who service the \nIndependence Medical Center are packing up their practice and moving on \nNovember 1.\n  But this crisis isn't limited to just Missouri's major cities. In \nMay, Dr. Julie Wood was forced to close her rural family practice in \nMacon because she could no longer afford her $71,000 malpractice \npremium while treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Macon's other \ntwo family doctors recently stopped delivering babies in order to \nreduce their insurance premiums, making the nearest point of care for \nexpectant mothers nearly an hour away.\n  All of that explains why Missouri unfortunately is now facing a \nmedical liability crisis and moves from a State with problems to a \nState in crisis.\n  Let's look across the Mississippi River to Missouri's neighbor, the \ngreat State of Illinois.\n  Time magazine recently ran a cover story entitled ``The Doctor is \nOut,'' highlighting the plight of Dr. Alexander Sosenko of Joliet, IL, \nand his patients.\n  Dr. Sosenko's insurance carrier recently dropped him and his \ncardiology partners, even though the practice had never lost or settled \na single malpractice case. The one offer of insurance the practice \nreceived would have raised their annual premiums from $14,000 per \ndoctor to nearly $100,000 per doctor.\n  Dr. Sosenko and his colleagues are trying to determine their next \nstep, but he is clearly worried about his practice's 6,000 patients. He \ntold Time: ``We doctors can move, but our patients can't.''\n  Dr. Sosenko's cardiology practice is not the only one in Joliet \ncoping with a medical liability crisis. The town is quickly losing all \nof its neurosurgeons.\n  In February, two Joliet neurosurgeons gave up performing brain \nsurgery, leaving the city's two hospitals without full-time coverage \nfor head trauma cases. The situation may soon get worse for Joliet's \npatients. The town's last remaining neurosurgeon must now pay $468,000 \na year for insurance and is considering leaving the State. If seriously \ninjured patients need the trauma services of a neurosurgeon, then they \nwill have to travel another 45 minutes to the next nearest trauma \ncenter.\n  These problems are not confined to Joliet. The Chicago Tribune \nreports that for specialties such as neurosurgery and obstetrics, \nmedical liability rates have increased by more than 100 percent and \ncould climb even higher later this year. So it is no wonder the AMA has \nnow observed that Illinois is experiencing a medical liability crisis.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry to say that this week the AMA added a 19th \nState to its list of States facing a medical liability crisis. Dr. \nWillard Woods of Wheatland, WY, was forced to give up delivering babies \nearlier this year. Throughout his career, he delivered 2,500 babies, \nwhich is most of the young people within Wheatland and the surrounding \ncommunities.\n  Dr. Woods described his situation in the Washington Post. He said:\n\n       I love delivering babies. I really love delivering the \n     babies of women I delivered a couple of decades ago. And I \n     know this community needs an obstetrician. But you can't \n     practice without insurance. And I can't get coverage for \n     deliveries anymore.\n\n  Since Dr. Woods stopped delivering babies, mothers with complicated \npregnancies must now make the 3-hour round trip to Cheyenne. Sadly, \nWyoming, too, is now facing a medical liability crisis.\n  So why are premiums rising so quickly that good physicians such as \nDr. Coleman, Dr. Crawford, and Dr. Woods are forced to give up their \npractices? The primary reason is rapidly increasing jury awards.\n  As this chart clearly shows, the Jury Verdict Research Service \nreports that the median award made by a jury has more than doubled \nbetween 1996 and 2000. As you can see, between 1996 and 2000 the median \njury awards have gone up dramatically, actually more than doubling. In \nfact, the median liability award jumped 43 percent in just 1 year--from \n$700,000 in 1999 to $1 million in 2000.\n  This chart depicts growth in liability claim payments. Not \nsurprisingly, the increase in jury awards has led to similar increases \nin the dollar value of settlements reached out of court.\n\n  As this chart shows, the average claim--including both jury awards \nand out-of-court settlements--has risen sharply in the past 6 years, \nrising from $176,000 in 1995 to approximately $325,000 in 2001.\n  The crisis will continue to grow worse until Congress acts. If we \nmiss yet another opportunity to pass meaningful liability reforms, I \nhave no doubt that more of these yellow States will turn red next year \nas they find themselves facing a medical liability crisis.\n  Thankfully, President Bush has outlined several commonsense legal \nreforms that Congress can adopt to address this crisis. The President's \nproposal is based on the Medical Injury\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\nCompensation Reform Act, commonly called MICRA, which California \nadopted back in 1975.\n  As this chart shows, California MICRA reforms have kept medical \nliability premiums affordable for California's physicians. Since the \nreforms were adopted back in 1975, California's total premiums have \nrisen 182 percent, while the rest of the Nation's have risen 573 \npercent--three times the California increase.\n  In short, while medical liability premiums across the country have \ntaken off over the last 25 years, California's have remained relatively \nstable.\n  So what do the California MICRA reforms mean for the average doctor \nand his patients? Quite a bit, as this chart shows.\n  This chart lists the going market rate for an insurance policy with \nthe largest insurer in each of the following cities. It should be noted \nthat Colorado has passed meaningful liability reforms that are very \nsimilar to California's reforms. These take a look at Los Angeles, \nDenver, New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Miami. Doctors in Los Angeles \nand Denver, where States have enacted reforms, pay less than those in \nStates that have not enacted comprehensive reforms.\n  For example, an obstetrician in Los Angeles, with the State's MICRA \nreforms, can expect to pay $54,000, while his colleague in Miami is \nlooking at a bill of more than $200,000. As you can see, Florida is \ncertainly a medical liability crisis State.\n  Similarly, a surgeon in Los Angeles or Denver can expect to pay about \none-half as much as a colleague in Las Vegas or Chicago. These same \nsurgeons would face an enormous liability bill--about $175,000--if they \nmoved their practices to Miami.\n  Senator Ensign has shown a great deal of leadership on this issue \ndating back to his days in the House of Representatives. He has \nincorporated the best parts of the President's proposal and MICRA, the \nCalifornia law, into the legislation before the Senate, S. 11, the \nPatients First Act of 2003.\n  While I would allow the author of this legislation to explain it in \ndetail, I will briefly describe some of the important reforms included \nin the Patients First Act.\n  First and foremost, the Patients First Act allows patients to recover \n100 percent of their economic damages. This can include hospital bills, \nlost wages, therapy, and rehabilitation costs and a wide variety of \nadditional expenses a victim might incur. So all of the economic losses \nwould be recovered.\n  In addition to recovering every dime of economic damages, patients \ncan receive additional sums up to $250,000 to compensate for ``pain and \nsuffering.'' The $250,000 is a substantial amount of money, identical \nto California's MICRA limit. But it still places at least some limit on \nunquantifiable noneconomic damages in order to prevent doctors from \nbeing driven out of business.\n  Let's look at punitive damages. In those rare instances where a \nmedical professional acts in a malicious or particularly egregious \nmanner, the Patients First Act also allows victims to recover punitive \ndamages the greater of $250,000 or twice the economic damages. This is \nin addition to recovering full economic damages and up to $250,000 in \nnoneconomic damages.\n  The legislation establishes a standard of ``fair share'' liability. \nWhat this simply means is doctors and hospitals will not be held liable \nfor harm they did not cause. Simple justice. Doctors and hospitals \nwon't be held liable for harm they didn't cause which is possible today \nand would not be possible after the passage of this act.\n\n  The Patients First Act also protects the injured by ensuring that a \nmajority of any jury award or settlement goes to the patient who is \nactually hurt and not their personal injury lawyer.\n  Finally, this legislation preserves State flexibility on damages by \nincluding what is commonly referred to as a flexicap. Recognizing that \ndifferent States have adopted different approaches to address this \ncrisis, the Patients First Act allows States to establish their own \nlimits on damages. Under the flexicap provision, in any State that has \nadopted limits on economic, noneconomic, or punitive damages, those \nState limits, not the Federal limits, will apply.\n  The flexicap also applies prospectively. If any State legislature \nbelieves the monetary limits established in this bill are too generous \nor not generous enough, it can simply enact a statute to change the \nlimits within that State.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nyield for a couple questions on these issues?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Kentucky is \npresenting his prepared statement, and it really has been quite \ninteresting, and I share his concern. My State is one of those first \nStates to be in red. We have a crisis in health care delivery. We are \nlosing doctors to retirement, leaving the State, or leaving part of \ntheir practice, like OB/GYNs getting out of the OB part of their \npractice. The Senator made a particular point. I think the bill is a \ngood solution, and it is based, as Senator McConnell said, on the \nCalifornia plan that has been successful that does have some limits on \npunitive damages.\n  The Senator from Kentucky just made a point about the abilities of \nthe States to act differently if they so choose. Will the Senator \nexplain that? I did not understand that was in the bill. I am very \ninterested because one of the complaints I have heard is that we are \nimposing our will on the States and the State legislatures cannot act, \nif they want to or if they will, although not many of them have. Will \nthe Senator from Kentucky expand on that point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, \nthe argument typically made for this type of legislation is that we are \ninterfering with the rights of the States. What we have done in this \nmeasure is to give the States an opportunity to act, to, in effect, \nsupercede what we have done to make it less generous or more generous, \ndepending on what they may conclude. A State is given an option to \naddress this crisis in a way that is different from the way we \naddressed it within certain guidelines. By doing that, we do make an \neffort to respect the State's right to act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I say to \nthe Senator, just coming back from my State, I had occasion to meet \nwith doctors, hospital administrators, and civilians who are having \nproblems, like some of those the Senator pointed out earlier. I also \nmet with some of the attorneys who raise the point that the States \nshould be allowed to act.\n  My own State legislature tried to deal with this issue and made a \nlittle progress, but it is still very weak. Our crisis is getting \nworse, and we are losing particularly those critical services that we \nneed in our trauma systems, for instance.\n\n  The point I wish to make or ask the Senator to further expand on is, \nthey say: What is the Federal role in this situation? Why is it \nnecessary for the Federal Government to become involved? My response \nhas been, clearly, there is a Federal application for medical liability \nthat may not exist in other areas because of the impact it is having on \nMedicare. The additional threat of these lawsuits, the defensive \nmedicine, the additional costs of medical liability insurance are \ncausing all kinds of additional costs to be added to our Medicare \nsystem. I have heard billions of dollars, and I am going to find out in \nthe next day or so what is the approximate amount that is being added \neach year to the cost of Medicare.\n  We are trying to improve Medicare and trying to add prescription \ndrugs, but there are other costs that are being heaped on to the system \nthat are very destructive.\n  I think the answer is, more than in any other area where we tried to \nget some legal reform, there is a Federal application in medical \nliability because of the impact it is having on the Medicare system.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky care to respond?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, I \ndo not know the exact figure--maybe my staff does--but clearly it has \nhad an impact on the cost to the Federal Government. In addition, these \ndoctors are moving back and forth across State lines seeking a place \nwhere they can practice their profession without basically giving away \ntheir services.\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\n  Kentucky happens to be next to Indiana which adopted standards \nsimilar to California some two decades ago. I have met a number of \ndoctors in Louisville and Henderson who are contemplating simply moving \nacross the river to even afford to continue to practice their \nprofession.\n  At least in two ways it impacts at the Federal level, with interstate \nmovement of doctors seeking a place to go where they can practice their \nprofession, and the direct costs to the Federal Government under \nMedicare.\n  Mr. LOTT. A similar situation exists in my State. We are right next \nto Louisiana and not a State one would think would have the type of \nreforms they have in place. It is very easy to move from Mississippi to \nLouisiana. They serve different patients in a different State and \nmedical liability costs are probably half of what they are right across \nthe border.\n  What worries me more is we have doctors leaving tremendously \nunderserved areas such as the Delta. One doctor in particular I know \nmoved up to South Dakota and started practicing medicine. Others are \nretiring when they would not have retired if they believed they could \nmake a decent living.\n  Even worse than that, doctors are getting out of certain practices. \nIt has become a serious problem for health care delivery in my State. \nWe have to act in this area, and soon, because the bleeding is growing \nin terms of losing doctors in these critical areas.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Mississippi, he \nis absolutely right. Not only does it affect decisionmaking at the end \nof one's career but at the beginning. The younger doctors taking a look \nat which speciality to choose are shying away from obstetrics because \nthey believe they cannot afford to go into that specialty, thus \ncreating a shortage at that end as well as on the other end where \ndoctors who have been in the field a number of years are no longer able \nto afford it. This is truly a national problem that cries out for a \nnational solution.\n\n  One modest estimate from CBO, in response to Senator Lott's earlier \nquestion--this is from my staff--this bill would probably save the \nFederal Government at least $11 billion. Our suspicion is it is higher \nthan that.\n  In conclusion, as this map shows, most of America is either nearing \nor facing a medical liability crisis. There are not many white States \non this map. The white States are the ones that are currently OK. There \nare six of them. The rest are either in yellow, States showing problem \nsigns, or red, States now in crisis, to which we have added a \nreasonable number just since this debate last year.\n  During the last 8 years, the House of Representatives has recognized \nthis brewing storm and has passed meaningful medical liability reforms \non multiple occasions. Unfortunately, during this same period, the \nSenate has served as a graveyard for meaningful legal reforms.\n  However, I believe the tide has begun to turn. The American people \nare beginning to understand this is not a battle about doctors, \npersonal injuries, lawyers, and insurance companies; it is about \nensuring their access, the patients of America, to needed medical care. \nExpectant mothers are worried that their obstetricians will have to \ndiscontinue practice before their baby is born. Parents are concerned \nthat their local trauma center might not have a neurosurgeon on staff \nto treat a child injured in a car accident. Seniors worry that the \ndouble whammy of rising malpractice premiums and reduced Medicare \npayments will drive their doctors out of business.\n  I believe the Patients First Act encompasses the key reforms needed \nto address this crisis. This legislation allows patients to be fairly \ncompensated--fairly compensated--while placing badly needed limits on \noften out-of-control damage awards. I believe it is time for the Senate \nto address this crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support the \nPatients First Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n  Testimony--United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Patient \n    Access Crisis: The Role of Medical Litigation--February 11, 2003\n\n       Ms. Leanne Dyess. Chairman Hatch, Chairman Gregg, Senators \n     Leahy and Kennedy, distinguished members of the Senate \n     Judiciary and HELP committees, it's an honor for me to sit \n     before you this afternoon--to open up my life, and the life \n     of my family, in an attempt to demonstrate how medical \n     liability costs are hurting people all across America. While \n     others may talk in terms of economics and policy, I want to \n     speak from the heart.\n       I want to share with you the life of my two children and I \n     are now forced to live because of a crisis in health care \n     that I believe can be fixed. And when I leave and the lights \n     turn off and the television cameras go away, I want you--and \n     all America--to know one thing, and that is that this crisis \n     is not about insurance. It's not about doctors, or hospitals, \n     or even personal injury lawyers. It's a crisis about \n     individuals and their access to what I believe is, otherwise, \n     the greatest health care in the world.\n       Our story began on July 5th of last year, when my husband \n     Tony was returning from work in Gulfport, Mississippi. We had \n     started a new business. Tony was working hard, as was I. We \n     were doing our best to build a life for our children, and \n     their futures were filled with promise. Everything looked \n     bright. Then, in an instant, it changed. Tony was involved in \n     a single car accident. They suspect he may have fallen \n     asleep, though we'll never know.\n       What we do know is that after removing him from the car, \n     they rushed Tony to Garden Park hospital in Gulfport. He had \n     head injuries and required immediate attention. Shortly \n     thereafter, I received the telephone call that I pray no \n     other wife will ever have to receive. I was informed of the \n     accident and told that the injuries were serious. But I \n     cannot describe to you the panic that gave way to \n     hopelessness when they somberly said, ``We don't have the \n     specialist necessary to take care of him. We need to airlift \n     him to another hospital.''\n       I couldn't understand this. Gulfport is one of the fastest \n     growing and most prosperous regions of Mississippi. Garden \n     Park is a good hospital. Where, I wondered, was the \n     specialist--the specialist who could have taken care of my \n     husband? Almost six hours passed before Tony was airlifted to \n     the University Medical Center--six hours for the damage to \n     his brain to continue before they had a specialist capable of \n     putting a shunt into his brain to drain the swelling--six \n     unforgettable hours that changed our life.\n       Today Tony is permanently brain damaged. He is mentally \n     incompetent, unable to care for himself--unable to provide \n     for his children--unable to live the vibrant, active and \n     loving life he was living only moments before his accident.\n       I could share with you the panic of a woman suddenly forced \n     into the role of both mother and father to her teenage \n     children--of a woman whose life is suddenly caught in limbo, \n     unable to move forward or backward. I could tell you about a \n     woman who now had to worry about the constant care of her \n     husband, who had to make concessions she thought she'd never \n     have to make to be able to pay for his therapy and care. But \n     to describe this would be to take us away from the most \n     important point and the value of what I learned. Senator \n     Hatch, I learned that there was no specialist on staff that \n     night in Gulfport because rising medical liability costs had \n     forced physicians in that community to abandon their \n     practices. In that area, at that time, there was only one \n     doctor who had the expertise to care for Tony and he was \n     forced to cover multiple hospitals--stretched thin and unable \n     to care for everyone. Another doctor had recently quit his \n     practice because his insurance company terminated all of the \n     medical liability policies nationwide. That doctor could not \n     obtain affordable coverage. He could not practice. And on \n     that hot night in July, my husband and our family drew the \n     short straw.\n       I have also learned that Mississippi is not unique, that \n     this crisis rages in states all across America. It rages in \n     Nevada, where young expectant mothers cannot find ob/gyns. It \n     rages in Florida, where children cannot find pediatric \n     neurosurgeons. And it rages in Pennsylvania, where the \n     elderly who have come to depend on their orthopedic \n     surgeons are being told that those trusted doctors are \n     moving to states where practicing medicine is affordable \n     and less risky.\n       The real danger of this crisis is that it is not readily \n     seen. It's insidious, like termites in the structure of a \n     home. They get into the woodwork, but you cannot see the \n     damage. The walls of the house remain beautiful. You don't \n     know what's going on just beneath the surface. At least not \n     for a season. Then, one day you go to hang a shelf and the \n     whole wall comes down; everything is destroyed. Before July \n     5th, I was like most Americans, completely unaware that just \n     below the surface of our nation's health care delivery \n     system, serious damage was being done by excessive and \n     frivolous litigation--litigation that was forcing liability \n     costs beyond the ability of doctors to pay. I had heard about \n     some of the frivolous cases and, of course, the awards that \n     climbed into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And like \n     most Americans I shook my head and said, ``Someone hit the \n     lottery.''\n       But I never asked, ``At what cost?'' I never asked, ``Who \n     has to pay for those incredible awards?'' It is a tragedy \n     when a medical mistake results in serious injury. But when \n     that injury--often an accident or oversight by an otherwise \n     skilled physician--is compounded by a lottery-like award, and \n     that award along with others make it too expensive to \n     practice medicine, there is a cost. And believe me, it's a \n     terrible cost to pay. Like\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\n     many Americans, I did not know the cost. I did not known the \n     damage. You see, Senator Hatch, it's not until your spouse \n     needs a specialist, or you're the expectant mother who needs \n     an ob/gyn, or it's your child who needs a pediatric \n     neurosurgeon, that you realize the damage beneath the \n     surface.\n       From my perspective, sitting here today, this problem far \n     exceeds any other challenge facing America's health care--\n     even the challenge of the uninsured. My family had insurance \n     when Tony was injured. We had good insurance. What we didn't \n     have was a doctor. And now, no amount of money can relieve \n     our pain and suffering. But knowing that others may not have \n     to go through what we've gone through, could go a long way \n     toward healing us heal.\n       Senator Hatch, I know of your efforts to see America \n     through this crisis. I know this is important to you, and \n     that it's important to the President. I know of the priority \n     Congress and many in the Senate are placing upon doing \n     something . . . and doing it now. Today, I pledge to you my \n     complete support. It is my prayer that no woman--or anyone \n     else--anywhere will ever have to go through what I've gone \n     through, and what I continue to go through every day with my \n     two beautiful children and a husband I dearly love.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first commend my colleague, Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky, for his presentation and his leadership on this \nissue. Though we disagree on some very fundamental parts of this issue, \nI have the highest regard and respect for his ability and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  What occurred about 45 minutes ago was that Senator Frist, the \nmajority leader, came to the Chamber and filed a motion to proceed, and \nI objected. What Senator Frist was asking was that the Senate stop its \nbusiness and move directly to S. 11 relative to the issue of medical \nmalpractice. Because I have filed an objection, Senator Frist indicated \nhe would file a cloture motion. After collecting the necessary \nsignatures from our colleagues, this will lead to a vote on cloture \ncome Wednesday.\n  If Senator Frist can gather some 60 votes, he will be in a position \nto then move to this bill and begin the debate and the amendment \nprocess. That is the ordinary course of the procedure.\n  An obvious question is why I objected. An issue clearly as important \nas medical malpractice should be considered by the Senate. There is no \ndoubt in my mind. But I would object to the fact that this bill comes \nto the floor without any hearing before a Senate committee. Consider \nthat. The most revolutionary and dramatic reform of tort law in \nAmerica, in modern memory, will come to the floor without the normal \nhearings, witnesses, opportunities to amend, opportunity to work out \ncompromises and negotiate, all part of the legislative process. So why \nthen does a bill of this gravity and importance only come to us in this \ncircumstance where there is no chance for us to work out ways to \nresolve our differences? Why, I cannot explain that to my colleagues. \nFor a person like myself who served for some time in the House and the \nSenate, it seems to me that the Republican leadership in control of the \ncommittee structure would not object to taking this bill to one of \ntheir committees, having hearings, bringing in the doctors, the \nlawyers, the victims, the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, and the companies that make medical devices. Let's hear \nabout this problem in its entirety. But, no, they object to that. They \ndo not want hearings. They do not want the people of this country to \nhear both sides of the story. They would rather come to the floor and \npresent their side with a take-it-or-leave-it approach. I do not think \nthat is fair. I think we can and we should do better.\n  Let me say at the outset that though I have objected and though most \nmajor medical associations, like the American Medical Association, \nsupport this bill, I want to make clear my high regard for the medical \nprofession. Time and time again, in my life and the life of my family, \nI have turned to some of the best and most talented medical \nprofessionals in America. I have entrusted them with the most important \nthings I have on Earth--my wife, my children, and the people whom I \nlove.\n  Time and again I have found them to be selfless, extraordinarily \ntalented, compassionate men and women who give the medical profession a \ngood name every single day. Thank God they are there, and I want them \nto continue to be there. So I do not come to this Chamber as a doctor \nbasher, as someone who thinks doctors are overpaid or frankly should be \nheld to task for this, that, and the other. Not at all. Like most \nAmericans, if I, my wife, or children are ever sick, I want to look up \ninto the eyes of the best and brightest doctor in America helping a \nmember of my family through a medical crisis. My family and I have been \nlucky in our lives. Many times I think we have had the best and the \nbrightest, and I still continue to thank them as I take a position with \nwhich many of them will not agree.\n\n  I believe there is a fundamental unfairness in the current situation \nwith medical malpractice. I have seen that unfairness in my State. \nSenator McConnell has noted it in many other States. The largest \nmedical malpractice insurance company in Illinois, the Illinois State \nMutual Insurance Company, raised its rates last week 35 percent on \ndoctors for medical malpractice insurance. Many lines of insurance are \ngoing up in cost, health insurance and other insurance, but this is an \nextraordinary increase.\n  Two neurosurgeons in Joliet, IL, have given up the practice of brain \nsurgery because of malpractice premium increases. They have left the \ncity's only two hospitals without a full-time coverage for head trauma \ncases. Senator McConnell is right; Victims of automobile accidents and \ntrauma need immediate help and immediate care.\n  Memorial Hospital in Belleville, IL, near the area where I grew up, \nhas lost three OB/GYN physicians in the past 6 months due to increases \nin rising malpractice premiums. I met one of them. I met one during the \ncourse of the campaign last year. She came to me and said: Senator, I \njust cannot continue to pay these premiums and deliver babies. And I \nbelieve her.\n  Eduardo Barriuso of Humboldt Park, an obstetrician in my State of \nIllinois, pays $104,000 a year for malpractice insurance. He says he \nearns $175,000 a year treating mostly poor people, Medicaid patients. \nHe pays $104,000 in malpractice, and has $175,000 in income. Like other \ndoctors who treat patients who depend on Medicare or Medicaid or \ninsurance through an HMO, Dr. Barriuso cannot pass on his higher \ninsurance rates to his patients.\n  The Family Health Partnership Clinic in McHenry, IL, was almost \nforced to close after its insurer left my home State. They found new \ninsurance at four times the cost. The clinic serves the uninsured and \noperates off the volunteer services of physicians. It now pays $28,000 \na year for malpractice insurance, up from $7,000 last year, for a \nclinic serving poor people.\n  A Chicago area OB/GYN is studying to obtain his pharmacist license. \nHe has decided he cannot continue as a doctor. He thinks he can make a \nbetter life as a pharmacist. He is now paying $115,000 for his \nliability insurance. I would readily concede the point made over and \nover by Senator McConnell that these malpractice premiums are not fair. \nThey are unfair particularly to certain specialties--neurosurgery, \ntrauma care physicians, OB/GYN, and several others who have been hit \nhard by these increases. That is just not fair.\n  I suggest there is another unfairness involved in this discussion, an \nunfairness which my colleague from Kentucky never conceded. Frankly, \nthere is an unfairness in this bill when it comes to the victims of \nmedical malpractice. Of all the comments made by my colleague from \nKentucky, little was said about whether it is fair to cap the recovery \nfor a victim of medical malpractice at medical bills, lost wages, and \npain and suffering of no more than $250,000.\n\n  Now, I do not come as an expert on anything. Some 20 years ago, in my \nlegal practice in Springfield, IL, I handled medical malpractice cases. \nFor a number of years I defended doctors through their insurance \ncompany. I had about 7 years with that experience. Another 2\\1/2\\ years \nI was a plaintiffs' attorney suing some doctors and hospitals for \nmalpractice. So I have seen it from both sides of the table in a \ncourtroom. I do understand the dynamics of a medical malpractice case, \nat least as they applied 20 years ago. I do not know how many others in \nthis Chamber have had that experience. Some have but very few.\n  So we come to this discussion, frankly, listening to others who are \nexperts\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\nin the subject asking them for advice. What is the right thing to do to \ndeal with this medical malpractice insurance crisis? I think, frankly, \nthat this bill, which limits the compensation to be paid to an \nindividual under a medical malpractice case to $250,000, is \nfundamentally unfair. It is as unfair to victims as the malpractice \ninsurance rates are to doctors.\n  Is that the best the Senate can do, that we take the unfairness to \ndoctors and then visit it on unsuspecting people who go to a doctor or \nto a hospital expecting professional care and come home with their \nlives changed or ruined?\n  I recall one case in Chicago. Let me give an illustration of what S. \n11 would mean in this case. This woman, about 50 years old, had two \nmoles on the side of her face. She said to her doctor: I think I would \nlike to have those removed, doctor. He said: I will send you to one of \nthe very best hospitals for this surgical procedure, and he did.\n  She went in for this surgical procedure to have two moles removed. \nShe was given an anesthesia. They administered oxygen to her and they \nbegan to cauterize these moles. But there was a problem. Medical \npersonnel were not supposed to use a cauterizing gun near oxygen.\n\n  As a consequence, there was an explosion and a fire on her face, \nburning off her nose, completely disfiguring and scarring her face. She \nis in her early fifties now and has gone through extensive \nreconstructive surgery. She is lucky to be able to breathe through what \nwas once her nose. Her life will never, ever be the same.\n  She told the story herself in an article published in the newspaper \nin Chicago. Routine surgery went disastrously bad and her life was \nchanged forever.\n  According to those who have brought the bill to the Senate, they have \ndecided how much it is worth to live 20 or 30 years with permanent \ndisfigurement and scarring, what it is worth to go into the hospital \nfor routine surgery and have something happen that completely changes \nyour life. Do you know what it is worth under this bill? It is worth \n$250,000 for her pain and suffering. Not a penny more, not one penny \nmore.\n  The decision will be made in the Senate that in her case, and \nthousands of others across America, we will decide the maximum amount \nto which she is entitled. I don't think that is fair. I don't think it \nis fair to victims.\n  Malpractice premiums are too high and that is unfair to doctors. But \na $250,000 pain and suffering cap? That is unfair in many cases of \nwhich I am aware.\n  Let me talk about another case from my home State of Illinois, in the \ncity of Urbana. David was born prematurely with a lot of problems. By \nthe time he was 6 years old many of the problems were behind him, \nthough he still had some problems with his lungs and asthma. When he \nwas 6 he had a respiratory infection and started running a fever. The \ndoctor who usually cared for him was out of town so his parents took \nhim to a clinic for nighttime care. At the clinic, he was given an \nantibiotic and sent home. He got worse. His parents took him to an \nemergency room that same night where he remained overnight with a \nfever. The next day, concerned about David's continuing fever, David \nand his parents returned. The doctor admitted him to the hospital at 5 \np.m. At the hospital, they took his temperature and admitted him to a \nregular hospital room. They did not refer him to the ICU, nor did they \nplace a temperature monitor on him.\n  His mother was dozing in the chair in his room when a nurse observed \nhe appeared to be lapsing into a seizure condition. The nurse did an \nemergency code. By the time the emergency team arrived, he was in full \nseizure. His temperature spiked to 107.7 degrees. He remained in a \nstate of seizure for quite some time and eventually went into cardiac \narrest.\n  As a result of this ordeal, this 6-year-old boy was rendered a \nquadriplegic and lost all expressive ability. Professionals believe he \nhas what is called receptive language. He can understand spoken \nlanguage at an age-appropriate level but he is unable to communicate. \nHe breathes through a tracheotomy stoma and is fed through a \ngastrointestinal tube.\n  That was 11 years ago. He is now 17. David can never be left alone, \nnot for 1 minute of 1 day. His mother says she can tell he is \ninterested in girls by the way he perks up when a girl his age enters \nthe room. But he cannot express himself. He cannot say a word. There is \nno chance of recovery and, of course, in his condition he is at a \nheightened risk prone to infection.\n\n  The very issue that brought David to the hospital in the first place \nwas his elevated temperature. Despite that fact, no temperature monitor \nwas ever placed on him. In light of his history and his delicate \nmedical condition he should have been admitted to the ICU rather than \nsimply sent to the regular hospital room and given periodic attention. \nHis family reached a settlement with the doctors and the hospital for \nthe negligence in the treatment of David.\n  It is not likely with all of the liability protections and extreme \ncap on damages under this bill that defendants would have felt \ncompelled to reach a settlement with that family if the bill before the \nSenate would have been the law of the land.\n  The tragic malpractice of which David was a victim literally took \naway from him all that every one of us take for granted. He will never \nwalk again. He will never have a normal relationship with other people. \nThough he remains alert and is apparently not intellectually impaired, \nhe cannot express himself and he never will be able to. He requires \nconstant care. His mother gave up her job at a local college to care \nfor him full time.\n  For all of these losses with their child, for being denied a normal \nlife, those who bring S. 11 today say they know what it is worth. They \nknow what the pain and suffering of David is worth for the rest of his \nlife. It is worth $250,000. Not a penny more. Is that fair? Is that \nfair to David, his mother, his father? I don't think it is.\n  What we have here is a response to a medical insurance crisis which I \ndon't believe gets to the root cause of a problem.\n  What I am about to say now is not a statement made by trial lawyers \nor those friendly to them. I quote from Dr. Carolyn Clancy, director \nfor the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality at the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. What I am stating she said, \nunder oath, before a committee I attended several weeks ago. This is \nwhat she said:\n\n       As we all know, medical errors and patient safety issues \n     represent a national problem of epidemic proportion.\n\n  This is a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, \na medical doctor herself.\n  When listening to the explanation of this bill, at any point in time \ndid you hear any reference to the fact that we are facing an epidemic \nof medical errors on patient safety issues in America? No. What we \nheard was we have lawyers who want to make too much money in court and \nthey are taking these cases to the courtroom.\n  Do you know, according to Harvard, what percentage of medical \nmalpractice actually ends up in a lawsuit being filed? Two percent. One \ncase out of 50 ends up with a lawsuit being filed. Think of that. In \nthe universe of medical errors and patient safety, think of it in terms \nof this statement by Dr. Clancy that we have a national problem of \nepidemic proportions.\n  The response of S. 11 to this epidemic of malpractice and medical \nnegligence is to do what? It is to say that David, who is now 17, who \nis now a quadriplegic, unable to respond or express himself, is going \nto pay the price. David and children like him in the future will never, \never be able to recover more than $250,000 regardless of medical \nmalpractice that brings them to the court.\n  I understand my colleague from Oregon is here and I yield to him for \nthe purpose of a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I had a couple of questions, having \nlistened to the statement.\n  First, my sense is that many physicians in our country--I am seeing \nthis across Oregon and rural Oregon--are having a real problem out \nthere paying their malpractice premiums. We are seeing physicians leave \nthe profession. This has resulted in patients not having the access to \ncare they deserve.\n  My understanding is that the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nagrees\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nwith that and that the Senator has already discussed that a bit this \nafternoon; is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. I say to my friend and colleague from \nOregon, I think it is a disservice to the medical profession of America \nnot to concede there is a medical malpractice insurance crisis \naffecting some specialties in some States. I do not argue that point. I \nhave seen those doctors face to face. Maybe my colleague from Oregon \nhas, too.\n  It is interesting, I might say to my friend from Oregon, as I \nlistened carefully to the explanation on the other side as to how to \ndeal with this crisis, I waited in vain to hear any suggestion that \ninsurance companies should be brought in as part of this conversation. \nTo the other side of the aisle it appears the only thing we need to do \nis to make sure the victims of medical malpractice have a limitation on \nwhat they can recover in court, no matter whether we are dealing with \nchildren or elderly people, no matter how serious the injuries. I do \nnot think that is a complete and honest approach to an extremely \ncomplicated problem.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If my colleague will yield further, my understanding is \nyou have already indicated you are open to working with others in the \nSenate, colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to try to find a \nbipartisan solution. I am particularly interested. Senator Hatch and I \nwere able to do this a number of years ago for the community health \ncenters that were being priced out of their malpractice coverage. We \nwere able to come up with a solution that has made it possible for \nthousands and thousands of poor people across the country to get their \ncare and have these clinics covered without extra cost to the \ntaxpayers, simply by working in a bipartisan way. My sense is to get \nout beyond the blame game, saying it is this interest group's fault or \nthat interest group's fault, and to try to find some common ground here \nbetween Democrats and Republicans so we can really deal with a problem \nthat is affecting many of our physicians and affecting our vulnerable \npatients. My understanding is my colleague from Illinois is open to \nthat kind of bipartisan approach and may even have some ideas he will \noffer this week.\n  I wanted to come to the floor because I think this is a real problem. \nI so often go to meetings and one group says it is the insurance \ncompanies' fault and the other group says it is the trial lawyers' \nfault. I have heard the distinguished Senator from Illinois say he \nwants to get beyond that and find a solution to a real problem. Perhaps \nhe could address that in whatever time is remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I did not have a chance to speak to \nSenator McConnell, but I did speak to Senator Frist, who was here \nearlier and made that same offer. I said to him, instead of bringing \nthis bill to the floor, take it or leave it, with no committee hearings \nand no effort to try to work out our differences, wouldn't it be better \nfor us to sit down at some point and try to engage all the elements \nthat are necessary for success if we are going to deal with this true \ncrisis in America?\n  He is open. I hope, if opportunity presents itself, we have that \nchance. I think we need to bring to the table, not only the legal \nprofession but also the medical profession and the insurance companies. \nIf you do not have all three of them at the table, as I will make clear \nin my statement, you are not going to get to the root cause of the \nproblem.\n  The answer from the other side is strictly to limit for malpractice \nvictims the amount they can recover in court. I am going to show in \ncharts I will present that that has not worked. Caps really do not \nguarantee that malpractice premiums come down, for a variety of very \ncomplicated reasons.\n\n  I hope we can do that. I hope on a bipartisan basis we can stop this \nhigh-noon standoff and reach a point where we have real conversation \nand dialog.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If my colleague will yield for one last question----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Will the Senator suspend so the \nPresiding Officer may remind all Senators that yielding is only for \npurposes of asking a question in order for the Senator from Illinois to \nretain his recognition on the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask, is there any reason why we couldn't begin such a \nbipartisan effort immediately? That is something I would like to do. I \ncited a specific example with Senator Hatch where we were able to make \na real difference by working in a bipartisan way. It is making a \ndifference in community health centers for their liability coverage. Is \nthere any reason why efforts to come up with creative solutions that \nare bipartisan could not begin right now, rather than going this route \nthat is going to polarize the Senate once again?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say through the Presiding Officer, there is no \nreason why it should not start this evening and I hope it will. But it \nwill require people of good will on both sides. It will require some of \nthe special interest groups that have not even been brought into this \nconversation to be brought in and to accept their share of \nresponsibility.\n  I think we can work this out. We must work this out so we do not have \nthe denial of basic medical services that are needed across the State \nof Oregon and Illinois and New Hampshire and Kentucky and so many other \nStates. But we have to do it in a bipartisan, constructive way.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon for coming to the floor.\n  The point I wanted to make with Dr. Clancy's quote is that medical \nmalpractice in this country is a very serious problem. It is not just a \nmatter of how many lawsuits are filed. As I indicated, only one out of \n50 malpractice cases actually ends up in court, and fewer than half of \nthem end up going to verdict or settlement. It is a serious problem. \nThe source of my statement is none other than the Institute of \nMedicine, a well respected organization here in Washington. They say \nthis epidemic of medical malpractice has caused more American deaths \nthis year than breast cancer, AIDS, and car accidents combined. It is \nan equivalent of a jumbo jet liner crashing every 24 hours for a year.\n  More than 70 studies in the past decade have documented serious \nquality problems in medical treatment. One of the most well known \nstudies published in 1991 by a team of Harvard researchers found \nadverse events occur in 3.7 percent of all hospital admissions and 58 \npercent of those events are due to error.\n  The Institute of Medicine later took that study and another similar \nstudy done in Colorado and Utah and extrapolated the results to all \nU.S. hospital admissions. The Institute of Medicine found that there \nare at least 44,000 adverse events every year and as many as 98,000.\n  They also found that each year drugs kill 14,000 hospital patients \nand injure another 750,000.\n  The group of Harvard researchers that published the 1991 study found \nonly 47 malpractice claims in the 31,429 cases they discovered. Of the \n280 identified patients who experienced adverse events as a result of \nmedical negligence, only eight filed malpractice lawsuits. That is only \n2 percent of the people who had a justifiable reason to file a claim. \nThose researchers concluded that we do not now have a problem of too \nmany claims. If anything, they said they were surprised there were so \nfew.\n  A similar study published in The Lancet found that although 17.7 \npercent of patients experienced an adverse event that led to longer \nhospital stays, only 1.2 percent filed a claim. Thirty patients filed a \nmalpractice claim out of 1,047 who could have, under this study.\n  There are profound problems with the current system. Doctors are not \nbeing disciplined and errors are not being reported. How can we expect \nfewer errors in the future if we do not address the system as a whole? \nDespite the alarming incidence of malpractice, only about 2,000 \ndoctors, one-third of 1 percent of the doctors in the United States, \nare disciplined each year by State medical boards. Let me repeat, one-\nthird of 1 percent of all doctors are disciplined each year by State \nmedical boards.\n  I was on a trip recently and picked up a book in a book store which I \nrecommend to people on both sides of this issue because I think it is \nthe best and most balanced story of what we are\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\nfacing and debating. It is entitled ``Complications.'' It is by a \nsurgical resident from Boston, Atul Gawande, a National Book Award \nfinalist for this book. It is subtitled ``A Surgeon's Notes On An \nImperfect Science.''\n  If you read this book--some people won't want to because there are \nsome parts that may make you squeamish. I think Dr. Gawande really \ntalks to you about the difficulty of being a medical doctor. The first \nchapter talks about placing a central line. It was tough for me to read \nthis chapter, let alone what it was like for him as a surgical resident \nafter having seen this central line implanted in a person's chest to do \nit for the first time himself. He had to. Trial and error was the only \nway he would learn. Of course, some mistakes were made. In his case \nthey were not fatal or serious. But it was part of the learning \nprocess.\n  I think we have to concede that medical practice is not perfect. But \nwe also know some serious mistakes can be made with terrible \nconsequences on an innocent patient.\n  Dr. Gawande refers in one part to this whole question of what to do \nor how to deal with the fact that many doctors practice with other \ndoctors who they really are worried about.\n  Let me give you an example of what he refers to in a chapter entitled \n``When Good Doctors Go Bad.'' He says:\n\n       But the problem of bad doctors isn't the problem of these \n     frightening aberrations. . . . In medicine, we all come to \n     know such physicians: the illustrious cardiologist who has \n     slowly gone senile and won't retire; the long-respected \n     obstetrician with a drinking habit; the surgeon who has \n     somehow lost his touch. On the one hand, strong evidence \n     indicates that mistakes are not made primarily by this \n     minority of doctors. Errors are too common and widespread to \n     be explained so simply. On the other hand, problem doctors do \n     exist. Even good doctors can go bad, and when they do, \n     colleagues tend to be almost entirely unequipped to do \n     anything about them.\n\n  He talks about situations that he has faced where doctors are taking \ndrugs. Doctors continue to practice and make errors every day. Because \nof the tight-knit community of physicians, other doctors are even \nafraid to speak to them, let alone to governing boards. Those doctors \ncontinue to make serious mistakes.\n  Quoting again, he says:\n\n       When a skilled, decent, ordinarily conscientious colleague, \n     whom you've known and worked with for years, starts popping \n     Percodans, or become preoccupied with personal problems and \n     neglects the proper care of patients, you want to help, not \n     destroy the doctor's career.\n\n  There is no easy way to help, though. In private practice, there are \nno sabbaticals to offer, no leaves of absence, only disciplinary \nproceedings of public reports and misdeeds. As a consequence, when \npeople try to help, they do it quietly, privately. Their intentions are \ngood; the result usually isn't.\n  This is a serious problem. If we are talking about malpractice \nclaims, don't we owe it to the American people to be talking about \nmedical errors and negligence and what we can responsibly do to make \ncertain that the small minority of physicians who are guilty of \nmalpractice are changed or removed from the practice?\n  It is estimated that 50 percent of the malpractice cases in America \nare filed against 5 percent of the doctors. Yet all of the doctors end \nup seeing their malpractice premiums increase.\n  When Congress set up a national practitioner database in 1986 to \ncollect data on adverse medical practice, it was expected that at most \nit would report about 1,000 disciplinary actions a month. However, \nfewer than 1,000 a year are reported across the United States.\n  Let me address another issue. It is interesting, when I speak to \ngroups of doctors, this is the focus of their attention, as it should \nbe, because malpractice premiums have gone up so high. But 2 years ago, \nthis wasn't what doctors were talking about. Malpractice premiums were \nlower. They weren't raising this issue as often.\n  They were raising another issue which is related. They were raising \nthe issue of HMOs and managed care. Doctors across America told me that \nfor years they were having difficulty being good doctors because \ninsurance companies were telling them whether or not they could have \ntests performed, how long they could leave a patient in the hospital, \nand whether or not a surgery was indicated. They were beside themselves \nsaying we were trained as medical professionals. We are being overruled \nby insurance companies.\n  Is it a great leap for us to take that concern of doctors over these \nmany years and understand that perhaps one of the reasons why \nmalpractice has increased is that HMOs and managed care companies are \nsqueezing doctors away from the professional standards that they were \ntaught to follow? That is part of the reality.\n  Another part of the reality is that not very long ago increased \nmalpractice premiums were passed on to patients. Patients paid more in \nfees. Hospitals, of course, charged more for their services. Now, with \nHMOs and managed care and strict accounting and restrictions in \ncompensation, the malpractice premiums can't be passed on. The doctor \npays more of it personally.\n  That is why this has become a dominant issue. But it also relates to \ninsurance companies.\n  A special interest group that is so heavily favored here in the U.S. \nSenate, which was hardly mentioned in the opening statement about S. \n11, is the insurance companies. We just do not talk about insurance \ncompanies in polite Senate company. It is considered inappropriate to \nthink that perhaps they have gone too far.\n  Do you know what this bill does? I think this is a classic. When you \nget to section 13 of this bill, the sense of Congress--this is like \nsending a note to your sister, but it is a sense of Congress, not a \nlaw--that a health insurer should be liable for damages for harm caused \nwhen it makes a decision as to what care is medically necessary and \nappropriate.\n\n  We debated for months as to whether the HMO and managed care company \nwould be held accountable for making the decision on what is medically \nnecessary and appropriate. Those on the other side of the aisle stood \nwith the insurance companies and said: No, we don't want to hold those \ninsurance companies liable. If they say that somebody has to leave a \nhospital too soon or that surgery is not indicated, the best we can do \nin this bill on malpractice is a sense of Congress--note to your \nsister--that says we really think a health insurer should be liable for \ndamages performed. No law, just that is what we think; that is what we \nsense.\n  Is that any way to address this serious problem that is part of the \nmedical malpractice crisis facing our country? Doctors and nurses many \ntimes know who the problem doctors are, and they know the problems with \ninsurance companies. But the culture we are creating in the medical \nprofession and the political culture which we created on the floor of \nthe Senate has led us to the point where we can't honestly speak to the \nAmerican people about remedying this problem.\n  I think there is a better way to deal with this. We should enact \nlegislation following the lead of Senator Kennedy, who introduced a \nbill last year. It would establish a voluntary system to share medical \nerror information among providers' and patients' safety organizations \nthrough the National Patients' Safety Database. Information shared in \nthis manner would be privileged and not subject to legal discovery. But \nit would allow health care professionals to report accidents without \nfear that that information will put anyone in legal jeopardy. It would \ntake a bad doctor out of the operating room when he should be out.\n  Health professionals who submit reports would also be protected from \ndiscrimination in the workplace for participating in reporting systems.\n  Also, consistent with the Institute of Medicine recommendation, this \nbill creates a new Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety \nand the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. The center would \nconduct and support research on medical errors--something we need to \nface and face honestly.\n  We also have to concede another point. When the doctors from Illinois \ncame in and said they favored this bill, I asked them: If we imposed a \nstrict limitation of $250,000 on David and his family, a child who went \nto the doctor and hospital but unfortunately did not have his \ntemperature monitored and became quadriplegic, if we said that child, \nno matter how long he lives, can never get more than $250,000 for pain\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nand suffering, no matter what the circumstances, if we did that, would \nit bring down your malpractice premiums? The doctors said: No, not \nright away, but maybe in 3 or 4 years we would start to see that turn \naround. In 3 or 4 years?\n  I listened to the Senator from Kentucky come before us and talk about \nan immediate national crisis. If his bill passes, it doesn't respond to \nthis immediate national crisis. There is a better way to do this.\n  Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years with the Bush administration, we have been \nrather liberal--I guess I could use that word--in relation to their \nparticular subject, tax cuts. We decided to use the tax cuts to reward \nand help certain people in our society. I believe we should construct \nlegislation that allows a tax credit for those medical professionals \nand doctors who see their malpractice premiums going through the roof. \nTo do that gives them immediate assistance, not something that may or \nmay not help them 3 or 4 years from now.\n\n  The same could be true for hospitals and certainly for high-risk \nspecialties. We need to allow doctors and hospitals to claim a tax \ncredit for the percentage of malpractice premiums they are paying or \nwill pay in the next number of years.\n  I also want to talk to you about the whole question of insurers and \nwhy we are in this dilemma. This has been analyzed by many groups, \nincluding the Government Accounting Office, the Wall Street Journal, \nand USA Today. How did we reach this point of a malpractice insurance \ncrisis today? Why is it so much worse today than it was?\n  According to the Senator from Kentucky, one of the sponsors of S. 11, \nit is all about lawyers filing claims. That is not the whole story.\n  Insurance works in this fashion. If I am going to insure you for a \nloss, I collect the premium from you. The only way that I make a profit \nis if I collect more premiums from you than I have to pay back or I \ntake those premiums and invest them in a way where I make money, and, \ncoupling that together with excess premiums, make my profit.\n  It turned out that a few years ago, with the booming stock market and \nduring the period of economic expansion in this country, a malpractice \ninsurance company--a leading company in St. Paul, which is now out of \nbusiness--had collected so much money in reserves and was making so \nmuch money in investments that they decided to declare a $1 billion \ndividend. Other companies saw this and said we need to get in the \nmalpractice business; this is lucrative. So they did. They went in and \nmade their investments. As the stock market started to crumble, they \nhad no choice but to cut off their malpractice insurance or raise their \npremiums dramatically.\n  Did you hear any part of that explanation in the introduction of S. \n11? You didn't. It was all about lawyers filing claims.\n  But there is another part of the story. The insurance companies are a \npart of the story. We are not supposed to talk about that on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. Perhaps someone is entertaining a rule to prohibit \nreference to insurance companies. We just don't do that around here. \nThat is not considered polite. But it is part of the problem, and it is \nalso part of the solution. We need to deal with making certain that \ninsurance companies treat doctors fairly--and reinsurance companies.\n\n  Now, this gets into the complexity of insurance policy, which I may \nnot understand as well as I should, but I do know this part: There are \nfive reinsurance companies in the world that reinsure for medical \nmalpractice. Only one of them, the Hartford, is regulated in the United \nStates and subject to State regulation; the other four are not. We have \nno idea whether the rates they are charging are fair. So before we say \nto David and his family, $250,000 and not a penny more, no matter how \nlong you live, the obvious questions is, Are the insurance companies \ndealing with this challenge and dealing with it fairly?\n  Incidentally, the insurance companies are exempt from antitrust law. \nThey can gather information and share that information without any \npenalty, through the Department of Justice, for violations of \nantitrust.\n  I think we understand what we are dealing with, but let me give you \nan idea of actual cases in States. The Senator from Kentucky talked \nabout various States facing a malpractice insurance crisis, with which \nI do not quarrel. He suggested caps on recovery was the way to bring \ndown malpractice insurance premiums.\n  The Weiss Ratings analysis took a look at the percentage increase in \nmedian medical malpractice premiums in the period between 1991 and \n2002. They took a look at the States with caps, with limitations on how \nmuch a victim can recover, and those without caps.\n  You would assume, by the opening argument, that if the State has caps \non how much a victim and his family can recover, the malpractice \npremiums must be low. But look at these States as examples of what \nhappened during that 10- or 11-year period of time. The States without \ncaps on recovery for malpractice victims such as this child David: \nArizona had a 3 percent increase in median premiums for medical \nmalpractice; New York, 6 percent; Georgia, 8 percent; the State of \nWashington, 27 percent.\n  When you go to the States with caps on recovery, let's see how their \npremiums reacted in the same period of time: California, up 50 percent; \nKansas, up 60 percent; Utah, up 82 percent; and Louisiana, up 84 \npercent. So there is no direct correlation, no linear relation between \ncaps and the premiums charged to doctors--exactly the opposite of what \nhas been argued on the floor of the Senate on the motion to proceed to \nthe bill.\n  In fact, if you look at it on a national basis--this, again, from the \nWeiss Ratings, Incorporated--the percentage increase in median medical \nmalpractice premiums from 1991 to 2002: States with caps, with \nlimitations on how much victims can recover, if they are the victims of \nmedical negligence, a 48 percent increase in that period time; States \nwithout caps, 36 percent. So it is counterintuitive to argue that we \nare dealing with a linear relationship, direct relationship between \ncaps and the premiums that are charged.\n  I would like to also add that I think we have to be honest about how \nwe bring the groups together to deal with this. I think we also have to \nlook to the legal profession. I do believe that if attorneys are guilty \nof filing frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits, we should put into \nlaw penalties to not only penalize them for costs and attorney's fees \nbut ultimately to prohibit them from filing this kind of lawsuit if it \nis done with any repetition.\n\n  I do not believe doctors should be harassed. I want them to be \ndoctors first and not sitting around in depositions and courtrooms for \nlawsuits that never should have been filed. But let me add very \nquickly, I have been there. I, as an attorney, had people walk into my \noffice where they had husbands who had died, children who had died, and \nasked me to file medical malpractice lawsuits. I had to listen to those \nfacts and make a decision. I will tell you, I thought long and hard \nbefore I considered taking on any of those cases.\n  Filing a medical malpractice case is not easy. It is not cheap. It is \ncomplicated and extremely expensive. If you do not start off with an \nunderstanding that you have a good chance of recovery, then, frankly, \nmost attorneys will turn down those cases. That is why so few cases are \nfiled relative to the number of malpractice claims that could be filed. \nAttorneys know that getting involved in those lawsuits in my State, \nnow, requires an affidavit from a doctor which says, before you can \nfile the complaint, that you do have a legitimate claim for medical \nmalpractice.\n  We know the depositions will require expert witnesses, who are \nextremely expensive, in preparing your case to take it to the jury. All \nof these things are understood. We also know, at the end of the day, \nmost plaintiffs lose their cases filed for medical malpractice, and \nthat is after they have cleared all these hurdles. So to suggest that \nattorneys are just filing these cases frivolously, believing they are \ngoing to receive money for just filing a complaint, is certainly not my \nexperience.\n  Let me say before I yield the floor--I notice my colleagues are in \nthe Chamber and would like to speak--there is an element of this bill \nwhich the Senator from Kentucky made no mention of and no reference to \nwhatsoever. He told us very good and important stories about doctors \nwho could\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\nnot practice because of malpractice premiums. I think he should have \nalso included the fact that this bill does not just provide a \nlimitation on recovery for lawsuits brought against doctors; this bill \nprovides a limitation on recovery for lawsuits brought against \npharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers.\n  I did not read anywhere about a malpractice crisis involving \npharmaceutical companies, but we learned 2 weeks ago, when we debated \nthe prescription drug bill--and we have learned time and again--that \nhardly any major bill could go through the Senate unless it figured out \na way to help drug companies. This bill is no exception. This bill has \nbeen designed to make certain there is a limitation on the amount of \nmoney that can be recovered from drug companies and medical device \ncompanies when they may be guilty of product liability, when they may \nhave sold a product which injured someone.\n  I can recall a specific situation: heart catheters. I am a little bit \nfamiliar with this issue, and maybe some of those who have followed the \ndebate are as well. These are tiny little lines which are passed \nthrough a vein of a person to their heart, and they actually film what \nis going on in the person's heart. It is an amazing diagnostic device.\n  The medical device itself had been cleared by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, but it turned out that the manufacturer was guilty of \nshoddy practices in Massachusetts. This manufacturer was creating and \nproducing catheters which, when inserted into a patient and sent up to \nthe heart, would break, leaving portions within the heart, leading to \nthe necessity for surgery to retrieve those pieces that were left \nbehind.\n\n  Now, I ask you, is that truly what this debate is all about, that \nmedical device manufacturers which negligently make a product that can \nendanger the lives of individuals should also be limited in terms of \ntheir liability? These are not individual doctors; these are medical \ndevice companies. The same thing can be said of pharmaceutical \ncompanies.\n  So I would just ask the sponsor of this legislation, the next time he \ncomes to the floor to explain this bill--and does it in compassionate \nterms about doctors--why he does not tell us the rest of the story. I \nwant to hear the rationale about drug companies and medical device \ncompanies, why they, too, need this protection when their products \ncause extremely excessive damage to individuals.\n  It is my understanding that tomorrow we are going to return to the \nmotion to proceed to this bill, and I am sure many of my colleagues \nwill be coming to the floor. But I will say this, as I did at the \noutset: It is unfair the way doctors are being treated with medical \nmalpractice premiums. Something needs to be done in a responsible \nfashion, and involving doctors and lawyers as well as insurance \ncompanies. If we do it, and do it right, it will be a service to every \nfamily in America and every community in America.\n  But this bill, S. 11, is equally unfair to the victims of medical \nnegligence. To put a limitation on the amount a person can recover--\nregardless of the permanent disfigurement, the incontinence, the \nblindness, the quadriplegia that these people will suffer for a \nlifetime--is fundamentally unfair and, as we have demonstrated, will \nnot lead to lower premiums. There are better, more reasonable ways to \napproach this problem.\n  As I said before on the floor, and I repeat at this point, I stand \nready to work with the majority and other Members of the Senate. Let's \nroll up our sleeves and do this the right way. Let's do it in a way \nthat we can be proud of, and not do it in a take-it-or-leave-it \nfashion, as this bill has been brought to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are on this subject now. We are out of \nmorning business; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \non this bill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chairman.\n  I am very pleased to come to the floor this afternoon and join my \ncolleagues to address an issue that has a crippling effect on the \nhealth care system. It has helped take out of control Medicare costs, \nmalpractice costs. I guess specifically I am interested in it for my \nown State, of course, as well as everyone else's. Some providers have \nseen premiums jump as much as 81 percent in 2 years. Rural areas are \ndisproportionately impacted. Often there is no other provider to fill \nin when a doctor is forced to close shop. That has been the case in my \nState.\n  Recent studies by HHS show that in States where they have enacted \nlimits on noneconomic damages in lawsuits, there are about 12 percent \nmore physicians per capita than there are where there is no such cap.\n  So we are beginning to not only test the costs but whether we have \nproviders. That is a very important one. OB/GYN services have been \nespecially impacted in my State, where 9 out of 54 recently surveyed \nhave either stopped delivering babies or plan to do so because of \nrising liability costs.\n  I have listened to my friend from Illinois talk about this issue. \nObviously it is going to be a controversial issue. There are different \nviews, very different views, but it is not a new solution. It is one \nthat has been in place and has proven to work in many of the States. It \nalso is interesting that we have talked a lot--I happen to be involved \nwith the rural health caucus. We have spent 2 weeks previous to this \ntalking about Medicare. And we talk about, frankly, who is going to \npay, but we seldom ever talk about what the costs are and what we could \ndo about reducing some of the costs that put people out of touch with \ntheir own physician. This is one that is proven. This is one that does \nwork. It is here to be acted upon.\n  As to the discussion on the other side of the aisle that maybe we are \nin too much of a hurry, this has been on our minds and on our floor and \nin our States for a very long time. This is not a new idea as a matter \nof fact.\n  I just wanted to show one little chart I think is interesting. That \nis to show that reforms do work as a matter of fact. This says, ``2003 \nPremium Survey Data Selected by Specialties, $1 million to $3 million \nlimits.'' Here are the specialties. Los Angeles, CA; Denver which has \nthe limitation versus similar to what is here; New York, Nevada, \nIllinois, Florida do not. Then take a look here at internal medicine. \nHere is an $11,000 premium, $9,000 premium. Over here where there is no \ncontrol--$16,000, $19,000, $26,000, $56,000. Down here is the OB/GYN. \nIn these cases where there is some limitation, $54,000, which is \nobviously too much anywhere, and $30,000. But look over here where \nthere are none, none of the controls we are talking about here, \n$89,000, $107,000, $102,000, $200,000. It does work. It does work. \nMedical Liability Monitor is the source of these numbers.\n  It isn't as if we are talking about something that is untested, \nsomething that we don't know about. It is not as if we are talking \nabout a new problem of which we were not aware. The fact is, we have \nphysicians living in Cheyenne, WY, who drive to Colorado for this \nreason. Can you imagine Wyoming being one of the highest places to pay. \nYou wouldn't think that, would you? I think this is something that has \na good deal of merit, something that we need to talk about.\n\n  We have cited some of the things that are peculiar to our own States. \nWe have a doctor in Wheatland, WY, who over the last several years has \ndelivered more than 2,000 babies in about four different counties. He \nhas been the major provider of services there. He has quit operating. \nHe has quit delivering babies.\n  Sheridan, a little larger town, has one of two OB/GYNs in the area. \nHis medical malpractice insurance costs over $60,000 a year. So we are \nin the position, then, when providers drop out of communities like \nthis, where people are forced to drive 2 to 3 hours before they can get \nservices. We have talked a lot, and we have a lot of concerns about \nrural health care. And it is difficult to keep providers in those \nareas. When you have one or two who leave, you have none. And so it is \nreally quite different to be in our area.\n  The Wyoming physician population ranks 47th out of 50 States. So \nevery physician is very valuable to us. Forty percent of our family \nphysicians are over the age of 50, and we are going to see more \nretirements. We are going to\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\nsee more movement, particularly if there are disincentives to serve \nsuch as this cost of malpractice insurance. So we need to deal with \nthis.\n  As I said, this idea that is being promoted has been in place. We \nknow that it works. Is it going to solve all the problems of cost? Of \ncourse not. But we know this one will solve some of the problems of \ncost, and we can move forward to find some other ones.\n  As I said, we talk all the time about health care and who is going to \npay. But as all health care costs keep going up 12 or 13, 14 percent a \nyear, we have to begin sometime to take a look at how we can contain \nsome of the costs so that somebody will be able to pay for it.\n  One of our orthopedic surgeons in Teton County, Jackson Hole, WY, has \nseen a 300-percent increase in liability premiums in the last 12 \nmonths. Without trauma care in Jackson, these people have to go to Salt \nLake City. This is the kind of additional difficulty we have.\n  We all pay for medical liability costs. All patients pay the \nescalating costs generated by the Nation's dysfunctional medical \nliability system. And these increased premiums are the result. It also \nreduces the access to care, especially specialty care. So every \ntaxpayer pays the price.\n  We think we can reduce Federal spending in Medicare, Medicaid, the \nFederal Employees Benefits Plan. It is suggested we can reduce this by \n$14 billion in 10 years. This would be a savings to everyone. Local and \nState governments could save over $8 billion over that period of time. \nSo it isn't just a focus on a few people. This is the kind of thing \nthat would save us all money and I think would make our lives much \nbetter.\n  What we are doing--and I think there needs to be a little explanation \nof it, to talk about it--doesn't limit damages to $250,000. It limits \nnoneconomic damages to $250,000. So if someone needs care, if somebody \nneeds various things that are economic costs, those things are not \nthere. We want to make sure we listen carefully to what is being said \nhere.\n  So what we are seeking to do, of course--it seems to me reasonable--\nis to set reasonable limits on noneconomic damages, provide for a \nquicker review of liability claims, assure claims are filed within a \nreasonable limit of time, and educate folks that frivolous suits only \nadd to the overall cost of care for everyone. We spend a lot of time \ntalking about who should pay. I have already discussed that but rarely \ndo we talk about the costs. They are becoming increasingly important to \nus.\n  This bill is modeled after California's liability reform bill. \nCalifornia's law stabilized the State's medical liability insurance \nmarket, increasing patient access to care, saving more than $1 billion \na year in liability premiums. As I said, specifically it allows \nunlimited economic damages. Past and future medical expense, loss of \npast and future earnings, cost of domestic services, these things are \nnot limited. It establishes a reasonable limit on noneconomic damages \nwhich is exactly what we are seeking to do. States, however, would have \nthe flexibility to establish or maintain their own laws on damage \nawards. It establishes a fair share rule that allocates damages \nproperly and fairly in proportion to the party's degree of fault. There \nis a sliding scale for attorney's contingency fees; therefore, \nmaximizing recovery for patients, which this is really all about.\n  It authorizes periodic payments to injured parties rather than one \nlump payment.\n  It is interesting to me, it does seem to present kind of strange \npolitics. We argue on the other side of the aisle all the time about \nhealth care and that we ought to pay and make sure everybody has health \ncare and so we will do it with taxes so that they are appealing to \nthose people who need help in terms of costs. But when we come up with \nsomething that will impact the costs, suddenly the sympathy shifts over \nto the trial lawyers. It is sort of interesting to try to argue both \nsides, when there is a certain amount of conflict here.\n  I think this is a real opportunity for us to do some things that will \nbe helpful to everyone, whether they are taxpayers, patients, \nphysicians, or whatever. We have a chance to do something with that. \nNow is our opportunity. It is not a new problem. I think it is time we \nact. I am pleased to be among the sponsors. I want to work to see that \nthis moves forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, briefly, I thank the Senator from \nWyoming for his contribution to this debate. We were discussing off the \nfloor the fact that Wyoming got added to the crisis list--today, \nactually. Talk about a State in which the distances are great and the \nproblems are compounded by it; Wyoming has to be at the top of the \nlist. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to correct some of the perceptions \nthat perhaps have been left about what this legislation would do, or \nwhat the situation is.\n  First, it is very interesting to me that it appears there is an \neffort to blame the medical profession, the doctors. I ask this \nquestion now of most Americans: Who do you have more confidence in, \nyour local doctors, the drugs you have been taking, the medical devices \nthat are keeping many alive, the type of medical care you are getting \nin home towns, or your local trial lawyer?\n  Well, that is an easy question to answer. I have had to deal with \nthat myself on both sides of the issue. By the way, I do have a law \ndegree and I do know a lot of lawyers on both sides of the issue for \nwhom I have a great deal of respect. Nobody is saying you should not \nhave an opportunity to bring a lawsuit when you have been wronged or \ndamaged. That is clearly not the case. But the idea that we are going \nto say no, no, there is not a medical liability crisis, there is a \nmedical malpractice crisis--in fact, when I go around and talk to \npeople who have pacemakers and have drugs that make their lives \nsomewhat acceptable, or they have had strokes but they are controlling \ntheir blood pressure, up or down, they feel pretty good about health \ncare in America.\n  Health care in America is the goose that laid the golden egg. We are \nthe most blessed people in the world when it comes to medical care. Is \nit perfect? No. Are mistakes made? Yes. Do we need better reporting or \nto keep records of this sort of thing? I will support that. The AMA may \nnot like it that we keep closer track and deal with some of these \nmistakes that are made. But I am for that. I think we need to know \nwhere the problems are and we need to deal with them.\n  But to say the problem here is the medical profession or the \ninsurance industry--by the way, I don't want to just dismiss their \ninvolvement either. I want to make sure we understand why these medical \nliability insurance rates are going through the ceiling like they are. \nIt is a variety of issues, I believe. I don't believe it is just the \nlawsuits but I think that is a big contributor. I think defensive \nmedicine is a big part of it. I think that some of their investments \nwent south on them and that is causing some insurance companies to \nraise rates.\n  But to shift the burden over to the medical profession, when I know \nthese men and women practicing medicine--the neurosurgeons, \northopedics, OB/GYNs--these general practitioners in the Mississippi \nDelta are already so terribly underserved and are just saying: We \ncannot continue. We are retiring or leaving and going to another State. \nThis is the crisis. Maybe my State is worse than most but this is a \nhuge problem, and it is all over the country now.\n  One of the things I want to correct is this: Senator Durbin talked \nabout David, referred to David's situation. The inference was that all \nhe would get is $250,000. As a matter of fact, under this legislation, \nhe would get all of his hospital bills paid for, all rehabilitation \nbills paid for, all physical therapy, all speech therapy, all \noccupational therapy; and if a home nurse is needed 24 hours a day, he \ncould receive full compensation for that. He could get lost wages up to \na lifetime of what he could have earned, which could be, obviously, \nmillions of dollars. It could cover anything David's family would have \nto spend on his condition. Plus, the punitive damages in this \nlegislation is not $250,000; it is the greater of\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\n$250,000 or two times economic damages. Quite often, economic damages \ncould easily be $10 million.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Then it would be two times that--$20 million--that a victim \ncould receive if the economic damages are $10 million.\n  So let me give an example, and then I will yield. I want to make this \npoint. Under the California situation, with the $250,000 limit, what \nhas happened? I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Californians Allied for Patient Protection]\n\n   Sample Recent Medical Malpractice Awards in California Under MICRA\n\n       December 2002; $84,250,000 total award; Alameda County.\n       5 year-old boy with cerebral palsy and quadriplegia because \n     of delayed treatment of jaundice after birth.\n       The $750,000 award for non-economic damages was reduced to \n     $250,000 under MICRA.\n\n       January 1999; $21,789,549 total award; Los Angeles County.\n       Newborn girl with cerebral palsy and mental retardation \n     because of birth related injury.\n\n       October 1997; $25,000,000 total award; San Diego County.\n       Boy with severe brain damage, spastic quadriplegic and \n     mental retardation because too much anesthesia was \n     administered during a procedure.\n       November 2000; $27,573,922 total award; San Bernardino \n     County.\n       25 year-old woman with quadriplegia because of a failure to \n     diagnose a spinal injury.\n       July 2002; $12,558,852 total award; Los Angeles County.\n       30 year-old homemaker with brain damage because of a lack \n     of oxygen during recovery from surgery.\n       The award included $250,000 in non-economic damages for the \n     plaintiff's husband and $676,921 for past and future \n     household services.\n       July 1999; $30,900,000 total award; Los Angeles County.\n       Newborn girl with cerebral palsy because of birth injuries.\n\n       October 2002; $59,317,500 total award; Contra Costa County.\n       3 year-old girl with cerebral palsy as a result of birth \n     injury.\n       The award included $100,000 in non-economic damages for the \n     child, $200,000 in non-economic damages for the mother and \n     $200,000 in non-economic damages for the father.\n\n       April 1999; $6,885,000 total award; Orange County.\n       Premature newborn girl with permanent blindness because of \n     delay in treatment.\n\n       February 2000; $1,384,685 total award; Riverside County.\n       39 year-old pregnant homemaker and mother who died because \n     of misdiagnosis.\n       The $300,000 award for non-economic damages was reduced to \n     $250,000 under MICRA.\n       December 1999; $50,239,557 total award; San Francisco \n     County.\n       10 year-old boy with brain damage because of undiagnosed \n     infection at birth.\n       The $324,000 non-economic damage verdict was reduced to \n     $250,000 under MICRA.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This shows that in December of 2002 there was an \n$84,250,000 total award in a case under the current California law; a \n$21 million in January of 1999; a $25 million award in October of 1997 \nfor a boy with severe brain damage and mental retardation because of \nthe anesthesia. It goes on. Here is one for a $59 million total award.\n  So the inference that all you could get under this legislation would \nbe $250,000 is absolutely not the case. It would depend on the economic \ndamages, the totality of the costs, and the verdict rendered. So I just \nwanted to make sure people are aware that there is flexibility here and \nthat, depending on the severity and how long it would last, it could be \na multimillion-dollar recovery.\n  I am glad to yield to Senator Durbin for a comment or question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I ask him this question: Is the \nSenator familiar with the provisions in this law relating to collateral \nsources? For example, health insurance?\n  Mr. LOTT. That you would get health insurance and that would be \ndeducted, in effect, from the damage? I was not familiar with that \nparticular provision but I understand that does happen all the time. I \nam not a cosponsor of the legislation but I am planning on being one. \nThat is why I have been here listening to the debate and reading the \nlegislation. I want to know all of the ramifications of it. There may \nbe the collateral insurance provision that would allow the amount of \nmoney received to be reduced by that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Mississippi familiar with the fact \nthat in all 50 States across the United States, including his State and \nmine, there is no similar provision about the deduction of collateral \nsources? There is only one other instance where we have passed a law \nwhere collateral sources would be credited, and that was for the \nvictims of 9/11.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wasn't aware it doesn't apply to any other States. I \nwould think the States would want to take that into consideration. I \ndon't have a problem with that. You need to look at the totality of a \nsituation--and you have judges and juries who will do that--to see what \nrecovery they might be getting through their insurance, as you decide \nwhat the award may be in terms of what their economic needs are.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield, is he aware of the \nfact that in most States, if you go into a civil lawsuit and raise the \nissue of insurance coverage, it is an automatic mistrial?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely. I have seen it happen. I was involved in a case \none time and one of the lawyers accidentally mentioned insurance, and \nthere was a mistrial on the spot. I always thought that was kind of \nridiculous. But I also know that some juries, when they think an \ninsurance company is involved and that actually the doctor might not \nhimself be paying, that might affect the amount of the verdict they \nwould give. So that is why that law is on the books.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield, this bill says that in \nany health care lawsuit any party may introduce evidence of collateral \nsource benefits. I ask the Senator, does he consider it fair that if \nDavid's family had health insurance that paid for some or all of his \nmedical bills, that those who were guilty of malpractice, in his case, \nshould somehow be absolved from paying because his family had the \nforesight to have insurance?\n  Mr. LOTT. Are these lawsuits about punishment, or are they about \nhelping the people who have been damaged? Sometimes both. By the way, \nthere could be, I guess, under certain circumstances, a criminal act \ninvolved. While I am not an expert in this area--it has been a long \ntime since I practiced law and defended anybody--I have always thought \nthe admission of evidence about where the money would come from or how \nmuch should be admissible in court. I have to defer to others who have \nmore experience and more expertise in this area than I do.\n  Mr. President, does Senator McConnell wish to comment? I yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend, my understanding of \nthe way this provision would work is the collateral rule would allow \nthe jury to know but does not reduce the award and does not allow the \ninsurer to subrogate. That is the way this provision is crafted in this \nlegislation. It would allow a jury to know, but it would not reduce the \naward and would not allow the insurer to subrogate. That is my \nunderstanding of the way it is crafted in the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I assume the Senator from Mississippi has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Durbin for a further question or answer \nto the comments from Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will do it in the nature of a question. Is it not true \nif the jury knows that the plaintiff's family, in David's case, has \nhealth insurance which is going to pay for some of his medical costs, \nwhich are obviously going to be extensive, that this is likely to \ndiminish the amount that will have to be paid by the party responsible \nfor David's condition?\n  I ask the Senator, he suggested earlier that this should not be about \npunishment. Is there not a question of accountability? If the doctor in \nthis case did not monitor his temperature leading to quadriplegia and a \nlifetime of pain and suffering, is there not a question of holding that \ndoctor accountable rather than his parents for having the foresight of \nbuying insurance?\n  Mr. LOTT. To answer the question, I see no problem in a jury being \nable to consider the totality of the situation. I do not think we \nshould ignore the fact a doctor--first of all, they are human beings. \nThey do make mistakes. There are lawsuits based on very good cases and \nrecoveries of a significant nature because of the extent of the damage \nor\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\nthe longtime life impact on that person.\n  When a doctor goes through this, don't you think it has an effect on \nhis practice in that community? Do you think he is not adversely \naffected by it? I remember a case in my home area where a doctor left a \nsponge in a patient and it affected his career the rest of his life. He \nwas punished. He was punished by the verdict, his insurance company had \nto pay, obviously--the patient got significant damages, both economic \nand punitive damages, and he suffered mightily.\n  The point is, I have watched this issue for pretty close to 34 years, \nboth as a lawyer and then as a Member of Congress, and it has gotten \nworse and worse. It is leading to a serious problem. It is about the \npatients, and it is about the doctors' insurance companies. But what \nabout the people now who are losing access to medical care, to expert \ndoctors, to especially the trauma doctors we are about to lose in my \nown State, the women who have to drive literally hundreds of miles to \nget to an obstetrician when they are going to have a baby, what about \ntheir risks? Maybe they should be able to file a lawsuit against \nsomebody because they do not get sufficient health care.\n  This is something we are going to talk about over the next 24 to 48 \nhours. I do think something has to be done.\n  I want to make this point, too, in terms of working something out: We \nsaw last year prescription drug legislation was brought directly to the \nSenate floor. It did not go through the Finance Committee. Because of \nthat, we were required to get 60 votes, and that is why we did not get \nprescription drug legislation last year. A couple of the alternatives \nthat were voted on got over 50 votes, but we had to have 60. So there \nis nothing extraordinary about taking up a bill that comes over from \nthe House or taking a bill directly to the floor for consideration.\n  I would prefer we have hearings. I think hearings would be a lot of \nfun. I would like to see the doctors, the nurses, and patients who are \nbeing denied care have a chance to say what this is doing to them. \nMaybe we could work out some of the disagreements.\n  I wish to make this point: That effort has been made this year. \nSenator Frist has been working with Senator Feinstein to come up with a \nbipartisan bill basically along the lines of what is in this bill with \nthe $250,000 limit on punitive damages or two times economic damages, \nwhichever is greater. Senator McConnell probably was involved in those \nnegotiations, but it fell apart when there was pressure to raise it \nfrom $250,000 to $500,000, and they just basically quit working on it, \nI guess, because they could not get an agreement.\n\n  I would hope a committee would act--have hearings, report a bill, and \nlet's make sure it is a good bill, but let's make sure it is not one \nwritten by just the plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  Mr. President, does Senator McConnell wish to comment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make sure my friend from \nMississippi is aware that, in fact, there was a joint hearing on \nFebruary 11 between the Judiciary Committee and the Labor Committee on \nthis subject. There has been a recent hearing. Of course, in previous \nCongresses, there have been numerous hearings on this subject for as \nlong as the Senator from Mississippi and I have been Members of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, to make sure we all understand what the \nprovision is in the bill we have been discussing, let's put it this \nway, Mr. President: This provision only allows a jury to know the \nvictim has received benefits from a third party, such as a health \ninsurer. It allows the jury to know that, I say to my friend from \nMississippi, but the jury is free to ignore that evidence if they like. \nIt would allow them to know there was insurance coverage, but the jury \nis free to ignore that evidence if they like. The provision also \nprevents health insurers, a third party, from recovering payments it \nmade to the victim. That is what this bill actually does.\n  I think it is important just to set the record straight on what is, \nin fact, contained in this legislation on that point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for joining us in \nthis floor debate, and I hope others will tomorrow, and I am sure they \nwill. It is worth noting that the State of Mississippi, faced with the \ncircumstances described by my colleague and friend, Senator Lott, \ndecided to do what each State has the right to do, and that is \nestablish its own standards of recovering for noneconomic losses.\n  It is my understanding they have established a schedule that starts \nat half a million dollars and, over a period of 10 or 15 years, goes up \nas high as $1 million or $1.2 million. That has been done by the State \nof Mississippi, as it could be done by any other State. What we are \nconsidering here is what we will do on a national basis.\n  I was wondering if the Senator from Kentucky would help me understand \nthe portion of the bill relative to what he described as flexibility in \nterms of States rights.\n  Would the Senator be kind enough to yield, without me yielding the \nfloor, to engage him in a dialog about this State flexibility? Is that \npermissible under the rules of the Senate? I direct that request \nthrough the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Illinois will make a \nunanimous consent request for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy, \nthat will be acceptable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Kentucky is kind enough to yield to \nthis procedure, I ask unanimous consent--I do not yield the floor--that \nwe be allowed to engage in a dialog about some aspects of this bill so \nthere is a clear understanding on the record of his intention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. As I \nhave said before, we get dangerously close to Senate debate on this \nfloor from time to time. This just happens to be one of those moments. \nI am happy to be here to witness it.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky, what is the Senator's intention in \nthe portion of the bill relative to State flexibility? I want to make \ncertain I understand. If my State has any law relative to medical \nmalpractice, relative to discovery or expert witnesses or, in my case, \nwe do not have a limitation on noneconomic losses, what part of State \nlaws would this new S. 11 preempt, and which portion would it not \npreempt?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Illinois, \nreading from the bill, of which I hope he has a copy, section 11 says:\n\n     SEC. 11. STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health \n     care lawsuits set forth in this Act preempt, subject to \n     subsections (b) and (c)--\n\n  Which I will go through in a minute--\n\n       State law to the extent that State law prevents the \n     application of any provisions of law established by or under \n     this Act. The provisions governing health care lawsuits set \n     forth in this Act supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United \n     States Code, to the extent that such chapter--\n       (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent \n     fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be \n     commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic \n     payment future damages,\n       (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding \n     collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits \n     subrogation or a lien on collateral source benefits.\n       Subsection (b) any issue that is not governed by any \n     provision of law established by or under this Act . . . shall \n     be governed by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.\n\n  Now, what the flexicaps are designed to do, as I understand it, is to \nallow a State to, in effect, opt out, consistent with the provisions \nthat I read to my colleague from Illinois, within those parameters.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask my colleague from Kentucky, that paragraph \n(b) goes on to say:\n\n       This Act does not preempt or supersede any law that imposes \n     greater protections (such as a shorter statute of \n     limitations) for health care providers and health care \n     organizations from liability, loss, or damages than those \n     provided by this Act.\n\n  As I read that, though, I understand that if one's State law is more \ngenerous to doctors, hospitals, drug companies, medical device \nproviders, HMO\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\ninsurance companies, then that State provision would be the applicable \nprovision. Is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is correct that this legislation allows states to \nprovide greater protections to health care providers than are contained \nin this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So it is not a balanced playing field completely. We are \nnot leaving it to the States to decide, for example, that wrongdoers of \nmedical malpractice cases would be treated more strictly, more \nseverely? If there is a stricter provision in the treatment of those \nindividuals, it would be preempted by this act? Is that the way we have \nexplained it?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Again, to ensure the availability of health care \nservices, the states are allowed to provide greater or additional \nprotections to health care providers than are contained in this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then if I might ask, the next section (c)--I am trying to \nget to the point of let's use an example of the State of Mississippi \nwhich has just decided on a cap of $500,000 on noneconomic losses \neffective January 1 of this year. Now, the underlying bill, S. 11, says \nthat the cap on noneconomic losses will be $250,000. So in that \ninstance, is it the position of the Senator that this bill would not \npreempt Mississippi law; that Mississippi's number would apply even \nthough it is larger than S. 11?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. This legislation does not preempt existing or \nfuture state laws on noneconomic damages.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator to explain subsection 2(c)(2) in \nterms of defenses available to a party in a health care lawsuit under \nany other provision of State or Federal law that does not preempt it? I \ndo not understand that particular section. If I have caught the Senator \noff guard on that particular section, we can return to it at a later \ntime, but perhaps he could explain what that particular section means.\n  We can come back. I do not mean to catch the Senator off guard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let's come back to that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We can come back to that at some point. I thank the \nSenator for yielding and providing that additional information.\n  As my colleagues can tell, during the course of this exchange we are \ndoing what usually happens in a committee hearing where sections of the \nbill are explained and members of the committee have a chance to ask \nquestions such as I have asked of one of the sponsors, Senator \nMcConnell. Then perhaps members of the committee say, perhaps, we need \nto change that language and we offer amendments. That is the committee \nprocess.\n\n  For this bill on medical malpractice, we have not done that. We are \nbringing it directly to the floor. As my colleagues can see, despite \nthe fact that my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, is certainly an \nable attorney, there are some complicated elements.\n  It is important, if we are going to consider a bill of this gravity, \nthat we do take the time to do it and do it right.\n  I also note that a case which I mentioned earlier is a clear \nillustration of why this bill is fundamentally unfair to victims. I \nmentioned this case earlier because it involves a woman who lives in \nthe city of Chicago. As I said in my opening statement, this lady, who \nhas written an article in a leading newspaper in our town, says that \nshe is literally the face of tort reform.\n  Three years ago, she went to a prestigious hospital in Chicago for a \nroutine surgery to have two moles removed from the side of her head. \nDuring the surgery, the oxygen which was being administered to her \nignited. In her words, it set her face on fire. It ended with her face \nin flames.\n  In her words:\n\n       My entire upper lip was burned off and much of my nose is \n     gone. For two years, I couldn't breathe on my own, and I now \n     wear a face mask with nasal tubes in what's left of my nose, \n     23 hours a day. I have endured eight surgeries, with more to \n     follow. The doctors who are trying to reconstruct my face and \n     teeth say the whole process could take up to seven years.\n\n  That is 10 years of surgery from that tragic accident.\n\n       Even then, the scars and burn marks will still be visible \n     and the emotional cost will be with me forever.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I'm 50 years old, and the mistakes made at the hospital \n     have damaged every part of my life--from my career to my \n     personal life to my sense of self. . . .\n       But today's proponents of medical malpractice reform don't \n     want to consider each case individually. They want to put a \n     cap on damages--regardless of how old a person was when they \n     were injured, how serious the injury, how an individual's \n     life has been affected by the negligence of others.\n\n  Let me interject for a moment. What is at stake in this debate is not \njust this important issue of medical malpractice but several other \nimportant issues. We are now talking about changing, at least in some \nrespects, the right of States to make individual decisions about the \nlawsuits filed in their States.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky said earlier, there are some parts where \nthe States will still have the last word but in other parts they will \nnot. So we will preempt a State's right to establish standards for \nlawsuits in its State. Now that is an important issue which we consider \nfrom time to time, and depending on one's prejudice on the issue before \nthem, they either ignore or honor States' rights. In this case, we \nclearly do not honor States' rights. The sponsors of S. 11 have decided \nthat on a national basis we will preempt States' rights.\n\n  The other thing that S. 11 preempts that is critically important is \nthe jury system. It is interesting that the men and women in the Senate \nwho came here because of the votes of the people they represent, who \ntrust the decision of the people they represent, would say that when 12 \nof them are gathered together in a jury box we cannot trust them; they \nare just not reasonable. They get carried away. And because they get \ncarried away, according to those supporting S. 11, we have to restrain \nthem. The only way to restrain them is to put limits in the law, say to \nthem no matter how much they think this poor lady's case is worth they \ncannot give her more than $250,000. This bill says we just do not trust \nthat jury.\n  Put the good lawyers in the room representing the doctor and the \nhospital, as well as those representing her, and the fear is, from \nthose who bring S. 11 to the floor today, that they are just going to \nsee this situation and say this is not fair, it is not right, and this \npoor lady deserves more than $250,000. Because of that fear that the \njury may go too far, this bill says: We will stop them. We will stop \nthem in every State in the Union.\n  Is it not interesting that when it comes to juries in medical \nmalpractice cases we have so little regard for their ability to find \nthe truth and do what is fair? And yet when it comes to so many other \nareas of the law, such as criminal justice and the imposition of the \ndeath penalty, the jury is sacrosanct; the jury has the final word. \nWhen it comes to deciding what this is worth for this lady, we do not \ntrust them.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Some claim that $250,000 compensates people who are \n     injured.\n\n  I refer to this photograph of this poor lady and what she has been \nthrough, and she asks: ``Would any healthy person allow their face to \nbe set on fire, or worse, to receive that sum of money?''\n  She says:\n\n       Not in the worst type of reality television show.\n       Some claim that caps are necessary to protect insurance \n     companies and HMOs. With documented medical mistakes soaring, \n     it is astonishing that federally proposed legislation would \n     first target the victims of medical error, before addressing \n     the errors themselves.\n\n  Now the Senator from Mississippi earlier suggested that I went too \nfar in suggesting we ought to look at the whole issue of medical \nmalpractice. Well, I do not think that is an issue foreign to this \ndebate. I think it is an issue central to this debate. If we are going \nto reduce exposure to lawsuits, if we are going to reduce the size of \npremiums, then we certainly have to look to the root cause of the \nproblem. If we do not deal with medical malpractice and the fact that \nonly 1 out of every 50 cases of malpractice ends up in a lawsuit being \nfiled, then frankly no matter how much we lower the noneconomic losses \nper case, there is still a universe of liability, a universe of \nexposure, for doctors and hospitals which goes untouched.\n  If this is going to be an honest discussion about reducing \nmalpractice insurance premiums and the crisis that\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\nthey have created among some specialities in some States, then I think \nfrankly, as is said by this poor lady who was a victim, what is wrong \nwith asking how we make our hospitals safer? How do we get our doctors \nto reach a point where they are making better informed decisions? That \nis a reasonable inquiry. It is one from which we should not shy away. \nIt is certainly one that applies directly to what we are discussing.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Some claim that juries are the problem. I trust a jury of \n     my peers to competently determine a fair judgment in cases \n     like mine.\n       The proponents of this legislation want to rein in juries \n     in medical malpractice cases, but never question the \n     legitimacy of the jury in cases of the death penalty or other \n     cases of wrongdoing. It appears that their concerns focus \n     more on satisfying specific constituencies than protecting \n     citizens from harm.\n       Like many people, I have been injured by poor care at a \n     hospital. More than anything in my life, I wish I could take \n     that day back, to make myself the way I was before the fire \n     exploded all around me. But I can't have that day back. All I \n     can have now is the right to be treated as an individual, to \n     have others understand how this event has changed my life.\n       Caps on damages seek to treat all injured people in the \n     same way. No victim is exactly like any other. Devastating \n     injuries affect each life differently and deserve to be \n     treated individually.\n       In short, my injuries are personal--though part of a \n     national epidemic of negligence in hospitals. A recent study \n     showed that 98,000 people were killed in hospitals, through \n     neglect, in a single year.\n       I'm hoping that Congress and the public will see that each \n     victim of medical malpractice is worth considering on his own \n     and not put arbitrary caps on the personal suffering of so \n     many people.\n\n  That is what it comes down to, a question of individual worth. The \nquestion is whether or not we have reached such a point in our society \nwhere we have to step away from the rights of this individual who was \nclearly a victim--as much a victim as someone who would be shot by a \ngun on the street or hit by a drunk driver on the road--whether we have \nto say in her circumstance we cannot trust a jury of her neighbors and \npeople in her community to decide what that injury was worth.\n  Have we reached that point? I hope we have not. I hope, instead, we \nwill do something which would be a breakthrough in the Senate--that we \nwill bring together the parties who are clearly responsible for where \nwe are today. Those include insurance companies.\n  The Senator from Mississippi conceded the point. He said: I will \nconcede that the investments of insurance companies have something to \ndo with the premiums, of how high they are.\n  Well, though the Senator from Mississippi conceded the point, this \nbill doesn't have anything to do with it. It does not bring to task the \ninsurance companies for the premiums they are charging or hold them \naccountable for premiums they will charge in the future.\n  We can keep noneconomic losses, limit the amount of money the victims \nlike this can recover, find premiums still rising through the roof as \nthey have in many States that already have these caps, and be powerless \nto respond. Our friends in the medical profession who are rightly \nasking us to do something should be enraged at that point, as well. \nHaving been promised this so-called tort reform--though I don't believe \nit is real reform--that this limitation on the amount that can be \nrecovered on individuals is going to be the answer to their prayers, it \nmay fail. That is not fair to them.\n\n  Bringing together in one place the medical profession to deal with \nlessening medical malpractice, which according to the Bush \nadministration spokesman, Dr. Clancy, has reached epidemic proportions, \nbringing together the insurance companies, which because of bad \ninvestments have seen their premiums skyrocket to try to make up the \ndifference, bringing together the attorneys to make sure frivolous \nlawsuits are not filed, can bring a solution. If that solution is to be \nimmediate--and it should be--it should necessarily involve some help in \nthe Tax Code for doctors who are currently facing these problems, as \nwell as hospitals.\n  I would like to know if the Senator from Kentucky would engage me, if \nhe would explain why he has included in this medical malpractice bill, \nthat was originally designed for doctors and hospitals, protection \nagainst lawsuits relative to medical device manufacturers and drug \nmanufacturers. Why were these two additional groups included in S. 11 \nto limit their exposure to lawsuits? I don't recall any reports of a \ncrisis when it comes to insurance for pharmaceutical companies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kentucky be allowed to \nrespond and I still retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to respond to some of the other suggestions my \nfriend from Illinois has made, so if he completes his comments, I will \nbe happy to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Fair enough. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to medical errors, were we \nnot debating a motion to proceed, and if we were on the bill, I am sure \nmy friend from Illinois or other Members of the Senate would offer \namendments with regard to medical errors. A medical errors bill has \npassed the House of Representatives.\n  I don't think anyone is suggesting--certainly not I--that the \nunderlying bill which we are seeking consent to get before the Senate \nshould not be amended or improved in a variety of different ways. \nHowever, it is pretty hard to offer an amendment when we are on a \nmotion to proceed.\n  With regard to the lady who was horribly disfigured--this picture \ndisplayed by my friend from Illinois--it is important to remember that \nher damages would not be capped at $250,000. She would get all of her \neconomic damages--all of them--plus $250,000 noneconomic damages, plus, \nin all likelihood, punitive damages on top of that equal to twice \neconomic damages or a quarter of a million, whichever is greater.\n  So the notion that there is simply no other compensation, that there \nis a $250,000 cap, is not accurate, I say with all due respect to my \nfriend from Illinois.\n  Senator Lott read off a few moments ago a list of awards under the \nCalifornia system--which is the underlying bill, the one we are seeking \nto get before the Senate, which this bill mirrors--of multimillions of \ndollars for compensatory damages; and punitive damages in a case of \ntruly egregious events could be twice the economic damages. Then there \nis a pain and suffering award potential of $250,000 on top of that.\n  The people who do not get a penny are the ones who cannot find a \ndoctor because the doctor is no longer there. One of the examples I \nused in my remarks earlier, Leanne Dyess from Mississippi, did not get \na penny. Nor did the women who give birth by the side of the road. They \ndon't get any money when their doctors have been driven out of \nbusiness.\n\n  So the point I make in response to my friend from Illinois: This is \nnot nearly as draconian as he suggests. On the economic side, there are \nno limits at all. Under punitive damages, there could be twice what \ncompensatory damages are, and there is a $250,000 possibility on pain \nand suffering already. We think that clearly the victims are not denied \nadequate compensation.\n  As we have already pointed out with several speeches, the States that \nhave tried this kind of approach have lower malpractice insurance \npremiums and do not have the crisis that we have in most of America \ntoday without that kind of legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will not yield at the moment.\n  With regard to an earlier reference to the FDA, if a product is found \nto be appropriate by the FDA, the companies should not have punitive \ndamages assessed when they follow the FDA approval process. Punitive \ndamages are for illegal conduct, and if the Federal Government blesses \nthat conduct, it can't be illegal. However, there is no cap on economic \nor noneconomic damages against the drug companies in that situation.\n  The other part of the FDA section prevents doctors from being sued on \nproduct liability cases just because they prescribed a drug that the \nFDA has approved.\n  That is the answer to the question the Senator asked earlier.\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me go on to say that in this case the question I was \ngoing to ask the Senator from Kentucky is this: This poor lady was a \nvictim in my home State of Illinois which does not allow punitive \ndamages in medical malpractice cases. My question for him, which I will \nsave for a time when he has a chance to answer--whether or not, under \nthose circumstances, this victim of medical malpractice has been \nallowed to recover punitive damages under his bill.\n  The reason I ask that question is I think that the section relative \nto State flexibility and protection of State rights is not altogether \nclear. If he is saying that this lady who was a victim of this \nexplosion in her face, which led to multiple surgeries over a projected \n10-year period of time, might have recovered punitive damages under S. \n11, then in my home State you cannot turn to punitive damages. Your \nrecourse, in her case, is for noneconomic losses, which are limited.\n\n  I might also add the Senator should note his punitive damage section \nincludes a phrase which is a very restrictive phrase. In my home State, \nwhen punitive damages were allowed they were allowed for reckless \nmisconduct or willful and wanton misconduct, which is a higher level of \nnegligence.\n  Under the specific language of S. 11, in order to recover for \npunitive damages, you must show a malicious intent to injure. So to \nhave cases of gross negligence is not enough. There must be ``malicious \nintent to injure.''\n  Another question which I am going to ask the Senator from Kentucky to \nconsider, and perhaps respond to at another time, is whether or not a \nsituation where a doctor is either on drugs, addicted to drugs, or \nintoxicated, is a case of malicious intent as opposed to gross \nnegligence or willful and wanton misconduct. Because if the doctor is \nclearly addicted or intoxicated and as a consequence someone is \nseverely injured, the question in my mind is, Is that plaintiff, that \nvictim, then strictly limited to $250,000? Is that a question of \nnegligence or is that a malicious intentional act?\n  The reason I raise that is because though we come to the floor and \nhave these phrases go back and forth in debate, in a courtroom it makes \nall the difference in the world, as in this case or similar cases where \nStates allow punitive damages.\n  From my point of view, I think this bill is certainly deserving of a \ncommittee hearing where many of these questions could be asked and \nanswered before taken up on the floor. We should have an amendment \nprocess. At the end of that process, we should decide whether or not \nthis is the only way to deal with the malpractice insurance premium \ncrisis, which we are facing in this country.\n  I will also add at this point, the Senator made reference earlier to \nsome of the challenges facing my home State of Illinois as part of the \ncrisis which he has referred to in his opening remarks. I might also \nnote it was just a couple of weeks ago in his home State of Kentucky \nthat a report that became very controversial was put together by the \nProgram Review and Investigations Committee on the cost of medical \nmalpractice insurance and its effect on health care. It turned out when \nthis report was filed there were those who tried to suppress it so it \nwould not be made public because it addressed the question of why \nmalpractice insurance premiums were high in the State of Kentucky. They \nraised, I think, some important points that deserve being part of our \ndebate, since the Senator from Kentucky has been kind enough to bring \nin my home State of Illinois.\n  This report talked about the impact of medical malpractice costs and \naccess in Kentucky, and I quote:\n\n       The total number of physicians in Kentucky has increased in \n     every year for which data was available--1981 through 2000--\n     suggesting that the cost of medical malpractice has not \n     reduced the overall availability of physicians for the State.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The difference of premiums in states with joint and several \n     liability [another provision in S. 11] and other states was \n     generally not statistically significant.\n\n  Then it went on to say:\n\n       Premiums in states with caps on non-economic damages were \n     not statistically different than in other states.\n\n  This is a report from the State of Kentucky written as it considered \ncapping its own noneconomic losses. They concluded:\n\n       Premiums in States with caps on non-economic damages were \n     not significantly different than in other states.\n\n  It said:\n\n       Premiums for internists and general surgeons were higher in \n     States that capped the amount of punitive damages that may be \n     awarded than in other states.\n       . . . There was no evidence that limiting the amount that \n     attorneys may charge for fees resulted in lower premiums.\n\n  That is from the State of Kentucky, this controversial report, which \nmany people did not want released to the public.\n  I think it raises questions as to whether or not the premise of S. 11 \nis a sound premise. Certainly in the State of Kentucky, people who \nlooked at it came to the opposite conclusion.\n  Let me say a word about attorneys' fees. There has been a lot said \nhere about attorneys and contingency fees. The contingency fee is the \nway a poor person comes to court. Unless you are independently wealthy \nand can finance a lawsuit and pay a lawyer by the hour, your only \nrecourse is to say to the lawyer, You recover your fee if I recover a \nsettlement or a verdict. That is what a contingency fee is.\n  In this bill, S. 11, the authors go to great lengths to limit the \namount of fees that can be recovered by attorneys filing medical \nmalpractice cases.\n  I will tell you in my experience as a down-State Illinois attorney--I \ndon't speak for any other part of the State or for current \npractitioners--it was not uncommon to say to someone coming in: I am \ngoing to charge you a 25 percent fee if we can settle this before \ncourt; a third if we have to go through a trial; and up to 40 percent \nif there is an appeal. You will also have to pay costs, but I will try \nto hold onto those in the hopes that ultimately you recover and we can \ntake that out of the ultimate settlement.\n  Many people would say, What is my recourse? I can't pay for this \nlawsuit. I know it is expensive to hire experts, it is expensive to \nhave attorneys prepare the case--for this lady who was a victim of \nmalpractice and many others.\n  In this particular law that is before us today, we try to put, at \nleast it is suggested that we put, limits on the amount attorneys can \nbe paid. We take away from the individuals the right to make that \ndecision with their own attorney.\n  Undoubtedly there have been abuses on attorneys' fees. I am sure that \nis the case, as there have been abuses on medical fees and abuses on \nfees charged by hospitals. But to say we are going to have a one-size-\nfits-all, one single approach nationwide as to the amount you can \nrecover is in fact to work a disservice as to whether or not attorneys \nwill be able to take these cases.\n  I spoke to an attorney today who took an extremely complicated case \nin Chicago who said before he finally reached a settlement his firm had \nincurred $250,000 in costs alone and there was no way that a 70-year-\nold plaintiff could pay them. So this attorney and his firm decided \nthey would put the money on the table, believing the case was \nmeritorious, hoping ultimately they could recover it if there were \nsettlement or verdict. And there was in this case.\n  But in this approach here, there is an attempt to try to limit the \namount attorneys can receive. I think people like the woman I showed \nhere, this lady here, who is a victim and certainly one deserving of \nany compensation coming back--but she may never have her day in court, \nmay never have an attorney, may never get a chance to submit her case \nto a jury of her peers if some attorney doesn't offer a contingency fee \narrangement. I have serious concerns about where this will take us in \nterms of limiting these contingency fee contracts. That, to me, is a \nconcern which should be I think debated and debated openly here.\n\n  I also want to raise a question--I hope if the Senator from Kentucky \ndoes not want to address the issue at this point; he will at a later \npoint--as to his qualifications of experts in medical malpractice \ncases. I want to understand the limitations he is putting on the \nexperts who come before the court.\n  In each trial I have been involved in, it was a decision to be made \nby the judge initially, and ultimately by the\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\njury, as to the credibility of an expert witness. The difficulty which \na plaintiff has in a medical malpractice lawsuit, in any city--whether \nit's in Illinois or Kentucky or New Hampshire--is most doctors are not \nanxious to testify against their colleagues. So if you are a person who \nhas been injured in a malpractice case, you have to look hard, far, and \nwide to find an expert who will come to the courtroom and say the \ndoctor did something wrong.\n  In this particular legislation there is a limitation on the types of \ndoctors who can testify in medical malpractice cases. I hope tomorrow \nwhen we return to this bill the Senator from Kentucky will consider \naddressing that particular issue as well--what kind of limitations he \nputs in place. Usually it is a case for the judge to decide initially \nand the jury to weigh. If they take a look at the doctor who is brought \nin and say, This doctor doesn't even have a specialty that relates to \nthis lawsuit, or has no experience or really no testimony, then they \ndiscount this and perhaps even reject it and maybe even use it against \nthe party who called this doctor. But to establish standards of \nevidence in this law--I think at least during the course of debating \nthis motion to proceed, we should have an opportunity to discuss the \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois mentioned the \nLegislative Research Service's study in Kentucky, which has been quite \ncontroversial and discredited by some. I think a more interesting study \nwas released today by HHS here in Washington which revealed that the \nStates' that enacted limits on noneconomic damages and medical losses \nhave been about 12 percent more for physicians per capita than States \nwithout such a cap.\n  As was pointed out earlier by a number of speakers on this side of \nthe issue, California and Colorado tend to prove the point. This \nlegislation is modeled after the California legislation. They enjoy \nlower malpractice insurance premiums in California. Widely believed by \neveryone is that the reason for that is a sensible system of caps on \nnoneconomic damages.\n  With regard to the limitation of lawyer's fees, I would remind \neveryone that is for the benefit of the victim because every penny the \nlawyer doesn't get, the victim does. The notion that somehow there \nwould not be lawyers available to pursue worthy litigation if there \nwere some kind of reasonable cap on lawyer's fees, it seems to me, is \nnot substantiated by the facts. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, \nthere has been a 25-percent cap for many years. I never heard of any \ncrisis created by the absence of lawyers willing to bring litigation \nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act. Certainly there should be a \nreasonable limitation on fees. We want to make it possible for lawyers \nto be adequately compensated. But to protect the victim from his own \nlawyer, it seems to me that some reasonable limitation is appropriate. \nThis bill includes what we believe to be a reasonable limitation.\n  The Senator from Illinois also suggested the bill only allows \npunitive damages in case of malicious intent. It is not just malicious \nintent; the bill also allows punitive damages when the doctor \ndeliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that such person knew \nthe claimant was substantially certain to suffer. Interpreted, that \nmeans that would apply to the situation of the drunk doctor Senator \nDurbin refers to, or a doctor who was on drugs or somehow incapacitated \nthrough this kind of behavior. This would clearly mean that punitive \ndamages would be allowed in this case.\n  We are making a careful list of all the questions which the Senator \nfrom Illinois asked. All of them are good questions. They deserve a \nresponse and further argument for getting past the motion to proceed \nand getting onto the bill. So if there are improvements that the \nSenator from Illinois and others think should be made to the bill, \noffer those amendments, debate them, vote on them. It could well be \nthat by the time we get to the end of this bill it would be in such a \nform that the Senator from Illinois might applaud and want to clear the \nSenate. Who knows.\n  But at the moment, what we are left with is a cloture motion which \nthe leader will later file on the motion to proceed in order to even \nget into a position to do anything beyond having an interesting back \nand forth conversation between the Senator from Illinois and myself and \nget beyond that and actually begin to offer amendments to the bill and \nhave debate on them and see where the votes may lie.\n  I think that pretty well covers my observations for today. We look \nforward to continuing the discussion tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \ninvitation to improve the bill. I believe it would be a better exercise \ndone in a committee setting with experts and witnesses and Senators \nhaving the opportunity to debate it openly and amend it and to include \nnot just changes to the rights of malpractice victims to recover, but \nalso the insurance industry and the medical profession. I think all of \nthose would make for a very constructive and important and timely \nundertaking which, unfortunately, we are not doing here.\n  This is a vote to bring this bill to the floor immediately, and to \nliterally debate it and pass it in a span of 3 or 4 weeks that we have \nleft before the August recess.\n  I might also add that California is often referred to in this debate. \nIt is true that in 1975 California passed a malpractice law which put \ncaps on the amount that individuals could recover from malpractice \nlawsuits. They have not changed that $250,000 cap in the interim. The \nactual value has been calculated. Because there has been some 28 years \nsince California put that in place, inflation has really taken its toll \non $250,000. Its value today is about $38,877.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \non that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If we indexed that amount under this bill, would the \nSenator then support the bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be open to the Senator bringing that in as an \noption, as long as we are dealing with honest figures and fair \ncompensation. But I would also say that in most States which have caps, \nthere are exceptions. For instance, in the State of Mississippi, there \nwere exceptions where judges could see extraordinary cases like the one \nI mentioned earlier and say that should not be subject to the caps. My \nproblem with California is it is a blanket cap.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree with the Senator from Illinois that some kind \nof inflation adjustment is an appropriate suggestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope the Senator also agrees with me that we ought to \nallow some exceptions to the cap. I don't want to put words in his \nmouth. But that is what I think. I think those exceptions should be \nallowed.\n  I would also say it is important to remember if there has been any \ncontainment of malpractice premiums in California, they also followed \nProposition 103 which is insurance reform. It is not just the \nlimitation on malpractice law that California has, but they passed \ninsurance reform. After that reform, we saw some changes in the amount \nthat was charged to physicians.\n  The last point I want to make is this: There has been talk that if we \ndon't do something about malpractice insurance, some doctors are forced \nto leave the State in which they are practicing. I don't doubt that is \na fact. I have spoken to doctors in Illinois in specialties in certain \nareas who are seriously considering leaving. I hope they don't have to. \nI hope we can do something here to avoid it.\n  But the fact is, in California there are indicators of significant \nphysician dissatisfaction with medical malpractice, and they have the \ncaps. There appears to be widespread problems recruiting physicians. \nOnly a third of California physicians would still choose to practice in \nCalifornia, if they had to do it over today.\n  To suggest that this is all about malpractice premiums and whether \nyou have a cap on how much victims of malpractice can recover, the \nCalifornia experience does not necessarily prove that.\n  Let me also say I would take exception--and we can debate this, I am\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\nsure--to my colleague's interpretations of the punitive damage section. \nIt is true there are two elements here for punitive damages. They are \nboth possibilities.\n  One is that the person who is being charged with malpractice has \nacted with ``malicious intent to injure the claimant.''\n  So that is an intentional act.\n  Then it goes on to say, ``or that such person deliberately failed to \navoid unnecessary injury that such person knew the claimant was \nsubstantially certain to suffer.''\n  I would say to my colleague from Kentucky and those who drafted this \nbill that is unusual wording, and wording I am not familiar with. I \nwould have to study that. But I think to talk about the deliberate act \nrises to intentional conduct again. The example I used was not a \ndeliberate act but the act of a doctor who was under the influence of \nalcohol or drugs who may have imbibed or taken drugs, and then in that \nstate of mind did a careless thing which resulted in medical \nmalpractice. Whether that is included in the phrase ``deliberately \nfailed to avoid unnecessary injury,'' I think is arguable. It should be \nclarified.\n  I also want to say in fairness to my friend from Kentucky, since \nKentucky and Illinois have been part of this debate, that a report of \nWednesday, August 9, 2000, in the Courier Journal noted that 329 \nphysicians had been disciplined in Kentucky for alcohol or drug abuse, \nincompetence, and other offenses from 1990-1999 according to a report \nissued on questionable doctors.\n  I might also say, Kentucky was ranked as one of the 10 best States in \n1999 in responding to this problem. I only raise that because, as \npainful as it is to concede by anyone, including those on the Senate \nfloor, and certainly those in the medical profession, there are, in \nfact, cases where individuals have been involved in alcohol and drug \nabuse and then involved in malpractice.\n  What I am hoping we can do, if we seriously want to deal with the \nmalpractice issue, is to go beyond limiting the amount that victims can \nrecover and bringing this conversation to how we police the ranks, so \ndoctors who are not doing the right thing are not going to continue to \ncommit malpractice. That isn't fair to the patients, and it certainly \nisn't fair to other members of their profession who end up paying \nhigher premiums as a result of it. I think that should be part of any \nlegitimate discussion that deals with this malpractice crisis.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Kentucky has yielded the \nfloor for the evening, and I am prepared now, for my side, to close the \ndebate on this matter and perhaps return to it tomorrow. At this point, \nuntil the Senate business is clear, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to talk \nspecifically about this debate but I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois for his excellent presentation today and for the work he \nhas already committed to with our colleague, Senator Graham, and others \nin an effort to try to resolve this matter and provide some meaningful \ndirection and leadership.\n  I am disappointed we find ourselves in the position we are in, both \nprocedurally as well as substantively--procedurally because this bill, \nobviously, has not had the benefit of committee consideration. The \nmajority leader, as is his right, brought it directly to the floor.\n  We have a model we used last year to resolve issues of controversy of \nthis nature, in particular the terrorism insurance bill. That bill was \nbrought to the floor after a significant degree of consultation and \ncooperation and, ultimately, negotiation. As a result of that \nnegotiation, even though the whole question of jury awards and issues \ninvolving tort reform were brought up--because there were some who \nargued that was the only way to resolve this issue involving terrorism \nand the problems of insurance related to terrorism--we passed the \nlegislation on a bipartisan basis.\n  If you ask anybody today in the industry, they will tell you that \ninsurance premiums have gone down dramatically. The terrorism insurance \nbill has worked. I would only hope that we could use a model such as \nthat with this issue as well. We can find legitimate, bipartisan, \nconstructive, substantive ways to deal with this issue.\n\n  There is no question this is a problem. There is no question that \nunless we address the problem successfully, it will become even more of \na problem, exacerbated by the month. So clearly we have to address it. \nThe question is how to address it.\n  If you look at independent analysis done over and over by studies--\nthe most recent, the Weiss study, issued about 3 weeks ago--those \nstudies have shown conclusively, and I would say almost unanimously, \nthat there is no connection between caps and reduced insurance \npremiums, none.\n  So we know we have to find a way to deal with the very legitimate \nproblem being faced today by physicians across the country. The \nquestion is how.\n  I give great credit to the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina and others who have tried to find a way to address this \nissue in a meaningful, effective, and, ultimately, bipartisan manner. I \nhope we can continue to work.\n  There is a problem on the other side as well. We want to relieve the \nproblem, financially, that doctors are facing but let us not forget \nthat we had reported by Health and Human Services that there were \napproximately 100,000 deaths due to malpractice last year. Mr. \nPresident, 100,000 people died due to mistakes made in the operating \nroom, in the hospital, in the clinic. I will talk more about this at a \nlater date but there are cases in South Dakota that are troubling.\n  So while we ought to be concerned with one side of this ledger, let \nus not forget the real problem that exists, as the Senator from \nIllinois has said so powerfully this afternoon, on the other side of \nthe ledger. Let's find that balance. I hope we can do that.\n  But the reason I oppose the motion to proceed is because we have not \nreally allowed the same opportunity that worked with terrorism \ninsurance to work here. If Senator Durbin and Senator Graham can work \ntogether to find some solution, you would think there could be other \nways with which we could use that terrorism model and truly find a \nconstructive, bipartisan solution to this issue.\n  Jamming this in the Senate, overriding the committee, and filing \ncloture on the motion to proceed is not the way to achieve some \nbipartisan consensus on a very legitimate issue. So we will vote in \nopposition to the motion to proceed, not because we do not want to \naddress the issue but because there is a better model if we are \nultimately going to find a solution. That is what it is we are trying \nto do. Let's use the model we established last year. I would hope we \ncould do that.\n  But we are spinning our wheels. We have 4 weeks in July, 4 weeks in \nSeptember, maybe a week or two in October--roughly 10 weeks to deal \nwith all the appropriations bills, all of the other issues that have \ncome before the Senate so far, a prescription drug bill, the child tax \ncredit legislation that is still languishing here, and an education \nbill that falls far short of even what the President said he would \ncommit with regard to resources.\n  We have a homeland security situation now, we are told by a report by \nSenators Rudman and Hart, that falls $98 billion short of where we need \nto be. One of the most stunning comments in that most recent report is \nthat there isn't a first responder in the country that will survive \ntoday a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack to respond in the first \nplace. That is right out of the report. So if we are serious about \ndealing with the Nation's issues, I hope we will not look at the \nideological agenda. I hope we will look at the real agenda.\n\n  I understand the President is going to be spending some time \ntraveling the country over the course of the next several days talking \nabout jobs. I hope he does. When we look at all the administrations, \nfrom the very first time we started looking at whether jobs were \ncreated or lost in any administration, you cannot find one--you cannot \nfind one--where in the first term of an\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\nadministration that administration was actually responsible for the \nloss of jobs, not the gain of jobs. We gained them in the Eisenhower \nadministration, the Kennedy administration, the Johnson administration, \nall through the 1980s and 1990s. This will be the first administration \nsince Herbert Hoover that has actually seen a net loss of jobs--so far \n3 million of those jobs in the first 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  So my point in raising these other issues is simply to say we have a \nlot of work to do. The more we spend time on ideological agendas and \nissues for which there has not been adequate committee consideration, \nmuch less an effort made by people on both sides of the aisle to \naddress them in a substantive way rather than in a political way, we \nare going to lose time and lose an opportunity to address these issues.\n  Mr. President, I know the majority leader came to the Senate floor \nearlier to talk about how unprecedented it is to consider the \npossibility of a filibuster on a judge. I go back to our record and I \nwill say we have broken all records with regard to the speedy \nconfirmation of judges. The New York Times again addressed it over the \nweekend.\n  Out of 134 judges considered so far under this administration, 132 \nhave been confirmed; 132 confirmed and 2 have not so far. But for the \nrecord I want to make sure people understand. Michael Gerhardt is one \nof the most respected analysts and experts with regard to the \nconstitutionality of advice and consent. I want to read one segment of \na speech he gave a few weeks ago. He talks about the historical \npractices of the constitutional right of advice and consent, especially \nas it applies to the rules of the Senate.\n  Obviously, we talk about rule XXII, and we are very cognizant of the \nimportance of Senate rules in this regard. Senate historical practice, \naccording to Mr. Gerhardt, goes back to the first recorded filibuster \nof a judge in 1881, to block President Hayes's nomination of Stanley \nMatthews to the Supreme Court. Numerous nominees before him were denied \nvotes by delay--in other words, they didn't come to the floor--which \nhas been a common practice for the 215 years the Senate has been \nmeeting. But on the very first occasion of a recorded filibuster, in \n1881, President Hayes's nomination was defeated; that being of Stanley \nMatthews.\n  From 1949 to the year 2002, 35 nominations were filibustered, 3 \nfatally, including Abe Fortas's nomination as Chief Justice. Seventeen \nof those thirty-five filibusters were of judicial nominations. From \n1968 to 2002, Republicans filibustered against 19 Presidential \nnominations. So these historical practices weigh heavily in support, of \ncourse, of the constitutionality in addition to the language itself.\n  That really doesn't tell the whole story: Thirty-five nominations, \nseventeen filibustered against judicial nominations by Republicans \nsince 1968. But the other story is the 65 nominations filibustered by 1 \nperson in the committee, not on the floor. Sixty-five nominations \nfailed to come out of the Judiciary Committee because of a hold \nrespected by the majority leader at the time or by a committee \nchairman. Ten had hearings. Fifty-five did not. Sixty-five nominations \ndied before they could even be considered by the Senate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  You have 35 nominations which came to the floor, 17 of which were \njudicial, all of which were filibustered, the 17 by Republicans, but 65 \ndidn't even have the opportunity to come to the Senate floor for even a \nvote on cloture.\n  I want to make sure the record, as the majority leader discussed the \nissue earlier today, is complete with regard to judicial nominations as \nwell.\n  Again, I go back to my hope that we can look back on those occasions \nwhen we actually succeeded at addressing a real problem and how it was \nwe did so. We succeeded with terrorism insurance because people such as \nDick Durbin and Mitch McConnell and others sat down and negotiated and \nultimately came to a resolution that solved a problem, solved it \nalmost, I would say today, by acclamation. Nobody would differ with \nthat assertion that we have solved, at least for now, the issue on \nterrorism insurance, even though it had many of the same questions \ninvolving it that we are dealing with today regarding malpractice.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I hope we can address education and jobs \nand prescription drugs and the child tax credit and homeland security, \nnot to mention energy and a lot of other issues that have to be \naddressed in the month before we leave. We can spend our time more \nproductively. I hope that realization will be one that will be accepted \nby our Republican colleagues sooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me make a few observations about \nthe record of the Senate this year. This year, the Senate had to \ncomplete 11 of last year's appropriations bills. There were only 13 \nthat were supposed to pass the basic work of the Government. This \nSenate had to come back and approve last year's work that was never \ndone, 11 of the 13 appropriation bills. Last year, for the first time \nsince the Budget Act was enacted in the early 1970s, there was no \nbudget. The Senate never passed a budget. This year, the Senate enacted \na budget.\n  It is important to note that this year's Senate has also enacted the \nPresident's growth package which included the third largest tax cut in \nAmerican history. And just before the recently completed recess, the \nSenate completed a bill modernizing and preserving Medicare and adding \na prescription drug benefit for our seniors, an issue that had \nlanguished over the last three or four Congresses with no action.\n  This has been an extraordinarily productive first part of the first \nsession of the 108th Congress, one of which we all have a right to be \nproud. We are moving forward to complete the agenda for the American \npeople.\n  The measure we are considering today, or hoping to consider in the \ncourse of the week, the medical liability crisis, is a major part of \ntrying to do what we need to do to make life better for the American \npeople.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion on the \nhealth care crisis that exists because of our medical liability system. \nIt is an issue we began talking about 4 hours ago, and it is an issue \nthat does affect every single American. I have been very pleased in \nlistening to the debate with the wide range of issues that have been \ndiscussed. For those who have listened, I think the debate today \nprovides a very effective beginning of a debate the American people \ndeserve and the American people expect.\n  Much of the discussion today has been about procedure and the fact \nthat we are moving to proceed with a discussion of this bill on the \nSenate floor. Although we can argue procedure back and forth, what we \nare trying to do is respond to a health care crisis that is real. The \ncrisis affects not just doctors and providers in health care today but \ndoes, in effect, have an impact on every American, whether it is \nthrough being beneficiaries of our Government program, Medicare, \nMedicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, or through the \nprivate sector, or even for those who have no insurance today.\n  I will outline a little bit about how every American is affected and \nwhy it is a bill that is important to every State and every citizen in \nevery State.\n  Medical malpractice premiums, as we reviewed over the course of the \nday, have skyrocketed in recent years. So it is a problem we have been \nable to identify for a period of time. A lot of people will date the \ndebate back to the mid-1970s when MICRA, or the health care medical \nliability refrom that was put forth in California, was first passed and \nthen implemented. It is an issue that in States which have not \naddressed the problem that is growing and is growing rapidly. We see \naccess to doctors being threatened, especially for women, and I will \ncome back to that particular point. Especially in rural areas, we see \nthis access to care being threatened, and this is why it is a crisis. \nAccess to care is being totally taken away in certain regions of the \ncountry. The AMA has a chart to be brought out, I am sure, in the next \nday or so that depicts\n\n[[Page S8891]]\n\nthose States which are in crisis. Since we last talked about some of \nthese issues on the Senate floor, the number of States in crisis, where \naccess to health care is threatened, has grown and grown dramatically.\n  Every American should participate in this debate. We hear the \nanecdotes. We see the trauma centers closing down. If one talks to \ntheir doctor or if my colleagues would talk to their doctors, or if the \npeople who are listening talk to their doctors, they know it is a real \nproblem and challenge that is increasing every day.\n  The situation is grave now. The crisis is there. It is getting worse \nand thus we bring the bill to the floor of the Senate for open debate. \nOnce we get to the bill, it will be open for amendment where we can \ndiscuss these issues before the American people.\n  The horror stories are there. The headlines are there. Hospitals are \nclosing labor wards, delivery units, obstetric units. We see the trauma \ncenters that have either threatened to close or have actually closed. \nWe hear the stories of the expectant mothers who are unable to find \nobstetricians. Doctors, especially orthopedic doctors, bone doctors, \nwho often are in a high-risk specialty, are the ones who are involved \nmost often in trauma centers. We see the specialties, neurosurgeons, as \nwell as orthopedists and obstetricians, all high-risk specialities, \ntreating the very sick in many cases, leaving their States. If they are \nin a high-risk State with skyrocketing premiums, they are often moving \nto a low-risk State. In the case of obstetricians, they are leaving the \npractice of specializing in the delivery of children and stopping the \ndelivery of children totally. There are neurosurgeons who are no longer \nsigning up to take trauma calls or work in trauma centers because of \nthe risk of being sued. The headlines go on.\n  What I really want to stress as a physician, because I talk to my \ncolleagues on a regular basis about this issue, the problem is getting \nworse, and getting worse by the day.\n\n  Time Magazine, June 9, the cover article--actually, I did not see \nTime when it came out but have gone back to look at that particular \nfront page cover and then the articles behind it. They talk about this \nproblem in very real terms.\n  I do encourage people, if they are unfamiliar with the debate, to go \nback and read the stories, the anecdotes, about what is happening \naround the country.\n  A year ago last July, when we talked about a particular amendment my \ndistinguished colleague from Kentucky had offered and we debated the \nissue, there were 12 States that were in crisis according to criteria \nused by the American Medical Association. That number went from 12 \nStates to 13, to 14, to 16, and 19. Now it is 19 States. Seven \nadditional States have reached that threshold of being in crisis level.\n  Crisis level means that premiums are skyrocketing. There are \nincreasing numbers of frivolous lawsuits, but that translates now to \nworse access, greater barriers to access, to everybody. All the \ncitizens of that crisis State are harmed in the event there is a trauma \naccident, in the event somebody needs to see a neurosurgeon or somebody \nneeds to see an orthopedic surgeon or somebody is going to have a baby \ndelivered. That is really the simple reason why we need to bring this \nlegislation to the floor now. We should not be blocking proceeding to \nthis very important bill.\n  As a physician, this crisis is something I am close to because I \nwatch what it is doing to my colleagues. These colleagues have chosen \nto go into this profession which is very special. I have a bias, but it \nis very special because they can go in and can heal, prevent disease, \nand people can live a better quality of life, day in, day out. That is \nwhy people go into the profession of medicine.\n  Yet as we talk to doctors today, many will say--and this is very \ndifferent than 15 or 20 years ago--that the greatest threat to their \nbeing able to continue in this healing profession is this skyrocketing \nescalation of malpractice premiums. They are being forced to pay for \nwhat ends up being a lot of frivolous lawsuits. These lawsuits are \nengendered or occur because the current system, which needs to be \nreformed, gives incentives to those trial lawyers--not all trial \nlawyers--to go out and stir up business. I think that is what is most \noffensive to the American people, that a component of our liability \nsystem is unnecessarily driving up the numbers of lawsuits which in \nturn is diminishing access to health care. Driving up the cost of \nhealth care, which we all know, makes it more difficult for people to \nreceive the care they deserve.\n  The fact that highly qualified and committed health care providers \nare being literally driven from the field they entered so they would \nhave that opportunity to heal and to make others' lives better, is \ntragic. These individuals do not want to drop these vital services. \nThey do not want to leave the specialities they spent years to develop, \nwhether it is obstetrics, neurosurgery, or trauma surgery. They do not \nwant to have to walk away from these fields. They do not want to have \nto leave underserved areas where this problem can be particularly bad.\n\n  Tomorrow or once we get on the bill, I will bring letters to the \nSenate from physicians writing if they worked in, say, the Appalachian \nMountains. In underserved areas or rural areas, they are being hit \nparticularly hard because they are having to pay these skyrocketing \npremiums, going from $20,000 to $40,000 to 60,000 to $80,000. They \nsimply cannot stay in business. They cannot afford paying an $80,000 or \n$100,000 premium for malpractice insurance. Without the insurance, they \ncannot ``go bare'' because then if they do get sued, it destroys their \nlivelihood and any chance of practicing medicine in the future.\n  The crisis is made real by the victims themselves. I hope the \nopponents of the underlying reform measure, or even those people who \nare saying, now is not the time to be addressing this in the Senate--I \nhope they look at those anecdotes, those individual stories now which, \nwhen accumulated in the aggregate, have reached crisis proportion. I \nhope they will agree that there is a crisis and now is the time to \nrespond.\n  The medical liability system is the root cause of this crisis. It is \nthe perverse incentives we need to address and that this underlying \nbill, when we are allowed to go to the bill, does address. The current \nsystem, with the inefficiencies, with the perverse incentives, hurts \nevery American. In addition, it hurts the negligently injured patients \nit is supposed to help.\n  The good news is there is something to be done about the problem to \nmake the system more fair, more just, to get rid of the waste and \nfrivolous lawsuits. That is what the underlying bill does.\n  Our system encourages lawsuit abuse in lots of different ways, in \npart, by rewarding personal injury lawyers who file huge claims in \nfriendly venues, looking for that big payday. These lawyers often keep \nup to 40 percent--I think the least is probably around 30 percent or 33 \npercent. They keep up to 40 percent of many of the settlements or \nverdicts of those injured. If there is a million-dollar verdict, for \nexample, in some States the personal injury lawyer, the trial lawyer, \npockets 40 percent, or $400,000, and the injured patient gets only \n$600,000.\n  At the same time, negligently injured patient many times don't \nreceive any compensation at all. They are never addressed because the \npersonal injury lawyers go after the big bucks, the big pockets, the \nlarge lawsuits. When one is negligently injured and should be \nappropriately compensated, the personal injury lawyers are not there to \naddress their particular needs. Again, they are going after the big \npockets, the big sum. We have a system that compensates the few all too \noften at the expense of the many.\n  The effect of these suits is staggering. Between 1996 and 2002, the \naverage jury award in medical liability cases jumped 83 percent. \nBetween 1997 and 2002, over that 5-year period, the percentage of \nmedical malpractice payments of more than $1 million more than doubled. \nAgain, this illustrates that the problem we have in this system is \ngetting worse by the day.\n  The mere threat of these huge, multimillion-dollar awards forces many \ndoctors and many insurance companies to settle cases for large amounts \neven if that individual physician is not guilty. The incentive is to \nsettle, simply to avoid the exorbitant suit, even if there is no guilt \ninvolved.\n\n  We will show charts in the Senate that most of the cases filed in the \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\ncourts are without merit. The most recent statistics showed that two \nout of three, or 67 percent, of those cases filed in U.S. courts are \nbeing dismissed or being dropped--not being settled and not actually \ngoing to trial. In addition, only 7 percent of cases actually go to \ntrial, and a staggering 85 percent of those cases are won by the \ndefendant.\n  So these numbers are clear evidence of the abuse of the current \nsystem, of the inefficiencies, of the number of lawsuits that are \nfrivolous. It is that waste, those inefficiencies, those disincentives, \nthose perverse incentives that this legislation addresses.\n  Frivolous lawsuits are unnecessarily driving up the premiums to \nphysicians. For the most part, for the physician to stay in business \nwith those premiums, skyrocketing premiums, increasing 10, 15, 20, 30, \n40 percent a year, if that physician is to stay in business, those \ncosts must be passed on to those patients directly.\n  It should be no surprise that the excessive litigation and frivolous \nlawsuits are forcing these malpractice premiums up. In 2002, physicians \nin many States did see their rates rise by 30 percent or more. In some \nStates, and in some specialties, malpractice insurance premiums are \nrising by as much as 300 percent a year.\n  In New York and Florida, obstetricians, gynecologists, and surgeons \npay more than $100,000 for every $1 million in coverage. Soon the \nannual premium these doctors pay could reach more than $200,000.\n  I mentioned earlier that the sky-high premiums uniquely affect women. \nThis will be heard again and again in the Chamber. One of the three \nhigh-risk specialties is obstetrics. Many obstetricians are leaving the \npractice, leaving obstetrics, and are involved just in the practice of \ngynecology or family practice because they cannot afford the premiums. \nRight now, nearly 1 out of 11 obstetricians no longer deliver babies. \nWho can blame them? If you ask why, again and again it comes back to \nthis threat of these frivolous lawsuits.\n  It is a tax that affects women in many ways disproportionately. If an \nobstetrician today pays $100,000 for premiums--and that is not \nunusual--say they deliver 100 babies. That is a $1,000 tax that has \nnothing to do with the health care that is actually delivered or the \ndelivery itself, but it is a $1,000 tax that, in effect, is placed \nright on top of the delivery of that baby. Thus, if you are a woman and \nyou have a family, you need to realize that the doctor is having to pay \nthat $1,000 tax on each baby delivered. This cost is ultimately passed \non to the patient.\n  This is clearly unacceptable because it reflects the waste, the \nperverse incentives in the system, all of which, again, can be fixed.\n  Again, women living in rural areas are disproportionately affected \nand are even more threatened by the current system.\n  In a June 9 front-page issue of Time magazine, there is one tragic \nstory of an expectant mother in rural Arizona having to drive more than \n2 hours on a desolate desert highway just to see a doctor. That is not \nthe sort of story that should be happening in America, especially when \nwe have physicians who want to stay in obstetrics, who want to practice \nin rural areas. However, they are being discouraged from doing so by \nthe current system of medical liability.\n  If anything, the incentives should be just the opposite. We should be \nencouraging physicians to deliver this care to women. We ought to \nencourage them to go to these underserved areas which are being \ndisproportionately affected.\n  It should be no surprise that the American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecology is one of the strongest supporters of meaningful medical \nliability reform. They are uniquely positioned to understand the threat \nthat the current system places on women. They are demanding action by \nCongress. I do urge my colleagues to listen to their unique concerns.\n  The broken liability system does more than just raise the liability \npremiums on individual physicians. It adds tremendous costs, both \ndirect and indirect, throughout the health care system. We have all \nheard of what is called defensive medicine and the increase in \ndefensive medicine that is, indeed, practiced because of the fear, the \nlegitimate fear, of these outrageous and skyrocketing lawsuits. To \navoid lawsuits or to make sure that they are protected as a physician \nif there happens to be one of these lawsuits, physicians will simply \norder more tests, establish more of a paper trail.\n  You think of the case of a simple headache. With defensive medicine, \nfor a headache coming into the emergency room, a physician might just \norder, instead of a good physical exam and maybe some medicine, simple \ndiagnostic tests. With defensive medicine we might go to the extreme of \na CAT scan that might cost $800 or magnetic resonance imaging, an MRI \nof the head, which might cost $1,000. Why? Because people are at risk \nif they are in emergency rooms, treating somebody who comes to the \ndoor, even for something as simple as a headache. You do that, not just \nonce or twice but hundreds of times, indeed thousands of times all \nacross the United States of America--again, driven by the incentive of \nfrivolous lawsuits being directed against you--and all of a sudden you \ncan understand why these defensive medicine costs tens of billions \nevery year.\n  Recent surveys show that 75 percent or more of doctors acknowledge \npracticing defensive medicine. The exact cost is hard to calculate, but \nwe do know it is tens of billions of dollars per year. When we realize \nthat three out of four doctors are practicing defensive medicine, those \nnumbers seem to be very realistic.\n  In an authoritative study out of Stanford, two researchers there \nestimated that reasonable liability reform could save the country \nanywhere from $70 billion a year to $126 billion a year in defensive \nmedicine expenditures; that is overall defensive medicine. If you look \njust at what the Federal Government could save by comprehensive medical \nliability reform, the Congressional Budget Office estimates about $18 \nbillion a year could be saved over 10 years with such reform. They are \nlooking at just the Medicare Program and the Medicaid Program and the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  Often in the Chamber today, a lot of people have talked about this \nissue of medical errors and patient safety. I think a lot of good \npoints have been brought up in the Chamber. It is absolutely critical \nthat we do address the issue of reporting of medical errors.\n  I will have to say, just listening to physicians and having been in \nthe field of medicine myself, the current system where you know that \nanything you say, in terms of even a possible medical error or mistake \ncould result in a lawsuit is unacceptable. If they are there, you need \nto shine a light on them, you need to elevate them, you need to talk \namong your peers and talk among others; that is the only way you are \ngoing to fix and reduce these medical errors.\n  But when above your health care system you do have some predatory \nlawyers who are sitting there looking for the big bucks, recognizing \nthey are going to take home 30 percent or 40 percent of a settlement it \ndiscourages that light that we all know is critically important to \nallow a discussion, to allow a self-examination so you can have a \nsystem of ongoing, continuous quality improvement in health care.\n\n  In the Chamber, people have referred and will continue to refer to \nthe report of 3 years ago by the Institute of Medicine, ``To Err Is \nHuman.'' A lot of these issues are talked about there. That is why I am \na strong supporter of the patient safety legislation that has been \ndeveloped by Senators Gregg and Jeffords and many others in a \nbipartisan way, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. That \nneeds to be done. That needs to be addressed. But at the same time, by \nimproving in a comprehensive way our medical liability system, we will \nactually improve the system itself. That will allow light to shine \nopenly with, I believe, a lot more discussion and self-reporting by the \nprovider system in order to have that quality improvement.\n  It is an inefficient system that we have today. It does waste tens of \nbillions of dollars. It does drive underground, I believe, our ability \nto improve patient safety. Thus, comprehensive reform of our medical \nliability system is, I believe, demanded. This bill, the Patients First \nAct, is a commonsense measure. It does restore a balance to the system \nitself. It protects the right of the negligently injured patient to sue \nfor just compensation while at the same time curtailing the abuses that \nwe know currently exist in our system--today. It has a number of\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\ncritical components. I will look forward, once we get on the bill \nitself, to talking about a number of those components.\n  I am delighted with the debate thus far. I look forward to continued \nparticipation on this important bill. We have seen at the State level \nthat liability reform can work. This particular bill we are trying to \nbring to the floor is a bill based on the MICRA system, Medical Injury \nand Compensation Reform Act that was passed in California in the mid-\n1970s. We know that is a big State. It has a high cost of living. Yet \nthe overall premiums paid by physicians there have been much more \ncontrolled than in other parts of the country. MICRA works. We have \nthat track record. We have that to look back to. That is why I feel so \ngood about the legislation we will hopefully bring to the floor.\n  There will be lots of blame passed around in terms of why the system \ntoday is not working. Some people say it is the doctors. Some people \nsay it is hospitals. Others will say it is the insurance companies. \nSome people say the stock market and the bond market. We will have this \ncrisis blamed on lots of different things as we go forward. I would \nargue that at the heart of the crisis is the current liability system \nwhich promotes these excessive lawsuits, and that it can be fixed. It \ncan be fixed. That is what I look forward to doing with my colleagues \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Passage of this measure will help on both the access issues in health \ncare as well as the expense issues for all Americans. If we do it, and \nwe do it right, it will improve health care for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/07/senate-section/article/S8893-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRUCE E.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I thank my colleagues and \nthe clerical staff awaiting my arrival from the customary Monday travel \nday from Philadelphia to Scranton to Harrisburg to Washington. For \nthose who may be about to venture onto the Baltimore Washington \nParkway, the traffic is very heavy indeed. Although when I arrived in \nthe Senate Chamber and I saw active debate, I am not quite sure my late \narrival has caused too much inconvenience.\n  I support legislation which would address the serious problems faced \ntoday by doctors, hospitals and other medical professionals and at the \nsame time provide balance to treat fairly people who are injured in the \ncourse of medical treatment.\n  While most of the attention has been directed to medical malpractice \nverdicts, the issues are much broader, involving medical errors, \ninsurance company investments and administrative practices.\n  I support caps on noneconomic damages so long as they do not apply to \nsituations like the paperwork mix-up leading to the erroneous double \nmastectomy of a woman or the recent death of a 17-year-old woman on a \nNorth Carolina transplant case where there was a faulty blood test.\n  An appropriate standard for cases not covered could be analogous \nprovisions in Pennsylvania law which limit actions against governmental \nentities or in the limited tort context which exclude death, serious \nimpairment of bodily function, and permanent disfigurement or \ndismemberment.\n  Beyond the issue of caps, I believe there could be savings on the \ncost of medical malpractice insurance by eliminating frivolous cases by \nrequiring plaintiffs to file with the court a certification by a doctor \nin the field that it is an appropriate case to bring to court. This \nproposal, which is now part of Pennsylvania State procedure, would be \nexpanded federally, thus reducing claims and saving costs. While most \nmalpractice cases are won by defendants, the high cost of litigation \ndrives up malpractice premiums. The proposed certification would reduce \nplaintiff's joinder of peripheral defendants and cut defense costs.\n  Further savings could be accomplished through patient safety \ninitiatives identified in the report of the Institute of Medicine.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine--IOM--issued a report \nentitled: To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System. The IOM \nReport estimated that anywhere between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized \nAmericans die each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However, \nonly a fraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence; \nmost errors are caused by system failures. The IOM issued a \ncomprehensive set of recommendations, including the establishment of a \nnationwide, mandatory reporting system; incorporation of patient safety \nstandards in regulatory and accreditation programs; and the development \nof a non-punitive culture of safety in health care organizations. The \nreport called for a 50 percent reduction in medical errors over 5 \nyears.\n  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education, which I chair, held three\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nhearings to discuss the IOM's findings and explore ways to implement \nthe recommendations outlined in the IOM report. The FY 2001 Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill contained $50 million for a patient safety \ninitiative and directed the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality--AHRQ--to develop guidelines on the collection of uniform error \ndata; establish a competitive demonstration program to test best \npractices; and research ways to improve provider training. In Fiscal \nYear 2002 and Fiscal Year 2003, $55 million was included to continue \nthese initiatives. We are awaiting a report, scheduled to be issued in \nSeptember by the Department of Health and Human Services, which will \ndetail the results of the patient safety initiative.\n  There is evidence that increases in insurance premiums have been \ncaused, at least in part, by insurance company losses, the declining \nstock market of the past several years, and the general rate-setting \npractices of the industry. As a matter of insurance company \ncalculations, premiums are collected and invested to build up an \ninsurance reserve where there is considerable lag time between the \npayment of the premium and litigation which results in a verdict or \nsettlement. When the stock market has gone down, for example, that has \nresulted in insufficient funding to pay claims and the attendant \nincrease in insurance premiums. A similar result occurred in Texas on \nhomeowners' insurance where cost and availability of insurance became \nan issue because companies lost money in the market and could not cover \nthe insured losses on hurricanes.\n\n  In structuring legislation to put caps on jury verdicts, due regard \nshould be given to the history and development of trial by jury under \nthe common law where reliance is placed on average men and women who \ncomprise a jury to reach a just result reflecting the values and views \nof the community.\n  Jury trials in modern tort cases descend from the common law jury in \ntrespass, which was drawn from and intended to be representative of the \naverage members of the community in which the alleged trespass \noccurred. This coincides with the incorporation of negligence standards \nof liability into trespass actions.\n  This ``representative'' jury right in civil actions was protected by \nconsensus among the state drafters of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of \nRights. The explicit trial by jury safeguards in the Seventh Amendment \nto the Constitution were adaptations of these common law concepts \nharmonized with the Sixth Amendment's clause that local juries be used \nin criminal trials. Thus, from its inception at common law through its \ninclusion in the Bill of Rights and today, the jury in tort/negligence \ncases is meant to be representative of the judgment of average members \nof the community--not of elected representatives.\n  The right to have a jury decide one's damages has been greatly \ncircumscribed in recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court. \nAn example is the analysis that the Court has recently applied to limit \npunitive damage awards.\n  In recent cases, the Court has shifted its Seventh Amendment focus \naway from 2 centuries of precedent in deciding that federal appellate \nreview of punitive damage awards will be decided on a de novo basis and \nthat a jury's determination of punitive damages is not a finding of \nfact for purposes of the re-examination clause of the Seventh Amendment \nwhich provides that ``no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-\nexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules \nof the common law''. Then, earlier this year, the Court reasoned that \nany ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages greater than 9/1 \nwill likely be considered unreasonable and disproportionate, and thus \nconstitute an unconstitutional deprivation of property in non-personal \ninjury cases. Plaintiffs will inevitably face a vastly increased burden \nto justify a greater ratio, and appellate courts have far greater \nlatitude to disallow or reduce such an award.\n  These decisions may have already, in effect, placed caps on some jury \nverdicts in medical malpractice cases which may involve punitive \ndamages.\n  Consideration of the many complex issues on the Senate floor on the \npending legislation will obviously be very difficult in the absence of \na markup in committee or the submission of a committee report and a \ncommittee bill.\n  The pending bill is the starting point for analysis, discussion, \ndebate, and possible amendment. I am prepared to proceed with the \ncaveat that there is much work to be done before the Senate would be \nready, in my opinion, for consideration of final passage.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the desk on \nthe pending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this moment \nto pay tribute to Art Stephenson, former Director of NASA's Marshall \nSpace Flight Center.\n  Mr. Stephenson joined Marshall in 1998, and has overseen the Center's \nwork on critical NASA initiatives such as development of new reusable \nlaunch vehicles, Space Shuttle propulsion, advanced space \ntransportation systems, research in microgravity, and science payload \noperations aboard the International Space Station, as well as the \nlaunch and continuing successful operation of the Chandra X-ray \nObservatory. Under his guidance the National Space Science Technology \nCenter, a NASA partnership with local universities conducting cutting-\nedge propulsion research, was established and ground was broken for the \ncritical Propulsion Research Laboratory.\n  For his exceptional contributions to the space program and the \nnation, Art Stephenson has been recognized with the NASA Outstanding \nLeadership Medal, the NASA Group Achievement Award, and the NASA \nExceptional Achievement Medal. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary \ndoctorate by The University of Alabama System and was selected by the \nAmerican Society for Engineering Management as the 2001 Engineering \nManager of the Year. In 2002, he received the Career Achievement Award \nfrom the University of Redland, CA. Most recently, he was selected as \nthe 2003 Martin Luther King Jr. Unity Award recipient by the \nHuntsville, AL, chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. He also \nreceived the 2003 Community Service Award from Oakwood College in \nHuntsville, AL.\n  The multiple honors and awards Art received are an indication of his \ndevotion to our country and his dedication to NASA. Without question, \nArt Stephenson is a man of honor and ability, and I would like to add \nmy thanks to those provided by so many others. His work has been given \nto the success of the NASA programs and he has done so without ever \nseeking personal gain or glory. I have been extraordinarily impressed \nwith his integrity and commitment to service.\n  The State of Alabama, NASA, and the nation are immensely proud of \nArt's service. He will be missed by his colleagues at Marshall Space \nFlight Center and those at NASA Headquarters. Our Nation owes a great \ndeal to the Stephenson family. Art's vision pushed us all toward the \nultimate goal of space exploration. His vision and that goal are both \nworth noting today, and I am pleased to bring them to the attention of \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/07/senate-section/article/S8895-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/07/senate-section/article/S8895-5", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/07/senate-section/article/S8895-6", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 7, 2003, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on June 30, 2003, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills and joint \nresolution:\n\n       H.R. 2350.

From \n     1991 through 2003, payment rates for physicians and health \n     professionals fell 14 percent behind practice cost inflation \n     as measured by medicare's own conservative estimates.\n       (4) The sustainable growth rate (SGR) expenditure target, \n     which is the basis for the physician payment update, is \n     linked to the gross domestic product and penalizes physicians \n     and other practitioners for volume increases that they cannot \n     control and that the government actively promotes through new \n     coverage decisions, quality improvement activities, and other \n     initiatives that, while beneficial to patients, are not \n     reflected in the SGR.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that medicare beneficiary access to quality care may be \n     compromised if Congress does not take action to prevent cuts \n     in 2004 and the following years that result from the SGR \n     formula.\n\n  TITLE V--MEDICARE APPEALS, REGULATORY, AND CONTRACTING IMPROVEMENTS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Regulatory Reform\n\n     SEC. 501.

HEALTH CARE THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS-CITIZENS \n                   HEALTH CARE WORKING GROUP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to improve the health care system, the \n     American public must engage in an informed national public \n     debate to make choices about the services they want covered, \n     what health care coverage they want, and how they are willing \n     to pay for coverage.\n       (2) More than a trillion dollars annually is spent on the \n     health care system, yet--\n       (A) 41,000,000 Americans are uninsured;\n       (B) insured individuals do not always have access to \n     essential, effective services to improve and maintain their \n     health; and\n       (C) employers, who cover over 170,000,000 Americans, find \n     providing coverage increasingly difficult because of rising \n     costs and double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Despite increases in medical care spending that are \n     greater than the rate of inflation, population growth, and \n     Gross Domestic Product growth, there has not been a \n     commensurate improvement in our health status as a nation.\n       (4) Health care costs for even just 1 member of a family \n     can be catastrophic, resulting in medical bills potentially \n     harming the economic stability of the entire family.\n       (5) Common life occurrences can jeopardize the ability of a \n     family to retain private coverage or jeopardize access to \n     public coverage.\n       (6) Innovations in health care access, coverage, and \n     quality of care, including the use of technology, have often \n     come from States, local communities, and private sector \n     organizations, but more creative policies could tap this \n     potential.\n       (7) Despite our Nation's wealth, the health care system \n     does not provide coverage to all Americans who want it.\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide for a nationwide public debate about \n     improving the health care system to provide every American \n     with the ability to obtain quality, affordable health care \n     coverage; and\n       (2) to provide for a vote by Congress on the \n     recommendations that result from the debate.\n       (c) Establishment.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, shall establish \n     an entity to be known as the Citizens' Health Care Working \n     Group (referred to in this Act as the ``Working Group'').\n       (d) Appointment.--Not later than 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives and the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader of the Senate (in this section referred to as the \n     ``leadership'') shall each appoint individuals to serve as \n     members of the Working Group in accordance with subsections \n     (e), (f), and (g).\n       (e) Membership Criteria.--\n       (1) Appointed members.--\n       (A) Separate appointments.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives jointly with the Minority Leader of the House \n     of Representatives, and the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     jointly with the Minority Leader of the Senate, shall each \n     appoint 1 member of the Working Group described in \n     subparagraphs (A), (G), (J), (K), and (M) of paragraph (2).\n       (B) Joint appointments.--Members of the Working Group \n     described in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (I), and \n     (N) of paragraph (2) shall be appointed jointly by the \n     leadership.\n       (C) Combined appointments.--Members of the Working Group \n     described in subparagraphs (H) and (L) shall be appointed in \n     the following manner:\n       (i) One member of the Working Group in each of such \n     subparagraphs shall be appointed jointly by the leadership.\n       (ii) The remaining appointments of the members in each of \n     such subparagraphs shall be divided equally such that the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives jointly with the \n     Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate jointly with the Minority \n     Leader of the Senate each appoint an equal number of members.\n       (2) Categories of appointed members.--Members of the \n     Working Group shall be appointed as follows:\n       (A) 2 members shall be patients or family members of \n     patients who, at least 1 year prior to the date of enactment \n     of this Act, have had no health insurance.\n       (B) 1 member shall be a representative of children.\n       (C) 1 member shall be a representative of the mentally ill.\n       (D) 1 member shall be a representative of the disabled.\n       (E) 1 member shall be over the age of 65 and a beneficiary \n     under the medicare program established under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (F) 1 member shall be a recipient of benefits under the \n     medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n       (G) 2 members shall be State health officials.\n       (H) 3 members shall be employers, including--\n       (i) 1 large employer (an employer who employed 50 or more \n     employees on business days during the preceding calendar year \n     and who employed at least 50 employees on the first of the \n     year);\n       (ii) 1 small employer (an employer who employed an average \n     of at least 2 employees but less than 50 employees on \n     business days in the preceding calendar year and who employs \n     at least 2 employees on the first of the year);

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING MEDICARE PAYMENT \n                   UPDATE FOR PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH \n                   PROFESSIONALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The formula by which medicare payments are updated each \n     year for services furnished by physicians and other health \n     professionals is fundamentally flawed.\n       (2) The flawed physician payment update formula is causing \n     a continuing physician payment crisis, and, without \n     congressional action, medicare payment rates for physicians \n     and other practitioners are predicted to fall by 4.2 percent \n     in 2004.\n       (3) A physician payment cut in 2004 would be the fifth cut \n     since 1991, and would be on top of a 5.4 percent cut in 2002, \n     with additional cuts estimated for 2005, 2006, and 2007; from \n     1991-2003, payment rates for physicians and health \n     professionals fell 14 percent behind practice cost inflation \n     as measured by medicare's own conservative estimates.\n       (4) The sustainable growth rate (SGR) expenditure target, \n     which is the basis for the physician payment update, is \n     linked to the gross domestic product and penalizes physicians \n     and other practitioners for volume increases that they cannot \n     control and that the Government actively promotes through new \n     coverage decisions, quality improvement activities and other \n     initiatives that, while beneficial to patients, are not \n     reflected in the SGR.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that medicare beneficiary access to quality care may be \n     compromised if Congress does not take action to prevent cuts \n     next year and the following that result from the SGR formula.\n\n     SEC. 623.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE STRUCTURE OF \n                   MEDICARE REFORM AND THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's seniors deserve a fiscally-strong medicare \n     system that fulfills its promise to them and future retirees.\n       (2) The impending retirement of the ``baby boom'' \n     generation will dramatically increase the costs of providing \n     medicare benefits. Medicare costs will double relative to the \n     size of the economy from 2 percent of GDP today to 4 percent \n     in 2025 and double again to 8 percent of GDP in 2075. This \n     growth will accelerate substantially when Congress adds a \n     necessary prescription drug benefit.\n       (3) Medicare's current structure does not have the \n     flexibility to quickly adapt to rapid advances in modern \n     health care. Medicare lags far behind other insurers in \n     providing prescription drug coverage, disease management \n     programs, and host of other advances. Reforming medicare to \n     create a more self-adjusting, innovative structure is \n     essential to improve medicare's efficiency and the quality of \n     the medical care it provides.\n       (4) Private-sector choice for medicare beneficiaries would \n     provide two key benefits: It would be tailored to the needs \n     of America's seniors, not the Government, and would create a \n     powerful incentive for private-sector medicare plans to \n     provide the best quality health care to seniors at the most \n     affordable price.\n       (5) The method by which the national preferred provider \n     organizations in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program have been reimbursed has proven to be a reliable and \n     successful mechanism for providing Members of Congress and \n     Federal employees with excellent health care choices.\n       (6) Unlike the medicare payment system, which has had to be \n     changed by Congress every few years, the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program has existed for 43 years with minimal \n     changes from Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that medicare reform legislation should:\n       (1) Ensure that prescription drug coverage is directed to \n     those who need it most.\n       (2) Provide that Government contributions used to support \n     MedicareAdvantage plans are based on market principles \n     beginning in 2006 to ensure the long- and short-term \n     viability of such options for America's seniors.\n       (3) Develop a payment system for the MedicareAdvantage \n     preferred provider organizations similar to the payment \n     system used for the national preferred provider organizations \n     in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n       (4) Limit the addition of new unfunded obligations in the \n     medicare program so that the long-term solvency of this \n     important program is not further jeopardized.\n       (5) Incorporate private sector, market-based elements, that \n     do not rely on the inefficient medicare price control \n     structure.\n       (6) Keep the cost of structural changes and new benefits \n     within the $400,000,000,000 provided for under the current \n     Congressional Budget Resolution for implementing medicare \n     reform and providing a prescription drug benefit.\n       (7) Preserve the current employer-sponsored retiree health \n     plans and not design a benefit which has the unintended \n     consequences of supplanting private coverage.\n       (8) Incorporate regulatory reform proposals to eliminate \n     red tape and reduce costs.\n       (9) Restore the right of medicare beneficiaries and their \n     doctors to work together to provide services, allow private \n     fee for service plans to set their own premiums, and permit \n     seniors to add their own dollars beyond the Government \n     contribution.\n\n     SEC. 628. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   A NATIONWIDE PERMANENT LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION \n                   PROGRAM FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Heart disease kills more than 500,000 Americans per \n     year.\n       (2) The number and costs of interventions for the treatment \n     of coronary disease are rising and currently cost the health \n     care system $58,000,000,000 annually.\n       (3) The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program has been \n     operating throughout 12 States and has been demonstrated to \n     reduce the need for coronary procedures by 88 percent per \n     year.\n       (4) The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program is less \n     expensive to deliver than interventional cardiac procedures \n     and could reduce cardiovascular expenditures by \n     $36,000,000,000 annually.\n       (5) Lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise affect \n     heart disease and heart disease outcomes by 50 percent or \n     greater.\n       (6) Intensive lifestyle interventions which include teams \n     of nurses, doctors, exercise physiologists, registered \n     dietitians, and behavioral health clinicians have been \n     demonstrated to reduce heart disease risk factors and enhance \n     heart disease outcomes dramatically.\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\n       (7) The National Institutes of Health estimates that \n     17,000,000 Americans have diabetes and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the number of \n     Americans who have a diagnosis of diabetes increased 61 \n     percent in the last decade and is expected to more than \n     double by 2050.\n       (8) Lifestyle modification programs are superior to \n     medication therapy for treating diabetes.\n       (9) Individuals with diabetes are now considered to have \n     coronary disease at the date of diagnosis of their diabetic \n     state.\n       (10) The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program has been \n     an effective lifestyle program for the reversal and treatment \n     of heart disease.\n       (11) Men with prostate cancer have shown significant \n     improvement in prostate cancer markers using a similar \n     approach in lifestyle modification.\n       (12) These lifestyle changes are therefore likely to affect \n     other chronic disease states, in addition to heart disease.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should carry \n     out the demonstration project known as the Lifestyle \n     Modification Program Demonstration, as described in the \n     Health Care Financing Administration Memorandum of \n     Understanding entered into on November 13, 2000, on a \n     permanent basis;\n       (2) the project should include as many Medicare \n     beneficiaries as would like to participate in the project on \n     a voluntary basis; and\n       (3) the project should be conducted on a national basis.\n\n     SEC. 629. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PAYMENT REDUCTIONS UNDER \n                   MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fees medicare pays physicians were reduced by 5.4 \n     percent across-the-board in 2002;\n       (2) recent action by Congress narrowly averted another \n     across-the-board reduction of 4.4 percent for 2003;\n       (3) based on current projections, the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that, absent legislative \n     or administrative action, fees will be reduced across-the-\n     board once again in 2004 by 4.2 percent;\n       (4) the prospect of continued payment reductions under the \n     medicare physician fee schedule for the foreseeable future \n     threatens to destabilize an important element of the program, \n     namely physician participation and willingness to accept \n     medicare patients;\n       (5) the primary source of this instability is the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR), a system of annual spending \n     targets for physicians' services under medicare;\n       (6) the SGR system has a number of defects that result in \n     unrealistically low spending targets, such as the use of the \n     increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) as a proxy for \n     increases in the volume and intensity of services provided by \n     physicians, no tolerance for variance between growth in \n     medicare beneficiary health care costs and our Nation's GDP, \n     and a requirement for immediate recoupment of the difference;\n       (7) both administrative and legislative action are needed \n     to return stability to the physician payment system;\n       (8) using the discretion given to it by medicare law, CMS \n     has included expenditures for prescription drugs and \n     biologicals administered incident to physicians' services \n     under the annual spending targets without making appropriate \n     adjustments to the targets to reflect price increases in \n     these drugs and biologicals or the growing reliance on such \n     therapies in the treatment of medicare patients;\n       (9) between 1996 and 2002, annual medicare spending on \n     these drugs grew from $1,800,000,000 to $6,200,000,000, or \n     from $55 per beneficiary to an estimated $187 per \n     beneficiary;\n       (10) although physicians are responsible for prescribing \n     these drugs and biologicals, neither the price of the drugs \n     and biologicals, nor the standards of care that encourage \n     their use, are within the control of physicians; and\n       (11) SGR target adjustments have not been made for cost \n     increases due to new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     should use its discretion to exclude drugs and biologicals \n     administered incident to physician services from the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR) system;\n       (2) CMS should use its discretion to make SGR target \n     adjustments for new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations; and\n       (3) in order to provide ample time for Congress to consider \n     more fundamental changes to the SGR system, the conferees on \n     the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 \n     should include in the conference agreement a provision to \n     establish a minimum percentage update in physician fees for \n     the next 2 years and should consider adding provisions that \n     would mitigate the swings in payment, such as establishing \n     multi-year adjustments to recoup the variance and creating \n     ``tolerance'' corridors for variations around the update \n     target trend.\n\n     SEC. 630. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF OASIS REQUIREMENT FOR \n                   COLLECTION OF DATA ON NON-MEDICARE AND NON-\n                   MEDICAID PATIENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the period described in subsection \n     (b), the Secretary may not require, under section 4602(e) of \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 or otherwise under OASIS, a \n     home health agency to gather or submit information that \n     relates to an individual who is not eligible for benefits \n     under either title XVIII or title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act (such information in this section referred to as ``non-\n     medicare/medicaid OASIS information'').\n       (b) Period of Suspension.--The period described in this \n     subsection--\n       (1) begins on the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) ends on the last day of the 2nd month beginning after \n     the date as of which the Secretary has published final \n     regulations regarding the collection and use by the Centers \n     for Medicare & Medicaid Services of non-medicare/medicaid \n     OASIS information following the submission of the report \n     required under subsection (c).\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on how non-\n     medicare/medicaid OASIS information is and can be used by \n     large home health agencies. Such study shall examine--\n       (A) whether there are unique benefits from the analysis of \n     such information that cannot be derived from other \n     information available to, or collected by, such agencies; and\n       (B) the value of collecting such information by small home \n     health agencies compared to the administrative burden related \n     to such collection.\n     In conducting the study the Secretary shall obtain \n     recommendations from quality assessment experts in the use of \n     such information and the necessity of small, as well as \n     large, home health agencies collecting such information.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study conducted under paragraph (1) by not \n     later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as preventing home health agencies from collecting \n     non-medicare/medicaid OASIS information for their own use.\n\n     SEC. 631. EMPLOYER FLEXIBILITY.\n\n       (a) Medicare.--Nothing in part D of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act, as added by section 101, shall be \n     construed as--\n       (1) preventing employment-based retiree health coverage (as \n     defined in section 1860D-20(e)(4)(B) of such Act, as so \n     added) from providing coverage that is supplemental to the \n     benefits provided under a Medicare Prescription Drug plan \n     under such part or a MedicareAdvantage plan under part C of \n     such title, as amended by this Act; or\n       (2) requiring employment-based retiree health coverage (as \n     so defined) that provides medical benefits to retired \n     participants who are not eligible for medical benefits under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act or under a plan \n     maintained by a State or an agency thereof to provide medical \n     benefits, or the same medical benefits, to retired \n     participants who are so eligible.\n       (b) ADEA.--\n       (1) In General.--Section 4(l) of the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 623(l)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) An employee benefit plan (as defined in section 3(3) \n     of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1002(3))) shall not be treated as violating subsection \n     (a), (b), (c), or (e) solely because the plan provides \n     medical benefits to retired participants who are not eligible \n     for medical benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) or under a plan maintained by a \n     State or an agency thereof, but does not provide medical \n     benefits, or the same medical benefits, to retired \n     participants who are so eligible.''\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 632.

Immediately following that vote, the Senate \nwill proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nnomination of Victor Wolski to be a judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims. Therefore, the first vote in tomorrow's session will occur at \n11:45 a.m. That vote will be the first of two back-to-back votes.\n  For the remainder of the day, the Senate will resume debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 11, the Patients First Act.
