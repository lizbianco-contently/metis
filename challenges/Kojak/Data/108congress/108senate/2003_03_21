It is my understanding that the two leaders are scheduled \nto go to the White House. Is that the reason? I want to make sure \neveryone understands that the majority leader is going to do what he \ncan to move this bill and the fact that there is this window is not \ngoing to happen during the rest of the day; is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. The Democratic leader and the majority \nleader will be meeting with the President of the United States for a \nperiod of about 30 minutes to discuss the war. There will be a pause, \nand then after 10:45 we would expect votes to occur with 10-minute \nintervals thereafter.\n  Mr. REID.

However, if Members feel compelled to offer them, I ask \ncourtesy of that notification.\n  I remind all Senators that once the voting sequence begins at 10:45, \nSenators should remain in the Chamber or close by to avoid missing any \nvotes. We will need to limit the votes in the sequence to 10 minutes \neach. We will stay until this resolution is completed. It may be a \nlengthy session today in order to conclude the process.

In \nthe Senate and in everyday life, we should honor that sacrifice in how \nwe comport ourselves.\n  Our service men and women are honorable, patriotic Americans, serving \nthe cause of liberty, our liberty. I pray to God that we who have the \nhonor to represent them continue to act in a manner worthy of them.\n  In this difficult time, I ask my colleagues to measure their words to \nremember those who are privileged to serve and to aspire to that same \nlevel of greatness. We will debate and we will disagree. We will differ \nin how we vote, but we are all Americans.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 23, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal year \n     2004 and including the appropriate budgetary levels for \n     fiscal year 2003 and for fiscal years 2005 through 2013.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Schumer amendment No. 299, to provide immediate assistance \n     to meet pressing homeland security needs by providing funding \n     in 2003 for first responders, port security, bioterrorism \n     preparedness and prevention, border security and transit \n     security, the FBI; to restore the elimination of funding of \n     the COPS program, firefighter equipment grants, Byrne Grants \n     and Local Law enforcement grants; to provide a sustained \n     commitment of resources for homeland security needs without \n     reducing funding to other key domestic law enforcement and \n     public safety priorities; and to reduce the deficit.\n       Brownback amendment No. 282, to express the sense of the \n     Senate that a commission be established to review the \n     efficiency of Federal agencies.\n       Conrad (for Feingold/Corzine) amendment No. 270, to set \n     aside a reserve fund for possible military action and \n     reconstruction in Iraq.\n       Breaux Amendment No. 339, to reduce tax cuts by $375 \n     billion and to reduce projected deficits by $464 billion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 9:45 will be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Conrad, we yield time to the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 299\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the first vote will be on the amendment \nthat I offered, along with many of my colleagues: Senator Clinton, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Byrd, and Senator Lieberman. It is the \nhomeland security amendment that we debated. I remind my colleagues how \nimportant homeland security is, how we have to fight a good offense. \nPraise God, it seems as if that is going quite well in Iraq. It is also \nvery important for us to fight defense and we have not been doing an \nadequate job.\n  I believe Senator Cochran will offer an alternative version later on \ntoday, but I would make two points about the Schumer amendment as \nopposed to the Cochran amendment. One is that the Cochran amendment is \nnot as generous, as I understand it. I have just received it. It is \neven in this fiscal year, the 2003 fiscal year, when our police \nofficers, our firefighters are hurting from one end of the country to \nthe other, when our port security is not what it should be, when our \nrail security is not what it should be, the Cochran amendment is \nconsiderably lower.\n  I am sure if my colleagues go back and ask their police and fire \ndepartments which amendment they prefer, it is the Schumer amendment.\n  Second and more important, we have close to a $700 billion tax cut. \nWe also have programs on education, on health care, on transportation, \nthe FBI and everything else. The alternative amendment cuts every one \nof those. Are my colleagues going to tell their police departments that \nthey are going to take away Byrne grants and COPS money to give them \nthis money? Are they going to take away fire money to give them this \nmoney? Are they going to cut road building? Are they going to cut the \nFBI? Are they going to cut everything that is in function 920 to do \nhomeland security? Just as we should not be pitting the defense and the \nmoney needed for our soldiers overseas against domestic needs like \neducation, health care and transportation, we should not be pitting \nhomeland security against that. I ask my colleagues to think about \nit. We have a huge tax cut. This amendment takes a very small amount--\nin a quick calculation--less than 1 or 2 percent of that tax cut.\n\n  Where should the money come from? I don't believe we are actually \ngoing to cut education any further, no matter what this budget \nresolution does. I don't believe we will cut health care any further. I \ndon't think we will cut road building any further. They are stretched \nto the bone because of the necessities of the budget.\n  This amendment offers the real chance at homeland security. This is \nthe amendment. To insist that every dollar of the tax cut must be \nsacrosanct while we sacrifice the rest of the Government--when your \nschool boards come to you, when your hospitals come to you, when your \nconstruction companies come to you, and your Governors and mayors and, \nof course, your police chiefs and firefighters, are you going to say \nyou let them down?\n  I urge, I hope, I pray; this is a time when we need unity. There is \nno problem, none whatever, with taking a small amount, a total over 10 \nyears of $38 billion, a total of over $5 billion this fiscal year, \n2003, and next year, 2004, getting to $8 billion, out of that tax cut \nbecause that will fund homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and stand up for \ntheir local police, their local firefighters, their local schools.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two leaders have agreed the second vote \nshould start at 10:30 and I ask unanimous consent that that be the \ncase.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, we will have a vote to begin in a couple minutes on the \nSchumer amendment, and then the second vote will begin at 10:30 on the \nCochran amendment that is also in relation to homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues, with great respect, to oppose the Schumer \namendment. His amendment would add $88 billion over 10 years for a \nvariety of homeland security programs, law enforcement assistance. I \ncontacted the\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security, Mr. Ridge, and asked for their position \non this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Secretary Ridge: ``The Administration opposes the \npending Schumer amendment'' in the second paragraph.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Secretary,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2003.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I appreciate your leadership as \n     Congress deliberates the FY 2004 Budget Resolution. I am \n     writing to urge you and your colleagues to maintain an \n     appropriate balance between adequate funding provided for \n     homeland security programs, program levels that can be spent \n     responsibly, and fiscal discipline.\n       The Administration opposes the pending Schumer amendment. \n     Substantial additional funding levels in the Budget \n     resolution could be diverted away from terrorism preparedness \n     and into activities that are traditionally funded by state \n     and local governments. Defending our homeland is not just \n     about spending more money. We need to ensure that funding \n     provided for ``homeland security'' is truly directed to \n     programs that help protect America against terrorism--the \n     President's FY 2004 Budget support these programs as does the \n     Senate Budget Resolution.\n       The FY 2004 budget represents a doubling of funding for \n     non-defense homeland security since the September 11th \n     terrorist attacks. This year, the President is requesting \n     $3,558 billion in First Responder funding for terrorism \n     preparedness grants and training and assistance. The Budget \n     also includes $4.8 billion for the Transportation Security \n     Agency--this level will fund a complete airport screener \n     workforce, maintain nearly 10,000 pieces of TSA screening \n     equipment, ensure coverage on commercial aircraft with \n     additional Federal Air Marshals, and assess methods for \n     improved screening of air cargo on commercial flights. More \n     than $1.6 billion is requested for biodefense research. \n     Through this investment and the proposed BioShield \n     initiative, the President is moving as quickly as possible to \n     research, develop and procure bioterror countermeasures. The \n     Budget also provides $6.7 billion for DHS's Bureau of Customs \n     and Border Protection--this level will support the continued \n     development of the comprehensive Entry/Exit system, \n     infrastructure and technology investments including remotely \n     operated infrared cameras to monitor isolated border areas, \n     radiation detection and x-ray machines for inspecting cargo \n     containers, and $62 million for the Container Security \n     Initiative.\n       As I indicated on Wednesday, the President intends to send \n     a supplemental appropriations request to Congress in the near \n     future to support the homeland security efforts of state and \n     local entities during this time of heightened threat.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Ridge.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have to decide, are we going to have individual \nSenators come here and say we know best, we ought to give the \nSecretary--this is a new Secretary, a new Department, where the funding \nfor these items has more than doubled in the last 2 years--a very \nsignificant increase.\n  The increase we have this year over last year is 18.4 percent. In \naddition to that, when we vote on the Cochran amendment, we will be \nincreasing funds for this function for fiscal year 2003, the year we \nare in, an additional $3.5 billion. That is more than enough to make up \nfor any deficiencies in first responders and also gives additional \nmoney for other necessary items in homeland security. Senator Cochran \nwill explain that amendment when we vote at 10:30.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the Schumer amendment.\n  This amendment will have a 15-minute vote, and possibly the next \namendment will have 15 minutes, and then we will have a series of \nrollcall votes. We have 10 amendments in the queue, and today we will \npossibly vote on a lot of amendments. We urge colleagues, particularly \non the second round, to stay on the floor and to be as attentive as \npossible because we will try to stay to the 10-minute timeframe to \naccommodate as many amendments as are necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator Schumer that would provide $88 billion in \ndesperately needed funding for homeland security efforts at the \nFederal, State, and local levels.\n  In the State of Maryland and across the Nation, State, local, and \nregional authorities have been called upon to meet the mounting \nchallenges we face in strengthening our domestic security. Many of our \nlocal officials have accepted this challenge with great resolve, and \nthere have been many improvements in protecting the American people \nagainst the increased dangers with which we now live.\n  Despite these efforts, homeland security enhancements remain woefully \ninadequate, and states, counties, and cities across the country are \nstretched to their financial limits. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and \nthe National League of Cities estimate that over $3 billion has been \nspent by our cities toward terrorism preparedness. An editorial in \ntoday's Baltimore Sun highlights the serious costs incurred by the City \nof Baltimore, which are estimated at $12.5 million. Despite the City's \nbest efforts, there remain serious concerns about its readiness for an \nattack. As the Sun asserts:\n\n     [a]mong them are the inability of Baltimore County, Baltimore \n     City, and the Maryland State Police to communicate on a \n     single radio system. Also, many police departments lack \n     sufficient tools for coping with a disaster, such as \n     equipment to detect radiation.\n\n  With the commencement of engagement by United States military forces \nin Iraq, we stand united as a country and will rally behind the men and \nwomen of our armed forces to give them the support they deserve. We \nmust and will remain steadfast and resolute in our strong backing of \nthe courageous men and women who are being sent into harm's way. As we \ndemonstrate our support for our troops overseas, however, we must not \nrelent in our support for the men and women who stand ready to protect \nus each and every day on our own shores.\n  This past Monday evening, President Bush declared that ``[j]ust as we \nare preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions \nto protect our homeland.'' In conjunction with the President's address \nto the nation, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge announced the \nadministration's decision to raise our threat assessment again to Level \nOrange. This time, however, the rise in threat level was accompanied by \na broad plan to increase security across the country, dubbed \n``Operation Liberty Shield.'' This call to our nation's domestic \ntroops--our firefighters, policemen, and emergency medical personnel--\nwill not go unheeded. As the events of September 11 so horribly \ndemonstrated, these brave men and women place themselves in harm's way \neach and every day, and will continue to face any danger to protect the \nfreedoms and the lives of innocent Americans. In a very real sense, our \ntroops abroad and our first responders at home stand together to \nprovide for our common defense.\n  Law enforcement agencies and fire departments across the nation have \nbeen stretched even further by Reserve call-ups. A study by the \nDepartment of Justice has estimated that 44 percent of law enforcement \nagencies have lost members to the war effort, and, according to \nestimates, 75 percent of the Nation's firehouses are home to \nreservists.\n  As we continue to ask more of our first responders, the \nadministration has repeatedly undermined the critical efforts of these \nbrave men and women by consistently refusing to provide the resources \nthey need to do their jobs. Just as we have made a commitment to \nsupporting our troops abroad and providing them with the most advanced \nequipment, we must make a more concrete Federal commitment to our first \nresponders.\n  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program has been a highly \nsuccessful effort to get much-needed Federal support directly to the \nnation's firehouses. The Republican budget proposal directs only $500 \nmillion to this critical program. This represents a $250 million cut \nfrom the amount enacted for the current fiscal year, and $400 million \nless than has been authorized by the Congress.\n  The National Fire Protection Agency, NFPA, has found that a minimum \nof four firefighters are needed to safely attack an interior structure \nfire. The congressionally mandated ``Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire \nService,'' published jointly by the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nand NFPA this past December, has shown that this personnel target is \nmet in far too few cases. I have cosponsored legislation, introduced by \nSenator Dodd, entitled the Staffing for Adequate Fire and\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nEmergency Response Act, or SAFER Act, which would create a grant \nprogram specifically for the hiring of new firefighters to address this \nneed. Senator Schumer's amendment would provide $11 billion over ten \nyears toward the FIRE and SAFER Acts.\n  The Republican budget we have before us also cuts programs for state \nand local law enforcement by over $1 billion. The Administration has \nproposed eliminating the Byrne Grant program, zero funding the COPS \nhiring program, ending the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, \ncanceling the COPS in Schools program, and slashing the COPS technology \nprogram. Senator Schumer's amendment would restore these unwise cuts.\n  This budget does little to address the inadequate safeguards to our \nNation's 361 seaports. One frightening estimate suggests that, of the 6 \nmillion shipping containers that enter the country each year, only two \npercent are actually inspected. The Port of Baltimore, in my own State, \nis one of the busiest seaports in the nation, handling over 30 million \ntons of cargo each year.\n  Last November we took a significant first step in improving port \nsecurity by passing the Maritime Transportation Security Act by an \noverwhelming margin. I joined 94 of my Senate colleagues in supporting \nthe passage of this measure, and the bill was signed into law by \nPresident Bush soon thereafter. However, while the Administration and \nmy Republican colleagues supported the mandates offered in this \nlegislation, they have again failed in providing the funding to fulfill \nthese commitments. The U.S. Coast Guard has estimated that the cost to \nthe private sector for port security improvements called for in the \nlegislation would total $4.4 billion. This budget's entire allocation \nfor port security is a meager $200 million.\n  I want to turn for a moment to the security of our Nation's surface \ntransportation systems. Roughly one-third of terrorist attacks \nworldwide target transportation systems. According to the Mineta \nTransportation Institute, surface transportation systems were the \ntarget of more than 195 terrorist attacks from 1997 to 2000. Clearly, \nthere is an acute need to improve the security of our transportation \ninfrastructure, and particularly our nation's transit systems--buses, \nsubways, ferries and light rail--which carry 14 million Americans every \nworkday. A recent GAO study identified significant security needs at \nour nation's transit agencies, where, according to the study, \n``insufficient funding is the most significant challenge in making \ntheir transit systems as safe and secure as possible.'' In fact, at \nonly eight of the transit agencies they visited, the GAO found over \n$700 million in identified security needs. And yet, the budget \nresolution demonstrates no commitment to helping transit systems become \nmore secure. Despite the elevated risk levels we are currently \nexperiencing, this budget provides only a minimal increase in Federal \ntransit spending and dedicates no resources within the budget of the \nTransportation Security Administration for transit security. We owe it \nto our nation's transit riders to do more.\n  This week, the administration again pledged its support for increased \nfunding for state and local governments toward homeland security. We \nhave heard many of these pledges over the past year, and, \nunfortunately, the administration has repeatedly fallen short on its \npromises. The rhetoric of support for our nation's first responders and \nupgrades to our homeland security will continue to ring hollow if not \naccompanied by the resources desperately needed for these critical \nefforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Schumer's amendment. If the \nCongress and the administration are to enact legislation signaling our \ncommitment to securing the homeland, we must provide the resources to \nprovide even the most basic levels of protection. We must demonstrate \nsteely resolve in our efforts to protect our citizens and critical \ninfrastructure, and this will not be achieved if the resources \ncommitted to the task are inadequate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

The next amendment will have a 15-minute time limit, but after \nthat we expect to enforce the 10-minute time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, so we can alert colleagues to what we are \nfaced with today, we have over 100 amendments that have been noticed to \nthe managers. At three amendments an hour, maybe a little more than \nthat, four amendments an hour would be 25 hours; three amendments an \nhour, 35 hours. So we will ask colleagues to call us and let us know if \ntheir amendments are that important to them or that they could wait for \nanother day. I urge colleagues to talk with their staffs and alert us \nas to amendments that do not need to be offered today. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, when we get into this, we will need to do these votes 10 \nminutes apiece, as the chairman has indicated. We will have to be very \ndisciplined to do that. That is the only way we can get through these \namendments in a way that will allow us to complete business on any \nreasonable schedule. We need to put colleagues on notice that that is \nthe way the day will have to go if we are going to get done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 369.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 23, line 15, increase the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $1,575,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 20, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $525,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 3, increase the amount by $350,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 7, increase the amount by $175,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $1,575,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $525,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $350,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $175,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,575,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $525,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by $350,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 21, decrease the amount by $175,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 20, increase the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 46, line 21, increase the amount by $1,575,000,000.\n       On page 47, line 6, increase the amount by $875,000,000.\n       On page 47, line 15, increase the amount by $525,000,000.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment will increase the fiscal \nyear 2003 totals in the budget resolution to provide an additional $3.5 \nbillion in funding for homeland security.\n  Based on information about possible terrorist attacks against U.S. \ninterests, the Secretary of Homeland Security earlier this week raised \nthe national threat alert level to orange, indicating a higher risk of \nterrorist attack. We must support the actions being taken across our \ncountry to mobilize Federal response assets, strengthen the protection \nof our transportation systems, tighten security at our borders and \nports, increase public health preparedness, and improve the \ncapabilities of first responders.\n  Secretary Ridge confirmed in a letter today that a supplemental \nappropriations request will be sent to Congress by the President in the \nnear future to support homeland security efforts. This amendment will \naccommodate additional funding to meet these immediate homeland \nsecurity needs, and I urge Senators to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter I \ndescribed addressed to the Honorable William Frist, Senate majority \nleader, from Tom Ridge be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2003.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I appreciate your leadership as \n     Congress deliberates the FY 2004 Budget Resolution. I am \n     writing to urge you and your colleagues to maintain an \n     appropriate balance between adequate funding provided for \n     homeland security programs, program levels that can be spent \n     responsibly, and fiscal discipline.\n       The Administration opposes the pending Schumer amendment. \n     Substantial additional funding levels in the Budget \n     resolution could be diverted away from terrorism preparedness \n     and into activities that are traditionally funded by state \n     and local governments. Defending our homeland is not just \n     about spending more money. We need to ensure that funding \n     provided for ``homeland security'' is truly directed to \n     programs that help protect America against terrorism--the \n     President's FY 2004 Budget supports these programs as does \n     the Senate Budget Resolution.\n       The FY 2004 budget represents a doubling of funding for \n     non-defense homeland security since the September 11th \n     terrorist attacks. This year, the President is requesting \n     $3,558 billion in First Responder funding for terrorism \n     preparedness grants and training and assistance. The Budget \n     also includes $4.8 billion for the Transportation Security \n     Agency--this level will fund a complete airport screener \n     workforce, maintain nearly 10,000 pieces of TSA screening \n     equipment, ensure coverage on commercial aircraft of with \n     additional Federal Air Marshals, and assess methods for \n     improved screening of air cargo on commercial flights. More \n     than $1.6 billion is requested for biodefense research. \n     Through this investment and the proposed BioShield \n     initiative, the President is moving as quickly as possible to \n     research, develop and procure bioterror countermeasures. The \n     Budget also provides $6.7 billion for DHS's Bureau of Customs \n     and Border Protection--this level will support the continued \n     development of the comprehensive Entry/Exit system, \n     infrastructure and technology investments including remotely \n     operated infrared cameras to monitor isolated border areas, \n     radiation detection and x-ray machines for inspecting cargo \n     containers, and $62 million for the Container Security \n     Initiative.\n       As I indicated on Wednesday, the President intends to send \n     a supplemental appropriations request to Congress in the near \n     future to support the homeland security efforts of state and \n     local entities during this time of heightened threat.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Ridge,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the two managers are listening, we do \nnot yet have a unanimous consent agreement that there will be 1 minute \nfor each side prior to a vote. I am going to ask unanimous consent that \nthat be the case.\n  Also, the two managers want to make sure the Chair enforces the 1-\nminute rule. The only way that can be enforced is that the Chair, when \nthe minute is up, stops the person from speaking; otherwise, it runs \ninto a minute and a half, 2 minutes, and we waste a great deal of time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to each vote there be 1 minute on \neach side, and that be strictly enforced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to modify that. This consent agreement will be for this group of \nvotes we now have planned.\n  Mr. REID. Not this vote right now.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the 10 votes we have ordered, not necessarily for \nevery vote we might have today. We will probably do that later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n  Mr. REID. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe the Senator from New York wants to speak on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am surprised at and happy to support \nthe Cochran amendment. Unlike what I had been told last night, it does \nnot take the money out of 920. It rather adds the cap. It is $3.5 \nbillion of homeland security money which we very much need.\n  I hasten to add, I do not think $3.5 billion is enough. Our amendment \nhad over $5 billion, and it does not go into 2004 and the outyears. We \nhave a long way to go on homeland security, but this is a good first \nstep.\n  I am delighted to support the amendment, and I thank the Senator from \nMississippi for helping us raise the amount of homeland security money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthis will be a 15-minute vote. We plan on strictly enforcing this vote \nat 15 minutes. We plan on strictly enforcing the subsequent rollcall \nvotes at 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Cochran \namendment No. 369.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) \nand the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I inquire of the Parliamentarian how long \nthat rollcall lasted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It lasted 21\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of colleagues, the majority leader \nand minority leader were cut off; in the next vote we are going to cut \noff a lot of people if they are not here and voting within 10 minutes. \nI forewarn our colleagues. I will be fair and bipartisan. We will cut \noff people if they are not here to vote. We will limit the votes to 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 270\n\n  The next amendment in order is the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This amendment, which I offer with Senators Corzine, \nDurbin, Graham of Florida, and Hollings, would create a reserve fund to \nset aside $100 billion, an amount well within the range of available \nestimates, to fund military action and reconstruction in Iraq. We would \npay for this by reducing the amount we would budget for tax cuts in the \nperiod covered by the budget resolution.\n  No one is certain how much the war with Iraq will actually cost, but \nwe can be certain such a war will not be free. The Center for Strategic \nand Budgetary Assessments estimates that the total cost could range \nfrom $129 billion to $683 billion. Today's Wall Street Journal reports \na supplemental appropriations request is expected shortly that will ask \nfor $80 billion and that will cover just the first 30 days of the war. \nThe day before yesterday the President said the war may be longer and \nmore difficult than some predict.\n  Plainly, we are talking about a major enterprise and one for which we \nshould budget. We are in a war. The budget must reflect it. This is no \ntime for business as usual. We should prepare responsibly for that \nwhich is right before our eyes. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. We asked CRS to do a study on how we funded wars in the \npast, and did we do it in advance. Based on the examination of previous \nreviews, fronting for wars and other major military operations, it \nappears that Presidents have not requested and Congress has not \nprovided funding for wars in advance of the start of operations; \nrather, administrations have requested funding after operations have \nbegun and Congress has subsequently appropriated money to meet \nspecific, documented budget requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The question is on agreeing to \nthe Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my amendment establishes a reserve \nfund for national defense and homeland security. The amendment is \nnecessary because the budget resolution actually cuts defense spending \nby $103 billion below the President's request over that 10-year window. \nThat is according to CBO and SBC. From 2004 through 2008, the \nRepublican budget assumes defense spending at the level requested by \nthe President. But the last 5 years of the budget window, from 2009 \nthrough 2013, the Republican budget resolution cuts $103 billion below \nthe level CBO estimates.\n  I ask that my friends on the Republican side of the aisle be very \ncareful when they look at the Republican message. It says the \nLautenberg amendment reduces the growth package by $103 billion in \nbudget authority and $88 billion in outlays. They don't say that the \nbudget comes from the tax cuts.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, as the hearts and minds of all \nAmericans are with our brave men and women in uniform who are embarking \non the most perilous of journeys, I rise to speak in support of Senator \nLautenberg's amendment and fulfill what I see as one of the most \nimportant duties of any Senator.\n  The Constitution of the United States invests the President with the \nauthority of the Commander in Chief, but it also establishes the \nCongress as the guarantor of the quality and size of the Army, the \nNavy, the Air Force, and the Marines because it is the Congress that \nauthorizes the expenditure of moneys to fund the military. As Senators \nwe have a great responsibility to watch over those who man the walls of \nour Nation's defenses.\n  Along the Iraq-Kuwait border the U.S. military is striking. Our Armed \nForces are engaged the world over in a fight against terror. Our \nuniformed commanders have testified before us that not since the Second \nWorld War has the U.S. military been so dispersed; not since that \nconflict have our Armed Forces been engaged with the enemy in so many \nlocales and climes. My colleagues and I on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee are aware of the difficulties our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines and their families face as a result of these strenuous \ndeployments. We have applauded the Department of Defense's efforts to \naddress the quality of life of its troops. Following in the best \ntraditions of this Chamber, we have worked together in a truly \nbipartisan fashion to increase military pay levels. We have addressed \nspousal benefits and we will, in the upcoming months of this Congress, \ndebate, and I hope determine once and for all the issue of concurrent \nreceipt. Year after year we strive to provide funding to equip our \nforces with the most advanced technology the world has ever seen.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, as a strong supporter of our Armed Forces, as one who \nrecognizes the strain of current operations upon our force structure \nand the importance of maintaining funding levels for the Department \npresently and for the foreseeable future, I cannot agree with any \nproposal which will reverse the important gains that we have made.\n  I believe we must oppose any attempt to decrease essential funding \nfor our national defense in order to paper over the fiscal havoc that \nthe President's proposed tax cuts cause. It is irresponsible to, when \nwe are at war, when the challenges that our men and women in uniform \nface are so omnipresent, contemplate slashing the future funds that \nwill make it possible for them to maintain their dominance into the \nnext decade.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to the Senate Republican budget \nresolution, which cuts defense spending after 2009 by more than a $100 \nbillion--$100 billion.\n  The resolution calls for a $6.5 billion drawdown in 2009 from the \nfunding level that the Congressional Budget Office estimates as \nrequired for the maintenance of the 2008 spending levels. In 2010 that \nshortfall would be $15.5 billion. A year later it is a $21.0 billion \nshortfall. A year later it grows to $27.5 billion. By 2013 the amount \nis $34.0 billion.\n  And why? To try to correct the fiscal damage the tax cuts have put us \nin. Now, I think we are all in agreement with Chairman Nickles that the \nrecord-setting deficits that will be the bitter fruit of the \nPresident's tax cuts need to be dealt with. But to deal with them by \ncutting moneys that will fuel our planes, feed our marines, steam our \nships, and arm our weapons is unfortunate indeed. I challenge the \nproponents of this plan to go out into the Kuwaiti desert and stand in \nfront of a U.S. platoon, and tell them that the future funding that is \nto secure them better communications gear or more money to fund \ntraining or better body armor is being cut. Cut because the Senate \nmajority refuses to take the President to task for pursuing fiscally \nirresponsible tax cuts on the eve of a war, and in the midst of an \ninternational campaign against terror.\n  The amendment that I rise in support of offers another way. Let's \ncarve out a $103.5 billion fund from the $1.4 trillion tax cut and use \nit to create a designated fund for the defense of our Nation's \nsecurity. In doing so we will serve to offset the proposed reductions \nin defense spending set forth in the Budget Resolution. By our actions \nwe will prevent the diversion of cash from accounts that fund the \ndefense of this country to an ill-considered, nonstimulative tax cut.\n  We are at war. Our military, the most powerful professional armed \nforce ever arrayed on the face of the earth is shouldering a heavy \nburden. To discuss cutting the very funding that will keep them the \npreeminent military force is more than poor politics--it is \nirresponsible. I like to think that what Lincoln called ``the better \nangels of our nature'' still, in these troubled times,\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nhold sway over our baser instincts. I urge you to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. This \nis a good reason that maybe we should not have 10-year budgets. He \nassumes we should increase spending in some areas instead of defense, \nbut there is not one line item that says 050. Nothing would increase \nmoney in defense under this resolution. It would increase taxes. It \nwould increase spending, unspecified spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n300.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment No. 265.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 265.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, March 18, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  There will be 2 minutes of debate evenly divided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if you turn to page 6 of the budget, you \nwill see that for the fiscal year we are projecting going into the red \n$484 billion; for 2004, $582 billion; for 2005, $556 billion. So for \nthe 3-year period, that is $1.5 trillion going into the red. That is \n$1.5 trillion of stimulus.\n  If anybody wants to talk growth, you know dividends and the estate \ntax are not going to stimulate anything. This is $l.5 trillion of \nstimulus. The only thing that grows in this budget is the debt. So for \nthose who are responding to the needs of the country, trying to get us \nto sober up and get back on track and get ahold of ourselves and quit \nrunning these horrendous deficits and spending Social Security, vote \naye; for those responding to the needs of the campaign, vote no.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. This amendment says there will be no growth package. It \nimplies a tax increase in 2011, 2012, and 2013. That means a 10-percent \nrate would go to 15 percent; the child credit that would be $1,000 will \nfall back to $500; the marriage penalty would be increased.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my disagreement with \nthe priorities set forth in the budget resolution we have been \ndebating, and support for the amendments offered by my colleagues from \nSouth Carolina and New York, Senators Hollings and Schumer. With our \nNation at war, we must do all we can to support our troops, ensure that \nour homeland is secure, and continue our emphasis on significant \ndomestic priorities, such as education and health care. This is why I \nbelieve it would be unwise to enact further tax cuts that would pit \nthese priorities against each other for limited Federal dollars and \nlead us further down the path to fiscal irresponsibility.\n  We have commenced military operations against an enemy who has defied \nefforts at international diplomacy. Without a doubt, these efforts will \ncome at substantial cost which is not reflected in this budget. \nProponents must rely on budget tactics to show that we can allow \nadditional tax cuts to be passed. I would like to associate my comments \nwith those of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, who \nrightfully attempted to enforce patriotic pause on this very point.\n  This budget repudiates our commitment to fight the evil of terrorism \nwithin our own borders. It fails to adequately fund homeland security, \nwhich is why I am a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my friend \nfrom New York, Senator Schumer, who has requested that $88 billion be \nprovided over 11 years for urgent homeland security needs, including \nimmediate funding for those on the home front--first responders, \nfirefighters, port, border and transportation security. I also applaud \nthe provisions for bioterrorism preparedness and threat and critical \ninfrastructure assessment. At a time when threats to U.S. civilians \nwithin our borders are very real, we must not abandon, for the sake of \ntax cuts, our resolve to ensure the peace of mind of families at home \nand individuals in their workplaces--many who are praying for loved \nones fighting in our armed services abroad.\n  This resolution calls for tax cuts that will do nothing to stimulate \nthe economy, but would worsen the progressivity of the Tax Code. It \nwould also rob our most important investment of required resources, and \nthat is the investment in the education of America's children. We \nshould be sending the message to our children that we will do all we \ncan to give them the knowledge and tools to be able to meet future \nchallenges that will face this country, when we in this body are long \ngone. Instead, if we pass additional tax cuts, we are saying that we \nwill place political gain over a solid start in life for young \nAmericans. This is why I voted for the amendment proposed by my \ncolleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, along with others, \nthat would have provided an $8.9 billion increase in education funding, \nas well as $8.9 billion for deficit reduction out of funding designated \nfor tax cuts. This funding increase sought to fully fund the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. We only began to fulfill some of the promises we made \nin passing this sweeping education reform law through the fiscal year \n2003 appropriations process. We cannot let this investment waver in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  Finally, I oppose efforts to decrease Federal revenues sorely needed \nto ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to the \ncomprehensive prescription drug program that they deserve. Far too many \nseniors are currently unable to afford the costs of the prescription \ndrugs that their doctors prescribe. Seniors must be able to obtain \nmeaningful prescription drug coverage through the traditional Medicare \nProgram. I supported the amendment sponsored by my colleagues, Senators \nBob Graham, Dorgan, and Stabenow, which would have made sure that a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit is adequately funded, by increasing \nthe Medicare reserve fund by approximately $220 billion. The amendment\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\nwould also have guaranteed that participants in traditional Medicare \nreceive the same prescription drug benefit as beneficiaries that enroll \nin private Medicare health plans. The funding should be included in the \nbudget resolution to adequately protect our Nation's seniors against \nthe increasing costs of prescription drugs instead of to accommodate \nadditional tax cuts. The Graham-Dorgan-Stabenow amendment would have \nreduced the size of the tax cuts in the budget resolution by \napproximately $400 billion and provided a clear choice between \nadditional tax cuts or a meaningful prescription drug benefit.\n  The time has come to face our fiscal responsibilities honestly. Tax \ncuts are not the answer at this point in our Nation's history. I join \nwith Senator Hollings and other colleagues in opposition to the passage \nof additional tax cuts that would steal much needed revenues at a time \nof great need. I owe it to the people of Hawaii and we owe it to the \npeople of America.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very quick. Senator Crapo and \nI have been in discussions. We have reached an accord which will enable \nthe managers to accept the amendment. This is directed to providing \nadditional funding for the State revolving fund dealing with clean \nwater and safe drinking water. There is an overwhelming need. The \nFederal involvement is a leveraging involvement for State and local \ngovernments to help address this important issue.\n  I am pleased to work with Senator Crapo.

Mr. President, I also appreciate Senator Sarbanes and the \nother Senators in the Chamber who are so involved in working on this \ncritical issue. Our water infrastructure needs in this Nation are \ncrying out for attention. This is one of those areas we have to address \nin the budget. We have the kind of need that requires us to be focused \nand unified.\n  I am very pleased we were able to come together on an amendment today \nthat will help us begin the process of addressing the crying need in \nour Nation's infrastructure for water systems.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by the Senators from Maryland and the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Today, we know that our Nation's waters are at risk. We have made \nprogress since the days of the early 1970s when textile mills in \nVermont turned river water the ``color of the day'' that was being used \nin the mill. It is almost unimaginable that wastewater would move \ndirectly from homes and businesses, untreated, into our rivers and \nstreams.\n  Our towns and cities, along with the Federal Government, have \ninvested billions of dollars over the last 30 years to build the \ninfrastructure to treat our wastewater and drinking water. However, \neven with those investments, we continue to fail to fully protect our \nwaters from pollution.\n  The EPA estimates that over 40 percent of our Nation's waters are \nimpaired. That is close to half of our Nation's waters. Lingering \nproblems such as combined sewer overflows and ongoing challenges such \nas nonpoint source pollution continue to require our attention.\n  The progress we have made over the last 30 years stands on the brink \nof evaporation as the extensive water and wastewater infrastructure we \nhave built is nears the end of its useful life. There are a number of \nestimates of the current funding gap in the areas of water and \nwastewater infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\n  The EPA estimates a $535 billion gap between current spending and \nprojected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure over the next \n20 years if additional investments are not made.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the spending gap for \nclean water needs is estimated to be between $132 billion and $388 \nbillion over 20 years and the spending gap for drinking water needs at \nbetween $70 billion and $362 billion over 20 years.\n  It is not solely the Federal Government's responsibility to fill this \ngap.\n  However, it is the Federal Government's responsibility to provide a \nreasonable investment in water infrastructure, given the size of the \nanticipated needs. The budget before us today fails to meet that \nresponsibility. Those supporting the budget will say that it provides \nlevel funding for the Clean Water and the Drinking Water SRF.\n  They will say that the President's budget had such a low request for \nthe Clean Water SRF in particular--one-half of traditional funding \nlevels--that the funding level in this budget is an accomplishment.\n  The fact that the President failed to recognize our water \ninfrastructure needs and requested such an inadequate amount of funding \ndoes not justify the same failure by the Congress.\n  I know that many Members of the Senate share this view. In December \n2002, Senators Sarbanes and Voinovich and 38 Members of the Senate from \nboth sides of the aisle sent a letter to the President asking him to \nprovide $3.2 billion for the Clean Water SRF and $2 billion for the \nDrinking Water SRF.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2002.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you prepare your fiscal 2004 budget, \n     we urge you to make investment in clean water infrastructure \n     a top environmental and public health priority. Specifically, \n     we ask that you provide for at least a $3.1 billion increase \n     above the Fiscal 2003 request of $2.1 billion in the Clean \n     Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SFR) to \n     help states and local communities meet water quality \n     standards and restore the health and safety of our nation's \n     waters.\n       This year marks the 30th Anniversary of the landmark Clean \n     Water Act. Despite important progress over the last three \n     decades, more than 40 percent of our nation's lakes, rivers \n     and streams are still too impaired for fishing or swimming. \n     Discharges from aging and failing sewerage systems, urban \n     storm water and other sources, continue to pose serious \n     threats to our nation's waters, endangering not only public \n     health, but fishing and recreation industries. Population \n     growth and development are placing additional stress on the \n     nation's water infrastructure and its ability to sustain \n     hard-won water quality gains. Today, maintaining clean, safe \n     water remains one of our greatest national and global \n     challenges.\n       On September 30, 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) released a Clean Water and Drinking Water \n     Infrastructure Gap Analysis which found that there will be a \n     $535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs \n     for water and wastewater infrastructure over the next 20 \n     years if additional investments are not made. This figure \n     does not even account for investments necessary to meet water \n     quality goals in nutrient impaired waters. As Administrator \n     Whitman pointed out, ``(t)he magnitude of the challenge \n     America faces is clearly beyond the ability of any one entity \n     to address.''\n       It is vital that the Federal government maintain a strong \n     partnership with states and local governments in averting \n     this massive projected funding gap and share in the burden of \n     maintaining and improving the nation's water infrastructure. \n     An increase in funding for the Clean Water SRF to $3.2 \n     billion and for the Drinking Water SRF to $2 billion in \n     fiscal 2004 is the first step necessary to meet the Federal \n     government's longstanding commitment in this regard.\n       Thank you for your consideration. The Administration's \n     leadership is needed to ensure that our communities' water \n     resources are kept clean and safe.\n           Sincerely,\n         Paul S.

Mr. President, the President ignored this request.\n  On March 7, I joined Senators Sarbanes, Voinovich, and thirty-seven \nMembers from both sides of the aisle in sending a letter to the Budget \nCommittee asking for these same funding levels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, the committee responded and provided a \nslight increase over the President's request. I thank the committee for \nthat.\n  However, that slight increase comes nowhere close to meeting the huge \nwater infrastructure funding gap. It comes nowhere close to meeting the \nfunding levels that were endorsed twice by over one-third of the \nSenate.\n  Now is the time to increase funding for water infrastructure, not \ndecrease it. We have the opportunity today to make an investment in our \nNation's water infrastructure that will protect the gains we have made \nin the last 30 years. Without this investment, we run the risk of \nactually increasing the number of polluted waters in the country.\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\n  Before I close, I want to say a word about the economy. We must take \naction to prevent our economy from faltering. Investment in water \ninfrastructure is estimated to create 40,000 jobs for every billion \ndollars invested. We are proposing to invest $5.2 billion in the State \nrevolving funds. The States will provide a 20 percent match of just \nover $1 billion. This could create up over 200,000 jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment proposed by the Senator \nof Maryland.\n  By voting aye on this amendment, we can take direct action to improve \nboth the State of our Nation's waters and the state of our Nation's \neconomy.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I support my friend's amendment to increase \nFederal funding to $5.2 billion next year to help local communities \nprovide our families and businesses with safe drinking water and clean \nwaste water.\n  Our water pipes are aging and falling into disrepair. New regulations \nto treat stormwater are placing a huge burden on localities. Growth \nacross the country, especially in the South and West, requires \nadditional water funding.\n  In my own State of Missouri, we have small communities such as \nPickering of no more than 150 people that still lack sewer systems. \nMid-size cities such as Lebanon have tripled water rates and still \ncan't afford new EPA regulations. Even our large cities such as St. \nLouis face many of the problems our aging eastern urban areas face. A \nrecent series of articles in the St. Louis Post Dispatch highlighted \nSt. Louis still using sewer pipes more than 100 years old and made of \nwood.\n  This crisis is too great for local communities to bear alone. Experts \nestimate the funding gap between what we as a Nation contribute and \nwhat is needed to clean and provide safe water at $500 billion over 20 \nyears.\n  That's $25 billion per year. The Federal Government can't close that \ngap alone, but we must provide more than the current paltry $2.2 \nbillion per year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Crapo amendment to increase vital \nwater funds without depriving our citizens of their much deserved tax \nrelief to spur economic growth, create jobs, and indirectly increase \nrevenue for Government at all levels.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 317.\n  The amendment (No. 317) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank both our colleagues. We just \nsaved at least 30 minutes. I thank them both very much for their \ncooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I, too, thank our colleagues. Maybe this \nserves as a good example of how we might proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 376\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this amendment moves to \nkeep the promise on IDEA. When the Federal Government enacted this \nprogram, it promised the States and the local jurisdictions that it \nwould fund 40 percent of the expense.\n  We have never done that. We are at about half that amount. As a \nresult, we have forced property tax increases all across America. This \namendment says let's keep the promise on IDEA. We phase it in over 10 \nyears. It costs $73 billion in outlays. It is paid for by the \nnonreconciled tax cuts. Let me emphasize to my colleagues, the \nnonreconciled tax cuts.\n  I hope my colleagues will give serious consideration to this \namendment. Let's keep the promise on IDEA. Let's help those local \njurisdictions at a time of enormous financial stress meet the need.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to pledge my continued support for \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Fully funding the \nFederal Government's share of special education costs is one of the \nmost important investments we can make in our children and our schools. \nFunding IDEA to the full 40 percent will lift the burden of rising \nspecial education costs off the backs of our schools and enhance their \nability to deliver a quality education to all students.\n  I have consistently fought to make full funding of IDEA a reality, \nand I will continue to build on the progress we have made.\n  But I am forced to vote against this amendment because of another \nconcern, my concern with mounting deficits.\n  The budget resolution brought before us includes tax cuts that total \n$1.3 trillion. The budget also proposes that $725 billion of these tax \ncuts be enacted immediately, under the reconciliation process.\n  Two years ago, we passed a $1.3 trillion tax cut. I supported that \ntax cut. But those were different times. We had a surplus. We did not \nforesee the significant decline in revenues, or the deficits that \nfollowed.\n  This is not the time to reduce revenues by $725 billion. It would \nhurt our budget and our economy.\n  Why is $725 billion in tax cuts inappropriate at this time?\n  The most crucial problem is that it is not paid for. The budget \nresolution brought before us forecasts enormous deficits for almost the \nnext decade. Reducing revenues by $725 billion adds to the already \nmounting deficits.\n  In order to prevent the passage of tax cuts that would drive up the \ndeficit and hurt our economy, I believe that we must reduce the size of \nthis tax cut.\n  I joined three of my colleagues in a letter that laid out these \nconcerns. We pledged that we would not agree to tax cuts above $350 \nbillion. This is crucial. The Budget Committee approved $725 billion in \ntax cuts, and brought it to the Senate floor. Along with my colleagues, \nI promised to vote to bring this number down by $375 billion.\n  In a narrowly divided Senate, it is important that both parties work \ntogether to come up with the appropriate spending and revenue targets \nfor the budget. That is why I worked with both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Together, we came up with a target of $350 billion for \nthis tax cut, and we agreed that we would all stick to that number.\n  As part of our commitment to try to reduce the size of the tax cut \napproved by the Budget Committee, we also agreed that we would not try \nto reduce the size of the tax cut below $350 billion. That means I am \nforced to make difficult decisions. In order to keep my commitment to a \nmore responsible tax cut, I have to vote against funding priorities.\n  During tough times, we must make tough choices. I chose to commit to \na responsible tax cut. A tax cut that will prevent worsening deficits \nthat would hurt our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, over the last 4 years, especially over the \nlast 2 years President Bush has been in office, there has been a \ndramatic increase in IDEA funding. In fact, we have increased IDEA \nfunding by almost 173 percent. Last year, we added $1 billion. This \nyear, we added $1 billion. This budget will add $1 billion on top of \nthat--$3 billion in 3 years. This has been a major commitment to IDEA. \nI will be following the amendment the Senator from North Dakota has \nproposed with another amendment which will add an additional $3.2 \nbillion into IDEA. It is inappropriate to take the course of action \nwhich the Senator from North Dakota has proposed. We believe we can do \nit in a much more thoughtful and appropriate way with the following \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n376.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

It represents a $3.2 billion \nincrease over the next 2 years, which will mean that the total increase \nin IDEA funding over the next 2 years will be approximately $6.7 \nbillion. That is a very dramatic increase that puts us clearly on a \npath toward full funding of the IDEA accounts, on which many have \nworked for a long time. I hope the membership supports the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is as phony as a $3 bill. \nIt provides for 2 years of funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act and then you drop off the face of the Earth. \nAnd it gets the money from--where? It gets it from nowhere. It is play \nmoney.\n  Later on, I will have an amendment that will really fund that. I have \nbeen working on an amendment with the Senator from Nebraska that will \nreally put the money in there and get us fully funded for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act by 2011. It will not be \nfunny money, and it will not fall off the face of the Earth in 2 years \nlike the Gregg amendment.\n  I ask for defeat of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on each side. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment would give a tax credit up \nto $5,000 to family caregivers. My amendment would help a family \ndealing with juvenile diabetes, a spouse taking care of someone with \nAlzheimer's, a parent taking care of an adult son with Down's syndrome.\n  My tax credit would pay for prescription drugs, home health care, \ndurable medical equipment--things that give help to those families \npracticing self-help. These families face a tremendous financial and \nemotional burden. Families will deal with their own emotional burden, \nbut I believe America should step up and help them with their financial \nburden as they deal with caregiving in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, 125 million Americans have chronic conditions; 18 \nmillion of those are children. Family caregivers are often stretched to \nthe limit, often working two jobs. This amendment costs $35 billion. We \ncan afford it and we ought to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time in \nopposition?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I obviously do \nnot rise in opposition to the goals the Senator from Maryland seeks, \nbecause I, along with Senator Graham of Florida--the two of us are \nsponsors of an amendment that would provide a $3,000 tax credit for \nfamily caregiving. But what we are involved with here is taking money \nfrom the tax reduction fund to put into another program. What we need \nto do is keep the tax reduction fund very strong because it is a growth \npackage, it is a job package. We want to create jobs. We want an \neconomic environment so when our men and women come home from Iraq \nthere are jobs for our men and women. There is no job creation now. We \nwant to create jobs. It is going to take a tax cut to create jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Mikulski \namendment No. 349.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the managers of the bill asked that I \nmaintain the floor until they return at approximately 1:15. They ask \nthat there be no amendments offered or debate on amendments.\n  Senator Byrd is here. And he usually, each spring, gives us a speech \non springtime.\n  Is the Senator ready to speak?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be allowed to speak as in morning business for up to 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. And I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the Democratic whip, for his characteristic \ncourtesy and attention to matters in the Senate, and his always \nreadiness to help other Senators in getting recognition. I thank him \nvery much.\n\n\n                               Springtime\n\n  Mr. President, this is my 85th year, but it is my 86th coming of \nspring. I am 85 years old--85 years young--but this is my 86th first \nday of spring.\n  So, Mr. President, at long last spring has arrived. How sweet it is. \nHow sweet it is. Spring has arrived.\n  After a long gray winter made darker by the specter of war, and with \nthat conflict now upon us, it is heartening to be reminded of the great \nrhythm of the seasons and the renewal of the earth and the life upon \nit.\n\n       Now Nature hangs her mantle green\n       On every blooming tree,\n       And spreads her sheets o' daisies white\n       Out o'er the grassy lea\n\n  So wrote the poet Robert Burns.\n  On the world stage, war plays a leading role, demanding our attention \nwith the strident clangor of steel and the tramp of marching troops. \nBut in the wings, subtly repainting the background sets, spring softens \nthe scenery and gives us hope for the rebirth of peace. Bright crocuses \nblanket the ground in a confetti of color and the green ink of new \ngrowth stains the tawny fields of winter. The redbuds cover the \nhillsides in a rosy blush as bare forests rush to cover themselves in \nverdant blankets of new leaves. Banks of nodding daffodils cheer the \nanxious hearts of families worrying over loved ones in uniform far from \nhome.\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\n  Last year, a dry and mild winter caused spring bulbs to bloom in \nFebruary. This year, as snowfall after snowfall piled up on lawns and \nroads, it seemed as if no flower could survive in the icy soil. Seed \ncatalogs languished unread as we shoveled sidewalks and scraped \nwindshields. We told ourselves that we needed the moisture and that the \nsnow would replenish the groundwater, but these charitable thoughts \nfaded as we faced another foot of new-fallen snow, another miserable \ncommute, another slushy slog across parking lot melt. It was a long and \nwearing winter, and for those in the northern latitudes of the United \nStates, it lingers on still. In Washington, and in West Virginia, \nhowever, we are emerging from our dens like bears--shaggy, lean, and \nhungry for spring.\n\n       Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising\n       Sweet\n       With charm of earliest birds; pleasant\n       The sun\n       When first on this delightful land he\n       Spreads\n       His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit\n       And flower.\n\n  The poet John Milton wrote those words.\n  I look forward to turning away from the incessant news coverage of \nwar, and I look forward to spending a few precious moments outside \nlistening instead to the spring peepers--those little frogs whose \nsinging brings back boyhood memories of long ago, bubbling springs \nalong Wolf Creek Hollow in Mercer County, WV. Their singing coincided \nwith the arrival of warmer weather and with it, a welcome respite from \nthose bitter early morning walks to school, cold hands wrapped around \nmy lunch pail handle, coat collar turned up against the wind that \ntransformed tender ears into red popsicles.\n  As I tend to the simple routines of springtime--cleaning up the \nsticks and leaves strewn across the yard by the winter winds, preparing \nmy small garden, of four or five or six or seven tomato plants weeding \nand fertilizing the lawn--I shall look upon the spring flowers in all \ntheir finery. The forsythia, the lilac, the hyacinth, all are undaunted \nby the code oranges and the code reds. They care nothing for al-Qaida \nterrorists or Tomahawk missiles, for M1-A1 tanks or F-117 bombers, for \nsandy battlefields or military strikes. In their benevolence, they show \nthe same cheerful faces to Presidents and dictators, to soldiers and to \nthe loved ones those soldiers leave behind. In their camps in Kuwait \nand in their bivouacs in the desert, our brave troops will not see a \ndaffodil this spring. But God's daffodil are there for them, just as we \nare, our support as eternal and dependable as the arrival of spring. I \nhope that they can take comfort in knowing that the daffodils still \nbloom and that spring has come at last. With my prayers for their \nsafety and quick success, I wish them the energy and purpose of spring. \nMay they soon be restored to their loved ones, to us, to enjoy a \nbeautiful springtime at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, normally when there are speeches given not \non the subject matter of the debate, we ask that they be put someplace \nelse in the Record. I think this speech on springtime should stay just \nwhere it is. This has been a very difficult morning. It is going to be \na much more difficult afternoon and evening. The speech on springtime \nshould appear in the Record for all eternity to show that there are \nother things we do that have more meaning sometimes than the \nmeaningless votes we take.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator's wonderful statement about \nspringtime stay where it is. As busy as we are here, sometimes we don't \nthink about it, but because of the Senator from West Virginia, we are \nforced to--speeches he has given on Mother's Day and Father's Day, and \nother such speeches that I will long remember. This speech on \nspringtime has caused me to focus on springtime that I would not have \ndone otherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to be in a quorum call unless \nsomeone has a speech on a subject not related to the budget that they \ncare to give. Senator Nickles and Senator Conrad asked that basically \nwe be in a shutdown on the budget until they return, which should be in \na matter of a few minutes. They wanted to come back around 1:15.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have tentatively agreed on an outline \nfor amendments. I will read through these amendments. It is subject to \nchange. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. We are working together \nand trying to accommodate Senators. Most of the amendment requests are \ncoming from the minority side of the aisle, and that is the way it \nusually is on these resolutions. I understand that. We are going to try \nto move as expeditiously as possible. We are absolutely committed to \nfinishing this bill. It is important we work together to try to \ncomplete it.\n  Some people are outside trying to rewrite amendments or write new \namendments. I really discourage that. It is this Senator's intention to \nfinish the bill. We have only been on it all week, and to have people \nin the drafting stage to see what they can come up with is not a good \nway to finish. We will be here until we finish.\n  I will not ask unanimous consent. I will list the order we expect \njust so Senators are notified and can be ready:\n  Senator Clinton dealing with homeland security; Senator Dorgan \ndealing with veterans affairs; Senator Breaux and others dealing with \nthe $350 billion growth package; Senator Kennedy dealing with Pell \ngrants; Senator Gregg dealing with Pell grants; Senator Byrd dealing \nwith Amtrak; possibly Senator McCain on Amtrak; Senator Biden dealing \nwith COPS; Senator Hollings on port security; Senator Nickles on port \nsecurity; Senator Bond on highways; and Senator Nickles on highways.\n  That is our intention. It is not a unanimous consent request. It is \njust our intention, a list, an outline for our colleagues. This will be \nanother 10 amendments. I suspect three or four of these amendments will \ndrop.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the two managers of this bill have \nbeen fair in doing their best to list these amendments and have an \norderly process to dispose of them. Not in this tranche, but maybe the \nnext, I hope the two managers will consider having part of a unanimous \nconsent agreement that--everyone has been here on time--if someone is \nnot here to offer their amendment, I am not sure we should hang around \nand wait for them.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I concur.\n  We are ready to do business. I believe Senator Clinton has a \nmodification of her amendment to send to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 381\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for this list of amendments I have \noutlined, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided on each of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate passed an \namendment offered by Senator Cochran to increase homeland security \nfunding by $3.5 million in the emergency supplemental bill we will \nconsider in the coming weeks. This is an important first step, but it \nis not nearly enough and it should be paid for.\n  Our cities have already invested $2.6 billion to protect the American \nhomefront. This amendment adds $3.5 billion to Senator Cochran's \namendment and takes the fiscally responsible approach of paying for the \nfull $7 billion without reducing the reconciliation amount. I think we \nneed to be much more vigorous in providing the funds that our police, \nour firefighters, and our cities need. This will help us move in that \ndirection, and it will also be paid for, which is another important \nvalue that this budget should be trying to promote.\n  I ask for its approval and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not know when we can say enough is \nenough. We have doubled the funding for homeland security in 2003 \ncompared to 2002. That is a result of 9/11, and appropriately so. The \nbudget we have before us increases it another 18.4 percent. We have \nalready increased homeland security an additional $3.5 billion as a \nresult of passage of the Cochran amendment.\n  Senator Clinton's amendment would just bump it up another $3.5 \nbillion. That would be an enormous percentage increase. Right now, we \nhave funds for homeland security State by State that are not being \nspent, for whatever reason. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Two minutes will be provided for debate, \nequally divided on each side.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This amendment adds $1.019 billion to the total amount in \nthe bill for veterans discretionary programs. The amendment is paid for \nby a decrease in the tax cut in an equal amount, in addition to the \nadditional spending on veterans programs that would be available to \nreduce the deficit.\n  With respect to veterans programs, let me say to the chairman and \nranking member, I think they did some good work with respect to \nveterans medical care. They did actually add some money for veterans \nhealth care, veterans medical care. We all commend them for that.\n  We are still very short with respect to veterans programs dealing \nwith research, with construction, with the administration that is \nneeded in order to process the requests by veterans. There is a rather \nlengthy time lag in being able to process the request. The fact is, we \nneed to provide sufficient moneys for this service.\n  At a time when veterans are in the field prosecuting this war, we \nought to say we will keep our promise to veterans.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against Senator Dorgan's \namendment, which proposes to add an additional $1 billion to VA \ndiscretionary accounts. I so vote because the budget resolution, as \nreported by the Budget committee, already makes significant additions \nin funding for veterans benefits. It is, I think, already a fair and \njust allocation of funding for veterans.\n  It seems to be the case that no matter how much funding is made \navailable in a budget resolution, someone will always propose \nadditions. For veterans this year, the budget resolution, as reported, \ncontains unprecedented increases in VA discretionary funding; it \nincreases VA discretionary funding by $3.4 billion over fiscal year \n2003 levels, a 13 percent increase. The Budget Committee-reported \nresolution more than doubles the administration's proposed VA medical \ncare funding increase of $1.5 billion, adding an additional $1.8 \nbillion to this most critical budget account, as urged by Senators \nJohnson and Ensign in the Budget Committee's markup. In fairness, it is \naccurate to conclude that funding levels approved by the Budget \ncommittee do not shortchange veterans.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment would add funds to non-medical care-\nrelated accounts, such as construction, research, veterans cemetery \nadministration, and veterans benefits processing. These are important \naccounts--and they have been increased significantly in recent years. \nSince 1997, Congress has provided funds to support a 40 percent \nincrease in staffing for compensation claims processing. VA medical \nresearch funding has increased by 47 percent Veterans cemetery \nadministration funding has increased by 71 percent. Funding for the VA \ninspector general's office has almost doubled. And over 2.5 billion \ndollars' worth of major and minor construction projects have been \nfunded. The present resolution will improve on this record by providing \na 13\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\npercent increase above 2003 enacted levels for such accounts. \nConstruction funding alone will increase by 62 percent over the 2003 \nenacted levels.\n  I would like to see even greater increases; it would always be nice \nto add more funding for various worthwhile purposes. But, in fairness, \nveterans benefits must be considered along with proposed increases in \neducation, health care, environmental protection, and many other \nworthwhile Federal programs. Viewed in this context, I think the \nproposed budget allocation is fair and just.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Dorgan, to \nincrease the amount of discretionary funding for veterans programs. I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment--one that will \ngo a long way in ensuring that our Nation's veterans receive the \nbenefits to which they are entitled.\n  As you know, every year a coalition of our Nation's veterans advocacy \ngroups comes together to compile the Independent Budget. This \ndocument--written by veterans for veterans--offers guidance to the \nCongress on the projected needs of our Nation's veterans in the coming \nfiscal year. I am pleased that during last week's markup of the Budget \nResolution, the Senate Budget Committee, with my support, adopted an \namendment to match the amount included in the Independent Budget to \nadequately provide medical care for the 6.5 million veterans enrolled \nin the VA health care system. This represented a nearly $2 billion \nincrease over the funding level requested by the President.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment will build upon this success by helping to \nprovide additional resources to appropriately fund other key functions \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Dorgan amendment adds $1.019 \nbillion to the total for veterans discretionary programs to match the \namount identified as necessary by the Independent Budget. Among other \nthings, these funds will be utilized to significantly boost VA medical \nand prosthetics research, improve the processing of veterans benefits, \nfund much needed construction, renovation and maintenance projects, and \nensure that are veterans are buried with honor.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's veterans, like the men and women in Iraq \ntoday, answered the call of their nation--marching into harm's way to \npreserve the ideals of liberty and democracy which we, as Americans, \nhold so dear. In my view, making sure that our veterans receive \nadequate and timely health care and the other benefits to which they \nare entitled is a small price to pay to express our continued gratitude \nfor their unwavering service to our nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. I \nthink this is another case where I said no matter what we do in \ncommittee, no matter how much we add, someone is going to come up and \nsay it is not enough. We increased the veterans budget altogether over \n12 percent, $3.4 billion. We did 10 percent over the President's \nrequest, about $3 billion. We did a 14.7 percent increase in veterans \nhealth care.\n  This amendment not only has more increases but, in addition, it also \nreduces the tax cut. We are taking care of our veterans in this \nproposal with enormous percentage increases. I urge my colleagues to \nvote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n385.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 328 and 282, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and \npass amendment No. 328, sponsored by Senators Wyden and Kyl, regarding \nthe national fire plan; and amendment No. 282, by Senator Brownback, \nregarding a commission to review the efficiency of Federal agencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Wyden, for \n     himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     328.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase investments in implementation of the National \n     Fire Plan to benefit national forests, the environment, local \n                    communities and local economies)\n\n       On page 16, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 12, increase the amount by $325,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 16, increase the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 20, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 24, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 3, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 2, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 3, decrease the amount by $325,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 7, decrease the amount by $85,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 11, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 15, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 19, decrease the amount by $15,000,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Very briefly, amendment No. 328 is a bipartisan amendment \nthat Senator Kyl and I have cosponsored with Senator Domenici, Senator \nBingaman, and others. It deals with the national fire plan. Suffice it \nto say, Senators know that the West over the last few summers has just \nbeen an inferno. We expect another very hot summer. This legislation is \na bipartisan initiative which would allow us to set aside additional \nfunds for forest restoration, hazardous fuels reduction and fire \nresearch, and real on-the-ground collaboration with States and \nlocalities to help them improve their environment and protect against \ncatastrophic fire. It is backed by the timber industry and a host of \nenvironmental groups. I see my colleague from Arizona on the floor as \nwell.\n  It is a bipartisan amendment on which Western Senators cooperated. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. Senator, let me add to the comments of my colleague from \nOregon. I compliment him for the work he has done. This is a good \nexample of bipartisanship in working to solve a\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nnational problem. The people from the Appropriations Committee, the \nadministration, and the Democratic and Republican Parties in the Senate \nhave come together to restore some of these funds so we could help to \ncreate healthy forests for the benefit of all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendments Nos. 328 and 282 en \nbloc.\n  The amendments (No. 328 and No. 282) were agreed to en bloc.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 339, as Modified\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the next amendment we will have will be \nby the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux. There will be a 10-minute \ntime limitation. It is a very large amendment. I ask that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment and send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $10,433,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by

OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we have worked in a bipartisan fashion. \nThis amendment is sponsored by myself, Senator Voinovich from Ohio, \nSenator Baucus, and also Senator Snowe. We have believed there ought to \nbe a way of reaching an agreement on the size of the tax cut that is \nreasonable and more balanced than the $626 billion tax cut currently \npending before the Senate.\n  There are some who have suggested that we would like to have no tax \ncut whatsoever. That would probably be the better course of action, if \nwe could find the votes to do that, because conditions are dramatically \ndifferent from what they were the last time we considered a major tax \ncut.\n  The last time we did a tax cut, we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. We do \nnot have that surplus. In fact, we have a $300 billion deficit facing \nus. There is no pot of money to which we can go to have a large tax cut \nof that magnitude.\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nIn addition to that, we are at war. We are not at peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is my belief that if this amendment \npassed, we would take the growth out of the growth package. I call upon \nmy colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has claimed the 1 \nminute in opposition. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I make a point of order. I understood that \nthe Budget chairman asked that we have 10 minutes on this because of \nthe importance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request was for 10 minutes on the vote. \nAmendments have been given 2 minutes on each side, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5 \nminutes on each side for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the distinguished chairman. I apologize for the \nmisunderstanding. I will ask the cosponsors if they would like to make \na comment.\n  The point is that we are at war. Turn on the television. Our men and \nwomen are fighting in the deserts of Iraq right now. We are being asked \nto cut tax revenues by $626 billion to pay for those functions. It \nwould be one thing if we had a surplus out of which to take it. We do \nnot. We are taking it out of a deficit. We are cutting taxes at a time \nof uncertainty while we are in the middle of a war. If we do need a tax \ncut of that magnitude, I would suggest we do it after the conflict is \nover, after we know how much it has cost, after we know how much we \nneed to spend on programs such as Medicare and prescription drugs which \nare not included in this budget whatsoever.\n  The better course of action would be to adopt our amendment. It \npresents a $350 billion tax cut, which is half of what is pending right \nnow, and it uses the remainder of those savings, which would be $275 \nbillion, for deficit reduction.\n  Some may say, ``That is not what I would like to do,'' but I think \nthis is something that is politically possible to accomplish. We can \nalways come back and increase the tax cut. That will be easy to do, if \nwe know how much money we have to deal with. We simply do not know that \nnow.\n  The wiser course of action would be to do what this amendment would \ndo. I ask for a favorable vote for the bipartisan amendment.\n  I reserve any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our amendment is straightforward, \nresponsible and practical. It reflects the reality of the confluence of \ncircumstances we face--a war on terrorism and in Iraq, a struggling \neconomy, increased homeland security needs, and increased Federal \ndeficits, with this year's projected deficit already having increased \nby more than 54 percent.\n  The amendment is a carefully calibrated, balanced approach to respond \nto two compelling needs--first, to provide immediate, short-term \nstimulus to an economy that has lost 2.3 million jobs and, second, to \navoid driving up deficits over the long term which, in turn, lead to \nincreased long-term interest rates that would stagnate our economy.\n  Our approach is simple--we differentiate between those aspects of the \ngrowth package that truly provide quick, short-term economic stimulus \nand those that do not. For those that don't, let's debate them later, \nand if they have merit, let's pay for them as we go, not with deficit \nspending that threatens our economy in the future as well as our \nability to address pressing national priorities such as strengthening \nSocial Security and Medicare as baby boomers begin to retire in 2008.\n  Mr. President, our measure provides a ``right-sized'' stimulus of \n$350 billion while committing $376 billion to deficit reduction. It \ndeserves strong bipartisan support, and I hope my colleagues will vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Breaux \namendment to S. Con. Res. 23, the budget resolution. This amendment \ndirects the Finance Committee to limit the amount of tax cuts that \ncould be passed through the fast track reconciliation procedure to $350 \nbillion over 11 years. The budget before us includes over twice that \nmuch in its so-called must pass economic stimulus package.\n  It is astounding to me that, on the eve of war, we are seriously \ncontemplating $725 billion in tax cuts in the same budget that does not \ninclude a dime for the war or its associated costs. Our budget is a \nstatement of priorities. Do we really mean to say that giving a tax \nbreak primarily to upper income taxpayers is 725 billion times more \nimportant than adequately fighting the war, rebuilding Iraq, and \nprotecting our communities for relatiatory terrorist attacks?\n  Of course not. No one thinks that. But I do believe that some are \nusing the diversion of war to rush through a tax cut that is fiscally \nirresponsible. No one wants to return to the days of deficit as far as \nthe eye can see and debt capable of dragging our country down for \ndecades. but that is what we'll get when we add a $725 billion tax cut \nto the necessary and massive costs of the war.\n  The Breaux amendment brings the fast-tract tax cut down to $350 \nbillion. I would prefer it to go much lower than that. In fact, I would \nprefer delaying all tax cuts and spending increases until we can put \ntogether an honest budget that looks at what we can afford to do in \nlight of what we must do. But if the choice is between $725 billion for \nan ill-timed, ill-conceived idea and $350 billion for an ill-timed, \nill-conceived idea, I will pick the latter and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nreject the Breaux amendment to the budget resolution that would reduce \nthe size of the President's growth and jobs plan to $350 billion. I \nthink my colleagues all recognize that such a drastic reduction in the \nsize of the growth package would make it most difficult for the Finance \nCommittee to include the Bush proposal to eliminate the taxation on \ncorporate dividends.\n  I know that a number of my colleagues have their doubts about the \nPresident's proposal to eliminate the double tax on dividends, and I \nwould like to take a few moments to try to persuade them to support the \nPresident's proposal. Today, I will address two aspects of this \nimportant issue--how ending this double tax will help today's seniors, \nand how ending the double tax will impact our Nation's economic future.\n  First, let us talk about how the double taxation of dividends affects \nolder Americans.\n  Our Nation's seniors have spent decades working long, hard hours, \nscrimping and saving for a well-deserved retirement, only to find that \nno matter how old they get, the tax man still has them in his sights. \nAge brings wisdom, but not tax relief.\n  Fifteen or 20 years ago, it was common tax-planning wisdom to defer \none's income until the retirement years. Why? Because the tax rate \nfaced by seniors was almost always lower then the tax rate paid during \none's working years. Unfortunately, this is generally no longer the \ncase. Millions of senior citizens are now paying taxes at as high or \nhigher a rate in retirement than they did during their working years.\n  This year, I want to help President Bush change all that. The \nPresident has a plan for cutting taxes for seniors, and I intend to \nwork with him to put his plan into law. We want to dramatically reduce \nthe marriage penalty for seniors, we want to expand the 10-percent \nincome tax bracket, and we want to speed up all of the rate cuts that \nare scheduled to be phased in over the next few years.\n  And on top of all that we want to eliminate the double tax on the \ndividends that seniors receive. This is the right plan for America's \nseniors.\n  All of the items in the President's plan are good ideas, but as I \nmentioned, today I would like to put particular focus on ending the \ndouble tax on dividends.\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\n  Over half of all income tax filers over 65 years of age pay tax on \ndividends, and over one-third of all filers between 55 and 64 have \ntaxable dividends. People saving for retirement, and people close to \nretirement or working for an early retirement are paying a double tax.\n  Why do we call this tax on dividends a double tax? This is because \nunder current law, a corporation hands over more than a third of its \nprofits to the Federal Government in taxes, and then when investors get \ntheir share of those profits in the form of dividends, we demand that \ninvestors have to pay regular income tax on those very same dividends.\n  As President Bush keeps reminding us, taking income once is fair, but \ntaxing it twice is not.\n  By the time State taxes are factored in, the combined Federal and \nState tax rate can exceed 71 percent. This is wrong, and it distorts \nthe economy and correcting it will give many benefits to taxpayers and \nto the Nation as a whole.\n  We need to remember that this is not a question of rich versus poor. \nOlder Americans with modest incomes receive substantial stock \ndividends. In fact, more than half of tax filers over the age of 65 \nearning between $30,000 and $40,000 per year receive taxable dividend \nincome: 50.9 percent, to be exact. And because our Nation's senior \ncitizens have been so thrifty during their lives, these dividend \npayments are very often sizable.\n  Elderly Americans who receive dividends and earn between $30,000 and \n$40,000 per year in total income receive an average of $2,008 every \nyear of that income as taxable dividends. Even retirees who earn \n$15,000 to $30,000 per year receive substantial dividends. Forth-four \npercent of the elderly in this category receive dividends, and these \nAmericans have to pay a double tax on over $1,400 a year in dividends.\n  Older Americans across the income spectrum pay a double tax on their \ndividends, and it is time to end it. This will be a great boon to our \nNation's elderly who have worked and saved throughout their lives for \ntheir retirement.\n  Now, I would like to turn to our Nation's economic future. A few \nweeks ago, Chairman Greespan came up to Capitol Hill and told us that \nending the double tax dividends was good tax policy, but he wanted us \nto do it in a fiscally responsible manner. Now, think it is fiscally \nresponsible to end the double tax on dividends. I have no doubt that \nthe static revenue estimate for the President's proposal is far too \nhigh.\n\n  Over my 27 years in the Senate, I have seen time and time again that \ntax cuts turned out to cost a lot less than the official estimates. We \nsaw it on the capital gains tax cut and we have seen it in other tax \ncuts too. And with a policy that is as good for the economy's long-run \nhealth as ending the double tax, I am confident that the official \nrevenue estimates are going to be far worse than usual. This tax cut is \ngoing to change the way America does business, and it will increase \nsavings and capital formation.\n  This is not just my opinion. The Heritage Foundation has used a \nmainstream economic model to look at how ending the double tax is \nlikely to help the economy. They conclude that ending the double tax \nwill be revenue-neutral by year 9. So even if Congress lets spending \ngrow at the projected rate, this proposal is an 8-year investment in \nour economy's longrun health, and then it starts to pay for itself.\n  Now I would like to see spending grow slower than the projected rate, \nso that we can balance the budget faster and so we can increase the \nsize of the private sector, but even if Congress fails to slow down \nspending, this is still good longrun tax policy. If people think that \nending the double tax on dividends will blow a permanent hole in the \nbudget, they are living in a world of pure static-model fantasy.\n  In addition, I should point out that the Heritage economic model \ncompletely ignored the long-term structural reforms that this tax cut \nwill bring about, reforms that will reduce the risk of future corporate \nbankruptcies. I am going to discuss those reforms in just a moment. So \nI believe that those 9-year-break-even estimates should be treated as a \nworst case scenario.\n  That is why I believe that ending the double tax on dividends is \nfiscally responsible. I have already addressed how this will help \nmiddle-income retirees. Now I would like to delve into why I am \nconvinced this is good for our economy's future. On this issue, I would \nlike to quote Chairman Greenspan. This is what the Federal Reserve \nChairman said a few weeks ago:\n\n       I have always supported the elimination of the double \n     taxation of dividends because I think it is a major factor \n     restraining flexibility in our economy . . . and moving in \n     the direction of improving flexibility has very large long-\n     term payoffs.\n\n  Flexibility is an issue that Mr. Greenspan has emphasized a lot \nlately. He has reminded us, again and again, that our Government should \ndo everything it can to make our economy as flexible as possible. Why \ndoes he want a flexible economy?\n  This is what he said, and I quote: ``The more flexible an economy, \nthe greater its ability to self-correct in response to inevitable . . . \ndisturbances, thus reducing the size'' of recessions. In plain English, \nhe believes that if our economy is more flexible, then we will have \nsmaller recessions, and less unemployment.\n  Further, Chairman Greenspan believes that Congress can do something \nabout this. Congress can make the economy more flexible if we enact \ngood policies, and we can make the economy less flexible if we enact \nbad policies. He said, and I quote, ``We should be placing special \nemphasis on searching for policies that will engineer still greater \neconomic flexibility and [we should be] dismantling policies that \ncontribute to unnecessary rigidity.''\n  And as the Chairman said, the double tax on dividends is a source of \nrigidity.\n  You might ask: How is cutting taxes supposed to make our economy more \nflexible?\n  Ending the double tax on dividends helps in two major ways: It cuts \nthe risk of bankruptcy and it helps to make sure that investment funds \nflow to the right companies. Let me address these in order.\n  Why is it America's corporations load up on debt financing, despite \nthe fact that high debt levels increase the risk of bankruptcy? Because \nour Nation's tax laws have always given them massive financial \nincentives to do just that.\n  The reason is simple. When a corporation pays interest to \nbondholders, that payment is taxed once--at the shareholder level. But \nwhen it pays dividends to stockholders, that payment is taxed twice--to \nboth the corporation and the shareholder.\n  As leading finance scholars Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers write: \n``[T]he . . . United States tax system clearly favors debt over equity \nfinancing.'' If you tax stock payments twice but you only tax debt \npayments once, it is clear what companies are going to do--they will \nfinance most of their business by borrowing.\n  By loading up on tax deductible bonds and bank loans rather than \nissuing new shares of stock, corporations, increase their chance of \ngoing bankrupt. We have seen this play out with WorldCom, with US Air, \nand most recently United Airlines. The media's refrain is always the \nsame: ``Today, a Fortune 500 company, burdened with debt, filed for \nprotection from its creditors.''\n  Our Tax Code should not encourage this behavior.\n  When corporations load up on debt, they commit too much of their cash \nflow to making interest payments, and the threat of bankruptcy becomes \nall too real. Once we change this policy, businesses will find that \nthey have people lined up out the door to buy stocks that pay \ndividends. When companies see the clamor for dividend-paying stocks, \nthey will have a much stronger incentive to pay for new projects and \nnew factories by issuing new shares of stock rather than running to the \nbank for a loan.\n\n  And then if times get tough, businesses will not be as likely to \ndeclare bankruptcy and head to Federal court for a painful \nreorganization. Instead, many companies will be able to cut their \ndividend to shareholders, and continue business more or less as usual. \nLower dividends are bad news for shareholders, to be sure; but it will \nspare society the pain of bankruptcy.\n  Ending the double tax on dividends will not end the business cycle, \nbut it will make it easier to recover from a recession. Bankruptcies \nspread the\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\npain of recession over months and years, and it can destroy sound \ncompanies that made the mistake of overpromising to banks and \nbondholders. This will not end bankruptcy, but it will prevent a few \nbig ones now and then.\n  And this is not some untested pie-in-the-sky theory. All but two of \nour major trading partners give some kind of relief from the double tax \non dividends. And the two countries that do not give relief--Ireland \nand Switzerland--already have much lower corporate tax rates than we \ndo, so their double tax problem is not as bad as ours.\n  The mere fact that other countries are doing something does not prove \nthat it is the right thing for the United States. What we want to know \nis, will our Nation get real, widespread benefits when we get rid of \nthe double tax? Here we have to look at history.\n  New Zealand used to have a double tax on dividends, but they got rid \nof it in 1988. And what happened when they did that? When New Zealand \ncompletely eliminated the double tax on dividends, corporate debt \nlevels fell, just as you would expect. Ending the double tax on \ndividends cut corporate debt levels in New Zealand, and ending the \ndouble tax on dividends will cut debt levels here, too. And our economy \nwill be safer for it.\n  The Bush proposal to eliminate the double taxation of dividends will \nhave a very positive effect on the economy, on seniors, on the tax \nsystem, and on taxpayers in general. I urge my colleagues to reject the \nBreaux amendment on the budget resolution, so that the Finance \nCommittee can accommodate the dividends proposal in the tax bill we \nwill be putting together in a few weeks.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment offered by \nmy good friend from Louisiana, Senator Breaux. The amendment, which was \nNo. 339 and has been described as the moderates tax amendment, would \nhave reduced the size of the tax cut in the budget resolution from more \nthan $700 billion to $350 billion. I would like the record to reflect \nexactly why it is that I voted for this amendment.\n  I voted for the amendment offered by Senator Breaux because it \npresented our best chance to cut the size of the irresponsible tax cut \nin this budget. Let me be clear, Mr. President, I do not support a $350 \nbillion tax cut as part of this budget. Had the Breaux amendment \npassed, I would have sought further reductions in the tax cut.\n  Today, America is at war in Iraq. We have troops in Afghanistan and \nthe Philippines. We are fighting to keep our homeland safe from \nterrorism. We have pressing needs in health care, education, and other \nareas. The Nation is running deficits. State and local governments are \nin fiscal crisis. The economy is slumping. For these reasons, a $350 \nbillion tax cut, just like a $700 billion tax cut, is wrong. Both \nproposals will dump debt on our children. And the President's plan is \nnot only too big, but it unfairly favors the wealthiest among us over \nworking families.\n  I have filed at the desk an amendment to this budget that I believe \ncharts the right course. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level in \n10 years. Some 300,000 Americans lost their jobs in February. State and \nlocal governments are in trouble. Families and businesses are hurting. \nWe are running huge deficits, and we are at war.\n  Our economy needs help. Working families need help. But we shouldn't \nbe burdening future generations with more debt. My amendment provides \nfor a $150 billion tax cut for all Americans this year and next and it \nis paid for in the outyears. It will stimulate our economy without \nsticking our kids with the bill.\n  Without taking a dime out of Social Security or Medicare, we can give \nevery American worker a one-time payroll tax holiday of more than $750 \nthat is far more than President Bush's tax plan. We could pass a \ntemporary job creation tax credit and help small businesses, all \nwithout adding to the ``debt tax'' on future generations.\n  It we pass the budget now before us--if we pass the President's \nplan--we will be spending our kids' money--and that is wrong. We need a \ntax cut that goes to working people who will spend the money--and we \nneed a tax cut that is paid for. Let's do what is right and pass a real \nstimulus package, and let us do what average Americans do: Let's pay \nfor it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, obviously we need to be very bold in our \nresponse to the flagging economy. It is our obligation to the folks who \nsent us here. We need to respond. Both sides agree on that need, as do \nthe centrists led by Senators Breaux and Snowe. The question is a \ndifference of the size of the tax cut. I say be bold. We want American \nbusinesses, small and large, to grow. We want every American who wants \na job to be able to get a job. We don't want to take any chances.\n  I understand the concerns of my friends from the centrist coalition. \nThey are worried about long-term deficits. I am as well. I am more \nworried, though, about the spending side of the ledger. Senators Breaux \nand Snowe have a long history of trying to secure bipartisan consensus. \nWe need more than $350 billion in tax relief to do the job the right \nway.\n  Don't get me wrong. If $350 billion is the number, that is the number \nthat, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I will work with. \nThe Finance Committee will develop the best package we can. My point \nis, the Finance Committee can do more growth incentives with a number \nabove $350 billion.\n  There is a war going on. When those men and women come home from the \nbattlefield, we want a growing economy so that those folks will have \njobs.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues the \nfact that the budget deficit for 2003 and 2004, including Social \nSecurity and the cost of the war, is going to be over $500 billion. \nAgain, in 2003 and 2004, including Social Security, it will be a half \ntrillion dollars.\n  This amendment basically says the tax package will be at $350 \nbillion. It also says if this Congress decides to go over $350 billion, \nwe ought to offset it either by cutting expenses or, in the \nalternative, increasing other taxes that are less stimulative to the \neconomy, and paying for a tax reduction that is more stimulative to the \neconomy. It makes sense.\n  We are on the edge of a fiscal crisis in this country if we keep \ngoing the way we are, particularly with the war that is hanging over us \ntoday.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. I have great respect for my colleagues from Louisiana and \nOhio, and the others who have sponsored the amendment. But it would \nbasically gut the President's growth package, cut it in half. The \nactual tax cut would be $323 billion. We have an economy that is over \n$10 trillion or $11 trillion per year. Estimated revenues over this \nperiod of time are going to be $27 billion. If you want to make some \nchanges that really stimulate and grow the economy and create jobs, I \nthink the President has the proposal to do so. I am afraid that the \nproposal that would have $323 billion just would not do it. When we \nreduced the capital gains tax in 1997 from 28 to 20 percent, we created \na lot of growth. That was a positive thing to do.\n  The President has a good proposal to grow the economy as well. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the President and a real growth package that \nwould really create jobs.\n  Then, on the concern for deficit reduction, I heard some people say \nit, but I don't see the votes showing the same conviction on deficit \nreduction with all the add-ons that we have been looking at in the last \ncouple of days.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There are 2 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will conclude my comments on this \namendment by saying I think those who are concerned about fiscal \ndiscipline should be concerned about the state of the economy of this \ncountry. We are at war. We are not at peace.\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\n  We do not have a surplus of $5.6 trillion as we had the last time we \ndid a major tax cut. We have no surplus at all. We are in deficit and \nwe are increasing the deficit by a huge amount of money at a time of \nwar and uncertainty in this country.\n  I think the conservative thing to do is be more careful with tax \ncuts. They are great things politically, but they are not free; we have \nto pay for them. We would be paying for it out of the deficit, and I \nthink that is a serious mistake. We need to be responsible, and this \namendment brings about a degree of responsibility that we all should be \nable to support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma has \n2 minutes and the Senator from Louisiana has--\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will not yield my time back. I have 2 other cosponsors \nwho would like to be heard.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I want to make a couple of points. This amendment is \nstraightforward, practical, prudent, proportional; it is a carefully \ncalibrated approach in terms of whether we can afford a certain size \ngrowth plan. That is why we made the decision.\n  It wasn't a question of splitting the difference; it was a question \nof making a distinction in terms of what constitutes a stimulus, what \nwe can afford to pay for, and what we cannot afford to pay for. That is \nhow I approached this amendment.\n  I think it is important that we think carefully if we want to provide \ndeficit financing for nonstimulative proposals. Finally, I should make \nthe point that we see deficits way into the future, until the year \n2013, at a time in which we have to address Social Security and \nMedicare. We cannot diminish our ability to address those critical \nprograms and the challenges they face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have two additional points: One, we have \nnever reduced taxes in a time of war. That is not the American way. We \ndo not reduce taxes in a time of war. I ask you to just look at the TV \nscreens. We are going to be over there for quite a while, in one way or \nanother.\n  Two, there are many ways to stimulate the economy, not only through \ntax reductions. It is also by spending. We are spending dollars on \nhomeland security. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, most individuals in this body support \nsome size of growth package. A few were at zero, a few at $140 billion, \nsome $350 billion, and some are with the President's package, which is \n$696 billion--$725 billion if you add refundables.\n  I yield time to Senator Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. He put together a very responsible budget that includes a \nsizable tax cut--much more than the $350 billion that this amendment \ntalks about. He eliminates the deficit within the 10-year period. It \nwas a hard decision to make, but we need to cut taxes in order to \nstimulate the economy, if we really want to have the revenues as we \nmove out in order to help pay for the war. We know that it is static \nscoring.\n\n  The President has come up with a plan that will truly stimulate the \neconomy. I think the chairman of the Finance Committee has come up with \nan equally effective plan. We need to support the tax cut.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time is that, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. First, I believe we have an \nexcellent budget. Frankly, we are charged with a lot of things that we \nare going to try to do. Most important, we have to find something that \nwill stimulate this economy. I, frankly, believe the President has come \nup with something very innovative, exciting, and it is apt to work; \nthat is, to change the longstanding double taxation of dividends.\n  Frankly, I am not sure we know how to stimulate this economy with \nreference to tax cuts, but I do believe we know how to make this \neconomy work far better if we change that part of our Tax Code. I think \nwe should leave the tax numbers as they are and vote the amendment \ndown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 386 to Amendment No. 339, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 386 to amendment number 339, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the reconciliation instruction by $375 billion, \n  reduce the size of tax cuts allowed by $980 billion,

I ask for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment simply holds the size of the \ntax cut to $350 billion. Any tax cuts beyond $350 billion would have to \nbe offset under my amendment or they would face a budget point of order \nrequiring 60 votes. Many colleagues may say, wait a minute, I thought \nthat was what the underlying amendment does. The underlying amendment \nstill allows for $940 billion in tax cuts in the future. It does reduce \ndown to $350 billion the amount of tax cut under reconciliation, but it \nstill allows for $600 billion more in tax cuts.\n  My amendment says $350 billion, and cap it at that. No more. Any tax \nbreaks beyond that would either have to be offset or it would require \n60 votes to overcome a point of order. It is very simple. It is a cap \nof $350 billion on tax cuts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute in opposition to the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nhave had great cooperation on this bill. We have not had second-degree \namendments. We have tried to avoid them and be expeditious.\n  We have not seen this amendment. I do know the effect of this \namendment would be in the outyears we would be taking a 10-percent rate \nand making it 15 percent. I do know in the outyears we would eliminate \nthe marriage penalty relief. I do know the effect of it would be reduce \nthe child tax credit from $1,000 to $500.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of a motion to table the Harkin \namendment. I make that motion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I make the motion to table the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized for 1 minute on his \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the budget resolution currently before the \nSenate cuts funding for Amtrak by almost 22 percent. There is no \nquestion that this funding level will put Amtrak into bankruptcy during \nthe next fiscal year. We must not let that happen. The bipartisan \nAmtrak board of directors has stated that Amtrak needs $1.8 billion \nnext year to operate all its trains and make a minimum level of capital \ninvestment. That board includes several Republicans.\n  This amendment that I offer with Senator Lautenberg would fund Amtrak \nat that $1.8 billion level. It is paid for by reducing the tax cut by \njust $900 million for 1 year. We need to stop having our national \npassenger railroad service just survive from one financial crisis to \nthe next. We need to allow the next president of Amtrak to continue to \nreform Amtrak, rather than oversee its liquidation.\n  I encourage all Senators to save rail service in this country and \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Byrd \namendment to the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution to increase \nAmtrak's budget in fiscal year 2004 from $900 million to $1.8 billion \nbecause this level of funding is critical for Amtrak's continued \noperations next year. Without this additional funding, Amtrak would be \nforced to entirely shut down its operations.\n  This amendment does not take funding from the President's $726 \nbillion growth package. This additional $900 million is offset from the \n$600 billion in tax cuts over the 10 years just as the $1.8 billion, \naccepted by Senator Nickles, on the Kennedy amendment to add to the \nPell Grants.\n  I am committed to the specified tax cuts over the next 10 years and \nthere will be ample time to reallocate the $900 million for Amtrak as \nwell as the $1.8 billion for the Pell Grants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this \namendment. I have the greatest respect for Senator Byrd and his support \nof Amtrak. I happen to be a supporter of Amtrak. But the net essence of \nthis amendment would be to double the amount of money we have for \nAmtrak. We proposed $900 million. That happens to be what the \nDepartment of Transportation has requested. I remind our colleagues, a \nfew years ago we were going to say that Amtrak would not need subsidies \nby this year.\n  If you look, this would more than double the amount of money. The \nlargest subsidy it has ever received was last year and that was because \nof the supplemental, so to go from $490 million to 1.8 is more than \ndoubling the Federal subsidies to Amtrak. Right now the cost in some \ncases from city to city exceeds that of air passenger service. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n387.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.

Mr. President, I have offered this amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senators Dodd, Daschle, Feingold, Bingaman, Murray, Reed, \nCantwell, and Collins. This amendment increases the maximum Pell grant \nby $500 at a total cost of $1.8 billion. It pays for those changes by \nreducing the nonreconciliation tax cut by $1.8 billion. If we do not \naccept this amendment, there will be 110,000 young people who are \nattending colleges who will lose their Pell grants. With the acceptance \nof this amendment, there will be more than 200,000 new Pell grant \nrecipients, and it will help immeasurably the 4.9 million Pell grant \nrecipients who come from families who average $15,000 in income.\n       Among the education community and students, there is broad-\n     based support for increasing the maximum Pell grant. The \n     following groups have stated their support:\n       American Council on Education.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       United Negro College Fund.\n       Coalition of Higher Education Organizations.\n       Unites States Public Interest Research Group.\n       United States Students' Association.\n       The National Association of State Universities and Land \n     Grant Colleges.\n       National Association of Community College Trustees.\n       Student Aid Alliance--an umbrella group of over 60 higher \n     education organizations which includes the groups I just \n     mentioned, as well as: American Association of Colleges of \n     Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, \n     American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, \n     American Association of College Registrars and Admissions \n     Officers, American Association for Higher Education, American \n     Association of University Professors, American College \n     Personnel Association, American College Testing, American \n     Dental Education Association, American Indian Higher \n     Education Consortium, American Jewish Congress, American \n     Psychological Association, American Society for Engineering \n     Education, American Student Association of Community \n     Colleges, APPA: The Association of Higher Education \n     Facilities Officers, Association of Academic Health Centers, \n     Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools, \n     Association of American Law Schools, Association of American \n     Medical Colleges, Association of Governing Boards of \n     Universities and Colleges, Association of Jesuit Colleges and \n     Universities, Career College Association, Citizen's \n     Scholarship Foundation of America, Coalition of Higher \n     Education Assistance Organizations, College and University \n     Personnel Association for Human Resources, College Board, \n     College Parents of America, Council for Advancement and \n     Support of Education, Council for Christian Colleges and \n     Universities, Council on Government Relations, Council of \n     Graduate Schools, Council for Higher Education Accreditation, \n     Council of Independent Colleges, Council for Opportunity in \n     Education, Educational Testing Service, Hispanic Association \n     of Colleges and Universities, Lutheran Educational Conference \n     of North America, NAFSA: Association of International \n     Educators, National Association for College Admission \n     Counseling, National Association of College and University \n     Business Officers, National Association for Equal Opportunity \n     in Higher Education, National Association of Graduate and \n     Professional Students, National Association of State Student \n     Grant and Aid Programs, National Association of Student \n     Financial Aid Administrators, National Association of Student \n     Personnel Administrators, National College Access Network, \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association, National Council of \n     University Research Administrators, National Education \n     Association, NAWE: Advancing Women in Higher Education, \n     University Continuing Education Association, and the Women's \n     College Coalition.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some of the letters from \nthese organizations in support of this amendment and in support of \nincreasing the maximum Pell grant be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Committee for\n\n\n                                            Education Funding,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Member,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: The Committee for Education Funding, a \n     nonpartisan coalition of 110 organizations reflecting the \n     broad spectrum of the education community, strongly urges you \n     to vote against passage of the House FY04 Budget Resolution, \n     H. Con. Res. 95, reported out by the Budget Committee on \n     March 12, 2003 and support amendments that restore cuts and \n     increase education investment substantially. The Budget \n     Resolution assumes a cut of 3 percent below the President's \n     already low request for discretionary spending for education \n     and related programs in Function 500, which includes vital \n     funding for No Child Left Behind, students with disabilities, \n     higher education, research, Head Start, and adult, vocational \n     and technical education, and libraries. It also assumes \n     terminating 46 important education programs totaling $1.6 \n     billion. Moreover, it calls for a draconian cut of $9.7 \n     billion over ten years for mandatory education spending on \n     critical programs such as school lunch and student loans.\n       The budget resolution is especially objectionable in light \n     of the urgent fiscal crisis in education resources at the \n     state level; the escalating costs of federal standards and \n     accountability requirements on elementary and secondary \n     schools; and the explosion of enrollments of low-income \n     postsecondary students. The federal commitment to education \n     is now more crucial than ever to carry out school reform and \n     ensure access to higher education for millions of students.\n       Again, we urge you to vote against the House Budget \n     Resolution and support amendments that restore education cuts \n     and make substantial increased education investments to move \n     education from the current 2.8 cents on the federal budget \n     dollar toward at least five cents and strengthen our economic \n     and national security and the quality of education for all of \n     America's students. Finally, we ask you to oppose amendments \n     that increase funding for one education program by cutting \n     another education program. Thank you for your support of \n     education.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dan Fuller,\n       President.\n     Edward R. Kealy,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Student Aid Alliance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Re: support Kennedy-Dodd amendment on Pell grants.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Student Aid Alliance--a \n     coalition of over 60 higher education organizations \n     representing students, parents, college presidents, financial \n     aid administrators and others--we write to urge you to \n     support an amendment to the FY 2004 Budget Resolution that \n     will increase the Federal Pell Grant maximum grant by $450 to \n     $4,500.\n       Should the funding of the Pell Grants increase by $1.8 \n     billion, as proposed in the amendment, more low-income and \n     first-generation students can pursue their higher education \n     dreams. Many of these students are consumed with worry that \n     the poor performance of the economy has seriously jeopardized \n     their hope of college attendance. They are right to worry. \n     Their concerns have a documented basis in fact: data from the \n     Department of Education show that qualified low-income \n     students are still only half as likely to enroll in a four-\n     year institution.\n       The federal government's investment in student financial \n     aid is less than one percent of federal spending, but as \n     states continue to pull away from providing resources to the \n     needy students, and as more students choose to pursue a \n     college education, federal funding becomes even more \n     essential.\n       Finally, the consequences of the Pell Grant amendment on \n     the federal budget are negligible, but its consequences for \n     the students in your state are significant. For them, it may \n     mean the difference between going to college or not, or \n     staying in college or not.\n       We strongly urge you to vote in favor of this important \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Ward,\n       Co-Chair.\n     David Warren,\n       Co-Chair.\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                             Association of Jesuit\n\n\n                                      Colleges & Universities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Association of \n     Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU) and the twenty-eight \n     institutions of higher education that we represent, I write \n     in support of the Kennedy-Dodd Budget Amendment to increase \n     the Pell grant maximum from $4,050 to $4,500 in FY04.\n       All of our Jesuit colleges and universities have been hard-\n     pressed to meet the critical increase of over 25% in Pell \n     eligible students over the past two years. Within one year, \n     our 28 institutions had to increase the amount of \n     institutional aid given to needy students by 10% to \n     accommodate declining federal dollars. Institutional aid \n     ranks as the highest funding category for our students at 47% \n     on average, and federal aid dollars including Pell grants and \n     campus-based aid programs totals 44%, while only 9% of aid \n     originates from the states. Some of our institutions have \n     been quite dependent upon state aid, but, because of the \n     burgeoning state budget crisis, students have lost aid. For \n     example, $1 million was cut in grant aid from the Illinois \n     Grant Aid program for Loyola Chicago University students. \n     Given the combination of state budget crisis and limited \n     federal dollars, students are increasing loan debts, while \n     institutions are increasing institutional aid. For many small \n     and medium-sized institutions these institutional increases \n     are straining the very financial fiber and well being of \n     these colleges.\n       The economy has played another factor not only in \n     diminishing college and university endowments, but, also in \n     trying to raise endowment funding. Parents are really hard \n     pressed because their savings have declined and their \n     contributions have diminished substantially. Thus, the \n     recession not only has impacted federal and state budgets, \n     but also college and university budgets and in particular, \n     parent's and student's budgets.\n       The Pell grant program remains the foundation program for \n     providing more access for more students of need to secure a \n     postsecondary education. Pell grants serve the neediest \n     students across the country and open doors for many first \n     generation students to pursue their dreams. Given the complex \n     times that we live in, our primary purpose should always be \n     to educate the best-educated populace in the world. An \n     America that offers equal opportunity to those who are less \n     affluent than others and who desperately want to contribute \n     back to society. Thank you for your leadership in introducing \n     this critical amendment. Our students are counting on your \n     continued advocacy.\n                                            Charles L.

FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COMMUNITY \n                   ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) State and local law enforcement officers provide \n     essential services that preserve and protect our freedom and \n     safety;\n       (2) with the support of the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services program (referred to in this section as the ``COPS \n     program''), State and local law enforcement officers have \n     succeeded in dramatically reducing violent crime;\n       (3) the COPS program is the only program in the Federal \n     government that provides homeland security resources directly \n     to law enforcement first responders;\n       (4) on July 15, 2002, the Attorney General stated, ``Since \n     law enforcement agencies began partnering with citizens \n     through community policing, we've seen significant drops in \n     crime rates. COPS provides resources that reflect our \n     national priority of terrorism prevention.'';\n       (5) On February 26, 2002, the Attorney General stated, \n     ``The COPS program has been a miraculous sort of success. \n     It's one of those things that Congress hopes will happen when \n     it sets up a program.'';\n       (6) the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Assistant \n     Director for the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination has \n     stated, ``The FBI fully understands that our success in the \n     fight against terrorism is directly related to the strength \n     of our relationship with our State and local partners.'';\n       (7) as a result of the COPS program, State and local law \n     enforcement agencies have received funds for more than \n     117,000 officers, 87,300 of whom are on the beat, fighting \n     crime, and improving the quality of life in our neighborhoods \n     and schools;\n       (8) the COPS program has assisted in advancing community \n     policing nationwide;\n       (9) 86 percent of the Nation is served by a law enforcement \n     agency that has full-time officers engaged in community \n     policing activities;\n       (10) the continuation and full funding of the COPS program \n     through fiscal year 2009 is supported by several major law \n     enforcement organizations, including--\n       (A) the International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n       (B) the International Brotherhood of Police Officers;\n       (C) the Fraternal Order of Police;\n       (D) the National Sheriffs' Association;\n       (E) the National Troopers Coalition;\n       (F) the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n       (G) the National Association of Police Organizations;\n       (H) the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \n     Executives;\n       (I) the Police Executive Research Forum; and\n       (J) the Major Cities Chiefs;\n       (11) several studies have concluded that the implementation \n     of community policing as a law enforcement strategy is an \n     important factor in the reduction of crime in our \n     communities;\n       (12) Congress appropriated $1,050,000,000 for the COPS \n     program for fiscal year 2002 and $928,900,000 for fiscal \n     2003; and\n       (13) the President requested $164,000,000 for the COPS \n     program for fiscal year 2004, $886,000,000 less than the \n     amount appropriated for fiscal year 2002.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that an increase of \n     $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the Department of \n     Justice's community oriented policing program will be \n     provided without reduction and consistent with previous \n     appropriated and authorized levels.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes equally divided on \neach side. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the COPS Program: $163 million. This \namendment will take it up to what it has historically been for the last \n8 or 9 years, about $1.16 billion. At the time we are cutting back FBI \nagents, we have cut the violent crime task forces, FBI agents no longer \ndo interstate bank robbery, car thefts, et cetera. All local \nmunicipalities are in a hole. Everyone is in trouble. Deficits are \nhigh. We are worried about terrorism. The first guy who is going to run \nacross a Bin Laden-type figure is not one wearing night vision goggles \nwith the Special Forces. It could be a cop.\n  We are cutting back on homeland defense, local law enforcement. There \nhas been an 83-percent cut from the COPS level we just approved in the \nomnibus bill just weeks ago. This will provide for 4,400 more cops at \nthe very time--think about this--the entire FBI is 11,000 FBI agents. \nWe are talking about adding 4,400 cops.\n  The COPS Program has worked. No one has a cogent argument as to why \nit has not worked. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime in opposition? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in function 750, which includes a lot of \nprograms for local law enforcement, we have a 29-percent increase. The \nSenator's amendment would add an additional $1 billion on top of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no. I yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the COPS Program was designed to put \n100,000 new police officers on the street. We have, in fact, put \n110,000 new police officers on the street.\n  In addition, the program has been replaced in large part by the huge \namount of increases that are going into the First Responder Program, \ninto the Byrne grant, into the LEA grant, and into the local law \nenforcement effort overall. We are dramatically increasing money in \nthese accounts.\n  To continue a program that was supposed to fade out is totally \ninappropriate when we are already expanding the spending in these \naccounts by significant amounts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have time to answer a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nHampshire be permitted to answer one question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, if I can have equal time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the budget rules changed? Is there some way that \nthe Senator from New Hampshire can offer an amendment that will, in \nfact, increase the budget so the COPS Program will be paid for?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator knows the budget rules much better than I do. \nI think his answer is rhetorical, and the answer is no.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. This amendment would not add to COPS. \nIt will add to the budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this takes $2 billion out of the tax cut. \nIt provides $1 billion for COPS, and $1 billion for reduction of the \ndeficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n278, as modified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 78 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 278), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are making progress. I inform our \ncolleagues, Senator Conrad and I have had members inquiring how much \nlonger are we going to stay. We are staying until we complete the bill. \nI urge Members not to generate amendments. We are trying to deal with \nthem and we are trying to accommodate Members as much as we can. \nSometimes we have had three or four amendments on one subject matter. I \nhope that does not continue.\n  The next amendment to be considered is the amendment from the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, the Hollings amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 343, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, and Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Graham of Florida, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Corzine, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 343, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

On behalf of Senators Graham of Florida and South \nCarolina, Senators Byrd, Lieberman, Corzine, Schumer, Murray, Biden, \nand others, this amendment is to fund the port security provisions that \nwe passed unanimously through the Senate. We had funding at that time. \nThe House would not agree and the law is there. The responsibility and \nthe unfunded mandate is there upon the States. Now they have no \nemergency dollars and it is an emergency situation.\n  We have to have $1 billion this year and $1 billion next year. I \nwanted to first take the money from the tax cuts. That was not going to \nwork, and then I was going to remove the caps and I retreated to the \n920 offset. We are in a desperate situation. We have to have the money.\n  Last Congress, we passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act of \n2002. This landmark bill reflects the first time that the federal \ngovernment has imposed security requirements on U.S. ports since World \nWar II.\n  People do not ordinarily think about what happens at our ports. They \ntake for granted that goods from all over the world are transported \nthrough our ports at minimal cost. However, this system is in jeopardy \nbecause security has never been part of the equation, and for the first \ntime, we are requiring shipments to not only be efficient, but \nefficient and secure. The current situation leaves us in jeopardy, \nbecause Al Qaeda could use one of the millions of marine containers \nthat are shipped into the U.S. to carry a dirty bomb, they could also \ntake over an oil tanker and use it as a weapon to attack our coastal \ncities.\n  The bill we passed last year, the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct, sets the stage for protecting our nation, and for protecting our \nhomeland. Last year, when we were considering this measure, Senate \nconferees insisted that we needed a commitment to fund the important \nrequirements and mandates of this act. But until now we have not agreed \non how to fund this measure. We implored the administration to come up \nwith their own plan to help us address the vital need to secure our \nports and points inland from maritime attack, but they sat on the \nsidelines.\n  Faced with that inaction, we pushed our colleagues in the House to \nrequire user fees on cargo shippers, and on ships, in order to provide \nfunds for security equipment and programs, and to help our first \nresponders plan how they might counteract any attacks. But our friends \nin the House, primarily those at the Ways and Means Committee, said \nthat it was not a user fee. When we convinced them that it was, they \nthen said that revenues had to originate in the House. After that we \nsaid okay, you pass the bill on the House side, and then we will pass \nyour bill in the Senate. Yet the goal post moved further away once \nagain, when the house said that they couldn't agree on any user\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\nfee at all, and that the federal government should pay for port \nsecurity in the budget. In the end, it was more important to pass the \nmaritime security bill, and to impose the security mandates, so we \nrequired the Administration to submit their plans for funding port \nsecurity to Congress within 6 months. Well, this years' budget proposes \nnot one penny for port security!\n  As required by the MTSA, the Coast Guard has begun to survey security \nat U.S. ports, and preliminary estimates are that we will need 4.8 \nbillion dollars to comply with the mandates. According to a ``Maritime \nSecurity Notice'' in the Federal Register of December 30, 2002, the \ntotal costs of implementing security in our seaports will reach $6 \nbillion over the next ten years. The first year cost will be $1.4 \nbillion. The costs are broken down by USCG as follows:\n  Vessel security: $1.1 billion over ten years,\n  Facility security: $4.4 billion over ten years,\n  Port Security Plans and Committees: $477 million over ten years.\n  This funding is crucial to the security of our homeland. A recent \nport security terrorism simulation was conducted by federal, state, and \nprivate sector experts to examine the consequences of a seaport attack. \nTheir conclusions were stunning. The simulation indicated that within \ntwenty days of an attack through U.S. seaports, the New York Stock \nExchange would halt trading on the Exchange because of restated \nearnings estimates and shareholder panic. Retailers and manufacturers \nwould be crippled by our inability to reopen U.S. ports so that their \ninventories could be replenished.\n  Last year, U.S. ports on the west coast were temporarily closed \nbecause of labor strikes, economists estimate that this closure cost \nour economy over two billion dollars a day. And, while we are spending \nbillions of dollars each year to figure out how to shoot missiles out \nof the sky, we are spending practically nothing to protect against a \nweapon simply being put into a marine container, and shipped to the \nUnited States at a cost of less than three thousand dollars.\n  The economic impact of the closure of just the west coast ports pales \nin comparison to the economic devastation that would be the reaction to \na dirty bomb imported in a container through the Port of Charleston or \nPhiladelphia, or an intentional ship collision with an oil facility \nalong the Houston ship channel, or the scuttling of a vessel blocking \nthe Mississippi River maritime highway. Many Members are from States \nthat would be directly impacted by a maritime terrorist event, and all \nwill be effected by the economic fallout. As demonstrated by the port \nsecurity simulation, a terrorist event will force the closure of every \nport in the country, potentially causing the destruction of our \neconomic system before the ports could be cleared and reopened. \nCurrently, we are only inspecting two percent of containers entering \nthe U.S. We need to do better. The consequences are just to great to \nnot provide the badly needed funds to upgrade port security.\n  For example, Tuesday, with the existing military situation and \nhomeland security threat level at ``high,'' the State of South Carolina \nhas been forced to supplement the existing security at the Port of \nCharleston, and at nuclear power plants, by deputizing and reassigning \n400 probation and parole officers. This extra security should be \navailable from security professionals trained in transportation \nsecurity, but these professionals are not available because we are not \ndoing what is needed to secure our ports.\n  A failure in securing our ports from attack, will result in a \ncatastrophic attack on our economy, and ultimately on the strength of \nour nation. We currently do not have an adequate security system at our \nports, and there has not been any sign from the Administration that \nthey will secure our seaports in the future. The Coast Guard, Customs \nand Transportation Security Administration are doing their best, but \nunless they are given the tools and the funding to help our ports and \ncities employ the security that we need, we will be defenseless from a \ncatastrophic attack. In order to provide this critical funding I am \nproposing an amendment to the Senate budget resolution.\n  The amendment would add $1 billion annually, for seaport security \nneeds, over the next two years. In order to pay for the amendment, the \ntax cut would be reduced by $2 billion. The one billion, per year, \ncould be spent consistent with the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nof 2002, as follows: Maritime Administration, $610 million; $450 \nmillion, for grants to ports and waterfront facilities to help ensure \ncompliance with federally approved security plans; $150 million; for \ngrants to states, local municipalities and other entities to help \ncomply with federal area security plans and to provide grants to \nresponders for port security contingency response; $10 million, to be \nused in conjunction with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to \nhelp develop a seaport security training curriculum to provide training \nto federal and state law enforcement personnel, and to certify private \nsecurity personnel working at seaports.\n  Coast Guard, $160 million; $50 million, for port security \nassessments; $50 million, for the establishment and operation of multi-\nagency task force to coordinate and evaluate maritime information in \norder to identify and respond to security threats; $40 million, to help \nimplement the Automated Identification System, AIS, and other tracking \nsystems designed to actively track and monitor vessels operating in \nU.S. waters; $20 million, for additional Coast Guard port security \nvessels.\n  The Border and Transportation Security Directorate, $230 million, \n$100 million, to Customs for the installation of screening equipment, \nand to be used to help develop new technologies to help develop and \nprototype screening and detection equipment at U.S. ports; $100 \nmillion, to TSA and Customs; $50 million each, to evaluate and \nimplement cargo security programs; $30 million, for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, TSA, to develop and implement the \nTransportation Worker ID Card, and to conduct criminal background \nchecks of transportation workers who work in secure areas or who work \nwith sensitive cargo or information.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman for his agreement. We could voice-\nvote to save time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friends and colleagues, Senator Hollings and \nSenator Graham of South Carolina, for their willingness to work with us \nto modify the amendment. We are happy to accept the amendment. That \nwill eliminate two rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n343, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 343), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe the next amendment will be offered by the \nSenator from Missouri, Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 358.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, and Mr. \n     Reid, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Warner, Mr. Specter, Ms. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Lott, Ms. Collins, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, \n     Mr. Levin, and Mr. Brownback, proposed an amendment numbered \n     358.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are stark needs for highways and \ntransportation systems. The red column the President recommended, the \ngreen column across the chart shows what this budget proposes, and the \nbudget before us proposes essentially flat funding for the next 6 \nyears. The administration itself said the needs just to maintain \nhighways are at this yellow line, which is way above.\n  Our amendment simply raises spending for highways over the 6 years to \n$255 billion and mass transit to $56.5,\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nusing dollars previously paid into the highway trust fund by highway \nusers, and other items that have been identified by the President and \nthe Budget Committee, such as transferring 2.5 cents for ethanol into \nthe highway user funds.\n  Investing in highways and transportation is the best immediate \nstimulus we can have to the economy, creating jobs, and lowering \nhighway deaths. I urge the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their \nleadership on this bipartisan amendment to increase the level of \nFederal investment in transportation by over 40 percent in the next 6 \nyears.\n  This amendment will enable the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand the Banking Committee to write their Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st century, TEA-21, reauthorization proposals with adequate \nfunding, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Maintaining an integrated, efficient, and safe transportation system \nis one of the most important things we can do to get this faltering \neconomy moving again. It is essential for maintaining the strength of \nour cities, and for promoting the growth of commerce and trade.\n  Of all the economic growth proposals that we will consider this year, \nfew will produce a greater bang for the buck than increased Federal \ninvestment in the Nation's transit and highway system. According to the \nDepartment of Transportation, every $1 billion in surface \ntransportation investment creates 47,500 jobs. With an economy losing \n300,000 jobs each month, we cannot afford to ignore the job-creating \npower of transportation investments and the other benefits that they \nbring.\n  According to a report by the American Public Transportation \nAssociation, Americans took 9.5 billion trips on mass transit in 2001--\nthe highest number in over 40 years, and a figure 22 percent increase \nsince 1996. Of those trips, 54 percent were work related. I cannot \nimagine what would happen in cities like Washington, Chicago, New York, \nand Boston if these commuters rushing to and from their jobs were to \nlose public transportation as a viable option.\n  Perhaps such a scenario is too grim to consider, but we do have some \nidea just what those commuters would confront if they got off the \ntrains and buses and back into their cars. In 2000, the average highway \ntraveler spent 62 hours mired in rush hour traffic--a 38-percent \nincrease over 1994. In fact, it is estimated that traffic congestion \nnow costs Americans $67 billion each year--the cost of 3.67 billion \nhours in lost productivity and 5.7 billion gallons of wasted gasoline--\nwasted gasoline.\n  Unless we continue to build on the impressive investments made under \nISTEA and TEA-21, I expect those congestion costs will rapidly \nmultiply. How much they will increase is not known, but the Federal \nTransit Administration estimates that public transportation now saves \nthe Nation $19.4 billion in congestion costs each year.\n  Unfortunately, this budget resolution does not provide room for \nbuilding upon those two landmark transportation bills, and assumes a \nrelatively flat level of funding for the next several years. These \nfigures fall far short of what is needed simply to keep pace with the \ndemands or exerted on our National Transportation System.\n  According to the American Association of State Highway and \nTransportation Officials, just to maintain the current conditions of \nour roads and bridges the Nation will need to invest approximately $92 \nbillion each year for the next 6 years, and $19 billion for our transit \nsystems. To actually improve these systems, the requirements are $125 \nbillion for highways and $44 billion for transit respectively. Yet this \nbudget provides only $32 billion for highways and $7.2 billion for \ntransit this year.\n  By the end of the next 6-year reauthorization cycle, over 65 percent \nof the Nation's public transportation bus fleet and 54 percent of the \ncountry's subway cars, commuter rail cars, and light rail cars will be \npassed their useful lives, according to FTA.\n  If we don't replace the oldest vehicles in the fleet now, and repair \nthose that can remain in revenue service for the foreseeable future, we \nwill only be kicking our problems down the road. Ignoring these needs \nwill only increase their expense, add additional financial burdens to \nState and local governments, and undermine the safety, security, and \nefficiency of our current transportation system.\n  It is also imperative that we boost funding for transportation \ninvestment now because of the new, post-September 11 security costs \nthat States are facing to protect their bridges, tunnels, and subway \nstations.\n  A report by the Transportation Research Board, suggests that of the \nNation's 600,000 bridges and tunnels, over 500 have been identified as \ncritical links based on their size, traffic capacity, and strategic \nimportance. If ever one of these bridges or tunnels should be \ncompromised, the effect on commerce and trade in whole States and \nregions would be profound.\n  That same study, which was conducted with the input of the FTA and \nFederal Highway Administration, suggests that the cost of protecting \nthese highway structures is approximately $6.8 billion over the next 6 \nyears, with an additional $578 million required for ongoing security \noperations.\n  On the transit side, the security upgrades are expected to cost about \n$6.2 billion over 6 years, with an additional $500 million required for \noperating expenses.\n  Who is going to pay for these security requirements? The existing \nbudget, which calls for essentially flat funding, does not anticipate a \nstrong Federal role. At the same time, the States are in the midst of \nthe worst fiscal crisis in nearly 50 years, and cannot afford these \nadditional responsibilities.\n  Ultimately, the States will not be able to avoid this burden for the \nsimple reason that they must protect their citizens. But with no \nadditional revenues to pay for these costs, they will be forced to raid \ntheir long-term transportation budgets to pay for these new security \nresponsibilities.\n  They are the ones who will have to finance additional State police \ndetails, construct physical barriers around the bases of bridges, \ninstall ventilation systems in tunnels, and create coordinated traffic \nmonitoring and management computer systems. They will have no choice \nbut to rob fund their immediate security needs at the expense of their \nlong-term transportation improvement needs. And the cost of this may \nwell be the long-term deterioration of their roads, bridges, tunnels, \nand public transportation services.\n  One final point I would like to make is that the terrorists of 9/11 \nclosed our airports, and very nearly crippled the aviation industry \npermanently. However, because we had made critical investments in all \nmodes of transportation during the past decade, intercity trains, the \ninterstate system, and public transportation were able to fill the gap \nduring those initial days following the tragedy. America did not stop \nmoving.\n  We hope and pray that there will never be another major terrorist \nattack on our country, but cannot pretend that our bridges, tunnels, \nand train stations are not inviting targets.\n  Its essential, therefore, to provide the resources in this budget \nresolution to maintain a strong multimodal National Transportation \nSystem. With this amendment, which provides $255 billion for highways \nand $56.5 for transit over 6 years, we are taking a large step in the \nright direction.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get a substantial \nreauthorization bill passed this year, as well as fully funding Amtrak \nand providing for increased aviation funding. We must meet all of these \nchallenges, and meet them now.\n  Today's bipartisan highways and transit funding amendment is a \ncritical step in that process. I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleagues \nfrom Missouri and Oklahoma and others who sponsor this amendment, but \nit is irresponsible to basically say 30 percent of highway funds will \nbe funded out of general revenues. Highways have been built and paid \nfor by and large by user fees, primarily gasoline taxes. This amendment \nsays we have an increase in the deficit of about $63 billion over the \nnext 6 years, meaning funded by general revenue financing. That is a \nmistake.\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\n  The Federal Government pays 80 percent of the cost of these highways. \nIf you have general fund financing of them, there is no limit on the \ndemands where people are saying we want you to pay for our roads.\n  This is over a 30 percent increase in the highway program, and \nbasically it is unfunded. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 358.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 79, nays 21, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--79\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--21\n\n     Allard\n     Chambliss\n     Cornyn\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n  The amendment (No. 358) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all of our \ncolleagues, we will now vote on the sense of the Senate offered by \nSenator Stevens and myself, and then Senator Conrad and I will work on \nan additional list of amendments. It is very much our intention to \nfinish this bill tonight.\n  I urge our colleagues to be a little more disciplined as far as \nsending amendments to Senator Conrad. I appreciate the cooperation of \nour colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 391\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens and myself, I send--is \nthe amendment at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 391:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HIGHWAY SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Highway construction funding should increase over \n     current levels.\n       (2) The Senate Budget Committee-passed Resolution increases \n     Highway funding above the President's request.\n       (3) All vehicles, whether they are operated by gasoline, \n     gasohol, or electricity, do damage to our highways.\n       (4) As set out in TEA-21, the direct relationship between \n     excise taxes and highway spending makes sense and should be \n     maintained.\n       (5) Highways should be funded through user fees such as \n     excise taxes and not through the General Fund of the \n     Treasury.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should only consider legislation that \n     increases highway spending if such legislation changes \n     highway user fees to pay for such increased spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, embedded in this amendment is a provision \nthat really intends to lift the cap so that the outlays under this \nconcept of increased highway spending will not be charged back against \nthe discretionary spending.\n  It is the intent of this sense-of-the-Senate to state that it is the \nSenate's position, that we support this increase only on the basis that \nit will not be charged against outlays to the discretionary spending \nand therefore reduce the amount of money available to the \nAppropriations Committee under this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am assured by the staff, who are experts \nin this area, that will not reduce the money available for \nappropriations. I agree with most of the whereases in this amendment \nbecause it says that highways should be paid for by highway users. And, \nfrankly, this returns to the highway trust fund almost $50 billion that \nhas been paid in by highway users over the last decade. It also lays \nout other areas where there should be additional funds that the Finance \nCommittee has already agreed we should pay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Bond amendment, I \nrecommend that we accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 391) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers are going to work to come \nup with another list of amendments that we will work on. The chairman \nand ranking member said it will take about another 15 minutes for them \nto come up with another list. During the time they are gone, if \nsomebody has some issue they want to talk about, Senator Nickles and \nSenator Conrad said they would have no objection to that--they can talk \nabout anything they want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say to Members on our side who have \namendments pending, we had over 105 amendments noticed. Not all of \nthose have been filed at the desk. We are asking Senators, if you have \nprovided notice of an amendment but it could be put off to another day, \nplease come to us now and advise us of that. We need to reduce the \nnumber of amendments.\n  We know that typically amendments Members have indicated an interest \nin sometimes fall away. Many times many of the amendments fall away. \nThat would be helpful. With that said, I also want to advise Members, I \ndo not see any way that this bill gets completed tonight. There are \nsimply too many amendments Members have indicated they are serious \nabout taking to a vote.\n  That does not mean we should not bend every effort to reduce the \nnumber of amendments outstanding so we could complete this as nearly as \npossible today, and finish up at a reasonable time tomorrow.\n  So this is going to be a challenge to all of us. If we do not do \nthis, let me just say, there are still 85 amendments pending here. We \nhave been doing about three an hour. If we continue on this pace, we \nare going to be here for another several days.\n  So I implore my colleagues, if you have given notice of an amendment, \nbut you really do not need a vote on it, please advise the staff of \nthat so we can whittle down this list.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of this bill have worked \nvery hard. Recognizing how hard they have\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nworked, the staff has worked even harder. I have relayed to the \nmajority leader that in addition to the fact that it is Friday, and we \nhave all had a hard week, we have to keep in proper perspective, \nwhether people want to acknowledge it or not, that we have had a number \nof Senators who have recently had surgery and have been ill. Not a \nsingle one of those Senators has come to me asking that we cut them \nsome slack. But we know that we should do that. Some of them came back \nto work earlier than they should have. They have violated doctors' \ninstructions to be here.\n  Senator Byrd has talked to us. We recognize that his wife is very \nill. Senator Byrd is doing everything he can to keep a watchful eye on \nhis wife.\n  I hope we have proven during this week--we, the minority--that we are \nnot trying to do anything to slow up this important piece of \nlegislation. I have trouble understanding what is the magic of \nfinishing this bill today. If there is magic there, it would take magic \nto complete it because we cannot complete the bill today. It would be \nmy recommendation that we work for a reasonable time this evening. If \nthe leader wants to come back tomorrow, come back sometime at a \nreasonable time tomorrow, do that. But I have to say we would be better \nserved by completing our work early this evening and coming back next \nweek and finishing this bill. It would give us all time to work to \nwinnow down this list of amendments. I will bet if we had the weekend \nto do it, we could work it out so there would not be a lot of \namendments. Our being pushed into saying you have to finish this bill \ntoday or tomorrow is not logical.\n  I know there is pressure from a lot of places to finish the bill, but \nit is not the Democrats preventing the legislation from passing. We are \ndoing everything we can to cooperate. I know there are people here who \nhave had far more experience than I. This, to me, would be logical and \nsensible.\n  Senator Byrd asked me today how long we are going. I would like him \nto express to the Senate how he feels about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there may be men and women dying right now \nin the Arabian desert. Here we are talking about a budget resolution \nwhich is required by law to be passed by April 15. The administration \nhas not added one penny in this budget for the war. They have not added \nanything in this budget for the war.\n  If we were debating a war budget today, it might be different. But we \nare not debating a war budget. There is no money in this budget by the \nadministration for the war. Yet we are fighting a war. Why the hurry, \nwhen the deadline is April 15? Why the hurry?\n  We have asked the administration, I have asked the administration and \nrepresentatives of the administration what is the cost of the war. How \nmuch is it going to cost. What is the cost of this war. The Secretary \nof Defense has answered it is not knowable. Here we are, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people who want to know something about the cost \nof the war. The administration has said: It is not knowable. The \nadministration has said, in essence, wait until you see the \nsupplemental. We will send you the supplemental.\n  The answer to our questions have been rather contemptuous, in saying: \nWell, we don't know the cost. We will let you know when we send up the \nbill.\n  Why don't we wait and see what the supplemental is going to ask for? \nWhy don't we wait and see what the administration asks for in the \nsupplemental before we proceed with the budget? I cannot understand the \nhurry. We have at least two Members who have had serious operations. I \ndon't mind staying a little while longer, but I have a responsibility \nalso at home. If it were absolutely necessary that we complete this \nbudget tonight, I would stay as long as I could, and if I had to go \nhome, I would go home and let the Senate finish it. But this resolution \ndoesn't have to be done tonight. This is not a war budget. The \nadministration has nothing in this budget for the war. The \nadministration has stiff-armed, as far as I am concerned, the Congress, \nthose of us who have wanted to know something about what are the costs \nof this war. The administration has given us the back of their hand.\n  Here we are; we are being asked to rush through a budget that is not \na war budget, no money in this budget for the war, and yet there is a \nwar going on right now. Go look at your television sets and see the \ndestruction that is being rained upon a capital city of a state that \nhas not attacked the United States. Why can't we wait until we find out \nwhat the administration is going to request in a supplemental and then \ndeal with the budget?\n  There is absolutely no necessity for dealing with this budget \ntonight. Suppose you lose a man here in the Senate because we continue \nto press for action on this budget tonight? You could lose a man. You \ncould lose two. We have had plenty of time. We have had plenty of time. \nThe administration should have told us how much they need in the \nsupplemental. I have a feeling we are going to be asked for $65 to $80 \nbillion, maybe $100 billion for the war in that supplemental. Why not \nwait and see what the administration is asking for in the supplemental \nbefore we proceed with this budget?\n  We have a huge tax cut in this budget, $1.3 trillion in tax cuts. So \nwe want to pass the tax cuts before we find out how much the \nadministration is going to request in a supplemental for fighting the \nwar.\n  Men and women are dying. We ought not be on this budget today. We \nought to at least show some respect for our own men and women. We are \nsending our own men and women across the sea to a foreign land where \nthey may die and their families here today are worrying and crying and \npraying about their loved ones. That is saying nothing about the Iraqi \nmen and women, old women, young women, old men, young men, sick people, \nchildren, babies.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no debate in order at this time.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been around here long enough to know \nwhat the regular order is. I also have been around here long enough to \nknow that we are being asked to stay here and spend the rest of the \nevening. We may send some old men to their deaths by doing this. I have \na sick wife. Sixty-nine days from now, if the Lord lets both of us \nlive, we will celebrate our 66th wedding anniversary. My first duty is \nto her. There will be enough Senators left here to pass this bill if we \nwant to stay that long. But I think it is unreasonable.\n  If there were a reason to stay here, I would say, let's stay here and \ndo our duty. But there is no reason for that, except to get this \nresolution passed before we know what the administration is going to \nrequest in a supplemental to fight this war.\n  Now, call for the regular order if you want to. Mr. President, I say \nit is time that we agree on a few more amendments, act on a few more, \nand go over to next week. The administration, I understand, is going to \nfight me down at the White House to tell me about the supplemental next \nTuesday as a ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Let them \ntell us that first, and then let's complete action on this massive tax \ncut.\n  Mr. President, I hope reason will prevail today. There is time to \npass this bill later. It doesn't have to be done today. Let's go home, \nat least out of respect for the men and the women who are being sent. \nThey didn't ask to go to foreign lands, possibly to fight and die.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Out of respect for those, Mr. President----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Further debate would require unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Can we not at least respect the people who are being sent \noverseas to fight and die, possibly? Can't we, out of respect, at least \nshut down the Senate for today and go home? Why do we have to debate \nthis while they are giving of their all? Remember, we are raining \ndestruction\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nupon a city of a state that has not attacked this country. There are \nmen and women, old people and young people, sick and dying people \nthere. At least we should have enough respect to quit now. We have done \na good day's work. We passed 15, 16, 17 amendments by rollcall votes. \nWhy do we have to continue? We don't have to--not for the political \nreason of getting action completed on this resolution before we find \nout what the administration is going to ask for in the supplemental.\n  I hope Senators will insist on our going over to next week. Our \nstaffs haven't had a chance to read the amendments. Senators don't know \nwhat is in these amendments. I don't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's take the weekend and have our clerks read them so \nthey can better advise us next week. I ask Senators to think about \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns raised by my \nfriend and colleague from West Virginia, who just doubled the subsidy \nfor Amtrak over my opposition. The majority leader has asked me to \nfinish this bill, and we are going to finish the bill. I regret it. I \nwill tell you, I have been here 23 years. We usually spend 1 week on a \nbudget. Undoubtedly, on that last day of the budget, we have a lot of \nvotes. We didn't do a budget last year and we should have. Maybe I \nshould have worked more with the chairman at that time to make that \nhappen. The Congress didn't function because it didn't get the budget \ndone. We are going to finish this budget this week--tonight or \ntomorrow.\n  I know there are a lot of amendments, but most of them are \nrepetitive. We have dealt with almost every subject area in the budget. \nThe budget is not an appropriations bill. The budget is not a tax bill. \nWe have had people offer amendments as though this is going to \nmicromanage section 750. We don't do that in the budget. We don't write \ntax bills in the budget. We have had umpteen amendments. Oh, this will \nfinance this, or it will be that portion of a tax bill. That is not \nwhat a budget does. A budget says basically how much we are going to \nspend and how much we are going to take in.\n\n  We have a budget and we need to finish our work. I know it is \nunpleasant and painful, and I know people would rather be home with \ntheir families, but we have to finish. Two years ago, we had 34 votes--\ntons of votes. We eventually passed a budget. I congratulated Senator \nDomenici because it wasn't easy or pretty. That is the way we are right \nnow.\n  I tell my colleague from North Dakota, we knew this was coming a \ncouple of days ago. I know it will not be pleasant, and we are going to \nask people, and some people have to catch planes, and that is \nunfortunate, but we are going to finish the budget.\n  All these amendments that are pending, for the most part, don't need \nto be offered. They can be offered if you want--we are going to set an \namount for appropriations. Most of those amendments can be dealt with \non an appropriations bill or on a tax bill. We are going to have both \nthis year. So I urge my colleagues to show some restraint. I will work \nwith my colleagues, and I think I have considered every amendment \nfairly. We have not postponed anybody's amendments. I think we have \nbeen as fair as possible to everybody. I might mention that 90 percent \nof the amendments offered on the other side--well, I will be happy to \nwork with my colleagues, but I think it is important to finish our \nwork, whether it is midnight tonight or tomorrow night. It is very much \nmy intention to finish. I urge our colleagues to work together to \ncomplete our work.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say the chairman and I have \nworked together closely to try to move this agenda, to have amendments \nand do it in an efficient way. But I must say I don't see any earthly \nreason this bill has to be done today. The requirement is April 15. I \nthink we are getting over the edge into unreasonableness. When one side \ngets unreasonable, that creates a reaction on the other side. I have \ntried to be reasonable, but I say to my colleagues, at some point it is \ngoing to be hard to feel that there is some rational reason for this \npress.\n  We can get this bill done, and get it done in a timely way, without \ngoing endlessly into the night. We went until midnight last night, the \nsame the night before. I will tell you, I think we should press ahead, \ndo additional amendments for a time, but I think we need to fold our \ntent and recognize that we need to come back tomorrow or Tuesday \nmorning and finish.\n  I just ask my colleagues to think about that and, in the meantime, we \ncan try to get an agreement on another traunche of amendments to work \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I tell my colleague from North Dakota \nthat I will let him know of this request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments that be allowed to \nbe considered be those filed and presently at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4258-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4258-S4268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF FORCE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as President pro tempore, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the permanent Record a letter I have \nreceived from the President consistent with its requirements under the \nauthorization for use of military force against Iraq, Public Law 107-\n243.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On March 18, 2003, I made available to \n     you, consistent with section 3(b) of the Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public \n     Law 107-243), my determination that further diplomatic and \n     other peaceful means alone will neither adequately protect \n     the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq, nor lead to enforcement of \n     all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \n     regarding Iraq.\n       I have reluctantly concluded, along with other coalition \n     leaders, that only the use of armed force will accomplish \n     these objectives and restore international peace and security \n     in the area. I have also determined that the use of armed \n     force against Iraq is consistent with the United States and \n     other countries continuing to take the necessary actions \n     against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, \n     including those nations, organizations, or persons who \n     planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist \n     attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. United States \n     objectives also support a transition to democracy in Iraq, as \n     contemplated by the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law \n     105-338).\n       Consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-\n     148), I now inform you that pursuant to my authority as \n     Commander in Chief and consistent with the Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law \n     102-1) and the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n     Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243), I \n     directed U.S. Armed Forces, operating with other coalition \n     forces, to commence combat operations on March 19, 2003, \n     against Iraq.\n       These military operations have been carefully planned to \n     accomplish our goals with the minimum loss of life among \n     coalition military forces and to innocent civilians. It is \n     not possible to know at this time either the duration of \n     active combat operations or the scope or duration of the \n     deployment of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to accomplish our \n     goals fully.\n       As we continue our united efforts to disarm Iraq in pursuit \n     of peace, stability, and security both in the Gulf region and \n     in the United States, I look forward to our continued \n     consultation and cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George W. Bush\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are going to soon ask unanimous \nconsent to clear seven amendments that Senator Conrad and I have agreed \nupon. Prior to that, though, I might ask the minority leader if he has \nan announcement to try to rally his troops.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been in discussions for the last \nhour or so. I am calling a caucus for 6:45 to discuss our current \nsituation and a series of ideas that might allow us to bring this \ndebate to closure.\n  I do not want to discuss it here and now, but I hope Senators will \nattend at 6:45 and we will have more information at that time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the minority leader will yield, I would very much \nappreciate it--I know you don't want to get into the details, but \nhaving final passage of the budget by 7 o'clock tonight would be very \nmuch appreciated by all Members of the Senate.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the minority leader.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 353, 283, 390, 388, 389, 309, 296 As Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that seven \namendments--No. 353, Senators Smith and Clinton's sense of the Senate \ndealing with health care coverage; No. 283, Senator Feinstein and \nothers' sense of the Senate dealing with criminal alien assistance; No. \n390, Nickles' technical correction, Social Security administrative \nexpenses; No. 388, Senator Voinovich's sense of the Senate CBO report \non liabilities and future costs; No. 389, Senator Hutchison's sense of \nthe Senate dealing with the Corps of Engineers; No. 309, Bingaman \nlanguage change to Medicaid Reserve; No. 296, Senator Rockefeller's \nsense of the Senate first responders, with a modification that is \npresently at the desk--be considered en bloc, agreed to, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid on the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be shown as a \ncosponsor of the Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were considered and agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 353\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the expansion \n                        of health care coverage)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AN EXPANSION IN \n                   HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there were 74,700,000 Americans who were uninsured for \n     all or part of the two-year period of 2001 and 2002;\n       (2) this large group of uninsured Americans constitutes \n     almost one out of every three Americans under the age of 65;\n       (3) most of these uninsured individual were without health \n     coverage for lengthy periods of time, with two-thirds of them \n     uninsured for over six months;\n       (4) four out of five uninsured individuals are in working \n     families;\n       (5) high health care costs, the large number of unemployed \n     workers, and State cutbacks of public health programs \n     occasioned by State fiscal crises are causing more and more \n     individuals to become uninsured; and\n       (6) uninsured individuals are less likely to have a usual \n     source of care outside of an emergency room, often go without \n     screenings and preventive care, often delay or forgo needed \n     medical care, are often subject to avoidable hospital days, \n     and are sicker and die earlier than those individuals who \n     have health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the functional totals in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) expanded access to health care coverage throughout the \n     United States is a top priority for national policymaking; \n     and\n       (2) to the extent that additional funds are made available, \n     a significant portion of such funds should be dedicated to \n     expanding access to health care coverage so that fewer \n     individuals are uninsured and fewer individuals are likely to \n     become uninsured.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 283\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the States and \n   localities should be reimbursed through the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program for the fiscal burdens undocumented criminal aliens \n                place on their criminal justice systems)\n\n         On page 79, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

RADIO INTEROPERABILITY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS.\n\n         (a) Study.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, should conduct a study of the need and \n     cost to make the radio systems used by fire departments and \n     emergency medical services agencies interoperable with those \n     used by law enforcement to the extent that interoperability \n     will not interfere with law enforcement operations.\n         (b) Grant Program.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should authorize and appropriate $20,000,000 to \n     establish a grant program through which the Attorney General \n     would award grants to local governments to assist fire \n     departments and emergency medical services agencies to \n     establish radio interoperability.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 283\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this non-binding sense of the Senate \namendment expresses that the budget resolution before us should \naccommodate an appropriation of $750 million for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program--SCAAP--for Fiscal Year 2004.\n  I am pleased that Senators Kyl, Bingaman, McCain, and Schumer have \njoined me in introducing this important measure.\n  The bipartisan amendment I offer today with my colleagues would also \nput the Senate on record as favoring a restoration of fiscal year 2003 \nfunding for this important program, which does so much to help State \nand county governments deal with the growing costs of incarcerating \nundocumented criminal aliens.\n  Without adequate funding, this fiscal burden will continue to fall on \nmany of our local law enforcement agencies--including sheriffs, police \nofficers on the beat, anti-gang violence units, and district attorneys \noffices.\n  The SCAAP program is based on the principle that when the Federal \nGovernment falls short in its efforts to enforce the laws against \nimmigration violations, it must bear the responsibility for the \nfinancial and human consequences of this failure.\n  Thus, the SCAAP program properly vests this burden with the Federal \nGovernment when undocumented aliens commit serious crimes within our \ncommunities.\n  It does so by providing Federal reimbursement funding to the States \nand county governments for the direct costs associated with \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens, who are convicted of \nfelonies or multiple misdemeanors.\n\n  Increasingly, State and county governments from all across the \ncountry have made use of these funds over the years. In fact, in Fiscal \nYear 2002, the number of State and local governments seeking SCAAP \nfunding jumped 25 percent from the previous fiscal year.\n  The combination of this increase, and the fact that all 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia receive some funding from the program, \nsuggests that no State is immune from the fiscal costs associated with \ncrimes committed by illegal aliens.\n  Today most States are encountering their largest deficits in more \nthan 60 years. Indeed, the fiscal consequences of illegal immigration \nhave contributed to this challenge.\n  In Fiscal Year 2002, State and county governments incurred more than \n$13 billion in costs associated with incarcerating criminal illegal \naliens. These costs are expected to grow over the next several years, \ngiven the new challenges of terrorism and our efforts to enhance \nsecurity within our Nation's borders.\n  California's border counties are among the hardest hit in terms of \ndollars spent on incarceration, prosecution and court costs for those \nin the United States illegally. I am greatly concerned about the \nsubstantial burden these immigration-related costs impose on the \ncriminal justice system on our local communities, especially given the \nlimited tax base and fiscal resources State and local jurisdictions are \nworking with today.\n  The SCAPP program is not in place to prevent crime, but to fulfill \nportion of the Federal Government's responsibility, so local \ngovernments can use their limited resources for their own \nresponsibilities, such as funding jail enlargement or new homeland \nsecurity ventures at the local level.\n\n  At a time when cash-strapped State and local governments are being \nasked to do even more to protect our homeland, we cannot afford to \neliminate vital funding that already falls far short of what local \ngovernments spend to incarcerate undocumented criminal aliens. In \nprevious years, Congress has appropriated between $500 million and $585 \nmillion for SCAAP to alleviate some of the fiscal burdens placed on the \nlocal criminal justice systems.\n  In Fiscal Year 2002, Congress appropriated $565 million for this \nimportant program. Unfortunately, the prolonged debate over Fiscal Year \n2003 appropriations produced budgetary pressures that resulted in a 53-\npercent drop in SCAAP funding for FY 2003.\n  SCAAP payments have never matched the true costs to the States \ndealing with this problem, but they have nevertheless been critical \nadditions to prison and jail budgets. They have also symbolized the \nFederal Governments obligation to pay for the results of its failed \nimmigration strategies.\n  These are challenging times in our Nation's history. And, we want, to \nthe best extent possible, our constituents to feel secure in their \nhomes and in their communities.\n  At a time when the Nation is focused on enhancing security within our \nborders, our States, and our local communities, a vital program like \nSCAAP should not be vulnerable to being under-funded or eliminated \naltogether.\n  The control of illegal immigration is a Federal obligation and we owe \nit to our States and local communities to provide them with the crucial \nFederal assistance they need to continue doing their job.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize that while this amendment would put the \nSenate on record as supporting this initiative, the amendment is not \nbinding and therefore, does not require any offsets.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues for their \ncooperation and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the caucus, for the information of our \nDemocratic Senators, will be in the LBJ Room, our normal caucus room.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n  I have something else, though, that I want to share with my \ncolleagues.\n\n\n   Congratulating Senator Paul Sarbanes on Casting his 10,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at 3:45 this afternoon, our friend and \ncolleague, Paul Sarbanes, joined what is truly one of the most \nexclusive clubs in the world. He cast his 10,000th vote as a United \nStates Senator.\n  Of the 1,875 people ever to serve in the Senate, only 20 others have \never reached this remarkable milestone. Remarkably, eight of the 21 \n``10,000 vote'' Senators are serving in this Senate.\n  In addition to Senator Sarbanes, they include our friends Joe Biden, \nSenator Byrd, Pete Domenici, Fritz Hollings, Dan Inouye, Ted Kennedy \nand Ted Stevens. I'm proud to note that, at least in this very \ndistinguished caucus, Democrats still have a majority.\n  Reaching this historic milestone is just the latest remarkable \naccomplishment in what has been, by anyone's standards, a remarkable \nAmerican success story. Paul Sarbanes is the proud son of Greek \nimmigrants. His parents, Spyros and Matina Sarbanes, emigrated from the \nsame town in Greece, but met in America. The Sarbanes family owned a \nrestaurant in Salisbury, MD. They gave it a quintessentially American \nname: The Mayflower Restaurant. Paul worked in the restaurant, and he \nand his family lived above it.\n  He graduated from a public high school and won a scholarship to \nPrinceton University.\n  He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After Oxford, he came \nhome and, in 1960, earned a law degree from Harvard. From Harvard, Paul \nSarbanes went to the White House, one of the ``best and brightest'' who \nanswered President Kennedy's call to public service. He worked as \nAdministrative Assistant to Water Heller, chairman of President \nKennedy's Council of Economic Advisors.\n  He won his first elected office in 1966, to the Maryland House of \nDelegates, where he served for 4 years. In 1970, the people of Maryland \nelected him to the House of Representatives. In 1976, he won his first \nelection to the United States Senate. In November 2000, he won his \nfifth election to the Senate, making him the longest-serving Senator in \nMaryland's history.\n  It's been said that there are two kinds of Senators: those who are \nhere to make headlines and those who are here to make history. Paul \nSarbanes is one of the history makers. He is one of the most modest men \nI know. He is also one of the most intelligent. He was a voice of \nreason on both the Whitewater and Iran-Contra committees. It was his \nleadership and his refusal to accept defeat--more than anything--that \nenabled us, in the last Congress, to pass the most far-reaching \ncorporate accountability reforms since the Securities and Exchange \nCommission was created 70 years ago.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley reforms will help prevent the kinds of corporate \nabuses that have so damaged our economy and shaken people's faith in \nthe economic markets these last few years. They will protect people's \ninvestments, and their economic futures.\n  I learned a Greek word from Paul Sarbanes: ``idiotes.'' It is the \nGreek root for the English word ``idiot.'' But it has a different \nmeaning in Greek. It means ``someone who takes no part in the affairs \nof his community.'' In the Sarbanes family, it was almost a curse.\n  Paul Sarbanes' parents taught him that serving one's nation is a \nnoble calling. I know they would be proud of him. So are we. I \ncongratulate my friend on casting his 10,000th vote in the Senate--and \non his long and exemplary career. I look forward to seeing him cast a \nfew thousand more votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and congratulate our colleague.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished leader for his \nvery kind comments about the 10,000 votes I have cast in the Senate. I \nmust say, if we keep doing these vote-a-ramas, everyone can aspire to \nreaching this goal in short order.\n  Our very able leader was very kind and generous in his remarks. I \nappreciate them very much.\n  I wish to register my deep appreciation to the people of my State who \nsent me to the Senate now for my fifth term and, therefore, made it \npossible for me to be here exercising my judgment on important issues \nthat come before us. I certainly hope that people, looking back over \nthat record, will think there was some quality in those votes as well \nas quantity.\n  I thank my colleagues for their constant support and the ability to \ninteract with them as we deal with important matters of public policy. \nEven though we sometimes differ, we support one another in a very \nunique and, to some, not understandable way. I am in my 27th year in \nthe Senate, and I am pleased to be in the company of those who our \nleader enumerated that have also passed the 10,000 mark. I particularly \nwant to acknowledge my respect for Senator Byrd, who I think has cast \nmore votes than anyone who has ever served in the Senate, and continues \nto be an example to us all.\n  I also would be remiss if I did not thank my family, my wife in \nparticular, for their strong support over these many years now. And \nfinally, I would like to thank the many staff members who have served \nme so well for these past 27 years.\n  Again, I thank all of those who have been so gracious to me in \nextending their best wishes and congratulations. And, in particular, I \nthank our leader, Senator Daschle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while Senator Sarbanes is still here, I \nwant to congratulate him.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am on that list. I just want to tell you, 10,000 is \njust the beginning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join our colleagues in \ncongratulating Senator Sarbanes on the milestone, and his \naccomplishments in the Senate.\n\n\n                           Democratic Caucus\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I announce we now have a Democratic caucus \nin the LBJ Room. If all Democratic Senators can move over there, it \nwould be greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are all following, on a moment-by-\nmoment basis, the developments in Iraq and the sad reality that this \nwar is upon us, but we also have the great feeling of support for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I was notified today that one of the first casualties in the war was \nfrom my home State. His name is Ryan Beaupre from Saint Anne, IL, a 30-\nyear-old Marine Corps captain who was a pilot on the helicopter that \nwent down with eight British commandos and four marines, a wonderful \nyoung man by all reports from a good family who attended Bishop \nMacNamara High School in Kankakee and then Illinois Wesleyan and \nenlisted in the Marine Corps and served his country so well. I have \ncalled his family today. Of course, they are grief-stricken, as is \neveryone in the community.\n  A special tribute was given to him today at his old high school, and \nI am sure there will be many more. Our hearts go out to the Beaupre \nfamily and all of their friends at this great loss.\n  We are fortunate in this country to have young men and women like \nhim, willing to volunteer and to risk their lives for their Nation. We \nshould remember the cost of war and remember how much we owe those who \nwill step forward to defend this Nation in time of need.\n  I hope, before this debate on the budget resolution is over, to ask \nmy colleagues in the Senate to consider an amendment which I hope to \noffer. If someone asked you today how much\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\ncombat pay do we pay to the marines and sailors and soldiers and airmen \nfor fighting the war in Iraq, most Americans would not know the answer. \nBut combat pay for our soldiers and those who are risking their lives \nnow in Iraq is $5 a day--$5 a day--$150 a month. That is combat pay for \nthose who are in active military, as well as those who are activated.\n  Also, you might be interested in knowing how much we pay the families \nwhen we separate people and send them off to war. What kind of monthly \nsupplement do we provide for the families who now have someone \nimportant in their lives gone for a period of time and have to struggle \nto try to keep things together when it comes to child care and added \nresponsibility and added expenses? How much do we give to these \nmilitary families? About $3.30 a day; $100 a month.\n  The amendment I am going to offer to the budget resolution will raise \nthose two amounts, not to what they truly deserve but to show that we \nhave not forgotten that they need more, to $500 a month for combat pay, \nand $500 a month to families who are separated because of this war.\n  It is a small token. It should be much more. But I hope my colleagues \nwill seriously consider that amendment. As we all feel so good and so \nstrong about the contribution of the men and women in uniform, let us \nnot forget they deserve a helping hand and the combat pay differential \nas well as the assistance to their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to elaborate on Amendment No. \n277, which would provide an additional $16 billion next year to fund \nour urgent homeland security needs. Because of the failure of the \nSchumer amendment--which would have provided a substantial but smaller \nincrease in homeland security funding next year--it is clear that my \namendment will not carry the Senate. Nevertheless, I would like to set \nforth the following statement on the reasons behind my amendment and \nthe urgency of dramatically increasing our investment in homeland \nsecurity.\n  America has the greatest military in the world--as we are witnessing \nin Iraq today--and we have it because we pay for it. For generation \nafter generation, presidents, members of Congress, and the American \npeople have come together across partisan divides and every other \nconceivable divide to invest what's necessary in our military, and in \nthe men and women in uniform who make our military what it is.\n  If we want the best domestic defenses, we'll have to pay for them, \ntoo. But consider this comparison. Under the resolution before us, \nbetween this year's and next year's budgets, defense spending would be \nincreased by some $19 billion. I support that increase. But over the \nsame period, this resolution would invest only $300 million more in \nimproving our homeland defenses.\n  Why? One reason and one reason only: the President's unaffordable, \nunfair, and unfocused tax cuts are leaving no room for necessary \ninvestments. They're crowding out every other priority. It's bad enough \nthat they haven't done anything to create jobs, to grow the economy, to \nexpand the middle class. On top of that, they have raided the national \ncupboard.\n  There's little money left for urgent needs--not for healthcare, not \nfor education, not for Social Security or homeland security. Little \nmoney left for smart tax cuts that will spur real growth and \ninnovation. Little money left to keep down the deficit at a time when \nwe're looking at $2 trillion in additional debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop and think about this for a second. The \nPresident's budget would have us spend about $100 billion next year \nalone on brand new tax cuts for those who need them least. $100 billion \nof our national treasure on unfocused, unaffordable and unfair tax cuts \nwhen we are at war against terrorism here at home, forced to marshal \nour strength to defend against a ruthless and unpredictable new enemy. \nAnd that's to say nothing of the cost of the war to disarm Iraq, the \npeace that will follow, or every other critical need facing our country \nfrom healthcare to education to Social Security.\n  For this administration and those who support this resolution, all of \nthose needs are down the list. Those needs can wait. Those needs can \nsuffer. As long as someone preserves the precious new tax cuts--which \nwill do little if anything to create new jobs--they're happy.\n  That's crazy. It's irresponsible. And it's downright unfair to those \nwho are working day and night to protect us, and who desperately need \nnew resources to do their job well.\n  My father ran his own small store and, like any decent businessman, \nhe understood that making a good living and paying the bills started \nwith sound and honest budget planning. If he needed to put a new lock \non the door, he would set aside some money to do it.\n  Those who run our government now don't seem to get it. They \nunderestimate or hide serious expenses. They squander money when \nbusiness is bad. They overestimate revenue. And they seem to think that \nour security will magically fund itself, rather than setting aside \nmoney for it, as my Dad would have.\n  It's time for this administration and those who back this resolution \nto show some economic common sense. It's time for them to let go of \ntheir pet tax cuts and dedicate some resources to our critical common \nneeds.\n  This amendment would do that. Rather than giving homeland security \nshort shrift by settling for a paltry $300 million increase, it would \nstart to put real dollars where the danger is. After extensive study \nand consultation with experts, I've determined it will take $16 billion \nto start truly raising our guard in the next fiscal year. That's what \nthis amendment would provide.\n  How will we pay for it? It's an important question--and unlike this \nadministration, we'll answer it. Because we understand, as the American \npeople understand, that we can't have it all. Leadership is about \nmaking tough choices--about tradeoffs.\n  So we propose paying for this new investment in homeland security by \nredirecting $32 billion in new tax cuts proposed by the President. Half \nof that money will go toward deficit reduction--to start digging \nourselves and our children out of the ditch of debt in which we now \nfind ourselves. And half of it will pay for urgent homeland security \nimprovements.\n  Aren't those two common goals, both of which will broadly benefit the \nAmerican people, a far, far better use of our precious resources than \nbrand new unfocused, unaffordable, and ineffective tax cuts to those \nwho need them least? The answer is obvious to me. I hope it's clear to \nothers in this chamber as well.\n  Let me now talk about some of the critical security needs that this \n$16 billion would help us meet.\n  Our commitment needs to start with first responders, who are our \nfrontline troops in this homefront war. In communities across the \ncountry, our firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \ntechnicians are struggling for the funds they need to meet the new \nthreats we face. It's time for us to give them the support they need \nand their jobs demand.\n  This budget resolution would provide virtually no new funding for our \nfirst responders. Virtually no new funding--at this time of \nunprecedented need and danger. That's unacceptable. There is equipment \nto buy. There are professionals to hire. There are people to train. All \nof that--like it or not--takes money.\n  This amendment provides for $10 billion in FY 04--$6.5 billion above \nthe President's request--to help first responders prepare for and \ncombat terrorism, including attacks involving weapons of mass \ndestruction. Additionally, the amendment provides for $1 billion in FY \n04 for firefighter grants, money that would be available to hire \nadditional firefighters. This is the first installment of the SAFER \nAct--of which I am an enthusiastic supporter--which would provide more \nthan $7.5 billion over 7 years to help communities hire badly needed \nnew firefighters. Unlike in the President's proposed budget, I believe \nthat new funds should not come at the expense of existing programs for \nfirst responders like the COPS program, the Local Law Enforcement \nGrants, or the Byrne Grant program.\n  Within this overall commitment, $4 billion should be dedicated to \nhelping first responders obtain interoperable equipment--a vital \nchallenge that has been estimated to cost $18 billion overall.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  Nor should we wait for the FY 04 appropriations cycle to help our \nfirst responders. The recently-approved FY 03 omnibus spending bill \ncomes up far short for first responders. We will need to seize every \nopportunity to fix that, and I am cosponsoring amendments today to \nensure that this happens. I will fight also for more money for first \nresponders in the supplemental appropriations process.\n  Our second critical unmet priority is shoring up port security--which \nmy amendment would accomplish by committing a $2 billion investment \nabove the pending resolution.\n  About 7 million containers arrive at these ports each year, yet only \na tiny fraction are searched. This poses a risk not only at the ports, \nbut also inland--as many of those containers travel many miles to their \nfinal destination without being searched.\n  Yet the administration's budget proposal and this budget resolution \nmostly ignore the physical security of our ports. The Coast Guard has \nestimated that it will cost $4.4 billion to improve basic physical \nsecurity at the nation's ports, starting with close to $1 billion the \nfirst year. In addition, the Maritime Security Act mandates certain \nsecurity measures without providing a funding mechanism. In an effort \nto jumpstart these vital improvements, this amendment provides $1.2 \nbillion in port security grants for fiscal year 2004.\n  Because the ports themselves are a potential target, we do not want \nto wait until dangerous containers arrive to investigate. Rather, we \nmust ``push the borders back'' and identify and inspect as much high-\nrisk cargo as possible before it enters our harbors. The Customs \nService has made some valuable strides in this direction through the \nContainer Security Initiative. This program stations Customs officers \nat overseas ports to allow for inspection of some containers before \nthey begin their voyage to the U.S. Yet the Administration is not \nexpanding this valuable program as forcefully as circumstances require. \nPresident Bush has requested $62 million for this program in fiscal \nyear 2004, a request that is echoed in this budget resolution. My \namendment would provide an additional $100 million to allow for \naggressive and effective expansion of this program, and for related \ninitiatives to inspect and track containers as close as possible to \ntheir point of origin.\n  Moving beyond physical security, my amendment would enable the Coast \nGuard to step up its supervision of the ports and adjacent maritime \nareas. I believe we must accelerate efforts to recapitalize the Coast \nGuard fleet--specifically, to speed up implementation of the long-\nplanned Deepwater Initiative to upgrade and integrate the Coast Guard's \nfleet and related communications equipment. The budget resolution \nbefore us, following the President's budget proposal, has proposed $500 \nmillion for this project in fiscal year 2004, which is only enough to \ncomplete the project in 20 years or longer--the timetable outlined \nbefore the September 11 attacks. Clearly, current circumstances call \nfor greater urgency. This amendment would provide an additional $700 \nmillion, for a total of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2004, to complete \nthe Deepwater Initiative in closer to 10 years.\n  In addition to the port security initiatives I have outlined, we must \nstrengthen other components of our border security. In particular, the \namendment calls for an additional $1 billion in FY 04 to increase \nborder personnel and to improve information technology systems for the \nborder. On personnel, we must strengthen the presence of Customs and \nimmigration inspectors and of Border Patrol agents in key areas. \nIndeed, some of these enhancements were mandated by the Patriot Act and \nthe Border Security Act but have not been funded and filled to date. I \nwould allocate additional funds to hire at least 2,000-3,000 new border \npersonnel. With respect to technology, it is especially critical that \nwe expedite implementation of the biometric document system as mandated \nby the Patriot Act and Border Security Act. The biometric document \nsystem will include biologically unique identifiers for immigrants, \nreducing the risk that immigrants will enter illegally or under an \nassumed identity. The budget resolution before us clearly has not \nallocated significant new resources to achieve this new system in the \nrequired timeframe, or anything close to it. The additional $1 billion \nin my amendment would allow us to make significant progress on these \nborder security needs.\n  We must also invest more in transportation security by increasing \nfunding $1.7 billion over the levels proposed by the administration and \nthe pending budget resolution. As we saw tragically on September 11, \n2001, terrorists can exploit weaknesses in our transportation networks \nto turn them into instruments of terror. The Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, was created to confront that grim reality, but it \ncannot succeed without more support from the Administration and \nCongress.\n\n  The TSA has made its initial mark at our airports, overseeing \npassenger screening and requirements that baggage be screened for \npossible explosives. Now, the agency must build on that work by \nexpanding rapidly to other transportation sectors. Unfortunately, the \nbudget resolution before us allows for neither task. It would provide \njust $4.8 billion for TSA in FY 04, a 10 percent decrease from the \nAdministration's FY03 request of $5.3B.\n  My amendment calls for $1.7 billion in additional resources to \nimprove transportation security. Among other things, this would restore \nthe Administration's proposed cut to the overall TSA budget, ensure the \nagency can continue to fulfill its existing missions, and enable the \nTSA to begin to expand its work beyond passenger airline security to \nother critical transportation needs including bridges, railways, \ntunnels, subways and buses.\n  In addition to this general increase, the amendment would invest an \nadditional $500 million in FY 04 on freight and passenger rail security \nenhancements, based on legislation approved by the Commerce Committee \nlast session, S. 1991. The bulk of that money would fund security \nimprovements for Amtrak, such as protection of bridges, tunnels and key \nfacilities. Amtrak would also receive money to help improve equipment \nfor emergency communications equipment and other security needs, and to \ntrain personnel to detect and handle potential attacks. With respect to \nmass transit, the amendment would provide $500 million for grants to \naddress urgent transit security needs, as identified by GAO, including \ncommunications systems, surveillance equipment and mobile command \ncenters. Additionally, the amendment would call for $200 million in FY \n04 for bus security grants, as outlined in legislation S. 1739 that won \nthe endorsement last session of the Commerce Committee. These grants \nwould enable carriers to improve passenger screening, training and \ncommunications, surveillance equipment and other security measures.\n  Next comes preparing ourselves for bioterror attacks and attacks \nusing other weapons of mass destruction--which demands an investment in \nFY 04 of $3 billion above the pending resolution. Some of the most \nchilling scenarios posed by homeland security experts are those of a \nchemical, biological or radiological attack. We are depending on our \npublic health network to help prepare for and respond to such an \nassault. Yet these health providers have not been given nearly enough \nresources to fulfill this role.\n  For example, despite the scope of the threat and our relative lack of \npreparedness, the resolution would invest just $940 million--flat \nfunding--in CDC grants to help state public health departments care for \nand track infectious disease outbreaks. That's just not enough. My \namendment would provide an additional $1 billion in FY 04--essentially \ndouble the proposed and existing funding level--to help these \ndepartments detect and cope with a bioterror attack. Among other \nthings, this funding could help defray the costs of administering the \nAdministration's smallpox vaccination program.\n  In the same vein, my amendment would double the federal appropriation \nfor the Health Resources and Services Administration, which provides \nmoney to help hospitals increase capacity, training and supplies. These \nimprovements are essential if our hospitals are to be prepared for a \nbiological, chemical or radiological event, yet, again, President Bush \nhas proposed flat funding for this program. Instead, we should increase \nthis account by $500 million, for a total of about $1 billion.\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\n  It will mean little to prepare our health infrastructure, however, if \nthey have no tools to employ--no detective or preventive measures, or \ncountermeasures to administer after an attack. The budget resolution \nwould provide some new funds to confront this challenge--such as the \nproposed Project Bioshield--but those proposals do not go far enough \nand are not targeted effectively enough to provide the jumpstart we \nneed in this area.\n  My amendment would call for an additional $1.5 billion for biothreat \nand other key research and development countermeasures--particularly \nefforts to get research from ``bench to bedside,'' translating basic \ndiscoveries into usable products. I recommend that the money be \navailable through the following entities: the Homeland Security \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, HSARPA, the National Bio-Weapons \nDefense Analysis Center and the Strategic National Stockpile. Increased \nfunding of these three programs would permit adequate funding of \npromising countermeasures research, essential investigation of the \nunderlying mechanism of biological threats, and procurement of needed \nmedicines and vaccines to our defensive pharmaceutical arsenal. In \naddition, some of this money should be available to compensate health \ncare workers who suffer ill effects from the smallpox vaccination \nprogram urged by the President.\n  The last but by no means least funding priority I want to address \ntoday is permanent protection of our critical infrastructure, which \ndemands a half-billion increase over the pending budget resolution. \nHomeland security experts have increasingly highlighted the \nvulnerability of the nation's critical infrastructure as one of the \nmost dangerous gaps in our homeland defenses. About 85 percent of these \nresources--which include such vital systems as energy distribution \ngrids, chemical and nuclear plants, or financial networks--are in \nprivate hands, complicating the process for assuring adequate security.\n  The administration, and the resolution before us, seem content to \ncontinue studying the vulnerabilities of these systems. They have \nrequested about $500 million for this process in FY 04. This would \nenable far too sluggish progress for such a vital task. My amendment \ncalls for an additional $500 million in FY 04 to get these assessments \ndone at once so that we can move to create action plans and conduct \nneeded security enhancements at the earliest possible moment.\n  Halfway around the world, the American military and our allies are \nfighting to disarm a dictator who refused to give up his weapons for 12 \nlong years. I believe our brave men and women in uniform will \naccomplish their mission--and that when they do, the world will be a \nsafer place for peaceful people, and a worse place for terrorists and \ntyrants.\n  But here at home, to guard the land beneath our feet, other men and \nwomen in uniform are engaged in another front of the war against \nterrorism--and unlike the men and women of our armed forces, we have \nnot given them all the support, the training, the technology, and the \nresources they need to succeed.\n  We owe it to our nation and ourselves to do better. On September 3, \n1939, shortly after Britain declared war on Germany, Winston Churchill \nsaid, ``Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed \nwith the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts this Sunday morning \nthere is peace. . . . Our consciences are at rest.''\n  Our consciences as Americans--and as parents to our children--will \nonly rest when we demonstrate the leadership and invest the resources \nto counter the fury the terrorists seek to bring upon us. Protecting \nthe American people in an age of terrorism demands strong leadership \nand enormous resources--and it demands them now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the significant budget challenges faced by \nour Federal Government demand that Congress develop proposals for sound \neconomic growth, while also working to cut wasteful government \nspending. The Budget resolution before the Senate today goes a long way \ntowards accomplishing that goal.\n  Even before 9/11, we know now that our current recession began in \nlate 2000.\n  The attack on America on September 11, the necessary cost of the war \non terrorism, and now the threat of a war with Iraq have led to a \ndramatic deterioration of tax revenues, huge spending increases, and \nthe return to budget deficits.\n  Over the last 2 years, revenues to the Federal Government have fallen \nby nearly 9 percent. And spending grew by 12 percent over that same \nperiod.\n  Unfortunately, revenues continue to underperform in 2003.\n  Congress cannot ignore our struggling economy, and I believe that the \nresolution before the Senate today addresses many of our economic \nproblems.\n  The committee-reported budget resolution increases deficits in the \nnear-term in order to invest in the economy and fight the war on \nterrorism.\n  The resolution provides over $725 billion during the 10-year period \nfrom 2003 to 2013 to the Senate Finance Committee for economic growth \nand job creation.\n  This tax relief is designed to let American families keep more of the \nmoney they earn. Economic growth is more easily achieved in an \natmosphere where more Americans are able to save and invest their \nmoney.\n  Tax relief provides economic growth, and when we draft legislation, \nwe should understand not just the cost of tax relief to the federal \nbudget, but also the benefits that tax relief provides to the economy \nand the long-term increase in revenues to the Federal Government that \ntax relief can provide.\n  The amount provided for this tax relief includes enough to \naccommodate the President's plans to accelerate the marriage penalty \nrelief, increase the child tax credit, eliminate the double-taxation of \ndividends, and increase small business expensing limits.\n  Although I may not agree with all of it, I do believe the President's \ntax proposal, which we included in this budget, is an overall good plan \nfor solid long-term economic growth.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Budget Committee does not dictate tax \npolicy changes. However, the committee resolution does provide enough \nmoney for specific growth proposals, but it will ultimately be up to \nthe Fiance Committee to write the policy.\n  I do agree with those who are concerned about budget deficits. The \nBudget before the Senate today does include 9 years of deficits. The \ndeficits do grow smaller, and eventually go back to surplus in the out \nyears.\n  I want to make it clear that I do not excuse the deficits, and I \nwould love to put us immediately into surpluses in this fiscal year. I \nthink it is important that Congress makes the return back to surpluses \na top priority. And we are not going to do that by spending.\n  I also believe we must be realistic in the constraints that the \nevents of the past two years have placed on our ability to balance the \nbudget in the immediate fiscal year.\n  I have confidence that the fastest way we can get back to surpluses \nis by fixing the economy through policy changes that encourage economic \ngrowth, coupled with a reduction in wasteful government spending. Mr. \nPresident, unfortunately, as we all know, in Washington DC we do not \nactually cut spending.\n  The best we can hope to do is control the growth of spending.\n  As Ronald Reagan stated during his State of the Union address on \nJanuary 25, 1984, ``The problems we're overcoming are not the heritage \nof one person, party or even one generation. It's just the tendency of \ngovernment to grow, for practices and programs to become the nearest \nthing to eternal life we'll ever see on this Earth. And there's always \nthat well-intentioned chorus of voices saying, ``With a little more \npower and a little more money, we could do so much for people.''\n  President Reagan was right.\n  Once we establish a federal program, it develops a constituency and \nthen it becomes impossible to cut. And we love to go home to our \nconstituents and tell them about the money we brought home from \nWashington DC for our home state projects.\n  If the other side of the aisle is concerned about deficits, as they \nsay they are, then they should join us in cutting out some of the \nwasteful spending in the Federal Government.\n  This resolution may not be the perfect blueprint to surpluses, but it \nmakes a good start by providing both sound tax policy for economic \ngrowth, as well as a control in federal spending.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this resolution today, and \nthat we will make an effort to tighten up the purse strings around \nhere, and start to work together during these difficult economic times \nto bring our budget back into balance.\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nDorgan prescription drug amendment to the fiscal year 2004 budget \nresolution.\n  The fact is, when Medicare was designed in 1965, the system relied on \ninpatient hospitalization and seldom on outpatient services, preventive \ncare, or patient drug therapies. At that time, prescription drugs only \naccounted for 4 percent of all personal health care expenditures.\n  But as we enter the 21st century, the cutting edge of health care has \nshifted. Every day, as new preventive and therapeutic drugs replace \noutdated inpatient procedures, Medicare falls further and further \nbehind in providing basic care.\n  Medicare was written to cover the most basic health care for seniors. \nWhen the original bill passed, the legislation's conference report \nexplicitly stated that the program was designed to provide adequate \n``medical aid . . . for needy people, and should ``make the best of \nmodern medicine more readily available to the aged.''\n  Well, we are not making the best use of modern medicine when millions \nof seniors cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. Prescription \ndrugs that had not even been developed when Medicare was enacted are \nnow an essential aspect of basic health care. We owe it to our seniors \nto live up to Medicare's original mandate and provide them the best \nmedical care.\n  Unfortunately, today, beneficiaries' current drug coverage options \nare often expensive and unreliable. And as a result, nearly 7 out of 10 \nMedicare beneficiaries lack decent, dependable coverage for their \nprescription drug needs, and more than one-third have no coverage at \nall. Prescription drug expenditures for the average senior in my home \nstate of Washington are over $2,100 every year--over 122,000 of my \nseniors spend more than $4,000 a year.\n  On average, $1 out of every $5 of every Social Security check to \nWashington State's seniors is spent on prescription drugs. And seniors \nwith the most serious illnesses spend nearly 40 percent of their Social \nSecurity check on prescription drugs.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment would ensure a fair and adequately funded \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. The budget resolution, S. Con. Res. \n23, currently reserves up to $400 billion for the Finance Committee to \nreport legislation that strengthens and enhances Medicare, improves the \naccess of beneficiaries under that program to prescription drugs, or \npromotes geographic equity payments.\n  This amendment would first increase the Medicare reserve fund by \nabout $220 billion, for a total of $620 billion. The amendment also \nspecifies that beneficiaries in traditional Medicare should receive a \ndrug benefit equal to that of beneficiaries who enroll in private \nhealth plans.\n\n  The $400 billion that is proposed in the committee resolution for the \nMedicare reserve fund is not adequate to provide prescription drug \ncoverage for all seniors, because this funding could be used for other \nMedicare ``reforms''--leaving even less for prescription drugs.\n  The Dorgan amendment would ensure adequate funding for a reliable \nprescription drug benefit in Medicare for all beneficiaries. Seniors \nshould not have to abandon traditional Medicare--and join an HMO or \nother private health plan--to receive the prescription drug coverage \nthey need. The Dorgan amendment ensures fairness: all beneficiaries \nwould have a prescription drug benefit without being forced into HMOs \nand other private health plans.\n  In addition to providing a comprehensive, affordable, and adequately \nfunded prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries, the \namendment would be fiscally responsible by including language to \ndecrease the deficit by $250 billion and reduce the proposed tax cut by \nroughly $400 billion.\n  As I visit senior citizen centers in my State of Washington and \ndiscuss a prescription drug benefit, my constituents repeatedly tell me \nthe same thing: They want prescription drug coverage to be \ncomprehensive, simple to administer, guaranteed, stable, and based on \nthe very best medical technology. And most importantly, seniors do not \nwant their prescription drug benefit run through an HMO or other \nprivate insurance company.\n  In fact, according to a June 2002 survey by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation and the Kennedy School of Government, 67 percent of American \npeople believe we should expand Medicare to pay for part of \nprescription drugs, but only 26 percent say we should help seniors buy \nprivate insurance to pay for prescription drugs costs.\n  Seniors want a prescription drug benefit run through Medicare--a \nprogram they understand and upon which they depend. The Dorgan \namendment would ensure that seniors have this choice.\n  Despite basic Federal standards included in Bush's Medicare \nPrescription Drug plan, a private delivery model means that insurers \ncan vary premium costs, benefit design, and the availability of drug \ncoverage across the country. They can create strict formularies that \nlimit access to prescribed drugs and bar access to local pharmacies. \nThat's too much flexibility in a program that is supposed to guarantee \nhelp for seniors.\n  The very basic issue here is that the private market will not cover \nsuch a high-risk population--especially a population at such risk for \nadverse selection. I don't want to see this benefit be a repeat of the \nMedicare+Choice program. And if the private insurance model hasn't \nworked for the full Medicare benefit, it certainly won't work for a \nsingle benefit where utilization is expected to be high.\n  For seniors who choose to remain in the traditional Medicare program, \nthe Bush plan proposes a prescription drug discount card. The GAO \nestimates that the prescription drug discount cards will provide less \nthan a $3.50 discount per prescription. However, the National \nAssociation of Chain Drugstores estimates that the average retail cost \nfor an outpatient prescription drug in 2001 was $54.55.\n  Clearly, the prescription drug discount cards do not offer a viable \nprescription drug benefit for America's seniors. In addition, the low-\nincome subsidy of $600 to supplement the prescription drug discount \ncards is a false promise of assistance for seniors, who spend an \naverage of $2,317 on prescription drugs each year.\n  Seniors account for 12.6 percent of the general population--but a \nthird of all prescription drug expenditures. And while prescriptions \nare expensive--in some cases, prohibitively so--these are the very same \nprescription drugs that keep people out of the hospital, out of the \nnursing home, and living vibrant and happy lives. And while it is \ndifficult to quantify in economic terms, prescription drugs preserve \nhealth and eliminate unnecessary hospitalization--which is by far most \nexpensive segment of the health care.\n  Americans are becoming increasingly reliant on more effective--and \nmore complicated--drug therapies. Total health care spending in the \nUnited States will total more than $1.5 trillion this year, an increase \nof 8.6 percent over last year, according to a March report released by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Prescription drug expenditures are the fastest growing segment of the \nhealth care market--with spending on outpatient prescription drugs by \nMedicare beneficiaries alone increasing by 12 percent annually. CMS \npredicts that prescription drug expenditures will continue to increase \nfaster than any other category of health care spending throughout the \nnext ten years.\n  In 1970, drug expenditures in the United States were about $5.5 \nbillion. Now, for Medicare beneficiaries alone, the CBO projects that \ntotal drug spending will grow from $95 billion in 2003 to $284 billion \nin 2013. This is a total of $1.8 trillion on prescription drug costs \nover the next ten years. Medicare beneficiaries alone will spend $1.8 \ntrillion on prescription drugs over the next ten years.\n  But while we discuss the potential cost of a new benefit, we also \nneed to discuss national priorities. I believe we can do a fair and \nadequately funded prescription drug benefit while living within our \nbudget, and we can do so by having a clear vision for our country's \npriorities. One of my top priorities is getting a new prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare beneficiaries in Washington State. But this may \nmean making other tough choices.\n  I strongly believe that we need to include a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program and I will continue to fight to ensure \nthat all Washingtonians have access to the prescription medications \nthey need.\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sarbanes-\nJeffords-Mikulski-Graham water infrastructure amendment.\n  Our amendment is simple and straightforward: It adds $3 billion to \nthe 2004 budget resolution for a total of $5.2 billion for water and \nsewer infrastructure in 2004. The amendment increases funding for EPA's \nClean Water State Revolving Loan Fund from $1.35 billion to $3.2 \nbillion, and increases funding for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving \nLoan Fund from $850 million to $2 billion.\n  Our amendment is necessary for two reasons.\n  First, our Nation's communities are facing enormous needs in their \nefforts to provide clean and safe water. The need for better sewer and \ndrinking water systems is much greater than what we put in the Federal \ncheckbook each year. These needs have been studied and restudied and \nthe needs are real and valid.\n  In April 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network reported that our \nNation's water and wastewater systems will face a funding gap of $23 \nbillion a year over the next 20 years. In November 2001, the general \nAccounting Office reported that cost range from $300 billion to $1 \ntrillion over the next 20 years. In September 2002, the Environmental \nProtection Agency reported that demands for improved sewer and drinking \nwater systems will outstrip current levels by $535 billion. And in \nNovember 2002, the Congressional Budget Office reported that water and \nsewer costs could average as much as $40 billion each year. The results \nare conclusive and the need is real and valid.\n  We are not putting enough funding in the Federal checkbook each year. \nThe current level for water infrastructure is only $2.2 billion. We \ncan't expect communities to comply with growing regulations like \narsenic, radon, and new requirements related to security, to name just \na few, without increased financial assistance.\n  If we don't help, the entire burden falls on local ratepayers. In \nmany urban and rural low-income areas, rate increases are just not \naffordable. My hometown of Baltimore is facing a $1 billion cost in \norder to meet Federal regulations.\n  The second reason that this amendment is necessary is for job \ncreation. The economy lost 300,000 jobs in February. Water \ninfrastructure funding creates jobs. For every $1 billion we spend on \nwater infrastructure, up to 40,000 jobs are created.\n  This amendment is a mini-stimulus package for three reasons:\n  First, it will create and sustain jobs. As I stated, for every $1 \nbillion in SRF funding, about 40,000 jobs are created. Second, the \namendment is temporary and targeted.\n  The amendment is a one-time, $3 billion increase of an existing \nprogram. It does not create a new bureaucracy. Third, the amendment \ndoes not contribute to long-term deficits because the $3 billion is \nfully offset by reducing the tax cut.\n  This $3 billion increase for water infrastructure is less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the $726 billion tax cut in this budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, the Sarbanes-Jeffords-Mikulski-Graham amendment helps \nour communities by providing more funding for immediate water and sewer \nneeds and by creating jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to speak \nto a $2.8 billion amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin, myself and \nothers to increase the health function in this resolution. The \namendment would add to the funding already included in the resolution \nfor the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, \nand the Health Resources and Services Administration as well as other \nhealth programs. The amendment is offset by an across-the-board \nreduction in function 920. This reduction would not cut programs, but \nsimply reduce administrative expenses, travel, and consulting services \nby .36 percent. This amendment would provide NIH with a $2.3 billion \nincrease over the fiscal year 2003 appropriation.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education and Related Agencies, I have said many times \nthat the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the \nFederal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government. \nWhen I came to the Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. \nThe fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained $27.2 \nbillion for the NIH which completed the doubling begun in fiscal year \n1998. This money has been very well spent. The successes realized by \nthis investment in NIH have spawned revolutionary advances in our \nknowledge and treatment for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Parkinson's disease, mental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, \nheart disease, ALS, and many others. It is clear that Congress's \ncommitment to the NIH is paying off. Now it is crucial that increased \nfunding be continued in order to translate these advances into \nadditional treatments and cures. Our investment has resulted in new \ngenerations of AIDS drugs which are reducing the presence of the AIDS \nvirus in HIV-infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death \nrates from cancer have begun a steady decline. With the sequencing of \nthe human genome, we will begin, over the next few years, to reap the \nbenefits in many fields of research. And if scientists are correct, \nstem cell research could result in a veritable fountain of youth by \nreplacing diseased or damaged cells. I anxiously await the results of \nall of these avenues of remarkable research. This is the time to seize \nthe scientific opportunities that lie before us.\n  On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nstating that funding for the NIH should be doubled over 5 years. \nRegrettably, even though the resolution was passed by an overwhelming \nvote of 98 to nothing, the budget resolution contained a $100 million \nreduction for health programs. That prompted Senator Harkin and myself \nto offer an amendment to the budget resolution to add $1.1 billion to \ncarry out the expressed sense of the Senate to increase NIH funding. \nUnfortunately, our amendment was tabled by a vote of 63 to 37. We were \nextremely disappointed that, while the Senate had expressed its \ndruthers on a resolution, it was simply unwilling to put up the actual \ndollars to accomplish this vital goal.\n  The following year, Senator Harkin and I again introduced an \namendment to the budget resolution which called for a $2 billion \nincrease for the NIH. While we gained more support on this vote than in \nthe previous year, our amendment was again tabled by a vote of 57-41. \nNot to be deterred, Senator Harkin and I again went to work with our \nsubcommittee and we were able to add an additional $2 billion to the \nNIH account for fiscal year 1999.\n  In fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I offered another amendment \nto the budget resolution to add $1.4 billion to the health accounts, \nover and above the $600 million increase which had already been \nprovided by the Budget Committee. Despite this amendment's defeat by a \nvote of 47 to 52, we were able to provide a $2.3 billion increase for \nNIH in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill.\n  In fiscal year 2001, Senator Harkin and I again offered an amendment \nto the budget resolution to increase funding for health programs by \n$1.6 billion. This amendment passed by a vote of 55 to 45. This victory \nbrought the NIH increase to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2001. However, \nafter late night conference negotiations with the House, the funding \nfor NIH was cut by $200 million below that amount.\n  In fiscal year 2002, the budget resolution once again fell short of \nthe amount necessary to achieve the NIH doubling. Senator Harkin and I, \nalong with nine other Senators offered an amendment to add an \nadditional $700 million to the resolution to achieve our goal. The vote \nwas 96 to 4. The Senate Labor-HHS subcommittee reported a bill \nrecommending $23.7 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the \nprevious year's funding. But during conference negotiations with the \nHouse, we once again fell short by $410 million. That meant that in \norder to stay on a path to double NIH, we would need to provide an \nincrease of $3.7 billion in the fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year 2003 \nomnibus appropriations bill contained the additional $3.7 billion, \nwhich achieves the doubling effort. We have fought long and hard to \nmake the doubling of funding a reality, but until treatments and cures \nare found for the\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nmany maladies that continue to plague our society, we must continue our \nfight.\n  I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously from the \ninvestment we have made in the National Institutes of Health and the \namendment that we offer today will continue to carry forward the \nimportant research work of the world's premier medical research \nfacility.\n  While the budget resolution assumes some increases in chronic \ndisease, health statistics and HIV/AIDS, cuts in other CDC programs \ntotal over $300 million. This amendment would add $600 million to the \namount already assumed in this resolution.\n  Several years ago, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and was appalled at the deplorable conditions of the \nlaboratories and buildings at the Atlanta campus. I found laboratory \nfacilities with roofs that were leaking on high-technology equipment, \nequipment falling through rotted floors, and bathrooms that had been \nconverted into labs and office space. The CDC, as the lead Federal \nagency responsible for promoting health and preventing and controlling \ndisease, should have adequate facilities and equipment to carry out its \nmission. To address the facility and equipment needs, Senator Harkin \nand I included $175 million in fiscal year 2001 to begin renovations on \ncampus. In fiscal year 2002, we included $250 million and the same \namount was appropriated in fiscal year 2003. The amount assumed in the \nbudget resolution is inadequate to continue the construction work \nneeded to make the CDC safe for workers and ensure that the next public \nhealth emergency will not overwhelm the current capacities of the CDC \nto respond to a biodefense attack or other illness. Additional dollars \nare also needed for prevention and health promotion programs such as \nimmunization, tuberculosis, cancers and cardiovascular disease.\n  The budget resolution assumes a decrease of $785 million for the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration. This amendment would add \n$400 million to restore some of the proposed cuts in health professions \nand provide for program increases in Ryan White AIDS, abstinence \neducation and Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education.\n  The increases included in this amendment are essential if we are to \ncontinue to carry forward the important work at the world's premier \nmedical research facility, ensure that the CDC has equipment and \nlaboratories to confront any public health crisis that may occur, and \nprovide the Health Resources and Services Administration with the \ndollars necessary to fund community health centers, train health care \nprofessionals, and confront the AIDS crisis.\n  I ask that you join Senator Harkin and me in supporting the \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address Senators Lautenberg \nand Corzine's proposed amendment to the budget resolution. Superfund \nand the cleanup of pollution sites should be an important concern to \nall of us. We must be concerned that our future generations are not \njeopardized by past inactions. But this amendment has been offered in \nan inapproprate forum, at an inappropriate place, using an \ninappropriate procedural method and I have voted no. As chairman of the \nFinance Committee, we will be able to consider this issue under more \nappropriate circumstances.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, while our thoughts are with our troops, \nthe business of Congress continues. And we need to approach our \nchallenges at home with the same resolve and the same seriousness of \npurpose with which our sons and daughters are confronting the threat \nabroad. It is sadly ironic that at the very time when our service men \nand women are inspiring us with their courage in the face of danger, \nthis budget runs and hides from one challenge after another while \nshowering $1.4 trillion in tax breaks primarily to the most prosperous \namong us.\n  Month after month, more American families are suffering from the \nfailure of this administration's irresponsible economic strategy. With \nthe economy hemorrhaging jobs from every sector, an increasing number \nof Americans are losing faith that they will ever find a job. But with \nthis budget, Republicans have turned their backs on the problems of \nAmerican families. Instead of offering new ideas and new solutions, the \nadministration continues to push a tired ideology that has turned our \neconomy into a job-destroying machine. This budget will hang some $1.5 \ntrillion of debt around the necks of our children. They will be paying \nfor this mistake for decades to come. The President's own economists \nagree that these chronic deficits will raise interest rates, hold back \nour economy today, and rob opportunity from even more Americans.\n  And though all Americans' thoughts are with our Armed Forces today, I \nwould ask that they take a moment to ask, why is this Republican \nCongress saddling our children with record-breaking deficits and \nmassive debt? It is not to fund the war or the rebuilding of Iraq that \nwill follow. It is not to protect our homeland. Republicans continue to \nshortchange the police and firefighters who need our help to prevent or \nrespond to a terrorist attack in their own communities, and continue to \noppose funding to better secure our borders, ports, and vulnerable \ninfrastructure. It is not to get our economy moving again. Like the \nPresident's budget, the Republican resolution before us contains very \nlittle to immediately stimulate the economy. It is not to provide all \nof our seniors with a real Medicare prescription drug plan or \nstrengthen Social Security for the coming generation of retirees. This \nplan starves Medicare and raids the Social Security surplus. It is not \nto come to the aid of States and local governments that are suffering \nthe worst fiscal crisis in 50 years. This budget will place an even \ngreater burden on our States. And it is not to build world-class \nschools so our children have the tools and skills they need to make the \nmost of their own lives. While some schools around our country will be \nforced to shut their doors early this year due to budget cuts, the \nPresident's plan falls $10 billion short of his own promise to \neducation.\n  This budget is not about meeting the challenges of the moment or the \nfuture. This budget is about one thing, and one thing only. More new \ntax breaks for the very wealthy at the expense of everyone else. At the \nexpense of deep cuts in domestic priorities. At the expense of record \ndeficits that will be imposed on our children and grandchildren.\n  Any other year, this budget would be seen as mean-spirited and \ndivisive. Today it is shameful. Across the globe, on display for all \nthe world to see, young men and women are risking their lives to secure \nthe lives and liberty of others. And yet here in this Capitol, on \ndisplay for the world to see, a Republican Congress is taking money out \nof the pockets of our own children. It is choosing not to provide the \nnecessary resources to make our homeland more secure. It is choosing \nnot to give States any help to deal with their mounting fiscal crisis. \nIt is choosing not to keep its commitments on education. It is choosing \nnot to provide needed health care and prescription drug coverage to our \nmost ill and vulnerable. With all those challenges and needs, this \nCongress instead is choosing to give hundreds of billions in new tax \nbreaks to the wealthiest among us.\n  Democrats are going to keep fighting to fund homeland security, \nprovide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit; honor our commitment \nto our students and teachers; restore funding to make up for Republican \ncuts to national defense and veterans programs, and offer relief to our \nStates and local governments. This is not a time to shrink from our \nresponsibilities to one another. We need to meet the test of this \ndemanding moment in our history. This Congress should be producing a \nbudget that reflects the very best of our Nation, the spirit that our \nsoldiers exemplify the spirit of honor, sacrifice, and duty in the \nservice of a better future for us all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no later than \n4 p.m. on Monday, the ranking member of the Budget Committee provide to \nthe chairman a list of 40 amendments, and the chairman provide to the \nranking member a list of no more than 40 amendments, which would then \nbe in order to be offered to the budget resolution; I also ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate then resume consideration of the \nbudget resolution at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and, at that time, it be in \norder for the majority leader or\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\nthe Democratic leader or their designees to offer amendments from the \nrespective list, and the Senate would then proceed to votes in relation \nto the amendments as provided for under the Budget Act, with 2 minutes \nfor debate equally divided prior to the vote, with relevant second-\ndegree amendments; provided that no later than 4 p.m. on Wednesday, \nMarch 26, the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of S. Con. Res. 23, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask consent that immediately upon passage of the \nresolution, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res 95, \nthe House budget resolution; further, all after the resolving clause be \nstricken and the text of S. Con. Res. 23, as amended, be inserted in \nlieu thereof, the resolution be adopted, and the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair then be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nthank all of our colleagues, especially colleagues on my side of the \naisle who have a great deal of skepticism, I would say, about this \nparticular proposal. I think it is equally clear that there is \nskepticism on both sides.\n  We have been through a good deal of debate over the last several \ndays. I think we have made progress. This will accommodate adequate \nprogress on both sides. I will say, as the majority leader and I have \ndiscussed on a few occasions, that this agreement requires a good deal \nof trust on both sides. We are trusting our Republican colleagues to \nwork with us to accommodate the consideration of 40 amendments. They \nare trusting us that we will share with them those amendments, that we \nwill be able to work through them, that they will have an opportunity \nto review them, and that we will complete our work at 4 o'clock.\n  So it does require cooperation and a level of trust that I hope will \nset a standard and example for other action we take later on. So I hope \nthat our colleagues will continue to cooperate in the course of the \nnext couple of days.\n  I have designated the ranking member of the Budget Committee and our \nextraordinary assistant Democratic leader. They have been tasked with \nthe responsibility of determining these 40 amendments. So we will work \nover the weekend and we will, as this agreement requires, provide those \namendments on Monday.\n  I appreciate very much the cooperation and the trust of the \ndistinguished majority leader and the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nThis certainly is the best way to accommodate the needs of both of our \ncaucuses. I congratulate my colleagues for doing so.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will comment and then turn to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I want to briefly say this and close \nmy remarks by expressing my appreciation to our caucus and to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and especially to the leadership on \nthe other side of the aisle and the ranking member. As most people \nknow, we have been negotiating and discussing in the last several hours \nhow to bring to closure what we all know is a big challenge, given the \nnumber of amendments that we have before us.\n\n  We put our heads together and, after a lot of conversation and, as \nthe Democratic leader said, basing a lot of what we are setting out to \ndo over the next several days on trust, came up with an agreement that \nis not perfect on either side, but it is the best we can do to give \nsome finite closure to this challenge.\n  In addition, we have had a very good week. It is late on a Friday \nnight and our colleagues have worked very hard. Indeed, we had very \ngood and productive discussions. We have done a number of amendments. I \ncongratulate the ranking member and chairman in bringing those to the \nfloor and having good debate today.\n  In addition to that, the resolution we agreed to sent a very \nimportant signal to our troops, our military, and our Commander in \nChief: our gratitude, respect, and support.\n  So we have actually accomplished a lot this week. We were unable to \nfulfill what I had initially hoped, and that was to pass the budget \nresolution by late tonight. But given the fact that at this hour we \nstill have many outstanding amendments, I am very pleased with the \nagreement. I thank the leadership and the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the leader will yield, I have a couple of comments. \nOne, I appreciate the cooperation of the leader and Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid and Senator Conrad. But just for the information of our \ncolleagues, we are going to have a very tough couple of days, a lot of \nwork to do on Tuesday and Wednesday. I urge our colleagues to be ready \nto go. I think the order called for us going into session at 9:30 \nTuesday morning.\n  Today, we worked long and hard. We had about 15 rollcall votes, and I \nbelieve we accepted probably another 15 amendments, counting the last \n7. It is going to be very challenging work. So I urge our colleagues to \nbe notified of the fact that they need to be here at 9:30 Tuesday \nmorning and expect a long day--a lot of votes on Tuesday and a lot of \nvotes on Wednesday. It is going to take the cooperation of all Members \nfor us to meet this ambitious goal. It will not be easy and it probably \nwon't be very pretty. Hopefully, we will be successful in meeting our \nobjectives. There is nothing in the unanimous consent agreement saying \nwe have to agree to 40 amendments?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No; we tried that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just wanted to make sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, the leaders have indicated \nthere has to be trust on both sides. The chairman of the committee has \nshown himself to be trustworthy in these long, difficult negotiations \nthis whole week. We had instances last night where I had to make a \ndecision that could have disadvantaged our side and did it because that \nwas keeping a promise. The chairman of the committee had to make a \ndecision today that could have disadvantaged his side, but he did it to \nkeep faith with the commitment that he made.\n  I want colleagues on our side to know the chairman of the committee \nhas repeatedly demonstrated trustworthiness. That is important to the \nfunctioning of this body. We are going to have to really work together \nvery closely to resolve these matters.\n  Let me say in conclusion to our colleagues on this side, we have 135 \namendments pending. We only have 40 spots. That means Senators are \ngoing to have to give up what is their right to offer amendments. That \nis the most precious right any Senator has. So we understand why they \nguard that right with real fervor at times. But I hope people \nunderstand there is no way we can fit 135 into 40. It is going to take \nrestraint, and it is going to take trust.\n  I think together over these next days we will demonstrate we are \nworthy of this body we serve and this country we love.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in wrap-up a little bit later tonight, we \nwill be more specific, but for our colleagues, on Monday we will not be \nhaving votes, but we will be in session. We will talk about the day. We \nwill not be voting on Monday. We need to have everybody here on time \nTuesday because we will be voting in a vote-athon, as we have come to \ncall it, starting early in the morning. We want people to make plans \naccordingly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4268-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, as President pro tempore, I send to the \ndesk a letter received from the President of the United States wherein \nhe informs the Congress of his comments concerning his actions \nconsistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 107-40. I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On September 24, 2001, I reported the \n     deployment of various combat-equipped and combat support \n     forces to a number of locations in the Central and Pacific \n     Command areas of operation. On October 9, 2001, I reported \n     the beginning of combat action in Afghanistan against \n     terrorists and their Taliban supporters. In my reports to the \n     Congress of March 20 and September 20, 2002, I provided \n     supplemental information on the deployment of combat-equipped \n     and combat support forces to a number of foreign nations in \n     the Central and Pacific Command areas of operations and other \n     areas. As a part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed, \n     I am reporting further on United States' efforts in the \n     global war on terrorism.\n       Our efforts in Afghanistan have met with success, but as I \n     have stated in my previous reports, the U.S. campaign against \n     terrorism will be lengthy. To date, U.S. Armed Forces, with \n     the assistance of numerous coalition partners, have executed \n     a superb campaign to eliminate the primary source of support \n     to the terrorists who viciously attacked our Nation on \n     September 11, 2001. The heart of al-Qaida's training \n     capability has been seriously degraded. The Taliban's ability \n     to brutalize the Afghan people and to harbor and support \n     terrorists has been virtually eliminated. Pockets of al-Qaida \n     and Taliban forces remain a threat to U.S. and coalition \n     forces and to the Afghan government. What is left of both the \n     Taliban and the al-Qaida fighters is being pursued actively \n     and engaged by U.S. and coalition forces. Additionally, \n     training missions and combat operations with Pakistani \n     special forces are ongoing near the Afghan/Pakistan border.\n       Due to our success in Afghanistan, we have detained \n     hundreds of al-Qaida and Taliban fighters who are believed to \n     pose a continuing threat to the United States and its \n     interests. The combat-equipped and combat support forces \n     deployed to Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the Southern \n     Command area of operations since January 2002, continue to \n     conduct secure detention operations. We currently hold more \n     than 600 enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay. All are being \n     treated humanely and, to the extent appropriate and \n     consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent \n     with the principles of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\n       In furtherance of our worldwide efforts against terrorists \n     who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the United \n     States, our friends and allies, and our forces abroad, we \n     continue operations in other areas around the globe. Our \n     relationship with the Government and Armed Forces of the \n     Philippines (AFP) developed and matured throughout 2002. Last \n     year's actions from February to July 2002 on Basilan Island, \n     with AFP in command and with U.S. forces in a support role, \n     helped to drive hundreds of Abu Sayyaf Group terrorists from \n     the island, restoring order and reestablishing government \n     services. To ensure that the AFP has the skills to fight \n     terrorism over the long term, we have a robust security \n     assistance training program and a variety of exercises that \n     will provide the AFP much needed counter-terrorism training \n     and equipment. There are approximately 300 combat-equipped \n     and combat support U.S. military personnel working with the \n     AFP and U.S. forces continue to plan with the AFP for \n     possible future activities. Continued U.S. support is \n     warranted as the Government of the Philippines has provided \n     unwavering support in the global war on terrorism.\n       Additionally, we continue to conduct maritime interception \n     operations on the high seas in the Central and European \n     Command areas of responsibility to prevent the movement, \n     arming, or financing of international terrorists who pose a \n     continuing threat to the United States.\n       Combat-equipped and combat support forces also have been \n     deployed to Georgia and Yemen to assist the armed forces of \n     those countries in enhancing their counter-terrorism \n     capabilities, including by training and equipping their armed \n     forces. Similar U.S. forces have deployed to Djibouti to \n     command and control operations and other activities as \n     necessary against al-Qaida and other international terrorists \n     in the Horn of Africa region. These activities include \n     providing oversight for urban and maritime counter-terrorism \n     training with the Yemen special operations forces. We \n     continue to assess options for working with other nations to \n     assist them in this respect.\n       I have taken these actions pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. In addition, these actions are \n     consistent with Pub. L. 107-40. As I stated in my previous \n     reports, it is not possible to know at this time either the \n     duration of combat operations or the scope and duration of \n     the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter the \n     terrorist threat to the United States. I will direct \n     additional measures as necessary to exercise our right to \n     self-defense and to protect U.S. citizens and interests. Such \n     measures may include short notice deployments of special \n     operations and other forces for sensitive operations in \n     various locations throughout the world.\n       I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep \n     the Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers \n     Resolution and Pub. L. 107-40. Officials of my Administration \n     and I have been communicating regularly with the leadership \n     and other Members of Congress, and we will continue to do so. \n     I appreciate the continuing support of the Congress in our \n     efforts to protect the security of the United States of \n     America and its citizens, civilian and military, here and \n     abroad.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4269-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4269-S4272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTES TO DR. LLOYD JOHN OGILVIE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude to Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, who served as our Chaplain \nin the Senate since 1995.\n  Dr. Ogilvie has been an outstanding Chaplain to the Senate. He is a \nperson I think all of us have grown to know and love and appreciate. He \nhas been our mentor, our companion, our friend, our brother, and our \nChaplain.\n  He has provided great leadership, great prayers. He has prayed for us \nmany times, and not just in his official capacity as Chaplain of the \nSenate. He has prayed for us individually as Members. He has prayed for \nour families. He has been with us through a lot of difficult times, \nchallenging times, exciting times.\n  We want him and his family to know they are very much in our thoughts \nand prayers. His wife Mary Jane is a lovely lady. And she has \nexperienced some very challenging physical tribulations of late. We \nwant both Dr. Ogilvie and his wife Mary Jane to know they are in our \nthoughts and our prayers.\n  We certainly miss him as our Chaplain. He has been kind enough to not \nonly meet with us in the morning and lead us in prayer, but he has met \nwith many of us on a weekly basis--Members of the Senate and also our \nstaffs, and also other people who work in the Senate.\n  He has been a great mentor and friend. We are certainly going to miss \nhim as our Chaplain of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to share a few \ncomments about our Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie. I had the honor to get to \nknow him after I came here. We live near one another. We see each other \non a regular basis. My wife and Mary Jane are friends, as we are with \nLloyd Ogilvie.\n  He is an extraordinary individual, one of the most educated people I \nhave had the honor to know. He has written over 40 books. His book \n``One Quiet Moment'', a devotional, I believe, is the finest devotional \nbook I have ever seen. Reading those devotions, and thinking about \nthem, is so current in time today while also so consistent with the \ngreat traditions of faith that it is really remarkable.\n  It is a special work he created there.\n  During his entire ministry, he was successful, whether in Hollywood, \nCA or in Illinois or here as chaplain. Our prayers are with Mary Jane, \nhis wife. She is suffering substantially now. We worry about her. We \ncare about her. Our prayers are with her. She has such a fighting \nspirit. She is a champion of life and of the good things of life. She \nspeaks her mind and she has great values. They are a tremendous team.\n  I, too, join with others in expressing my appreciation for what he \nmeans to me, my appreciation for what he does for others in the Senate, \nincluding our staff members for whom he has ministered and for whom he \nhas represented an outstanding example of the richest kind of Christian \nfaith.\n  We have been blessed by having him here. We certainly will miss him. \nI will miss him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to comment a moment on our \nChaplain who is leaving us.\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\n  I vividly recall when our previous Chaplain indicated he was not \ngoing to serve us any longer. Many of us thought it would be impossible \nto replace him. I was in a small group--I don't remember if it was \nthree or five Senators--who were given the job of going out and looking \nin America for another Chaplain. Senator Stevens was a member, I \nrecall. So was Senator Mark Hatfield. I don't recall the others.\n  There were a lot of people. I was not so sure that Lloyd Ogilvie, \nbased on the things he had done in his life--he was a great preacher; \nhe had large assemblies of Christians he spoke to in the California \narea. I did not believe, as one, that he would necessarily fit in, but \nI said: Let's try him.\n  He preaches with a beautiful voice; he sounds almost like you would \nexpect God to sound. He came, and he has been absolutely marvelous. \nEverybody here has learned to grow in faith and confidence having him \naround.\n  It is too bad he has to leave, but he is a very loyal man in terms of \nhis marriage and his wife. I think her illness takes him to join her. I \nhope she gets well, although she has been very critical and he sees fit \nto be present there with her.\n  So we all say good-bye and good luck. Whomever he serves and whomever \nhe shares his views with as to where we came from, where we are going \nto go when we finish here on Earth, and our value system, I am sure \nthey will all benefit, just as we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me add my voice in commendation of \nLloyd Ogilvie. He has been superb as the religious leader of this body.\n  Several years ago, my chief of staff died suddenly and unexpectedly. \nI called Dr. Ogilvie on very short notice and asked him to come and \nlead my staff in prayer and remembrance. I will never forget the \nextraordinary job, the extraordinary sensitivity that Dr. Ogilvie \nbrought to that task. I will never forget the way he made my staff feel \nbetter in a very acute time of loss.\n  Dr. Ogilvie has been a remarkable friend to us all; he has done a \nsuperb job of leading us in prayer, and been a counselor to so many in \nthe Senate family. We are going to miss him very much, and certainly \nmiss the presence of Mary Jane as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \ntalking about our chaplain. Lloyd Ogilvie was very influential in the \nvery short time I knew him these last 2 years. A lot of people around \nthe country don't know him, but he provided a very valuable service to \nthe country by being the spiritual foundation not for just Senators but \nfor the entire Senate family.\n  Because Lloyd Ogilvie had a television ministry, I was very skeptical \nabout who this Senate chaplain was when I first came here a little over \n2 years ago. He leads Bible studies. He leads prayer groups. He leads \ntimes to get together for people. Regardless of faith, whether somebody \nwas Muslim, Jewish or a follower of Jesus, Lloyd John Ogilvie was there \nfor us in the truest sense of the word.\n  He knew what was going on in individual people's lives. If somebody \nwas suffering, he knew about it because people trusted him enough to \nbring him into their confidence. As we have seen over the last couple \nyears, he was there when the Senate was suffering as a family. He would \ncome and comfort us, and he would lead us from a spiritual sense. I \nhave come to greatly admire this man.\n  One of his sayings was quoted in an article I read that helped \ninspire me to run for Congress back in 1994. The saying was: You may \nonly be able to make a small difference, but that does not relieve you \nof the responsibility to make that small difference.\n  People say you can't change the world, so why try. That quote by \nLloyd John Ogilvie tells us of the responsibility we have. Whatever \nsmall difference you can make, that is what you are called to make.\n  This man, who I believe at the end of his days will come before the \nFather in heaven, the Father in heaven will put his hand on his head \nand he will say to Lloyd John Ogilvie: Well done, good and faithful \nservant.\n  Each of us in the Senate family look to Lloyd John Ogilvie and say to \nhim: Thank you. He has truly been a good and faithful servant. My \nprayers go out to him and Mary Jane. She is suffering tremendously. All \nof us together have been joining in prayer to relieve her suffering. It \nhas been a terrible thing to watch them go through. Even through this \nterrible suffering, we have seen the strength of Lloyd and Mary Jane. \nThey have been a comfort to us even through this time of trial.\n  I thank both of them for their service to this country and to the \nSenate family.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me add my appreciation to Dr. Lloyd \nOgilvie for his terrific service to this great institution. I have been \na Member here for not even 3 months now. Lloyd Ogilvie has added such \ngreat inspiration to my life. It has been a joy to get to know him and \nto have the opportunity to listen to him, to learn from him in our \nBible study, to share our Wednesday morning prayer breakfast with him, \nand to have some private time with him. It has been a real joy, a \nprivilege, and something that truly got my career in the Senate started \nin the right way.\n  We are all here truly by the grace of God. There is nobody who \nunderstands the grace of God and is able to express it better than \nLloyd Ogilvie.\n  My wife is a very strong Christian, and the highlight of her week, \nwhen she is able to be up here, is the Tuesday Bible study that the \nspouses attend. Dr. Ogilvie exhibits that same inspiration to the \nspouses as he does to us.\n  We will miss this guy. He is such a great man, a great spiritual \nleader, and a great American. What he and Mary Jane have been through \nover the last couple of years is an inspiration to all of us. It lets \nus know that good men suffer just like everybody else in the world, and \nLloyd Ogilvie and Mary Jane have been through very difficult times.\n  God has a place for all of us, and God truly has placed Lloyd and \nMary Jane in the right place at the right time by sending him to the \nSenate.\n  I told Lloyd this in the last Bible study he led last week. The first \ntime I met him I was not a Member of the Senate. I was a Member of the \nHouse, and I attended the funeral of my close friend and Georgia \ncolleague, Senator Paul Coverdell. It was in a Methodist church in \nAtlanta. When they said that Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, who I knew was a \nPresbyterian minister, was going to have the service, I said: Who is \nthis guy? Why is he coming down to do my friend Paul's service?\n  I told him the other day, I said: It didn't take but one sentence out \nof your mouth, Lloyd, to understand why you are where you are, that God \nhad truly placed you in the right position. And what a terrific job he \ndid for the Coverdell family and all of us at a very difficult time in \nthe life of my State, the life of me personally, and certainly the life \nof the Coverdell family at that point in time.\n  We obviously will keep Lloyd and Mary Jane in our thoughts and \nprayers every single day as they continue to go through difficult \ntimes. Mary Jane had a better day the other day. And when it was \nreported at the prayer breakfast on Wednesday morning, you could just \nsee the light in the room brighten because we knew that Mary Jane was \nfeeling better, which meant Lloyd was feeling better, which meant all \nof us were feeling better.\n  We do cherish the moments we have with Lloyd. We thank him for his \ngreat service to our country and to this great institution. We wish him \nand Mary Jane Godspeed. They will continue to be in our prayers every \nsingle day.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and thank Chaplain \nOgilvie for his service and devotion to the entire Senate family over \nthe past 8 years. Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie has been the Chamber's \nspiritual leader since the 104th Congress, having been nominated to the \nChaplaincy by Majority Leader Robert Dole in 1995, the same year I \njoined the United States Senate. Throughout his tenure here, he has \nfulfilled his role as ``an intercessor, trusted prayer partner, and \nfaithful counselor'' with the commitment, compassion, and comforting \ngrace of a learned and sincere man of God. There are many among us in \nthe Senate who have sought his wisdom and found solace in his council \nand friendship.\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n  In addition to listening to his beautiful prayers at the commencement \nof each legislative session, I have been a regular participant in his \nweekly Bible study groups. Like many of my colleagues, I have watched \nDr. Ogilvie execute his office with a great joy for the work he does \nand a deep respect for the moral difficulties we often face as the \nNation's lawmakers. In times both of celebration and distress, Chaplain \nOgilvie always did more than make himself available to the thousands of \nSenate members, staff, and employees; he reached out to our community \nand brought us together, inviting all faiths and all kinds to be a part \nof the family. Throughout the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and \nin the confusing, frightening time that followed, we witnessed Dr. \nOgilvie's amazing capacity for calming and focusing our thoughts, \nencouraging their expression, and reminding us of the strength we \npossess when we put our faith in God.\n  Chaplain Ogilvie has been a particularly important figure in my \nprivate and professional lives. We pray together daily and frequently \ndiscuss questions of ethics, religion, and law. But he has also shared \nin the personal experiences and sorrows that my own family has \nundergone. Prayerfully guiding me and my wife through the loss of our \nson, Gabriel, Dr. Ogilvie's reassuring words and his friendship were an \ninvaluable source of peace for us then, as they continue to be now.\n  I have much admiration for Lloyd John Ogilvie, and am grateful to \nhim, for leading us all by the example of his life. As he relinquishes \nthe Senate Chaplaincy and returns to California and to his wife, he \nreminds us that our most important responsibilities are always to our \nfamilies and loved ones, and through them, to God.\n  Thank you, Lloyd, for showing us where the right path leads, for \nserving the Senate and our Lord faithfully, and for helping the Senate \nfamily to weather our personal and collective difficulties. Your \nguidance and your companionship will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we will all miss our dear friend Dr. Lloyd \nJ. Ogilvie. His distinguished service to the Senate has been an \nimportant part of this institution during this historic time. Since he \nwas appointed Senate Chaplain in 1995, Dr. Ogilvie has offered \nguidance, support, and prayers to Senators, their staffs, and our \nfamilies. He has greatly enhanced the Office of Senate Chaplain that \nwas instituted at the Senate's first meeting in 1789.\n  Dr. Ogilvie's ministry has been a ballast and a bridge for Senators \non both sides of the aisle. His spiritual leadership has been strong. \nHis service has been selfless. As he takes up his work outside of the \nSenate, Lilibet and I wish to express our profound gratitude for the \ninspiration and wisdom he has shared with so many of us. We cherish our \nfriendship with Lloyd and Mary Jane. May God bless both of them.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie came to the Senate when I \ndid in 1995. He and I became good friends. Lloyd has meant more to me \nthan I can express. He has been a friend and spiritual advisor to my \ncolleagues and many, many staff members and employees of the Senate. \nDemocrats and Republicans, men and women of many different religious \nfaiths, could always call on him.\n  He has been a focal point of the Senate family. On September 11, and \nevery day since, his ability to share the power of his faith in God has \nbeen all the more invaluable to me and to others. He is eloquent and \nlearned. He's done a wonderful job, opening every session with prayer, \nleading Bible study, helping us to understand Scripture and ourselves.\n  For the good of this institution he has worked with us to realize, in \nthe words of John Witherspoon, ``the dominion of Providence over the \npassions of men.'' Obviously that is pretty important here in the \nSenate, where we are frequently at loggerheads. Reverend Ogilvie, by \nlifting our sights to the world of the spirit, has been a soothing \npresence.\n  We did not want to lose him; but we know it was necessary to be with \nhis wife Mary Jane in California. We understand; and, since he is going \nto continue his prolific speaking, teaching, and writing, we also know \nwe won't lose touch with him.\n  The entire Senate family is better for the service of this \ninfluential servant of God. Lloyd and Mary Jane, Godspeed.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise tonight to express by great \nadmiration and appreciation for Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, a man who has served \nthe Senate, and our country, with great dignity and honor.\n  Bob and I have treasured our friendship with Lloyd and Mary Jane \nthrough many years. I feel blessed to know such a warm, compassionate \nand caring couple. They share a beautiful partnership and just last \nyear celebrated 50 years of marriage and three wonderful children, \nScott, Heather and Andrew.\n  Mary Jane has long been admired for setting such a strong example of \nwhat it means to give of yourself. After battling breast cancer 20 \nyears ago, she has done so much to help other women going through the \npain--physical, emotional and spiritual--of cancer and cancer \ntreatment. My thoughts and prayers are continually with Mary Jane and \nher family now, at this very difficult time in her life and theirs.\n  Lloyd Ogilvie is an extraordinary man of God. He has served amongst \nus with such a gentle and humble spirit, that sometimes it has been \neasy to forget what a world-renown spiritual guide and Biblical scholar \nwe have had in our midst. As a profound preacher, as well as an author \nand editor of over 40 books, Lloyd Ogilvie is admired the world over \nfor his depth of insight into eternal truths and for his ability to \ncommunicate those truths in a God-horning and loving spirit. It has \nbeen our special blessing to have had this wise, dear man of God as our \npersonal friend and advisor, standing with us here in the Senate \nChamber or meeting with us just down the hall.\n  The first in his family to attend college, Lloyd Ogilvie's plan was \nto study drama, hoping to go to Hollywood. He answered a call to preach \ninstead, but still ended up in Hollywood--pastoring the First \nPresbyterian Church.\n  After 23 years at First Presbyterian, Dr. Ogilvie answered another \ncall--and became the 61st Chaplain of the Senate. Recommended by a \nbipartisan committee, he was nominated by then-Majority Leader Bob Dole \nand he began his duties March 13, 1995. He bridged Dole to Dole--and \nduring his time in the Senate he has also bridged many differences, \ncounseling and caring for both sides of the aisle.\n  With that deep, booming voice of his, which we have come to so easily \nrecognize and love, Lloyd has opened our days in prayer. Day after day, \nhe has steadied our hearths and pointed our thoughts Heavenward. And I \nbelieve, as a result, he has helped us to render service to our Nation \nand to our God with a deeper sense of perspective and stewardship.\n  From this first days as Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie reached out in so many \nways--one of which impacted my life--a weekly Bible study for Senate \nspouses. And one of the things I will miss most is the Senators' Bible \nStudy he has led every Thursday at noon during my first 10 weeks in the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n  Lloyd has seen all of us here in the Senate family as his parish. He \nwill be deeply missed by the hundreds of Senate staffers, cafeteria \nworkers, police officers, and service department personnel whom he has \ninspired to deeper faith and commitment.\n  Lloyd's love of Christ, and his love of others in Christ's name, have \nbeen evident through his life, and his ministry amongst us, each and \nevery day. There is a remarkable, caring spirit about Lloyd Ogilvie, a \nspecial attentiveness in his demeanor. Lloyd has a wonderful capacity \nfor kindness and compassion. He has been a valued teacher and counselor \nto so many. He has been there at our side, when we or our family \nmembers have faced turmoil. And he has ministered among us when our \nNation has faced special challenges.\n  Each one of us is constantly in need of God's grace and guidance not \nonly to make the big decisions, but also to perform life's routine \nduties with the love for others, the peace, the joy inherent in God's \ncall. Lloyd Ogilvie has helped bring that grace and guidance to the \nSenate. His gift, and his passion, is helping others not only to \nunderstand God's will, but to resolve to live within God's will each \nand every day.\n  Although Lloyd Ogilvie is leaving the Senate, I am comforted in \nknowing that he will still be praying for the people of the Senate. \nThrough his continued friendship, and his writings, he\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nwill be a treasured resource for spiritual guidance.\n  As former chaplains of distinction Peter Marshall and Richard \nHalverson continue to impact this historic Chamber, so, too, will Lloyd \nJohn Ogilvie.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4272-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4272-S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n14, 2001 in Tulsa, OK. A food store employee of Middle-Eastern descent \nwas attacked while leaving his apartment. Three people jumped on him, \nknocked him down, covered his eyes, and beat him. After addressing him \nwith an expletive, the men threatened, ``We are going to cut you like \nyou cut our people.'' Before his eyes were covered, he saw that one of \nthe attackers had a knife-like object. The victim was hospitalized and \ntreated for multiple lacerations.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, March 23 marks the 20th anniversary of \nPresident Reagan's historic address to the Nation in which he launched \nthe program known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI, designed to \nhelp protect America and our allies from ballistic missile attack.\n  I would like to commemorate this occasion by placing a copy of \nPresident Reagan's remarks into the Record at this time.\n  With each passing year, we see more clearly the wisdom of President \nReagan's vision. The spread of technology relating to ballistic \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction has grown enormously in 20 \nyears. Since September 11, 2001--and now as we are engaged in military \noperations to disarm IRAQ--more people have become aware of the growing \nthreats we face from missile attack.\n  When President Reagan spoke in 1983, he said it might take \n``decades'' before reliable missile defense was a reality. And he was \nright. As he well knew, it was not only the technical and engineering \nhurdles that stood in the way, but also the formidable political \nobstacles.\n  During the Clinton years, the outdated ABM Treaty was enshrined as \nthe ``cornerstone of strategic stability,'' SDI was essentially \nscrapped, and, in 1996, the Congress's determination to build a missile \ndefense system by 2003 was vetoed.\n  But George W. Bush dramatically changed the political climate and has \ntaken a different course--a course in keeping with President Reagan's \ncommitment. In 2001, he wisely announced U.S. withdrawal from the ABM \nTreaty, and in 2002, he announced that we would move to deploy the \nfirst elements, sea-based and land based for a real missile defense \nsystem capable of protecting U.S. cities from long-range missile \nattacks.\n  I applaud President Bush for his steadfast commitment to America's \nnational security and to fulfilling President Reagan's vision. The bold \nactions he is taking are moving us forward to the actual deployment of \na missile defense capability that will serve our country for many years \nto come.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have President Reagan's speech printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAddress to the Nation on National Security By President Ronald Reagan--\n                             March 23, 1983\n\n       The calls for cutting back the defense budget come in nice, \n     simple arithmetic. They're the same kind of talk that led the \n     democracies to neglect their defenses in the 1930's and \n     invited the tragedy of World War II. We must not let that \n     grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or \n     neglect.\n       This is why I'm speaking to you tonight--to urge you to \n     tell your Senators and Congressmen that you know we must \n     continue to restore our military strength. If we stop in \n     midstream, we will send a signal of decline, of lessened \n     will, to friends and adversaries alike. Free people must \n     voluntarily, through open debate and democratic means, meet \n     the challenge that totalitarians pose by compulsion. It's up \n     to us, in our time, to choose and choose wisely between the \n     hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom and \n     the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the \n     best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.\n       The solution is well within our grasp. But to reach it, \n     there is simply no alternative but to continue this year, in \n     this budget, to provide the resources we need to preserve the \n     peace and guarantee our freedom.\n       Now, thus far tonight I've shared with you my thoughts on \n     the problems of national security we must face together. My \n     predecessors in the Oval Office have appeared before you on \n     other occasions to describe the threat posed by Soviet power \n     and have proposed steps to address that threat. But since the \n     advent of nuclear weapons, those steps have been increasingly \n     directed toward deterrence of aggression through the promise \n     of retaliation.\n       This approach to stability through offensive threat has \n     worked. We and our allies have succeeded in preventing \n     nuclear war for more than three decades. In recent months, \n     however, my advisers, including in particular the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, have underscored the necessity to break out \n     of a future that relies solely on offensive retaliation for \n     our security.\n       Over the course of these discussions, I've become more and \n     more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable \n     of rising above dealing with other nations and human beings \n     by threatening their existence. Feeling this way, I believe \n     we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reducing \n     tensions and for introducing greater stability into the \n     strategic calculus on both sides.\n       One of the most important contributions we can make is, of \n     course, to lower the level of all arms, and particularly \n     nuclear arms. We're engaged right now in several negotiations \n     with the Soviet Union to bring about a mutual reduction of \n     weapons. I will report to you a week from tomorrow my \n     thoughts on that score. But let me just say, I'm totally \n     committed to this course.\n       If the Soviet Union will join with us in our effort to \n     achieve major arms reduction, we will have succeeded in \n     stabilizing the nuclear balance. Nevertheless, it will still \n     be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation, on mutual \n     threat. And that's a sad commentary on the human condition. \n     Wouldn't it be better to save lives than to avenge them? Are \n     we not capable of demonstrating our peaceful intentions by \n     applying all our abilities and our ingenuity to achieving a \n     truly lasting stability? I think we are. Indeed, we must.\n       After careful consultation with my advisers, including the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, I believe there is a way. Let me share \n     with you a vision of the future which offers hope. It is that \n     we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile \n     threat with measures that are defensive. Let us turn to the \n     very strengths in technology that spawned our great \n     industrial base and that have given us the quality of life we \n     enjoy today.\n       What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that \n     their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. \n     retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept \n     and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached \n     our own soil or that of our allies?\n       I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may \n     not be accomplished before the end of this century. Yet, \n     current technology has attained a level of sophistication \n     where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort. It will \n     take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. \n     There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be \n     successes and breakthroughs. And as we proceed, we must \n     remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and \n     maintaining a solid capability for flexible response. But \n     isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the \n     world from the threat of nuclear war? We know it is.\n       In the meantime, we will continue to pursue real reductions \n     in nuclear arms, negotiating from a position of strength that \n     can be ensured only by modernizing our strategic forces. At \n     the same time, we must take steps to reduce the risk of a \n     conventional military conflict escalating to nuclear war by \n     improving our nonnuclear capabilities.\n       America does possess--now--the technologies to attain very \n     significant improvements in the effectiveness of our \n     conventional, nonnuclear forces. Proceeding boldly with these \n     new technologies, we can significantly reduce any incentive \n     that the Soviet Union may have to threaten attack against the \n     United States or its allies.\n       As we pursue our goal of defensive technologies, we \n     recognize that our allies rely upon our strategic offensive \n     power to deter attacks against them. Their vital interests \n     and ours are inextricably linked. Their safety and ours are \n     one. And on change in technology can or will alter that \n     reality. We must and shall continue to honor our commitments.\n       I clearly recognize that defensive systems have limitations \n     and raise certain problems\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n     and ambiguities. If paired with offensive systems, they can \n     be viewed as fostering an aggressive policy, and no one wants \n     that. But with these considerations firmly in mind, I call \n     upon the scientific community in our country, those who \n     gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now \n     to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the \n     means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and \n     obsolete.\n       Tonight, consistent with our obligations of the ABM treaty \n     and recognizing the need for closer consultation with our \n     allies, I'm taking an important first step. I am directing a \n     comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long-term \n     research and development program to begin to achieve our \n     ultimate goal of eliminating the threat posed by strategic \n     nuclear missiles. This could pave the way for arms control \n     measures to eliminate the weapons themselves. We seek neither \n     military superiority nor political advantage. Our only \n     purpose--one all people share--is to search for ways to \n     reduce the danger of nuclear war.\n       My fellow Americans, tonight we're launching an effort \n     which holds the promise of changing the course of human \n     history. There will be risks, and results take time. But I \n     believe we can do it. As we cross this threshold, I ask for \n     your prayers and your support.\n       Thank you, good night, and God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4273-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHINA AIRLINES PURCHASE FROM BOEING\n\n  Ms. CANTRELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate \nthe purchase of 10 Boeing 747-400's acquired by China Airlines.\n  The relationship between Boeing and Taiwan's China Airlines has been \nextensive. Over the last 7 years, China Airlines has purchased a total \nof 97 American-made aircraft from Boeing. The acquisition of these 10 \nplanes, which value $2 billion, brings the total amount of the \nairline's Boeing-purchased aircraft to $13 billion.\n  Sales between Boeing and China Airlines have contributed to increased \ntrade between the United States and Taiwan over the last decade. In \nthese past years, bilateral trade has grown each year by an average of \n4.1 percent. Because of this thriving market, the United States has \nbecome Taiwan's largest export market. In 2000, the United States \naccounted for 20 percent of Taiwan's trade worldwide.\n  In addition, the aircraft have allowed increased domestic flights \nbetween Taiwan and the United States. Every week there are over 270 \nflights--179 passenger and 89 cargo--between our two countries.\n  I am very pleased to see that Taiwan has become one of our more \nbeneficial trading partners in the world today, and I hope that this \nmarket continues to thrive for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4273-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             A MICHIGAN MOM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues Ms. \nShikha Hamilton, a board member of the Million Mom March from my home \nState of Michigan. Ms. Hamilton visited my office last month with her \nfellow board members to report on their successes and to urge us to \npass sensible gun safety legislation to stem the tide of gun violence \nthat plagues many of our communities.\n  Ms. Hamilton currently serves as the president of the MMM Chapter in \nDetroit. A rash of gun violence in Detroit over the last year has \nclaimed the lives of 26 children; these incidents highlight the \nchallenge gun violence poses for communities in protecting families. \nMs. Hamilton is one person who has stepped up and met that challenge. \nShe has helped form a coalition with other Detroit violence prevention \ngroups, organized a huge march on Belle Isle, and helped create public \nservice announcements to air on local radio stations. Ms. Hamilton is a \nleader in her community and I commend her for her work.\n  As Detroit chapter president, Ms. Hamilton testified in support of a \nlocal ordinance prohibiting weapons in public buildings. It unanimously \npassed the Detroit City Council on November 13, 2002. Her chapter also \npersuaded the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News to close the \n``newspaper loophole.'' The newspapers agreed to stop the placement of \ngun sales in the classified ads, one way criminals had been gaining \naccess to guns without background checks. In addition to all of this, \nMs. Hamilton is a full-time attorney, wife and the mother of a 4-year-\nold daughter.\n  In the meeting with my staff, Ms. Hamilton and her MMM colleagues \nmentioned several pieces of gun safety legislation that are critical if \nwe are to reduce gun violence. Among the most important is legislation \nclosing the gun show loophole. In 1994, Congress passed the Brady Law, \nwhich requires federal firearm licensees to perform criminal background \nchecks on gun buyers. However, a loophole in this law allows unlicensed \nprivate gun sellers to sell firearms at gun shows without conducting a \nbackground check.\n  The Gun Show Background Check Act would close this loophole in the \nlaw by extending the Brady law background check requirement to all \nsellers of firearms including those at gun shows. I cosponsored this \nbill because I believe it is critical that we do all we can to prevent \nguns from getting into the hands of criminals and terrorists. Study \nafter study has demonstrated that the Brady law has been successful in \nmaking it more difficult for criminals to gain access to firearms, and \nby closing the gun show loophole, Congress would again demonstrate its \ncommitment to public safety. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. Hamilton is doing her best to reduce gun violence in her \ncommunity. We should do our best to pass sensible laws to make her job \neasier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/21/senate-section/article/S4273-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING U.S. ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

He earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from \nEmory University in 1970 and his M.D. degree from Duke University \nSchool of Medicine in 1975.\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\n  On July 1, 2002, Dr. Gavin began work as President of Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine in Atlanta, GA. Prior to his presidency, Dr. Gavin \nwas the senior scientific officer at the Howard Hughes Medical \nInstitute (HHMI) and director of the HHMI--National Institutes of \nHealth and Research Scholars Program.\n  Prior to joining the senior staff of HHMI, he was on faculty at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center as a professor and as \nchief of the Diabetes Section, acting chief of the Section on \nEndocrinology, Metabolism and Hypertension, and William K. Warren \nProfessor for Diabetes Studies. He previously served as associate \nprofessor of Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in \nSt. Louis. He was a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Public Health \nServices from 1971-73 and continues to serve in that capacity as a \nreserve officer.\n  Among the many honors Dr. Gavin has received are the Daniel Hale \nWilliams Award, the E.E.

They are a deep, veteran team with plenty of skills and \nNCAA experience. The Hilltoppers also had a great scoring balance, with \nfive players averaging at least 9.8 points a game.\n  The Hilltoppers earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament with a \n64-52 victory over Middle Tennessee in the Sun Belt Conference \ntournament championship. This makes Coach Felton the first coach in \nWKU's history to lead the Hilltoppers to three consecutive Sun Belt and \nNCAA tournament appearances. Unfortunately, the Hilltoppers were unable \nto carry on their winning momentum against the University of Illinois, \nlosing to the Fighting Illini in a valiant effort the first round of \nthe NCAA tournament.\n  Overall, the Western Kentucky University Hilltoppers had a very \nsuccessful and productive season.

A bill to provide for the enhanced protection of electricity \nconsumers under the Federal Power Act; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nElectricity Market Manipulation Prevention Act--legislation I believe \nis critical in ensuring our Nation's consumers will never again have to \nsuffer from the type of energy price manipulation that has so \ndevastated the economy of my home State of Washington. This bill is \nsimple yet powerful in concept. In essence, it requires the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission to do its job--protect consumers from \nenergy price manipulation.\n  This bill says that where FERC gives companies the authority to \ncharge market-based wholesale electricity rates, the Commission must \nalso actively ensure that effective competition--the only kind of \ncompetition that benefits consumers and businesses--actually exists. It \nsays that if FERC finds that an entity has attempted to manipulate \npower markets, the Commission will revoke or modify the company's \nability to sell power at market-based rates, and the company will be on \nthe hook to pay back revenues in excess of the average regional cost of \ngenerating the power. And lastly, it says that FERC will not be allowed \nto change the legal standard for\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nreviewing whether consumers deserve relief from market manipulation.\n  I first want to make a very important point about this legislation. \nIn large part, it does not expand FERC's existing authority under the \nFederal Power Act. It simply articulates more explicitly how Congress \nintends for FERC to exercise its existing authority.\n  Now why is this an important point? As many of my colleagues may \nknow, FERC--under sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act--is \nalready given the responsibility of ensuring just and reasonable \nwholesale electricity rates, and fixing those rates when market \nactivity has gone awry. So why do we need clarification? Because \ndespite overwhelming and undisputed evidence that any number of energy \ncompanies--Enron and its ilk--engaged in activities designed to \nmanipulate power markets in the west, FERC has to date failed to take \naction on behalf of consumers.\n  While prices started skyrocketing out of control during the summer of \n2000, it took the Commission nearly a year to step in and reign in \nthose prices throughout the west. The provisions of this legislation \nthat require FERC to perform annual reviews of how well markets are \nfunctioning would help ensure the Commission's active oversight, and \nprevent the type of price gouging from which consumers and businesses \nin my sate continue to suffer.\n  While the Commission did finally step in to cap prices--under intense \ncongressional pressure, I might add--it has, almost 2 years later, \nfailed to decisively act on the billions of dollars' worth of refund \nand long-term contract complaints resulting from the crisis. What's \nmore, the Commission's Administrative Law Judges have taken every \nopportunity to throw additional hurdles in the path of the Northwest \nconsumers, who have suffered more than any as a result of California's \nill-fated restructuring scheme. That's why this legislation \nspecifically articulates what legal standard should apply to the \nCommission's review of complaints for relief.\n  Even in the face of admitted market manipulation--in the most brazen \nof cases, where Enron has described its own schemes to drive up prices \nand Reliant's transcripts quote company traders explicitly voicing \ntheir plans to drive up prices throughout the west by withholding \npower--FERC has, more than two years later, failed to use all the tools \nat its disposal to send a message that such activities will not be \ntolerated, levying fines that are clearly inadequate compared to the \neconomic devastation these activities have caused.\n  This bill makes the remedies for market manipulation far more \ntransparent, doing away with the multiple years of arcane proceedings \nin which we are currently embroiled. The protracted cases resulting \nfrom the western energy crisis have yet to benefit anyone--certainly \nneither the industry nor consumers--except, perhaps, for energy \nattorneys.\n  This legislation tells energy companies that if they are going to \nattempt to manipulate markets, there will be harsh and immediate \nconsequences. It says that if the commission finds that an entity has \nattempted to gouge consumers, it will revoke or revise its market-based \nrate authority, set a just and reasonable rate going forward, and order \nthe refund of revenues collected above the average wholesale generation \ncost within the relevant regional power market. Concrete, explicit \nconsequences--commensurate with the level of damage caused by \nmarketplace shenanigans--should provide a powerful disincentive for \ncompanies tempted to engage in the types of behavior that have crippled \nthe economy of Washington and other western states.\n  Now, I can already hear the outcry from some--but not all sectors--of \nthe energy industry. They will claim that putting concrete remedies on \nthe books--transparent mechanisms for consumer relief, and tangible \npenalties for companies that endeavor to gouge consumers--will breed \ntoo much uncertainty for participants in energy markets.\n  To those who would make that argument, I would simply say, it is \nabsolutely absurd to suggest that energy companies can't make money \nunless they retain their legal rights to rip off the ratepayers of this \ncountry. Ensuring that FERC--which is supposed to be, in Chairman Pat \nWood's own words, ``the tough cop on the beat''--takes swift and \ndecisive action when energy companies attempt to manipulate markets is \nan issue of simple fairness and common sense. Afterall, it is our \nNation's ratepayers--residential and industrial customers alike--who \npay the price for FERC's inaction, and FERC is the only cop on the \nbeat.\n  I have stood on this floor many times to speak of the economic train \nwreck created in my state by FERC's inaction in the face of the western \nenergy crisis, which we now know resulted in large part from bad actors \nwho decided to take advantage of a near-historic drought and tragically \nflawed market rules in California. Today, retail rates in many parts of \nmy State of Washington have risen almost 50 percent, our unemployment \nis consistently among the top five in the nation, the demand for low-\nincome energy assistance is at record levels, we are struggling to \nstave off yet another regional rate increase, and there is no end in \nsight--unless FERC takes long-overdue action.\n  This bill sends a clear signal to FERC: we expect you to right the \nwrongs from which consumers throughout the west continue to suffer, and \nwe expect you to use your authority to ensure a repeat of the western \nenergy crisis never occurs. There is no other competitively traded \ncommodity aside from electricity--soy beans, wheat, pork bellies, \nmetals--for which a prolonged price run-up can single-handedly cripple \nindustries as diverse as aluminum smelting, microchip manufacturing, \nirrigated agriculture, paper production or aerospace. Clearly, the \neconomic stakes are exceptionally high when it comes to electricity, \nand as such, Congress must demand a greater degree of accountability \nfrom both the industry itself and those who regulate it.\n  With this bill, we make Congress' intent perfectly clear: FERC must \nprotect consumers; there will be swift and decisive action against \nthose who endeavor to manipulate markets; and the deck will not be \nstacked against the consumers and businesses who are the victim of \nEnron-like schemes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 682. A bill to authorize funding for Genomes to Life Research and \nDevelopment at the Department of Energy for fiscal years 2004 through \n2008; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Genomes to Life \nResearch and Development Act. I appreciate the bipartisan sponsors, \nSenator Cantwell, Senator Murray and Senator Bingaman who join me in \nits introduction.\n  In the last 2 years, there have been many events celebrating the \ncompletion of maps of the human genome. The genome map has been lauded \nfrom many quarters, with some referring to it as the ``recipe for \nlife,'' our ``genetic fingerprint,'' or the ``holy grail of biology.'' \nThere can be no question that the work of the DOE, the NIH, and private \nindustry to complete this map has ushered in a new frontier in \nbiological research.\n  I had the tremendous pleasure and honor of being the first legislator \nto recognize the importance of human genomics. It was at a March 1986 \nconference in Sante Fe, NM, led by Charles DeLisi and David Smith, that \nthe first proposal for the DOE Human Genome Initiative was developed. \nAnd it was in 1987 that I introduced the legislation that laid the \nfoundation for the Human Genome project. Senator Chiles worked with me \nin this effort, and both the Labor and Energy Committees had important \nroles in advancing the project.\n  The first year of appropriated funding was fiscal year 1988, with $11 \nmillion for the DOE and $17 million for the NIH. Since then, in \ncompleting the map, over $3 billion has been invested. I firmly believe \nthat history will view that investment as one that truly changed \nmedical and health sciences for all mankind.\n  I have found it amusing to review some of the arguments against the \ngenome project in those early days. It was labeled as a ``mindless \nfactory project,'' or ``a scheme for unemployed\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\nbombmakers.'' One well known researcher said, ``The Idea is gathering \nmomentum. I shiver at the thought.''\n  Now there's only praise for the future of this endeavor. I \nparticularly value an autographed copy of the original genome map that \nwas presented to me in February of 2001 by Craig Venter, president of \nCelera Genomics, with the inscription ``Your vision went beyond the \nparochial objections of the few and the doubts of the many, we all owe \nyou our thanks.''\n  But even as we can see today that the benefits to mankind from the \ngenome project will be immense, we also are nowhere near the point of \nfully utilizing the treasure trove of information in these maps. Today, \nwe do not understand how details of genome sequence influence medical \nconditions. In short, we have a map, but aren't quite sure exactly how \nthat map corresponds to reality.\n  With this bill, we authorize a new DOE program, Genomes to Life. \nAlong with companion measures in the NIH, this DOE program will seek to \ninterpret this wonderful new map and really begin to use it. Through \nthese programs, we will begin to understand how our own DNA sequence, \nas expressed in our own genome map, translates into a collection of \ninteracting proteins that function as our own personal molecular \nmachine.\n\n  The intellectual challenges in this new initiative are immense. They \nrequire public support for the basic and applied research and \ndevelopment. There must be significant advances in areas like \ncharacterization of multi-protein complexes and gene regulatory \nnetworks that will be required before biologically based solutions and \ntechnologies will be available for applications to DOE missions.\n  New instruments will be essential in the Genomes to Life research. \nThese may be instruments that haven't been invented yet. Specialized \nfacilities will be required to advance the field and realize its \npromise. This bill envisions these facilities being built as user \nfacilities, using the model that the Department already successfully \nuses for many facilities in diverse areas of science.\n  With the Genomes to Life program, and its companion programs at the \nNIH, we'll finally be in a position to understand how genomic \ninformation can be used to benefit mankind. From the NIH side, we will \nbe far better equipped to understand many diseases. We may have drugs \ndesigned for specific genetic profiles, drugs may be screened for \nadverse interactions, and side effects of drugs may be predicted and \navoided.\n  From the DOE side of the program, we may have biological approaches \nto hydrogen production or carbon sequestration. We may have new \nalternatives for detection and mitigation of biological threats. We may \nhave new biological tools to handle complex cleanup issued at DOE \nsites.\n  This Bill lays the foundation for this new Genomes to Life program, \nand I encourage its support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``The Genomes to Life Research and \n     Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Energy's Genomes to Life initiative \n     involves the emerging fields of systems biology and \n     proteomics, which address the ability to understand the \n     composition and function of the biochemical networks and \n     pathways that carry out the essential processes of living \n     organisms.\n       (2) The Genomes to Life initiative builds on the Department \n     of Energy's integral role in the Human Genome Project, which \n     has led to the mapping, sequencing and identification of \n     genetic material. Genomes to Life will go beyond mapping to \n     develop an understanding of how genetic components interact \n     to perform cellular activities vital to life.\n       (3) The ability of the United States to respond to the \n     national security, energy and environmental challenges of the \n     21st century will be driven by science and technology. An \n     integrated and predictive understanding of biological systems \n     will enable the United States to develop new technologies \n     related to the detection of biological and chemical agents, \n     energy production, carbon sequestration, bioremediation and \n     other Department of Energy statutory missions. These advances \n     will also enhance the strength of U.S. science, technology, \n     and medicine generally.\n       (4) The fundamental intellectual challenges inherent in the \n     Genomes to Life initiative are considerable, and require \n     public support for basic and applied research and \n     development. Significant advances in areas such as the \n     characterization of multiprotein complexes and gene \n     regulatory networks will be required before biologically-\n     based solutions and technologies will be useful in national \n     security applications, as well as to the energy, medical and \n     agricultural industries.\n       (5) The development of new scientific instruments will also \n     be required to advance Genomes to Life research. Such \n     instruments are likely to be large and costly. Specialized \n     facilities are also likely to be required in order to advance \n     the field and to realize its promise. Such facilities will be \n     sufficiently expensive that they will have to be located and \n     constructed on a centralized basis, similar to a number of \n     unique facilities already managed by the Department of \n     Energy.\n       (6) Contributions from individual researchers as well as \n     multidisciplinary research teams will be required to advance \n     systems biology and proteomics.\n       (7) The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well \n     suited to manage systems biology and proteomics research for \n     the Department. Through its support of research and \n     development pursuant to the Department's statutory \n     authorities, the Office of Science is the principal federal \n     supporter of the research and development in the physical and \n     computational sciences. The Office is also a significant \n     source of federal support for research in genomics and the \n     life sciences. The Office supports research and development \n     by individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, and \n     manages special user facilities that serve investigators in \n     both university and industry.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce--along with my \ncolleagues Chairman Domenici, and Senators Bingaman and Murray--the \nGenomes to Life Research and Development Act.\n  This bill capitalizes on the enormous success of the Human Genome \nProject, and promises to take this important research to the next \nlevel. While the mapping of the human genome is an unparalleled \naccomplishment on its own, this new initiative will allow researchers \nto go beyond the science of description, and begin to explore the \ncomplex interactions of the elements within cells.\n  It is those intracellular dynamics that truly hold the key to finding \nsolutions to some of our most difficult scientific problems--from \ndetection of biological and chemical agents and nuclear waste clean-up \nto figuring out new and more efficient ways to produce hydrogen, so \ncrucial in attaining energy independence for this Nation. Where the \nHuman Genome Project has provided researchers with the range and \ndescription of musical notes, Genomes to Life will enable scientists to \nbegin to understand the way these notes are arranged to produce music--\nthe essential process of life.\n  The Genomes to Life Act sets out an aggressive path for DOE, to make \nthis area a high priority for the Office of Science. Of course, none of \nthis would be possible without the successes of the Human Genome \nProject, and I want to acknowledge the vision of this legislation's \nother sponsor, Chairman Domenici, in making that a reality. As some of \nmy colleagues may be aware, the senior Senator from New Mexico laid the \nfoundation for the Human Genome Project with legislation he first \nintroduced in 1987.\n  I am thus extremely pleased to be working with him on this bill, \nwhich I believe is the Human Genome Project's logical successor. Our \nlegislation would authorize the Department of Energy to design and \nestablish national research centers to investigate proteomics and \ngenomics. Proteomics refers to the study of proteins, how they are \nmodified, when and where they are expressed, how they are involved in \nmetabolic pathways, and how they interact with each other. Genomics \nrefers to the study of three-dimensional structures of thousands of \nproteins--all of the proteins produced by a species.\n  These are exciting research fields that combine the discipline of \nphysics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and advanced computational \nand mathematical modeling. The Department of Energy's Office of Science \nhas a long history of success in large scale, cross-discipline \nscientific research and is thus well suited to manage this program. In \naddition, a significant component of the Human Genome Project has been \nthe transfer of technology to the private sector, which has in turn \ncatalyzed the multi-billion dollar U.S. biotechnology industry and \nfostered the development of new medical applications.\n  The Genomes to Life Act that Chairman Domenici, Senators Bingaman, \nMurray and I are introducing today provides a coordinated and \ncomprehensive plan for the next generation of biotechnology research \nfacilities. The functions and dynamics of all living cells are \ndetermined by the complex interactions of the constituent proteins. We \ndo not yet understand these interactions, but the Genomes to Life Act \nwill give us the best tools to investigate these microscopic mysteries. \nPut in simple terms, teams of American scientists will try to answer \nthe fundamental question, ``How do cells work?'' This bill will ensure \nthat state of the art facilities, leading edge equipment, and the next \ngeneration of commuters are available to map and model these complex \ninteractions, as we strive to answer this critical question.\n  The promise of biotechnology research is especially important to my \nstate of Washington--home to many world-class research facilities. \nWashington has over 190 biotechnology companies employing more than \n11,000 people. In 2001, the annual revenue of these companies exceeded \n$1.2 billion. Nearly one half of these companies were based on \ntechnologies developed at research and development institutions and \nover 40 percent of the companies have been established in the past six \nyears.\n  This legislation's provisions--ensuring that research with its \norigins at the Department of Energy provides the science and technology \nbasis for new industries in biotechnology, and that DOE continues to \nidentify appropriate commercial applications--will help this important \neconomic sector continue to grow in Washington state and across the \ncountry.\n  The Genomes to Life Research and Development Act that Sens. Domenici, \nBingaman, Murray and I have introduced today will strengthen our \nnational security and our national economy. Additionally, the \nintegrative and predicative understanding of biological systems will \nimprove our ability to respond to the energy and environmental \nchallenges of the 21st century. The Genomes to Life laboratories will \nattract top researchers and push the envelope of present technologies. \nThe Genomes to Life Act will help the U.S. to maintain our premiere \nposition in the world in the fields of science and technology.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues during this session to \nensure passage of this legislation. I believe that the United States \nmust continue to invest in scientific research to maintain our standing \nin the world and I am confident that this short-term investment will \npay long-term dividends to our health, our security, and to our \neconomy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 683. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nprovide entitlement to leave to eligible employees whose spouse, son, \ndaughter, or parent is a member of the Armed Forces serving on active \nduty in support of a contingency operation or notified of an impending \ncall or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nbring a small measure of relief to the families of our brave military \npersonnel who are being deployed for the ongoing fight against \nterrorism, the war in Iraq, and other missions around the country and \naround the world.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces undertake enormous sacrifices \nin their service to our country. They spend time away from home and \nfrom their families in different parts of the country and different \nparts of the world, and, too often, are placed into\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\nharm's way in order to protect the American people and our way of life. \nWe owe them a huge debt of gratitude for their dedicated service.\n  The ongoing deployments for the fight against terrorism and for the \ncampaign in Iraq are turning upside down the lives of thousands of \nactive duty, National Guard, and Reserve personnel and their families \nas they seek to do their duty to their country and honor their \ncommitments to their families, and, in the case of the reserve \ncomponents, to their employers as well. As of March 29, more than \n212,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel were on active duty, and \nthousands more can expect to be activated in the coming days and weeks.\n  Some of my constituents are facing the latest in a series of multiple \nactivations and deployments for family members who serve our country in \nthe military. Others are seeing their loved ones off on their first \ndeployment. All of these families share in the worry and concern about \nwhat awaits their relatives and hope, as we do, for their swift and \nsafe return.\n  Our men and women in uniform face these challenges without complaint. \nBut we should do more to help them and their families with the many \nthings that preparing to be deployed.\n  Often, military personnel and their families are given only a couple \nof days' notice that their units will be deployed. These dedicated men \nand women then have only a very limited amount of time to get their \nlives in order. For members of the National Guard and Reserve, this \nincludes telling their employers that they will be deployed for, in \nmany cases, up to a year, and will be away from their jobs. I want to \ncommend the many employers around the country for their understanding \nand support when an employee or a family member of an employee is \ncalled to active duty.\n  In preparation for a deployment, military families often have to \nscramble to arrange for child care, to pay bills, to contact their \nlandlords or mortgage companies, and take care of other things that we \ndeal with on a daily basis, from stopping the newspaper to making sure \nthat their plants are watered and that their pets are cared for while \nthey are gone.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would allow eligible employees \nwhose spouses, parents, sons, or daughters are military personnel who \nare serving on or called to active duty in support of a contingency \noperation to use their Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, benefits for \nissues relating to our resulting from their deployment. These instances \ncould include preparation for deployment or additional responsibilities \nthat family members take on as a result of a loved one's deployment, \nsuch as child care.\n  I was proud to cosponsor and vote for the lgislaiton that created the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act FMLA, in the early days of my service to \nthe people of Wisconsin as a member of this body. This important law \nallows eligible workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year \nfor the birth or adoption of child, the placement of a foster child, to \ncare for a newborn or newly adopted child or newly placed foster child, \nor to care for their own serious health condition or that of a spouse, \na parent, or a child. Some employers offer a portion of this time as \npaid leave in addition to other accured leave, while others require \nworkers to use accrued leave or sick time for this purpose.\n  Since its enactment in 1993, the FMLA has helped more than 35 million \nAmerican workers to balance responsibilities to their families and \ntheir careers. According to the Congressional Research Service, between \n2.2 million and 6.1 million people took advantage of these benefits in \n1999-2000.\n  Our military families sacrifice a great deal. Active duty families \noften move every couple of years due to transfer and new assignments. \nAnd as we rely more heavily on National Guard and Reserve personnel for \nmore and more deployments that are longer in duration, the burden on \ntheir families also increases.\n  This legislation has the support of a number of military \norganizations, including the Wisconsin National Guard, the National \nGuard Association of the United States, the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the Military Officers Association of America, and the \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do all we \ncan to support them in this difficult time. I hope what this bill will \nbring a small measure of relief to our military families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 683\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Military Families Leave \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to create an office within the Department of Justice \nto undertake certain specific steps to ensure that all American \ncitizens harmed by terrorists overseas receive equal treatment by the \nUnited States Government regardless of the terrorists' country of \norigin or residence, and to ensure that all terrorists involved in such \nattacks are pursued, prosecuted, and punished with equal vigor, \nregardless of the terrorists' country of origin or residence; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to right a wrong. I am doing \nso on behalf of myself and Mr. Wyden, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bond, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Miller, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Specter. \nFor far too many years, Americans who have been murdered overseas by \nterrorists have not been receiving the full weight of equal justice \nunder the law, a fundamental principle of our governance. This is \nhappening while we are in the midst of trying to introduce the \ninstitutions of democracy, including the notion of a fair judicial \nsystem, to a skeptical part of the world. This is happening while we \nare in the midst of a War on Terrorism.\n  This double standard of justice sends out a pernicious, mixed message \nto would-be terrorists around the world. It suggests that we are weak \nin our resolve to prosecute certain terrorists who have murdered \ncertain American citizens. It wrongly sends the message that certain \nAmerican lives are more valuable and more worthy of justice than \nothers. Or as the mother of Mathew Eisenfeld, a young Yale University \ngraduate who was killed in 1996, together with his young fiance, Sara \nDucker, a Barnard College graduate, put it, ``it makes me feel that my \nson's blood is less American than others.''\n  When our embassies were attacked in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, \n1998, then Secretary of State Albright and President Clinton said, \n``You can run but you can't hide from the long arm of American justice. \nAnywhere an American is murdered around the globe, we will seek out \nthat suspect and retrieve him to these shores to stand justice.''\n  However, since the signing of the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993, \nthirty-nine American citizens have lost their lives at the hands of \nPalestinian terrorists alone. And how many indictments have there been \nin response to these thirty-nine murders? Zero. Notably, one can't find \nthe term Palestinian on the State Department's web site for the \n``Rewards of Justice'' program--the place where suspects are listed and \nrewards are described for their capture. That website rather contains \nonly vague references to ``persons in opposition to the Middle East \nPeace Process.''\n  This is simply wrong. On the humanitarian level, it is wrong. When \nour own government fails to mete out justice with equal and due \ndiligence for a particular victim, or a group of victims, this \ncompounds the grief experienced by American families who have lost \nloved ones to terrorists: families such as that of 14 year old Abigail \nLitle, an American girl from New Hampshire, a young Christian who was \namong the fifteen people murdered in the recent terrorist attack on a \nbus in Haifa, Israel; families like those of Ted Burgon of Oregon and \nRick Spier of Colorado, the two American teachers killed in August of \n2002 in Indonesia. Murders for which there have been no indictments and \nno suspects named. FBI agents have underscored that until such time as \nthey have full and unfettered access to witnesses and evidence in \nIndonesia, they cannot rule out terrorism, nor can they exonerate \nmembers of the Indonesian military who have been implicated in this \nheinous crime.\n\n  This is wrong as a matter of foreign policy. Anything less than 100 \npercent commitment to pursue all terrorists who harm or murder American \ncitizens undermines our moral clarity and our War on Terrorism. it also \nserves to embolden would-be terrorists all over the world, ultimately \nputting us all at greater risk.\n  We have arrived at this unfortunate juncture because the State \nDepartment, whose major objective is diplomacy, has had primary purview \nover this issue. The State Department, it would seem, has simply not \nbrought its full resources to bear when it comes to facilitating the \ninvestigation, capture and prosecution of those who have murdered \nAmericans overseas. This is particularly true if those Americans have \nbeen murdered in Israel or in areas under control of the Palestinian \nAuthority, or in countries whose support we are seeking or counting on \nin the War on Terrorism.\n  The major objective of the Justice Department, in contrast, is \njustice. The Justice Department recently scored a victory, when on \nFebruary 20th, they issued indictments on several members of the \nPalestinian Islamic Jihad. That terrorist organization is believed to \nbe responsible for the deaths of two American citizens, and dozens of \nother people in recent years. As we celebrate this substantial step \ntoward justice, however, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is \nmuch more work to be done.\n  We should not, and cannot, in good conscience allow the pursuit of \njustice to be suborned to diplomatic considerations and expediencies. \nThis is why I am introducing the Koby Mandell Act of 2003. Koby was a \n13 year old boy from Silver Spring, MD, who one day decided to do the \nHuck Finn thing, and skip school. However, the punishment did not fit \nthe crime. His body was found brutally stoned and dismembered in a cave \noutside of Tekoah, Israel. His assailants remain at large in the \nPalestinian controlled areas.\n  This Act will create a watch-dog office within the Department of \nJustice to ensure that all terrorists who murder or harm American \ncitizens overseas are pursued with equal vigor, irrespective of the \nnationality or current residence of the terrorist. This Act will work \nto ensure that no other American family who has suffered at the hands \nof overseas terrorism will have their grief compounded a lack of \njustice.\n  I urge you all to join me and my fellow senator from the State of \nOregon, ron Wyden, by becoming a sponsor of the Koby Mandell Act, to \nput the issue of justice for American victims of overseas terrorism \ninto the hands of the Justice department, where it truly belongs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Koby Mandell Act of 2003 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Koby Mandell Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Numerous American citizens have been murdered or maimed \n     by terrorists around the world, including more than 100 \n     murdered since 1968 in terrorist attacks occurring in Israel \n     or in territories administered by Israel or in territories \n     administered by the Palestinian Authority.\n       (2) Some American citizens who have been victims of \n     terrorism overseas, especially those harmed by terrorists \n     operating from areas administered by the Palestinian \n     Authority, have not received from the United States \n     Government services equal to those received by other such \n     victims of overseas terrorism.\n       (3) The United States Government has not devoted adequate \n     efforts or resources to the\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\n     apprehension of terrorists who have harmed American citizens \n     overseas, particularly in cases involving terrorists \n     operating from areas administered by the Palestinian \n     Authority. Monetary rewards for information leading to the \n     capture of terrorists overseas, which the Government \n     advertises in regions where the terrorists are believed to be \n     hiding, have not been advertised in areas administered by the \n     Palestinian Authority.\n       (4) This situation is especially grave in the areas \n     administered by the Palestinian Authority, because many \n     terrorists involved in the murders of Americans are walking \n     free there; some of these terrorists have been given \n     positions in the Palestinian Authority security forces or \n     other official Palestinian Authority agencies; and a number \n     of schools, streets, and other public sites have been named \n     in honor of terrorists who were involved in the murders of \n     Americans.\n       (5) To remedy these and related problems, an office should \n     be established within the Department of Justice for the \n     purpose of ensuring equally vigorous efforts to capture all \n     terrorists who have harmed American citizens overseas and \n     equal treatment for all American victims of overseas \n     terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OFFICE OF JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF \n                   OVERSEAS TERRORISM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established within the Department \n     of Justice an Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas \n     Terrorism (in this Act referred to as the ``Office'') to \n     carry out the following activities:\n       (1) Rewards for justice.--\n       (A) In general.--The Office shall assume responsibility for \n     administration of the Rewards for Justice program and its \n     website.\n       (B) Administration.--In administering the Rewards for \n     Justice program the Office shall ensure that--\n       (i) rewards are offered to capture all terrorists involved \n     in harming American citizens overseas, regardless of the \n     terrorists' country of origin or residence;\n       (ii) such rewards are prominently advertised in the mass \n     media and public sites in all countries or regions where such \n     terrorists reside;\n       (iii) the names and photographs and suspects in all such \n     cases are included on the website; and\n       (iv) the names of the specific organizations claiming \n     responsibility for terrorist attacks mentioned on the site \n     are included in the descriptions of those attacks.\n       (2) Notification program.--The Office shall establish and \n     administer a program--\n       (A) comparable to the VINE system for notification of crime \n     victims; and\n       (B) that will provide notification for American victims of \n     overseas terrorism or their immediate family to update them \n     on the status of efforts to capture the terrorists who harmed \n     them.\n       (3) Government representation.--The Office shall send an \n     official United States Government representative to attend \n     the funeral of every American victim of terrorism overseas.\n       (4) Report.--The Office shall assume responsibility for \n     providing twice-annual reports to Congress as required by \n     section 805 of the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan \n     Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and \n     2001.\n       (5) Profiting from crimes.--The Office shall work with \n     other United States Government agencies to expand legal \n     restrictions on the ability of murders to reap profits from \n     books or movies concerning their crimes so as to ensure that \n     terrorists who harm American citizens overseas are unable to \n     profit from book or movie sales in the United States.\n       (6) Terrorists as police.--The Office shall--\n       (A) determine if terrorists who have harmed American \n     citizens overseas are serving in their local police or \n     security forces; and\n       (B) if it is found that terrorists who have harmed American \n     citizens overseas are serving in their local police or \n     security forces--\n       (i) alert those United States Government agencies involved \n     in providing assistance, directly or indirectly, to those \n     forces; and\n       (ii) request of those agencies that all such assistance be \n     halted until the aforementioned terrorists are removed from \n     their positions.\n       (7) Patterns of prosecution.--The Office shall--\n       (A) undertake a comprehensive assessment of the pattern of \n     United States indictments and prosecution of terrorists who \n     have harmed American citizens overseas, in order to determine \n     the reasons for the absence of indictments of terrorists \n     residing in some regions, such as the territories controlled \n     by the Palestinian Authority; and\n       (B) provide the assessment to the Attorney General and to \n     Congress, together with its recommendations.\n       (8) Monitoring.--The Office shall--\n       (A) monitor public actions by governments and regimes \n     overseas pertaining to terrorists who have harmed American \n     citizens, such as the naming of schools, streets, or other \n     public institutions or sites after such terrorists; and\n       (B) in such instances, encourage other United States \n     Government agencies to halt their provision of assistance, \n     directly or indirectly, to those institutions.\n       (9) Compensation.--The Office shall initiate negotiations \n     to secure appropriate financial compensation for American \n     citizens, or the families of such citizens, who were harmed \n     by organizations that claim responsibility for acts of \n     terrorism against Americans overseas and that subsequently \n     become part of a governing regime with which the United \n     States Government maintains diplomatic or other official \n     contacts, such as the Palestinian Authority.\n       (10) Incarcerated terrorists.--The Office shall--\n       (A) monitor the incarceration abroad of terrorists who \n     harmed Americans overseas, to ensure that their conditions of \n     incarceration are reasonably similar to conditions of \n     incarceration in the United States; and\n       (B) in cases where terrorists who have harmed Americans \n     overseas, and are subsequently released from incarceration \n     abroad, are eligible for further prosecution in the United \n     States, coordinate with other Government agencies to seek the \n     transfer of those terrorists to the United States for further \n     prosecution.\n       (11) Persona non grata.--The Office shall strive to ensure \n     that all terrorists who have harmed Americans overseas are \n     treated by the United States Government as persona non grata, \n     including steps such as--\n       (A) denying those individuals visas for entry to the United \n     States;\n       (B) urging United States Government agencies to refrain \n     from political and diplomatic contacts with those \n     individuals; and\n       (C) instructing United States embassies and consulates to \n     urge American visitors to those countries to refrain from \n     patronizing businesses that are owned or operated by such \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2003 and each subsequent fiscal year such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act.\n       (b) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under subsection (a) are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 685. a bill to assist low income taxpayers in preparing and filing \ntheir tax returns and to protect taxpayers from unscrupulous refund \nanticipation loan providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Akaka, to re-introduce the Low Income Taxpayer \nProtection Act of 2003. This legislation, if enacted, will give \ntaxpayers much needed assistance with the arduous annual task of \npreparing their Federal tax returns by providing them with real \nalternatives to paying for expensive tax preparation services. In doing \nso, many of these taxpayers will not need to take out expensive and \noftentimes usurious refund anticipation loans that greatly reduce the \ntax refund that these taxpayers are entitled to receive. As we all \nknow, the result of a complicated tax code is complex and confusing tax \nforms. Until Congress is able to provide simple and understandable \nforms for taxpayers, we have an obligation to make sure that taxpayers \nhave the ability to prepare and file their tax returns without paying \nfor expensive and sometimes abusive services.\n  Refund anticipation loans, RALs, are high interest loans offered to \ntaxpayers that are secured by their anticipated tax refund. While some \ntaxpayers may choose these loans willingly, many are often forced to \ntake out a RAL to cover the upfront cost of the preparation services. \nSadly, many taxpayers get caught with outstanding loans that they can't \npay off because a mistake was made on their tax return resulting in a \nsmaller than anticipated refund. Many of these loans, when annualized, \nhave interest rates over 200 percent. As long as we require our \nNation's taxpayers to determine their own tax liability, we will have a \nresponsibility to make sure that these same taxpayers have an \nalternative to these expensive options. We must come up with better \noptions for these taxpayers than paying usurious fees and expenses or \nnot filing a return.\n  Recently the Brookings Institute and the Economic Policy Institute \nreleased a report that illustrated the abuses occurring with RALs. \nAccording to this report, roughly $1.75 billion of the earned income \ncredit, EIC, funds are annually going to tax return preparers and RAL \nfees and costs. It was not the intent of Congress that this program \nwould create such a middleman for these funds. Every dollar that goes \nto these businesses is a dollar that is not going to the intended \nbeneficiaries. The EIC has become one of the most effective tools for \nfighting poverty and benefiting low and moderate income working \nfamilies, and so it is essential that every dollar of this credit goes \nto the taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n  To help low and moderate income taxpayers, my bill requires all those \ninvolved with RALs to register with the IRS. Treasury will then be \nrequired to determine what is a fair amount of interest and fees to be \ncharged based on the benefit to the taxpayer and the risk to the \nlender. It will also expand the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program \nby directly giving them matching funds to operate. VITA clinics are one \nof the few places lower income taxpayers can go to get free assistance \nwith their tax returns.\n  In New Mexico, the VITA program has had an enormous impact. For \nexample, in conjunction with Albuquerque Technical Vocational \nInstitute, TVI, over 8,500 taxpayers were assisted with their returns \nlast year resulting in over $9 million in refunds being brought back \ninto the New Mexico economy. This year, this program is on pace to \nassist even more taxpayers. By utilizing a computer program system \ndeveloped and advocated by Fred Gordon, an accounting instructor at \nTVI, even supervised high school students at Del Norte High School in \nAlbuquerque have been preparing and filing tax returns. I commend the \nefforts of those directly involved with this program, as well as, the \nscores of volunteers who give their time to help prepare tax returns \nfor their fellow New Mexicans. Through the efforts of groups such as \nthe Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce, Public Service Company of \nNew Mexico (PNM), TVI and Wells Fargo Bank, the VITA program has made a \nbig difference in New Mexico, but more needs to be done. Our \nlegislation will provide programs like these with the ability to get \nsome matching Federal grants to make it possible to pay for training \nmaterials, computers or other necessary equipment. A little money can \ngo a long way and I intend to keep working with my colleagues here in \nthe Senate until this becomes a reality. This is a truly worthwhile \ngoal and one that will greatly help communities in New Mexico as well \nas the rest of the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERALLY \n                   INSURED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Approximately 40,000,000 Americans are unbanked and not \n     utilizing mainstream, insured financial institutions.\n       (B) In 1999, nearly half of the $30,000,000,000 in earned \n     income tax credits (EITC) claimed\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n     nationwide was refunded through refund anticipation loans, \n     and an estimated $1,750,000,000 intended to assist low-income \n     families through the EITC was received by commercial tax \n     preparers and affiliated national banks to pay for tax \n     assistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost \n     refund loans.\n       (C) Refund anticipation loans carry interest rates in a \n     range between 97.4 percent to more than 2000 percent.\n       (D) An estimated 45 percent of earned income tax credit \n     recipients pay for check cashing services, which reduces EITC \n     benefits by $130,000,000.\n       (E) Individuals with bank accounts can receive their tax \n     refunds faster than waiting for a paper check and without the \n     need to utilize refund anticipation loans or check cashiers.\n       (F) Individuals with federally insured depository accounts \n     have an increased opportunity to access financial services at \n     mainstream financial institutions, which typically have \n     reduced costs for consumers.\n       (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     establish a grant program to provide unbanked low-and \n     moderate-income taxpayers with tax preparation services and \n     increase their access to financial services by the \n     establishment of an account at a federally insured depository \n     institution or credit union and the provision of financial \n     education.\n       (b) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary is authorized \n     to award demonstration project grants (including multi-year \n     grants) to eligible entities to provide tax preparation \n     services and assistance along with establishing an account in \n     a federally insured depositary institution for individuals \n     that currently do not have such an account.\n       (c) Eligible Entities.--\n       (1) In general.--An entity is eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section if such an entity is--\n       (A) an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code,\n       (B) a federally insured depository institution,\n       (C) an agency of a State or local government,\n       (D) a community development financial institution,\n       (E) an Indian tribal organization,\n       (F) an Alaska Native Corporation,\n       (G) a Native Hawaiian organization,\n       (H) a labor organization,

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the Low \nIncome Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003, which Senator Bingaman and I \nare introducing today. I thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership on \nthis important issue.\n  The legislation that my colleague from New Mexico and I are \nintroducing would provide the Department of the Treasury with the \nauthority to regulate income tax refund anticipation loans, RALs, and \nprohibit excessive fees. The bill would also provide additional \nopportunities for low-income taxpayers to receive assistance with tax \npreparation and filing their taxes and thus, we are seeking to meet \ntaxpayers' needs for assistance while attempting to discourage a \npredatory practice.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2001, the Earned Income Tax \nCredit, EITC, was responsible for elevating nearly four million people \nabove the poverty line. This credit has helped and continues to help \nlow-income individuals and families to meet their food, clothing, \nhousing, transportation, and education needs.\n  However, while this tax relief is benefitting families who need it \nmost, the EITC's impact is being unnecessarily limited. Earned Income \nTax Credit benefits intended for working families are increasingly \nbeing diminished by often exorbitant tax preparation fees and the \ngrowing use of high-interest refund anticipation loans, which typically \ncarry triple-digit interest rates.\n  In 1999, according to a report published by the Brookings \nInstitution, an estimated $1.75 billion intended to assist low-income \nfamilies went to commercial tax preparers and affiliated national banks \nfor tax assistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost refund \nloans. Although tax preparation services are useful, when combined with \nrefund anticipation loans and other fees, these services are \noverpriced. The report further stated that 39 percent of taxpayers who \nearned the EITC received their refund through a refund anticipation \nloan, while only\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nfour percent of those who did not receive the EITC purchased a refund \nanticipation loan. Clearly, RALs were heavily marketed to a specific \npopulation of taxpayer. Forty-seven percent of all EITC dollars were \ndistributed to recipients through these loans. In my state of Hawaii, \nin the Honolulu metropolitan statistical area, 27.7 percent of all EITC \ndollars were associated with refund anticipation loans. These loans \ntake money away from the day-to-day, kitchen-table needs of the low-\nincome families.\n  Furthermore, refund anticipation loans carry interest rates that \nrange from 97.4 percent to more than 2,000 percent. The interest rates \nand fees charged on these products are not justified for the short \nlength of time that these loans cover. The typical rapid refund loan \nlength is two weeks. These loans carry even less risk because of the \nDebt Indicator program. The Debt Indicator program allows the Internal \nRevenue Service to inform the lender if the applicant for a refund loan \nhas any outstanding Federal debts. The risk is further reduced because \nloan issuers share information about outstanding delinquencies that \nrefund anticipation loan applicants owe and are able to collect debts \nfor each other.\n  This bill would terminate the Debt Indicator program. In 1995, the \nuse of the Debt Indicator was suspended because of massive fraud in e-\nfiled returns with RALs. After the program was discontinued, RAL \nparticipation declined. The use of the Debt Indicator was reinstated in \n1999. Remarks from H & R Block Chief Executive Officer Frank L. \nSalizzoni upon the reinstatement of the program state that the Debt \nIndicator ``is good news for many of our clients who opt to receive the \namount of their refund through Refund Anticipation Loans. The IRS \nprogram will likely result in substantially lower fees for this \nservice.'' However, according to a study conducted by the Consumer \nFederation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, that has \nnot been the case for at least one of the major tax preparers. H & R \nBlock and Household Bank's fees dropped for a year after the Debt \nIndicator was reinstated. The fees rose significantly from 2000 to \n2001, which increased H & R Block's revenue from RALs by 49 percent. \nPer RAL revenue rose by 43.9 percent while RAL sales volume increased \nby only 2.7 percent. The expected outcome that RAL prices would go down \nas a result of the reinstatement of the indicator has not occurred. The \nuse of the Debt Indicator should again be stopped.\n  Another important provision in the bill is authorization language for \na grant program to link tax preparation services with the establishment \nof a bank account. There are still approximately four million EITC \nrecipients that are classified as unbanked, and lack a formal \nrelationship with a financial institution. It has been estimated that \n45 percent of EITC recipients pay for check cashing services. These \ncheck cashing services reduce EITC benefits by $130 million. Having a \nbank account allows individuals not only to receive their tax refund \ncheck faster than waiting for a paper check, but also does not impose \nthe excessive fees that check cashing services and refund anticipation \nloan providers assess. An account at a bank or credit union provides \nconsumers alternatives to rapid refund loans, check cashing services, \nand lower cost remittances. In addition, bank and credit union accounts \nprovide access to saving and borrowing services found at mainstream \nfinancial institutions. This grant program builds upon the First \nAccounts initiative which has funded pilot projects that have coupled \ntax preparation services with the establishment of bank accounts. An \nexample of such a project is the partnership that has been established \namong The Center for Law & Human Services, Accounting Aid Society, \nShoreBank, National Consumer Law Center, and Consumer Federation of \nAmerica that is taking place in Chicago and Detroit. More of these \nprograms are necessary to provide much needed tax preparation \nassistance and to encourage the use of mainstream financial services.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 686. A bill to provide assistance for poison prevention and to \nstabilize the funding of regional poison control centers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues--\nSenators Murray, Landrieu, Breaux, Bingaman, and Inouye--to introduce \nthe Poison Control Center Awareness and Enhancement Act of 2003. Our \nbill is designed to help make certain that the vital work of our \nnation's poison control centers continues.\n  Many of us--as parents and grandparents--have experienced the \nterrifying situation when a child accidentally swallows something \npotentially toxic. Fortunately, local poison control centers--many of \nthem located at children's hospitals--work around the clock to answer \nquestions from parents and to field phone calls from others about \npossible poisonings. Today, we also have in place a national, toll-free \npoison control telephone number--and that number is 1-800-222-1222--\nthat automatically connects callers to specially trained nurses, \npharmacists, and doctors at the closest local poison center.\n  This phone number went into effect as a result of legislation I \nhelped get signed into law a few years ago. And now, as parents of \neight children and now grandparents of eight, my wife, Fran, and I can \ntell you that we rest a bit easier knowing that in the case of a \npossible poisoning, all we need to do is call a toll free, 1-800 \ntelephone number to get in contact with the nearest poison control \ncenter. Any parents, anywhere--whether they are in their own hometown \nor in another state on vacation--can call the 1-800 number, 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week in the event of a poisoning.\n  There are over 70 poison control centers nationwide--three in my home \nState of Ohio. These centers have fielded over one million phone calls \njust since January 2002, answering questions about poisonous, drug \nabuse, product contents, substance identification interactions, and \nadverse reactions. They can answer questions and concerns about what \nwould typically be called poisonous products--things like cleaners and \nbleach. This is the most common poison exposure for children, who \ntypically ingest household products, such as cosmetics and personal \ncare products, cleaning substances, pain relievers, foreign bodies, and \nplants.\n  But poison control centers can also answer questions about products \nthat people may not think are poisonous, like prescribed medicines or \nover-the-counter medications. Maybe someone mixed medications or \nmisread a label and took too much of the medicine by accident. Poison \ncontrol centers can answer caller questions and direct the caller to \nseek medical attention if necessary.\n  I remember very clearly a time when Fran and I needed to call the \nlocal poison control center. As we were wrapping up our annual Ice \nCream Social at our home in Cedarville, our then two year-old \ngranddaughter, Isabelle, fell into a bucket of cleaning solution. We \nfeared that she may have swallowed some of the solution and immediately \ncalled the poison control center. We were very lucky. The trained \nhealth care professional at the local poison center explained that all \nwe needed to do was rinse Isabelle off and have her drink some water. \nThe quick response of the poison control center provided rapid, easy \nanswers to our questions--a process that has become even easier since \nthe toll-free hotline began operating.\n  A young child, like Isabelle, is representative of most poisoning \ncases; however, adults often face situations necessitating information \nand help from poison control centers. Take the example of what occurred \nin Marysville, OH. Thirty workers in a manufacturing plant in \nMarysville were victims of gas exposure. Twenty of these workers went \nto Union Memorial Hospital. The hospital contacted the poison center, \nafter which these patients were given oxygen and later discharged that \nsame day. Ten others went to a different hospital that did not call a \npoison center. These patients were not released until the next day, \neven though their symptoms did not differ from the other 20 workers. \nThe national hotline will help cut-down on situations like that in \nMarysville.\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n  Our Nation's poison control centers handle an average of one poison \nexposure every 15 seconds. These centers are critical to our \ncommunities--especially now during this time of war and uncertainty. \nParents are already anxious about the safety of their children, and \nwith the potential anthrax scares or chemical or biologic scares, \npoison control centers can provide information to parents and help \nrelieve some of their concerns.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide the continued funding \nneeded to ensure that the national toll-free number continues to \noperate, taking phone calls and helping families across the country. We \nmust continue to increase the accessibility and effectiveness of our \nnation's poison control centers, as well as cement their existence for \nfuture generations. With this bill, we are not just making an \ninvestment in poison control; rather, we are making it easier to keep \nour children, friends, and ourselves safer and healthier.\n  I encourage my colleagues to remember the hotline number--it could \nsave a life: 1-800-222-1222.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Control Center \n     Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 2 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 14801) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Poison control centers are our Nation's primary \n     defense against injury and deaths from poisoning.

In any given year, \n     there will be between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 poison \n     exposures. More than 50 percent of these exposures will \n     involve children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxic \n     substances in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 \n     hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and \n     13,000 fatalities annually.\n       ``(3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n     utilization of poison control centers, and reduce the \n     inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other \n     more costly health care services.\n       ``(4) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the \n     anthrax cases of October 2001, have dramatically changed our \n     Nation.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to prohibit the \nconcurrent deployment to combat zones of both military spouses of \nmilitary families with minor children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrequire that the Secretary of Defense issue regulations that would \nprevent a mother and father of minor children from being deployed to a \ncombat zone at the same time.\n  Under my legislation, the Secretary of Defense would have 15 days to \nimplement this policy by issuing regulations that would include the \ndefinition of what comprises a combat zone.\n  As we wage war against Iraq, it is important that we work to ensure \nthat a child will never have to endure the pain of losing both parents \nduring wartime. Military families sacrifice so much to serve our \nNation. We should do everything we can to ensure their children are not \norphaned.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 688. A bill to provide that no electric utility shall be required \nto enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase or to sell \nelectricity or capacity under section 210 of the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this bill that \nwill end the practice of forcing electric utilities to purchase \nunneeded electricity at above market rates--a practice that ultimately \ncosts consumers more.\n  This outdated practice began after the 1973-74 oil embargo. In the \nembargo's aftermath, we understood a far reaching assessment of our \nenergy policies and enacted numerous laws to address the issues facing \nthis country at that time. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978, PURPA, was one of several energy bills that resulted from \nthose efforts.\n  In 1978, the electric utility industry in this country was based on \nmonopolies and almost totally reliant on antiquated technologies. It \nwas also highly territorial, having only limited ability\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nto move electricity from one part of the country to another.\n  PURPA was intended to address these issues. It was designed to \nalleviate real and potential shortages in electricity and encourage the \nuse of alternative fuels to generate electricity. To do this, it \nestablished a new class of electricity generators. The goal was for \nthese new generators to rapidly implement new generating technologies \nthat the utilities had been slow to adopt and to expand the amount of \nelectricity generated with alternative fuels.\n  To ensure that investors would build these new facilities, PURPA \nessentially guaranteed them a profit. It required the conventional \nelectric utilities to purchase all of the electricity the new \ngenerators wanted to sell. Prices were essentially fixed--requiring \ntraditional utilities to pay for the electricity based on the costs \nthey ``avoided'' by not having to build additional capacity themselves.\n  And PURPA worked. It led to the development of plants converting \nwaste to energy and to construction of smaller, more efficient \ngenerating facilities.\n  But much has changed since 1978.\n  Today there are competitive wholesale markets throughout the country, \ngiving generation project developers many opportunities to see their \noutput. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and a variety of Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission directives now ensure that generators have access \nto transmission lines, so that power can reach those markets. And we \nnow have additional capacity coming from a variety of non-utilities \nusing small-scale facilities and newer, more efficient technologies \nwhich allow them to be price competitive.\n  There have also been changes in the PURPA generators. One of PURPA's \ngoals was to spur the use of alternative or renewable fuels, but 80 \npercent of the electricity currently generated by PURPA facilities is \nproduced by burning natural gas, oil and coal. And the ``equitable'' \nprices imposed on electric utilities purchasing PURPA power are \nsubstantially higher than market rates, increasing the cost to \nconsumers by roughly $8 billion annually. Exactly the opposite of what \nwas intended.\n  The bill I offer today would rescind any requirement for electricity \nutilities to enter into new agreements to purchase electricity from \nPURPA facilities. It would not prevent utilities from buying PURPA \npower that is offered at competitive rates. And it would not affect \nexisting PURPA agreements. Those agreements would remain in effect \nuntil they expire, allowing those PURPA facilities to continue selling \ntheir electricity to the utilities at the prices specified in the \nagreements. This approach would ensure that the investment in PURPA \nfacilities can be recouped in accordance with the parties' \nexpectations, but will protect consumers from new PURPA contracts--\ncontracts which force them to pay above market prices for electricity.\n  This bill would also ensure that the electric utilities that are \nrequired to purchase PURPA electricity, possibly for decades to come \nunder existing contracts, have the flexibility to recover those costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is fiscally \nsound, and is an example of good government because it eliminates \noutdated and counterproductive legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 689.

Of those children 385,171 are military \n     dependent children.\n       (2) At a time when many States have initiated steep cuts in \n     education funding, Impact Aid helps in easing the financial \n     burden on school districts with large military populations.\n       (3) At a time when many military parents have been deployed \n     overseas, schools with large military populations are \n     reporting many students experiencing difficulty adjusting to \n     their parents being absent or physically threatened. As a \n     result, school officials report increased behavioral \n     problems, academic problems, and an increased need for \n     school-based counseling.\n       (4) Increased funding for Impact Aid will ensure that \n     federally impacted schools will continue to serve some of \n     these children's basic educational needs, as well as special \n     needs, such as counseling for children with a parent overseas \n     on active duty.\n       (5) Despite the Administration's proposed $173,000,000 cut \n     in Impact Aid funding both the Senate and House of \n     Representatives Committees on the Budget rejected this cut. \n     Furthermore, the budget resolution of the House of \n     Representatives assumes an increase in Impact Aid funding to \n     $1,238,226,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Impact Aid \n     funding is funded at $1,238,226,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 385.

FINDINGS--THE SENATE FINDS THAT:\n\n       Twenty-eight years ago, the federal government promised to \n     pay for 40 percent of the additional cost of special \n     education. Presently, the federal share is only 17.6 percent. \n     The nation's school districts cannot afford such a large \n     unfunded mandate. Thus, it is imperative that Congress \n     increase IDEA funding to the long-promised 40 percent share.\n\n     SEC. 2.\n\n       On page 3, line 10, increase amount by $792,000,000.\n       On page
