Mr. President, there are a couple of news events in the \nlast 24 hours or 48 hours that I thought deserve some comment.\n  Let me first talk a moment about the atrocities and abuse of enemy \ncombatants--prisoners--in Iraq which has been a major concern. Many of \nmy colleagues have commented upon the horrific images that have come \nout on television and in the papers. I have not seen as yet many \ncomments about the Pentagon's response. That is what I wanted to \ncomment on briefly.\n  Officials within the Department of Defense have known at least since \nJanuary that prisoners held as enemy combatants in Iraq have been \nsubject to maltreatment, and to physical and sexual abuse. We know this \nbecause in January the Department of Defense relieved the camp \ncommander of her duties and ordered an investigation. The investigation \nwas completed in February. The 54-page report that was issued, as I \nunderstand it, contains horrifying details about these abuses.\n  Yesterday, on the CBS news program ``Face the Nation,'' Bob \nSchieffer, the host of that program, interviewed General Myers, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bob Schieffer asked about this \nreport. He said, ``There is a 53-page report that Sy Hersh of the New \nYorker has obtained which says that the situation was even worse. How \ncould this have happened? What is going to occur?\n  The part that I thought was most disturbing was the response by \nGeneral Myers to the question: ``Why would you not have seen the \nreport?'' The investigation was carried out in December. The report was \ncompleted in February. ``Why would you not have seen report?'' And the \nresponse was: ``It is working its way up, up the chain. I will see this \nreport. I am sure it just hasn't come to me yet.''\n\n  This is an unacceptable response. If this is a concern of our \nDepartment of Defense, if this is a concern of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, how can he state in May that he has not seen the \nreport or demanded to see the report, and that it is, as he understands \nit, ``working its way up'' and will eventually come to him?\n  I don't think that is the level of concern we ought to be \ndemonstrating in our Department of Defense for this kind of \ncircumstance. It is not the level of concern the American people would \nexpect of their military commanders for this type of conduct.\n  I would think if the general believed swift action was required he \nmight have directed those in the command--in his command and, of \ncourse, that is everyone in the military--to get that report to him \nimmediately upon completion, and to give him concrete action items they \nwere intending to take to deal with the situation.\n  Leadership and responsibility flow from the top in our military. We \nall know that. For the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to handle \nthis matter in this way and indicate that, on May first, he has not \nseen the report but he assumes it is working its way up through the \nchain of command, demonstrates to all members of the military that \nhumane treatment of prisoners is not a priority for our military in \nIraq.\n  That is unacceptable. That is unacceptable to this Senator. It is \nunacceptable, I believe, to the American public. I hope we can get a \ndifferent reaction from the Pentagon and a more acceptable reaction \nfrom the Pentagon to this horrific state of affairs that has come to \nour attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4728-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4728-S4732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ENSURING AMERICA'S FUTURE COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a \nspeech Senator Daschle gave 2 weeks ago to the American Association for \nthe Advancement of Science be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the author of this report on the front \npage of the New York Times today, Mr. Broad, points to several trends \nthat are working against the United States with regard to our world \nleadership position in science and technology. He points out the \npercentage of patents issued to Americans is declining. He points out \nthe portion of published research attributable to Americans in top \nphysics journals is decreasing. He points out the number of Nobel \nPrizes awarded in the basic sciences to Americans is decreasing. He \npoints out the number of doctoral degrees granted in science and \nengineering in this country is on the decline. He points out the \ndeclining percentage of science and engineering doctoral degree \ncandidates from foreign countries who are planning to stay in the \nUnited States after they graduate. This last phenomenon I referred to \nhas been dubbed ``the reverse brain drain.'' He talks extensively about \nthat.\n  The simple fact is, the world has become a highly competitive place \nwith regard to science and technology leadership and talent and \ninvestments. We have historically believed we were the leaders in the \nworld in this arena, and we have taken for granted the fact that \npromising young scientists and engineers from other countries would all \nwant to come here, to stay here, and contribute to our continued world \nleadership. All of that is now in danger of changing.\n  We ignore this challenge to our long-term economic security at our \nown peril. This challenge requires strong efforts by our Government and \nour industry to counter the strong efforts that are being made in other \ncountries, and to match the strong efforts that are being made in other \ncountries in this field.\n  So what needs to be done? Let me list briefly six areas on which I \nthink we ought to take aggressive action. The first area relates to \nresearch frontiers. We need to start by focusing on broad support for \nbasic science and engineering research across the board, as well \n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nas on targeted investments in critical emerging technologies that will \ndrive future job growth and economic growth in this economy.\n\n  Unfortunately, in terms of broad-based basic research support, we \nhave a pattern of underfunding across the physical sciences and \nengineering, and that is in comparison particularly to what we have \nbeen doing in biological and life sciences for several years. I do not \nadvocate reducing our commitment to the biological and life sciences, \nbut I strongly advocate a comparable commitment to maintaining our \nleadership in the physical sciences and engineering.\n  In terms of targeted research and development, there are many areas \nwhere there are promising developments that we should be paying \nattention to. Let me cite three examples. One is high-end computing. \nJapan today is the world leader in high-end computing with their Earth \nSimulator supercomputer. That is a sad statement to make on this Senate \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to continue for another 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is a sad statement because I can remember a decade \nago when the United States was the unrivaled leader in high-end \ncomputing. We need to do much better in this field.\n  Senator Lamar Alexander and I have introduced the High-End Computing \nRevitalization Act. I hope that the leadership in the Senate will see \nfit to move this legislation this year, and that we will receive strong \nsupport from our colleagues.\n  Nanotechnology is another area. Although Congress passed a \nnanotechnology bill last year, and the President signed the bill with \ngreat fanfare, the truth is, we are not putting the needed funding into \nit. The administration has not requested sufficient funding. We are not \ncommitting the money. This is another major shortfall.\n  The next specific area I believe we need to target is next-generation \nlighting. I have spoken several times about that on the Senate floor. \nSemiconductor lighting has the promise to greatly increase the \nefficiency of lighting devices and also to create an enormous number of \njobs. The estimate is this will be a $12 billion per year industry for \nthese devices in the future. The question is, where will the leadership \nbe in developing these devices? Will we maintain some of that \nleadership in this country? And where will the high-wage jobs be \ncreated by this? I hope those jobs will be created in the United \nStates, but Congress needs to act to ensure that.\n  A second area deals with the training of scientists and engineers. An \nenormous amount needs to be done to better prepare our own students for \ncareers in these fields. We do too little in those areas. We need to do \nbetter. We now have the added concern that the foreign students who \nhave traditionally come here to study are, first, finding visa problems \nthat keep them from coming here; and, second, are deciding not to stay \nonce they complete their education but go back to their home country. \nThis is a precursor to the shifting of more and more research and \ndevelopment activity out of this country and into other countries \naround the world, which I think is a very bad trend for our \neconomic future.\n\n  The third area is infrastructure. The National Science Foundation \nestimates there are roughly $10 billion of unfilled needs for science \nand engineering facilities at universities. Unfortunately, the system \nwe have in Congress today to fund these needs is through random, \nuncoordinated earmarks to appropriations bills. This is totally \nunacceptable. We need a merit-oriented solution that involves a look at \nthe merits of the request and the need, and also the commitment that \nState and local governments are willing to make to creating this \ninfrastructure.\n  The fourth area is finance. We need public policies and strategies to \nexpand the pool of risk capital for entrepreneurial investment.\n  A fifth strategy is public-private sector interactions. We need to \nfully fund the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnerships. The administration's request that we zero-fund \nthe Advanced Technology Program is totally wrongheaded, in my view, and \nclearly needs to be rejected by this Congress. We should have the \nFederal Government take a stronger role in supporting science parks and \nincubators around this country as well.\n  The final area I would mention is regulation and trade policy. We \nneed to recognize the strategic importance of legal or regulatory \nstructures to high-technology industries. We need to increase the \nefforts to protect intellectual property, to support fair competition \nregimes, to enforce legitimacy and transparency in the global market \nsystem, and to assure access by U.S. companies to these markets.\n  We need to spend some time better monitoring and being sure we are \ngetting fair treatment under the trade agreements we have already \nentered into instead of rushing forward pellmell trying to find new \nagreements we can sign.\n  We need to focus on export promotion. There is way too little \nattention to export promotion.\n  We need to focus on assistance programs for those people who are \ndisplaced and those communities that are damaged by increased trade. \nThe current administration and, unfortunately, the Congress in the last \nfew years have not done what needed to be done in this area. We have no \nformal science and technology policy. The administration has \nundermanned and seemingly neglected the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy.\n  In previous remarks to the Senate, I have gone through a list of the \nproposed cuts by this administration to basic science and applied \nresearch in the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the \nAgriculture Department, in the transportation sector, the Department of \nEnergy's Office of Science, the Advanced Technology Program in the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  These include:\n  $660 million in cuts proposed for basic and applied research at the \nDepartment of Defense, the sort of research that has the greatest \npotential for dual use and effective spin-off to the civilian high-\ntechnology industries;\n  $63 million in cuts for energy conservation R at the Department of \nEnergy;\n  $183 million in cuts for FY 2005 for agricultural research;\n  $24 million in cuts for transportation research; and\n  $68 million in cuts for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, \na major supporter of basic physical sciences and engineering research--\nwe have 40 Democratic Senators and 15 Republicans on a letter asking \nfor increased funding rather than cuts here--and;\n  total elimination of the Advanced Technology Program at the \nDepartment of Commerce, a loss of $171 million for new technologies \nthat otherwise would have been enabled and brought to commercial \nreality. This is a highly successful program praised by the national \nacademies and even the President's own budget language, cut for short-\nsighted ideological reasons.\n  For the sake of our future national competitiveness, we need to face \nup to the challenges and technological revolutions of the 21st century \nand ensure that the United States has an effective plan for taking them \non. It would be my hope that the coming Presidential election will \nserve as an opportunity to reflect on the ineffective ways in which we \nare currently addressing these issues, and to put forth the case that \nwe need a comprehensive change in our policies to ensure our future \ncompetitiveness.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                                Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 2004]\n\n              U.S. Is Losing Its Dominance in the Sciences\n\n                          (By William J. Broad)\n\n        The United States has started to lose its worldwide \n     dominance in critical areas of science and innovation, \n     according to federal and private experts who point to strong \n     evidence like prizes awarded to Americans and the number of \n     papers in major professional journals.\n        Foreign advances in basic science now often rival or even \n     exceed America's, apparently with little public awareness of \n     the trend or its implications for jobs, industry, national \n     security or the vigor of the nation's intellectual and \n     cultural life.\n        ``The rest of the world is catching up,'' said John E. \n     Jankowski, a senior analyst at the\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n     National Science Foundation, the federal agency that tracks \n     science trends. ``Science excellence is no longer the domain \n     of just the U.S.''\n        Even analysts worried by the trend concede that an \n     expansion of the world's brain trust, with new approaches, \n     could invigorate the fight against disease, develop new \n     sources of energy had wrestle with knotty environmental \n     problems. But profits from the breakthroughs are likely to \n     stay overseas, and this country will face competition for \n     things like hiring scientific talent and getting space to \n     showcase its work in top journals.\n        One area of international competition involves patents. \n     Americans still win large numbers of them, but the percentage \n     is falling as foreigners, especially Asians, have become more \n     active and in some fields have seized the innovation lead. \n     The United States' share of its own industrial patents has \n     fallen steadily over the decades and now stands at 52 \n     percent.\n        A more concrete decline can be seen in published research. \n     Physical Review, a series of top physics journals, recently \n     tracked a reversal in which American papers, in two decades, \n     fell from the most to a minority. Last year the total was \n     just 29 percent, down from 61 percent in 1983.\n        China, said Martin Blume, the journals' editor, has surged \n     ahead by submitting more than 1,000 papers a year. ``Other \n     scientific publishers are seeing the same kind of thing,'' he \n     added.\n        Another downturn centers on the Nobel Prizes, an icon of \n     scientific excellence. Traditionally, the United States, \n     powered by heavy federal investments in basic research, the \n     kind that pursue fundamental questions of nature, dominated \n     the awards.\n        But the American share, after peaking from the 1960's \n     through the 1990's, has fallen in the 2000's to about half, \n     51 percent. The rest went to Britain, Japan, Russia, Germany, \n     Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n        ``We are in a new world, and it's increasingly going to be \n     dominated by countries other than the United States,'' Denis \n     Simon, dean of management and technology at the Rensselaer \n     Polytechnic Institute, recently said at a scientific \n     meeting in Washington.\n       Europe and Asia are ascendant, analysts say, even if their \n     achievements go unnoticed in the United States. In March, for \n     example, European scientists announced that one of their \n     planetary probes had detected methane in the atmosphere of \n     Mars--a possible sign that alien microbes live beneath the \n     planet's surface. The finding made headlines from Paris to \n     Melbourne. But most Americans, bombarded with images from \n     America's own rovers successfully exploring the red planet, \n     missed the foreign news.\n       More aggressively, Europe is seeking to dominate particle \n     physics by building the world's most powerful atom smasher, \n     set for its debut in 2007. Its circular tunnel is 17 miles \n     around.\n       Science analysts say Asia's push for excellence promises to \n     be even more challenging.\n       ``It's unbelievable,'' Diana Hicks, chairwoman of the \n     school of public policy at the Georgia Institute of \n     Technology, said of Asia's growth in science and technical \n     innovation. ``It's amazing to see these output numbers of \n     papers and patents going up so fast.''\n       Analysts say comparative American declines are an \n     inevitable result of rising standards of living around the \n     globe.\n       ``It's all in the ebb and flow of globalization,'' said \n     Jack Fritz, a senior officer at the National Academy of \n     Engineering, an advisory body to the federal government. He \n     called the declines ``the next big thing we will have to \n     adjust to.''\n       The rapidly changing American status has not gone unnoticed \n     by politicians, with Democrats on the attack and the White \n     House on the defensive.\n       ``We stand at a pivotal moment,'' Tom Daschle, the Senate \n     Democratic leader, recently said at a policy forum in \n     Washington at the American Association for the Advancement of \n     Science, the nation's top general science group. ``For all \n     our past successes, there are disturbing signs that America's \n     dominant position in the scientific world is being shaken.''\n       Mr. Daschle accused the Bush administration of weakening \n     the nation's science base by failing to provide enough money \n     for cutting-edge research.\n       The president's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, who \n     attended the forum, strongly denied that charge, saying in an \n     interview that overall research budgets during the Bush \n     administration have soared to record highs and that the \n     science establishment is strong.\n       ``The sky is not falling on science,'' Dr. Marburger said. \n     ``Maybe there are some clouds--no, things that need \n     attention.'' Any problems, he added, are within the power of \n     the United States to deal with in a way that maintains the \n     vitality of the research enterprise.\n       Analysts say Mr. Daschle and Dr. Marburger can both supply \n     data that supports their positions.\n       A major question, they add, is whether big spending \n     automatically translates into big rewards, as it did in the \n     past. During the cold war, the government pumped more than $1 \n     trillion into research, with a wealth of benefits including \n     lasers, longer life expectancies, men on the Moon and the \n     prestige of many Nobel Prizes.\n       Today, federal research budgets are still record highs; \n     this year more than $126 billion has been allocated to \n     research. Moreover, American industry makes extensive use of \n     federal research in producing its innovations and adds its \n     own vast sums of money, the combination dwarfing that of any \n     other nation or bloc.\n       But the edifice is less formidable than it seems, in part \n     because of the nation's costly and unique military role. This \n     year, financing for military research hit $66 billion, higher \n     in fixed dollars than in the cold war and far higher than in \n     any other country.\n       For all the spending, the United States began to experience \n     a number of scientific declines in the 1990's, boom years for \n     the nation's overall economy.\n       For instance, scientific papers by Americans peaked in 1992 \n     and then fell roughly 10 percent, the National Science \n     Foundation reports. Why? Many analysts point to rising \n     foreign competition, as does the European Commission, which \n     also monitors global science trends. In a study last year, \n     the commission said Europe surpassed the United States in the \n     mid-1990's as the world's largest producer of scientific \n     literature.\n       Dr. Hicks of Georgia Tech said that American scientists, \n     when top journals reject their papers, usually have no idea \n     that rising foreign competition may be to blame.\n       On another front, the numbers of new doctorates in the \n     sciences peaked in 1998 and then fell 5 percent the next \n     year, a loss of more than 1,300 new scientists, according to \n     the foundation.\n       A minor exodus also hit one of the hidden strengths of \n     American science: vast ranks of bright foreigners. In a \n     significant shift of demographics, they began to leave in \n     what experts call a reverse brain drain. After peaking in the \n     mid-1990's, the number of doctoral students from China, India \n     and Taiwan with plans to stay in the United States began to \n     fall by the hundreds, according to the foundation.\n       These declines are important, analysts say, because new \n     scientific knowledge is an engine of the American Economy and \n     technical innovation, its influence evident in everything \n     from potent drugs to fast computer chips.\n       Patents are a main way that companies and inventors reap \n     commercial rewards from their ideas and stay competitive in \n     the marketplace while improving the lives of million.\n       Foreigners outside the United States are playing an \n     increasingly important role in these expressions of \n     industrial creativity. In a recent study, CHI Research, a \n     consulting firm in Haddon Height, N.J., found that \n     researchers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea now account for \n     more than a quarter of all United States industrial patents \n     awarded each year, generating revenue for their own countries \n     and limiting it in the United States.\n       Moreover, their growth rates are rapid. Between 1980 and \n     2003, South Korea went from 0 to 2 percent of the total, \n     Taiwan from 0 to 3 percent and Japan from 12 to 21 percent.\n       ``It's not just lots of patents,'' Francis Narin, CHI's \n     president, said of the Asian rise. ``It's lots of good \n     patents that have a high impact,'' as measured by how often \n     subsequent patents cite them.\n       Recently, Dr. Narin added, both Taiwan and Singapore surged \n     ahead of the United States in the overall  number of \n     citations. Singapore's patents include ones in chemicals, \n     semiconductors, electronics and industrial tools.\n        China represents the next wave, experts agree, its \n     scientific rise still too fresh to show up in most statistics \n     but already apparent. Dr. Simon of Rensselaer said that about \n     400 foreign companies had recently set up research centers in \n     China, with General Electric, for instance, doing important \n     work there on medical scanners, which means fewer skilled \n     jobs in America.\n        Ross Armbrecht, president of the Industrial Research \n     Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that represents \n     large American companies, said businesses were going to China \n     not just because of low costs but to take advantage of \n     China's growing scientific excellence.\n        ``It's frightening,'' Dr. Armbrecht said. ``But you've got \n     to go where the horses are.'' An eventual danger, he added, \n     is the slow loss of intellectual property as local \n     professionals start their own businesses with what they have \n     learned from American companies.\n        For the United States, future trends look challenging, \n     many analysts say.\n        In a report last month, the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science said the Bush administration, to live \n     up to its pledge to halve the nation's budget deficit in the \n     next five years, would cut research financing at 21 of 24 \n     Federal agencies--all those that do or finance science except \n     those involved in space and national and domestic security.\n        More troubling to some experts is the likelihood of an \n     accelerating loss of quality scientists. Applications from \n     foreign graduate students to research universities are down \n     by a quarter, experts say, partly because of the Federal \n     government's tightening of visas after the 2001 terrorist \n     attacks.\n        Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science, told the recent forum \n     audience that the drop in foreign students, the apparently \n     declining interest of young Americans in science careers and \n     the aging of the technical work force were, taken together, a \n     perilous combination of developments.\n        ``Who,'' she asked, ``will do the science of this \n     millennium?''\n        Several private groups, including the Council on \n     Competitiveness, an organization\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\n     in Washington that seeks policies to promote industrial \n     vigor, have begun to agitate for wide debate and action.\n        ``Many other countries have realized that science and \n     technology are key to economic growth and prosperity,'' said \n     Jennifer Bond, the council's vice president for international \n     affairs. ``They're catching up to us,'' she said, warning \n     Americans not to ``rest on our laurels.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Remarks of Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle to the American \n               Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n       Thank you, Dr. [Shirley] Jackson, for that warm \n     introduction, and for the tremendous work you are doing. Few \n     people alive today can claim to have done as much to advance \n     both the cause, and the frontiers of science.\n       It is a great honor for me to address such a distinguished \n     group of scientists and thinkers. Since my childhood, I've \n     been fascinated with science, perhaps because I knew my \n     father had hoped to become a geologist before World War II \n     called. But any child of South Dakota grows up with an \n     appreciation for the impact science has on our lives. Whether \n     it's the work of agricultural geneticists improving crop \n     yields, or simply paleontologists explaining the fossils of \n     Rapid City's Dinosaur Park, science has a special place in \n     South Dakota. I chose a different path than a life of \n     science, but I've always been mindful of John Adam's letter \n     to his wife, Abigail, in which he wrote, ``I must study \n     politics and war [so] that my sons may have liberty to study \n     mathematics and philosophy.'' Sooner or later, every elected \n     official needs to come up with a justification for the \n     demands of public office to their husband or wife. I wish I \n     could come up with something as good as John Adams.\n       Whatever Adams motivation was for the comment, I share his \n     understanding of the relationship between politics and \n     science. Elected officials have an obligation to maintain our \n     nation's prosperity and peace, not merely for their own sake, \n     but because they provide our citizens the liberty to pursue \n     the higher callings of the mind. History best remembers not \n     the civilizations that have done the most to expand their \n     borders, but those civilizations that have done the most to \n     expand the boundaries of human understanding. These are the \n     accomplishments that resonate through the centuries, and it \n     is the work of America's scientists that will serve as our \n     testimony to history.\n       For all the grandeur of intellectual pursuits, America's \n     interest in scientific progress has a pragmatic urgency as \n     well. Today, your discoveries matter more to our every day \n     life than at any other point in human history. Biotechnology \n     and genetics, not to mention the steady progress of medical \n     science and nanotechnology, are extending and improving our \n     lives. The physics of computer science is sparking new \n     industries that employ millions of Americans and enhance the \n     productivity and well-being of countless more.. On the \n     battlefield and in the laboratory, the war on terrorism is \n     being waged, not just with soldiers, but with software armed \n     with artificial intelligence algorithms. America's health, \n     prosperity, and security are tied to your success. And as a \n     result, our obligation to ensure you have the freedom and \n     resources necessary to advance your work is more pressing \n     than ever before.\n       This tension between science for the sake of human \n     understanding, and science for the sake of human well-being \n     has marked our history since its first days. Even de \n     Tocqueville thought democracies were ill-equipped to support \n     pure scientific research. The more democratic a society, he \n     wrote ``the more will discoveries immediately applicable to \n     productive industry confer gain, fame, and even power on \n     their authors.''\n       But our Founding Fathers had different ideas. Many, most \n     notably Jefferson and Franklin, considered themselves men of \n     science and the government they designed their most daring \n     and novel invention. Jefferson once wrote to a friend, ``We \n     have spent the prime of our lives procuring the precious \n     blessing of liberty. Let [young men] spend theirs in shewing \n     that it is the great parent of science and of virtue.'' So \n     vital was this idea to the American experiment, that the very \n     first coin minted in our country bore the motto, Liberty, \n     Parent of Science and Industry.\n       When Jefferson sent Merriwether Lewis across the continent \n     to map the land that held our nation's future, he understood \n     the expedition would have two results. It would serve \n     practical purposes such as easing the westward expansion of \n     the nation and creating new trade relationships with the \n     Indian populations. At the same time, the expedition captured \n     Jefferson's scientific heart. In fact, his first choice to \n     lead the expedition was a French botanist. Jefferson changed \n     his mind, and after offering Lewis an education in botany, \n     geology, geography, and the finer points of navigation, he \n     gave the Lewis a broad and simple directive: explore. The \n     information Lewis and his men brought back represented \n     immense steps forward for American sciences from anthropology \n     to zoology and many in between.\n       In many ways, Jefferson's leadership and the Lewis & Clark \n     expedition established the model for government's partnership \n     with science. And in the 200 years since, government support \n     for scientific research had helped invent the telegraph, \n     split the atom, conquer space, create the Internet, map the \n     human genome, and much more. No nation has ever made such an \n     enduring and significant investment in science, and no \n     nation's scientists have done as much to demystify our world \n     and better the quality of life on earth.\n       In the years before World War II, America became the \n     adopted home of a generation of scientists fleeing fascism in \n     Europe. Never was the importance of a free society to science \n     more clear. The physicist Emilio Sergre was among those who \n     came to America, emigrating in 1938, and eventually working \n     on the Manhattan Project. ``America,'' he wrote at the time, \n     `` looks like the land of the future.''\n       America has always been the land of the future. Throughout \n     our history, we have maintained a remarkable devotion to the \n     simple idea that our children's lives should be better, \n     safer, and richer than our own. This simple idea that we \n     call the American dream has been made real because of the \n     myriad contributions of Americans scientists.\n       Today, we stand at a pivotal moment. For all our past \n     successes, there are disturbing signs that America's dominant \n     position in the scientific world is being shaken. According \n     to a recent study, America's rate of scientific discovery is \n     lagging behind that of European countries. The number of \n     scientific papers published by American researchers declined \n     last year, and has been flat for the past several years. In \n     contrast, every country in Europe has increased its rate of \n     discovery. In the last two decades of the 20th century, \n     France, Germany, and the United Kingdom doubled their \n     production of doctorates in science and engineering. Japan \n     doubled its production of science and engineering doctorates \n     in just one of those decades. If this stagnation is allowed \n     to continue, it will have profound implications for every \n     aspect of American society. If we are to remain the land of \n     the future, we must reaffirm the partnership that created \n     America's dominant position within the world of science.\n       Regrettably, rather than strengthening this partnership, I \n     fear that the Bush Administration has allowed it to erode in \n     two critical ways. First, the Administration is abdicating \n     its responsibility to provide scientists with the funding \n     cutting-edge research demands. As you know, the federal \n     government has seen its R investments steadily decline as a \n     share of the U.S. economy, bringing the federal investment \n     down to levels not seen since the mid-60s. Public-sector \n     investments in advanced research have declined sharply, \n     relative to our economic growth rate, and barely kept pace \n     with inflation. This year, federal funding for research is \n     set to increase 4.7 percent. However, the entire increase \n     would go to the Department of Defense and Homeland Security \n     for the development of weapons systems and counterterrorism \n     technology. Make no mistake, these are necessary investments \n     that will make our nation safer. But the remaining federal \n     R budget that supports research into health, environmental, \n     biological, and other sciences, will all see funding reduced.\n       In my home state of South Dakota, for instance, the Earth \n     Research Observation System is facing the possibility of deep \n     cuts in staff due to cuts to their budget. Their work helps \n     us become more responsible stewards of the environment, while \n     increasing the yields of farmers all over the world. And yet, \n     this work is endangered due to draconian budget cuts.\n       But the administration's disregard for science extends \n     beyond budgetary choices. Just last month, the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists released a report charging the White \n     House with systematically working against the spirit of \n     objective science. The report states that the Bush \n     Administration has suppressed or distorted the scientific \n     analyses offered federal agencies to bring these results in \n     line with administration policy. Time and time again, the \n     Administration is choosing politics over real science.\n       Consider the administration's response to global warming. \n     Even though the scientific community is united on the fact \n     that fossil fuel production and consumption has contributed \n     to global warming, the White House deleted that finding from \n     its 2001 report on Global Warming, and in its place inserted \n     a reference to an opposing study that was financed by the \n     American Petroleum Institute.\n       In addition, when the administration has had the \n     opportunity, it has stacked the deck by staffing research \n     boards and advisory councils with under-qualified researchers \n     who have shown allegiance to the White House's political \n     goals. Just recently, the President dismissed two advisers \n     from his Council on Bioethics because they were outspoken \n     proponents of research on human embryos.\n       This is not real science. This is vending machine science. \n     The administration thinks it can pull a lever and get the \n     results it wants at no cost. But the costs are extraordinary. \n     If history shows anything, it's that a bet against science is \n     a bet you cannot win. For the sake of short-term political \n     posturing, the White House is putting the long-term security, \n     health, and prosperity of our nation at risk.\n       Just as importantly, America's reputation as a home for \n     cutting edge science is being diminished. I am hearing from \n     more and more friends in the science community that they are \n     concerned about the support and reception their work will \n     receive in the years to come. They worry that the \n     administration's failure to provide intellectual leadership \n     will erode the high standing American\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n     science has achieved since WWII. And I fear their \n     apprehension is well justified.\n       But we should be honest with ourselves. Outside the \n     scientific community, there is no hue and cry for more \n     government funding of R There is no widespread public \n     outrage when the administration disregards the unequivocal \n     judgment of the scientific community. And it's unlikely that \n     the science gap growing between the United States and other \n     developed nations will become a major issue in the upcoming \n     Presidential campaign.\n       This represents a failure on our part. We have not done \n     enough to show the American people the connection between the \n     work underway in your laboratories and the problems that \n     affect their lives. This must change. The stakes simply could \n     not be higher. What future challenge will we fail to meet \n     because America's scientists were not given the tools they \n     need to discover new answers to old questions? When rumors of \n     a Nazi bomb program reached President Roosevelt, he said \n     simply, ``Whatever the enemy may be planning, American \n     science will be equal to the challenge.'' Will future \n     presidents be able to speak with such confidence?\n       The challenge to the American scientific community is to \n     rebuild the link not only between science and government, but \n     between science and society. I believe we can do so, if we \n     return to the model established by Thomas Jefferson. There is \n     an implicit ongoing debate within the government regarding \n     what kind of research is most important to support. Some \n     suggest that we should put no limits on the kind of research \n     we support and have faith that advances in theoretical \n     science, regardless of the field, will inevitably translate \n     into practical applications that improve human life.\n       For others, that approach is too abstract. There are real \n     problems, and to spend taxpayer dollars on anything but the \n     most pragmatic search for solutions seems high-minded, but \n     naive. There is merit to each approach. Both kinds of \n     research are critical.\n       But Jefferson offered a third way, and, I believe, the \n     right way to make the best use of government's resources, and \n     gain the full support of the American People for the efforts \n     of science. Merriwether Lewis's expedition represented a \n     basic attempt to enlarge the scope of America's understanding \n     of the world around it. It was the stuff of doctoral \n     dissertations. At the same time, because the mission was \n     targeted at the urgent needs of an expanding nation, the \n     voyage captured the support of Washington and the imagination \n     of our young country.\n       America saw another tremendous example of this in recent \n     years in the Human Genome Project. The effort pooled the \n     combined wisdom of biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, \n     mathematics, and computer science, tapped the strengths and \n     insights of the public and private sectors, brought together \n     1,000 researchers from six different nations to reveal all 3 \n     billion letters of the human genetic code. Few endeavors have \n     brought together such diverse disciplines for a single and \n     pure pursuit of scientific knowledge. The discoveries of the \n     Human Genome Project have created extraordinary promise in \n     the field of medicine, and brought to life an industry that \n     could lead the American economy for a generation to come.\n       It has been nearly four years since the human Genome \n     Project concluded its primary objective. If the science \n     policy of this Administration has failed in any way, it has \n     failed here: it has yet to point the way to the next great \n     frontier of human understanding. It has yet to call \n     scientists from every discipline to a single mission of \n     public service.\n       Today, we need to rally once again around common goals, and \n     put the broad interests of the nation ahead of the narrow \n     boundaries of scientific disciplines. Surely there is no \n     shortage of challenges. Should we not set our nation's \n     physicists, chemists engineers, and geologists to the task of \n     freeing our nation from the need to import oil? Can we create \n     the scientific and technological foundations for affordable, \n     carbon-free energy sources? Can we ``level the playing \n     field'' for American researchers that lack the resources of \n     our nation's wealthiest universities? Is it beyond our \n     imagination to address the major challenges of developing \n     countries--such as cures and vaccines for AIDS, TB and \n     malaria? In addition to the obvious moral and ethical \n     imperative to do so, the economic and foreign policy benefits \n     from harnessing our scientific and technical talent to foster \n     sustainable development would be profound.\n       Let me suggest one final goal that could occupy the best \n     efforts of scientists from every discipline for a generation \n     to come. Now that we have surveyed the map of human life, let \n     us turn our attention to that which makes human life unique: \n     the mind. What challenge would be beyond our reach if we \n     truly understood how we learn, remember, think and \n     communicate? What could we accomplish if our education policy \n     was bolstered with a new understanding of how children learn? \n     How much safer could our neighborhoods be, if neurophysiology \n     solves the puzzle of addiction? What industry would not be \n     strengthened by a more complete picture of the workings of \n     the mind? There is perhaps no field in which major advances \n     would have more profound effects for human progress and \n     health than that of neuroscience. If the American scientific \n     community could come together and communicate to the nation \n     the kaleidoscopic possibilities that could result if we \n     unlocked the secrets of the mind, we could not only achieve \n     untold advances in science, we could open a new chapter in \n     the story of America's support for science.\n       Investments in science and technology are the ultimate act \n     of hope, and will create among the most important legacies we \n     can leave. America is still, as Emilio Segre said decades \n     ago, the land of the future. We have held that honor since \n     this continent was discovered by a daring act of science more \n     than 500 years ago. We have earned it anew with each passing \n     generation because America's scientists and public officials \n     have understood the importance of applying the power of \n     American curiosity to most intractable American challenges.\n       The hallmark of American science is not that we have been \n     able to overcome each new frontier. The hallmark of American \n     science is that having conquered one, we impatiently seek out \n     new, more distant and difficult frontiers. America will be \n     able to call ourselves the land of the future so long as we \n     dream that the future holds a better life for ourselves, and \n     so long as those of us who, in Adam's words, study politics, \n     continue to invest in your ability to make that dream real.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4732-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak to the legislation we are \ngoing to be taking up when we go back to S. 1637, called the Jumpstart \nOur Business Strength Act, which will attempt to modify the law \nrelative to how we treat manufacturing firms in tax policy to comply \nwith rulings of the World Trade Organization and related legislation.\n  There is an amendment pending that will be offered by Senator Harkin \nthat relates to final regulations issued last week by the Department of \nLabor. I would like to speak to why we should quickly dispense with \nthat Harkin amendment to move on with the S. 1637 and not get bogged \ndown in the regulations that were issued by the Department of Labor.\n  The regulations issued a final rule to update the previous \nregulations that implemented the Fair Labor Standards Act. That act \nimplements rules guaranteeing overtime pay for certain nonwhite collar \nworkers--in other words, when somebody works longer than the period \nthey would ordinarily be required to work, what circumstances the \nemployer is required to then pay overtime pay for that additional work. \nThe rules the Department of Labor has had in effect have not been \nmodified for over a quarter of a century. The salary levels to which \nthese regulations apply have not been changed since 1975. The duties \ntest has actually not changed since 1949. That is the test that tries \nto define whether a worker is a white collar worker who would be exempt \nfrom this requirement or a blue collar worker who would be guaranteed \novertime if they worked longer than they are supposed to. What this has \ndone is to leave employers with very obsolete job \nclassifications, things such as straw boss and leg man, other titles \nfor work that have not been performed for years. That needed to be \nfixed.\n\n  The Department of Labor had been struggling to try to bring it up to \ndate and get final rules into place, which now has been done. A lot of \nthe concerns expressed by supporters of the Harkin amendment are based \non interpretations or misreadings of the previously proposed rule. But \na lot of that has now been cleared up in the final rule made effective \nlast week. Much of the criticism should fall by the wayside.\n  Let me describe what the final rule does. It would guarantee overtime \nbenefits to 1.3 million low-wage workers who before were not entitled \nto overtime pay. Under this rule, 6.7 million new employees must be \npaid overtime regardless of their duties. That is 1.3 million more than \nis currently the case. It would raise the minimum salary level at which \nworkers are ensured overtime pay from $155 to $455 a week or $23,660 \nannually. That is the largest increase since the law was enacted in \n1938. Under the previous regulations, individuals earning the minimum \nwage, which would be about $10,700 a year, were not guaranteed \novertime.\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nThey must be classified by their employers as nonexempt in order to \nreceive overtime. The previous regulations guaranteed only employees \nearning less than $8,000 a year a nonexempt status--in other words, \nguaranteed minimum wage. This regulation updates all of that.\n  The work the Department of Labor has done is going to help a lot of \nAmericans. Over 6.7 million Americans will now be guaranteed this \novertime pay and a lot more than that will probably get it, depending \nupon exactly what kind of work they perform. Under the new regulations, \nemployees who earn more than $100,000 annually would be exempted, but \nhere again, even they would only be exempted if they regularly and \ncustomarily perform executive, administrative, or professional duties. \nEven somebody with earnings over $100,000 a year could get overtime \npay. The Department of Labor estimates only about 107,000 employees who \nearn $100,000 or more could be reclassified as white collar employees \nand potentially lose their overtime pay. Those who earn between $23,660 \nand $100,000 will remain eligible for overtime pay if they meet the so-\ncalled ``short test,'' which determines whether they are exempted white \ncollar employees or not.\n  Let me respond to some of the misinterpretations. There was a view \nthat a lot of folks would not be guaranteed pay. The new rules \nexplicitly define certain groups as being guaranteed pay. For example, \nfirst responders, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, emergency \nmedical technicians, and similar public safety officers are entitled \novertime pay.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement from the \nFraternal Order of Police relating to these regulations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Final DOL Regulations Protect and Expand Overtime for America's First \n                               Responders\n\n\n   F.O.P. Efforts Crucial to Protection of Overtime for Public Safety\n\n       Today National President Chuck Canterbury hailed the \n     release of the Department of Labor's (DOL) final regulations \n     on the exemptions from overtime under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA) as an ``unprecedented victory'' for \n     America's first responders. The regulations, which were first \n     proposed in March 2003, highlight the F.O.P.'s singular and \n     significant contribution to protecting the future of overtime \n     compensation for State and local police officers, \n     firefighters and EMTs.\n       ``The Fraternal Order of Police is extremely grateful for \n     the work of Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao and Wage & Hour \n     Administrator Tammy McCutchen to take into consideration and \n     incorporate the views of the F.O.P. in developing their final \n     regulations,'' Canterbury said. ``Since the beginning, the \n     F.O.P. was alone in its confidence in this Administration's \n     commitment to our nation's first responders, and their \n     intention to resolve this issue to the benefit of these vital \n     public servants.''\n       On the preamble to the final regulations, the Department of \n     Labor acknowledged that it was responding specifically to the \n     views of the Fraternal Order of Police ``about the impact of \n     the proposed regulations on police officers, firefighters, \n     paramedics, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and other \n     first responders.'' DOL went on the note that the current \n     regulations do not explicitly address the exempt status of \n     these employees, and ``this silence . . . has resulted in \n     significant federal court litigation to determine whether \n     such employees meet the requirements for exemption.''\n       The final Part 541 regulations make several important \n     changes for public safety employees. for the first time ever, \n     the regulations clarify that neither the regulations \n     contained in 29 CFR nor the Section 13(a)(1) exemptions apply \n     to police officers, firefighters, EMTs and other first \n     responders who perform public safety work. The regulations go \n     on to clarify why these employees, regardless of their rank \n     or pay level, cannot be classified as executive, \n     administrative or professional employees, and thus be \n     exempted from receiving overtime pay. In addition, the \n     Department acknowledges that the right to overtime \n     compensation may be extended to some public safety employees \n     who are currently classified as exempt because of changes to \n     the regulations.\n       ``Where others were content to ask the Department to say in \n     its final rule only that `no expansion of law enforcement \n     exemptions is included in or intended by the new rules,' the \n     Fraternal Order of Police said `today's public safety work is \n     more unique than ever before, and the final regulations must \n     account for the challenges faced by our nation's first \n     responders in the post-9/11 environment,' '' Canterbury said. \n     ``The final regulations achieve that goal.''\n       On 31 March 2003, the Department of Labor published a \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register to \n     revise and update the exemptions from overtime under the FLSA \n     for executive, administrative, and professional employees; \n     also known as the Part 541 or ``white collar'' exemptions. \n     Immediately, the clarion call spread across the nation \n     that the Department was trying to take away the right to \n     overtime pay for hundreds of thousands of police officers, \n     firefighters and EMTs.\n        During the public comment period, the F.O.P. worked with \n     the International Association of Firefighters (AFL-CIO) to \n     seek clarification of the Department's intent with respect to \n     the overtime eligibility of public safety employees--an issue \n     which was not explicitly addressed in the proposed rule. In \n     late June, the F.O.P. submitted its formal written comments \n     to the Department. It was the first organization to weigh in \n     on behalf of America's law enforcement community regarding \n     the proposed changes, and advised DOL about the potential \n     impact of the proposal on public safety employees.\n        ``We were never concerned that DOL was trying to destroy \n     the ability of police officers and others to earn overtime \n     compensation, despite the rhetoric employed by other groups \n     and some legislators to vilify and demonize Secretary Chao,'' \n     Canterbury said. ``Rather, we believed it was important to \n     point out that the regulations as proposed did not \n     sufficiently recognize the increased workloads and hazards \n     faced by public safety employees since the heinous terrorist \n     attacks of September 11, 2001, and to use that as the basis \n     for our efforts.''\n        Canterbury explained that while the F.O.P. faced strident \n     and often vitriolic opposition from other organizations who \n     viewed this as a fight to maintain the status quo, the F.O.P. \n     never considered this to be a viable solution because of the \n     number of public safety officers currently classified as \n     exempt under the existing regulations. Instead, the F.O.P. \n     viewed the proposal as a unique opportunity to correct the \n     application of the overtime provisions of the FLSA to public \n     safety officers.\n        ``These final regulations show that this Administration \n     and this Department of Labor are responsive to the concerns \n     of rank and file first responders,'' Canterbury said. ``There \n     has been too much posturing and rumor mongering on this issue \n     by the leadership of other police organizations, who have \n     seemed intent on sacrificing their members' paychecks on the \n     altar of partisan politics. I hope that those who have been \n     so employed over the course of the past year can see the \n     folly of their ways, and that we can all recognize this for \n     what it truly is: an unprecedented victory for police \n     officers and their families.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. The Fraternal Order of Police is one of the groups very \ninterested in this issue. It is the largest organization of sworn law \nenforcement officers, and obviously they are in support of the first \nresponders being exempt from the nonguarantee--in other words, being \nguaranteed overtime pay.\n  Another group is nurses. The licensed practical nurses and other \nsimilar health care employees will be entitled to overtime pay under \nthe new regulations. Originally unions had asserted to the contrary, \nbut that is not the case. With respect to registered nurses, they are \nalready exempted professionals under current law. The new rule will not \nchange that. Explicitly blue collar workers are identified as entitled \nto overtime pay.\n  There was a question about cooks. They are entitled to overtime pay. \nThe only people in that group that might not be are college degree \nchefs who have degrees in culinary arts, who supervise others in work \nthey do. Paralegals will be entitled to overtime pay. Public sector \ninspectors, people such as building inspectors, will be entitled to \novertime pay. Union courts, collective bargaining agreements in States \nwill not be affected by the rule. This is another area that has been \ngrossly misrepresented.\n  The bottom line is this final rule will bring clarity. It defines \nspecific categories of people who will be guaranteed pay and, \ntherefore, shuts down a lot of the litigation that has been based on \nthe fact that the law has not been explicit or very clear. The \nconfusing and outdated current or previous regulation has been a gold \nmine for trial lawyers, and there are a lot of articles that have \nrecently been published that point out some of the abuses. The number \nof lawsuits in this area has doubled since the 1990s. Class action \nlawsuits have tripled since 1997. The number of these suits has \nactually surpassed the EEOC class action lawsuits in number.\n  While the trial lawyers have made out very well off of the confusion \nof the previous regulations, the plaintiff's benefit is significantly \nsmaller. For example, in a recent Oregon lawsuit, which the Presiding \nOfficer will be interested in, fast food restaurant workers each \nreceived $1,300, while the trial lawyers received $1.5 million. In a \nsimilar California case, workers got $2,800\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nwhile the trial lawyers were awarded almost $4 million.\n\n  Let me conclude by making a point that part of the confusion is due \nto objections by the AFL-CIO. Even before the final rule was made \npublic, they were criticizing it, producing TV advertisements, \nmisrepresenting the effect of the new rule. This is especially \ndistressing given the fact--I know this personally from the Secretary \nof Labor, who had spent untold numbers of hours working on this--it was \ntheir intention to try to take in all of the criticisms and comments \nand blend them into a rule that made sense for workers. She did this, \nand then to have it attacked before it is finalized, with \nmisrepresentations, is very unfair.\n  Prior to drafting a rule, the Department of Labor held over 40 \nstakeholder meetings with 50 different interested groups, including 16 \ndifferent unions, and invited 80 groups to participate in these so-\ncalled stakeholder meetings. It was not as if this were done without \nthe input of people clearly interested in it.\n  The amendment that is in order when we take up the bill is the Harkin \namendment. It is unclear precisely what the wording of the amendment \nwill be, but obviously the intent is to preclude the regulations from \nfully taking effect.\n  I urge my colleagues, after they review that language, to quickly \ndispose of the amendment so we can move on to the important business of \npassing the underlying JOBS bill. As we know, the only group of \nemployees that is not going to be guaranteed overtime under the new \nregulations is those making over $100,000 or more. The theory there is \nthey are in a position to negotiate their own salary.\n  Just to conclude, if this new rule is not allowed to go into effect, \nthe biggest winners under the new rule, which are the low-income \nworkers, will be the biggest losers. We need to put this into effect, \nclear up the confusion, and create the specific categories that are \nguaranteed overtime pay or these people are going to lose. The police, \nthe firefighters, the lower income people, the blue collar workers are \nnot going to be assured overtime pay. Remember, it only previously \nwould guarantee anybody with $8,000 or less the overtime pay they \nshould be entitled to.\n  The effect of the Harkin amendment will be to hurt workers, not to \nhelp them. It is my hope that, again, we can quickly dispense with the \nHarkin amendment, defeat that amendment, support the regulations, the \nnew rules that have been adopted by the Department of Labor, let them \ngo into effect, and see how they work; in the meantime, move on with S. \n1637, the underlying legislation, the purpose of which is to finally \nget our manufacturing industry back on even par with our competitors, \nparticularly in the European market. That is legislation we have to \npass because of the tariffs that are being imposed each month until we \ncomply with the ruling of the WTO.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, that is an interesting segue \ninto what I wanted to talk about, the polarized nature today of the \nSenate.\n  At times, this Senate has become so partisan, and increasingly so \nnow, that it is in gridlock. There seems to be a playing out of \n``gotcha'' politics that has poisoned the atmosphere in Washington, DC, \nso that it is hard to get the people's business done.\n  When I had the privilege of coming 4 years ago to the Senate, I had \nread the histories of the great leaders of this body and the \nextraordinary consensus and bipartisanship, that they would reach out \nand bring people together in order to form a consensus that could help \nthe Nation govern itself. We find we have exactly the opposite \nhappening in the Senate.\n  At the same time, what we find happening--under the Constitution, the \nseparation of powers are a check and a balance against each other. That \nis beginning to erode. Instead, what we see is the power, instead of \nbeing equally divided and balanced between the judicial, the \nlegislative, and the executive branches, we find in the executive \nbranch almost an attitude that the legislative branch should become an \nappendage of what the executive branch wants. If that trend continues, \nthe Constitution is not going to work as it was intended to work.\n  We find in the histories of this great body, when we have read about \nthose great leaders, even within our lifetime--Everett Dirksen, Lyndon \nJohnson, Mike Mansfield, and Bob Dole--they reached out and built \nbipartisan consensus. They were partisan when they needed to be, and \nyet they knew the way this body operates. One cannot break a filibuster \nexcept by 60 votes now; it used to be two- thirds. We have to build \nconsensus, and we have to build it from the political center by \nreaching out and bringing people together.\n  The sharpness of this poisoned atmosphere of excessive partisanship \nand excessive ideological rigidity has made it very difficult for this \nGovernment to function. As a matter of fact, we read the articles \nrecently in major periodicals where it seems ideology is lining up in \none party or another, almost as if that is the decision point, the \nchoice, for America to make.\n  But America has always yearned for another way and that was using the \nbest of our democratic principles through the cross currents of ideas, \nthrough the intercourse of discussion, through the heat of debate, for \nideas and consensus to emerge upon which to govern this wonderful, \nbroad, beautiful, powerful, and very diverse country. Until we do that, \nwe are going to continue to have a problem of gridlock.\n  There is something I can do about it by the way I conduct myself \nindividually, day in and day out--when I make mistakes, own up to those \nmistakes and apologize to the people who would be offended by those \nmistakes in the interest of comity and consensus building. That is how \nthis Senator has tried to conduct himself, failed as I may be.\n  That is how I will try to continue to conduct myself and hope I am \njoined by other Senators in that--through the way you conduct yourself, \nreaching out in the spirit of comity and personal friendship, and with \na sight set on what is good for the Nation. Partisanship prevents us \nfrom building consensus in order to run this wonderful country we are \nprivileged to serve and represent.\n  Mr. President, that is what has been on my heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4734-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4734-S4735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE GAO MISSILE DEFENSE REPORT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came to the floor to discuss \na topic we will be taking up in the Senate Armed Services Committee \nlater this week as we start to grapple with the authorization bill for \nthe Defense Department--the question of missile defense.\n  This topic is timely for a number of reasons. First of all, the \nadministration plans to deploy a ``rudimentary'' missile defense system \nthis September, despite the fact it has not been proven to work. The \nArmed Services Committee begins consideration of this DOD fiscal year \n2005 budget request, and the Pentagon has requested $10 billion for \nmissile defense systems in 2005,\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nso it is timely to talk about it right now.\n  Also, it is timely to talk about this issue because the General \nAccounting Office has released a report exhaustively reviewing major \nmissile defense programs--with interesting and useful findings, if we \nwill listen to those findings.\n  Let's look at that GAO report. The report made some very telling \nobservations. Among them was that the missile defense to be deployed in \nSeptember simply will not be proven yet, because it hasn't been tested \nagainst realistic targets. The GAO recommends that realistic \noperational tests should be conducted on the missile defense system, \nwhich many of us have been saying. How in the world can you deploy \nsomething that has not been developed and tested?\n  The GAO recommends we establish clear and firm missile defense goals. \nI don't see how we can operate and manage a complex, expensive program \nlike this without goals. The report also took a hard, unbiased look at \nwhat progress was being made on these missile defense programs. The GAO \nspent close to a year doing research going beyond the rhetoric to \nunderstand what was going on scientifically and fiscally among these \ncomplex programs.\n  What did the GAO find? Well, they found some major problems, problems \nthat should concern all of us who support a true working missile \ndefense for our homeland. I want to repeat that--problems that concern \nthose of us who truly support a working missile defense program for our \nhomeland.\n  The GAO found, for example, the prime contractors for 2 of the \nmissile defense programs had cost overruns totaling almost $400 million \nduring fiscal year 2003 alone.\n  The GAO found the first increment of missile defense to be deployed \nin September is going to cost a billion dollars more than the Pentagon \nthought it would cost a year ago. That is a billion dollars of cost \ngrowth in a single year. I want this program to be successful, and I \nalso want it to be fiscally responsible.\n  The GAO also found the airborne laser program is more than a year \nbehind schedule and projected to go over budget between a half billion \ndollars and a billion dollars. Let's look at that airborne laser \nprogram for a moment. It is a fascinating technology, using a laser \ncannon mounted on a 747 aircraft to shoot down missiles while they are \nrising in the boost phase of an ICBM flight.\n  In March 2003, only a year ago, during the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee hearing on missile defense, I asked the Lieutenant General \nKadish, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, about the airborne \nlaser. He told me it was going to be working within a year. Well, we \nknow now--not from him, but from the GAO report--that at the time of \nthe hearing last year, the airborne laser program was already \nsignificantly behind schedule and had more than $100 million in cost \noverruns a year ago when I asked the question in the Armed Services \nCommittee. But they didn't tell us that.\n  According to the GAO, just about everything that can go wrong with \nthis program has gone wrong. General Kadish did not tell us that a year \nago. The report says:\n\n       Numerous and continuing issues have caused the [program] to \nslip, including supply, quality, and technical problems.\n\n  I continue the quote:\n\n       For example, specialized valves have been recalled twice, \n     laser fluid management software has been delayed due to \n     inadequate definition of requirements, and improperly cleaned \n     plumbing and material issues have required over 3,000 hours \n     of unplanned work. In addition, delays in hardware delivery \n     occurred in almost every month of fiscal year 2003.\n\n  Why didn't they tell us that last year? It is, again, symptomatic of \nthe executive branch not deferring to the proper balance of powers as \nenvisioned by the Constitution. Instead, they are asking the \nlegislative branch to do its bidding. This has to stop for the sake of \nthe balance of powers of this country.\n  Even as these problems were occurring with the airborne laser, more \nmoney was pouring into the program. The Missile Defense Agency spent \nabout a billion dollars on the airborne laser in 2002 and 2003, and the \nadministration has asked for another half billion dollars in fiscal \nyear 2005 for this same program.\n  The Pentagon has not been forthcoming with this sort of information. \nIf it weren't for this GAO report, it is not likely the Congress would \nunderstand how serious the problems are with this airborne laser \nprogram. I wish it were not so, because wouldn't it be good for America \nif we suddenly had an airborne laser that could shoot down an ascending \nrocket heading for an American target?\n  The airborne laser program is not the only surprise in the GAO \nreport. The report reveals computer programs needed for Navy ships to \nwork with the administration's missile defense system won't be tested \nadequately prior to the planned September deployment of the system. \nSince these ships are needed to protect Hawaii from a missile launch, \nHawaii is now unprotected. That same report reveals major delays with \nthe administration's missile defense plans. It says:\n\n       Flight tests leading up to the [deployment] have slipped \n     [over] 10 months, largely as a consequence of delays in \n     [missile defense] interceptor development and delivery. \n     Accordingly, the test schedule leading up to the September \n     [deployment] has been severely compressed, limiting [the] \n     opportunity to characterize [the system's] performance prior \n     to the initial fielding.\n\n  The report goes on:\n\n       The production and delivery of all 20 interceptors by the \n     end of [December 2005] is uncertain--contractors have not \n     demonstrated that they can meet the increased production \n     rate.\n\n  Given the reality of the technical problems, the schedule delays, and \nthe lack of operational testing, can we justify to the American people \nspending hundreds of millions of dollars in 2005 to continue to buy \nmore missile defense interceptors than we already have?\n  I want them to be successful. Let's make sure what we have is going \nto, in fact, work because the GAO report reveals many of the \nadministration's missile defense programs are in serious trouble with \nmajor cost overruns, schedule delays, and inadequate testing. Even to \nthe most enthusiastic supporters of missile defense among us, it should \nbe clear that technology is not proving itself as fast as we had hoped. \nGiven the fact a missile attack against the U.S. is probably lower on \nthe list in terms of probability than other attacks, and given what is \ngoing on right now in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think it is \nclear we need to look carefully and objectively at this missile defense \nbudget and see if we should not spend some of this money on making sure \nwe get it right through the development and testing, and some of that \nmoney for our soldiers and marines in battle right now so they can \nfight and win.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I have three topics I wish to speak \nabout today. The first is about Marvin Runyon. Marvin Runyon is a man \nknown to almost all Tennesseans. He died last night. He had a \nremarkable career.\n  Marvin Runyon and his Nissan team brought the automobile industry to \nTennessee, creating jobs and better lives for tens of thousands of \nfamilies. They built from scratch the largest and most efficient car \nand truck plant in North America.\n  For an encore, Marvin Runyon became chairman of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and stabilized TVA rates. And for a double encore, he became \nthe Postmaster General of the United States, and in the year he left, \nif I am not mistaken, the Post Office made a profit. It is rare that \nour country has produced a better chief executive officer. I am certain \nTennessee has\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\nnever produced a better one. He has three wonderful stories all after \n50 years of age.\n  Prior to that, Mr. Runyon was a senior executive at Ford Motor \nCompany. It was in 1980, in my second year as Governor, when Nissan \nhired that team of Ford executives. They came to Tennessee, a State \nthat was not building any cars or trucks, only had a few thousand, I \nwould say, automobile supplier jobs.\n  Today, Tennessee is the third or fourth largest producer of cars and \ntrucks. One-third of our manufacturing jobs are automotive. There are \nseveral reasons for that development, but it would not have happened if \nMarvin Runyon and his Nissan team had not chosen to come to Tennessee \nin 1980.\n  My wife and I and our family have lost a dear friend, Tennesseans \nhave lost a friend, and I wanted to pay tribute to a man who literally \nchanged the lives of tens of thousands of families for the better by \nhis work in bringing the automobile industry to Tennessee and \nstabilizing the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4736-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FAMOUS MUSIC CORP/HORNBUCKLE MUSIC\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to talk about songwriters. Italy \nhas its art, and California and Oregon have fine wine, Hollywood has \nmovies, Dalton, GA, has carpets, and Nashville has songwriters.\n  There are a great many beautiful songs that come from Nashville--\npoems--but I want to especially commend to my colleagues a new song \ncalled ``Letters from Home.'' You may hear John Michael Montgomery sing \nit. It is a poem that touches the heart of Americans at this time. It \nis especially meaningful with the men and women of our military in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and all over the world fighting for freedom.\n  This is a story about their loved ones awaiting their coming home. \nThe last stanza goes like this:\n\n     I hold it up and show my buddies\n     Like we ain't scared an' our boots ain't muddy\n     But no one laughs 'cause there's\n     Ain't nothin' funny when a'\n     Soldier cries.\n     So I just wipe my eyes\n     Fold it up and put it in my shirt\n     Pick up my gun and get back to work\n     And it keeps drivin' on, waitin' on letters from home.\n\n  That song was written by Tony Lane and David Lee. I saw them a couple \nweeks ago at Belmont University in Nashville. Belmont celebrated the \nintroduction of a course on ``Poetics in Country Music,'' to explore \nliterary criticism of song lyrics as we do for other poetry. I salute \nBelmont University for its leadership.\n  When Johnny Cash died, the New York Times streamed a headline: ``Poet \nof the Working Poor.'' Bob Dylan once said Hank Williams was America's \ngreatest poet. I said on the Senate floor, if that is true, why don't \nwe have English professors somewhere criticizing their poetry? They are \nall up in Northeastern schools writing good criticism of mediocre poems \nwhile we have poets of the working poor and some of the best poets in \nNashville writing poems.\n  ``Letters from Home'' is yet another great poem from Nashville \nsongwriters and one more example of why Belmont University's pioneering \nwork to discuss ``Poetics of the Working Poor'' is a good idea.\n  There might be more in common between Shakespeare's sonnets and Hank \nWilliams stanzas than one at first might imagine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4736-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4736-S4737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CALCULATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT RATE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to discuss with my colleagues \nsomething of a mystery. I have yet to be able to find an answer to this \nmystery. I am hoping by addressing it on the Senate floor and by \nletters I am sending today to Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, their research might help me figure this out.\n  I asked Chairman Greenspan at our hearing on April 21 of the Joint \nEconomic Committee about the 6 million people, more or less, who are \nliving and working in the United States who our Government is not \ncounting when it makes our monthly projections about who is working and \nwho is unemployed.\n  Here is what I base that question on: There is a consensus there are \n8 to 10 million undocumented aliens or illegal immigrants in the United \nStates today. For example, the Urban Institute estimate says 8 million, \nand the Center for Immigration Studies says 10 million. The Urban \nInstitute estimates perhaps 6 million or more of those undocumented \npersons have a job in the United States. I do not think there is much \ndebate about the fact there are 6 million people living in the United \nStates, more or less, who are illegally here who are also working.\n  My guess is our Government is not counting most of these 6 million \nundocumented aliens when we announce each month the number of Americans \nwho have jobs. It was 138 million for March and the number who are \nunemployed, 5.7 percent of the workforce, or 8.4 million people in \nMarch.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which makes these announcements each \nmonth, gathers their estimates in two different ways. The first is the \nso-called payroll survey of 400,000 business establishments. Since it \nis a violation of Federal criminal laws for a company to employ an \nundocumented alien, I think it is wrong to assume most or even many of \nthe 6 million illegal immigrants who are working here are reported by \nthe payroll survey. Nor do I believe these 6 million illegal immigrants \nare likely to be included in the other principal data-gathering \nmechanism of the survey, which we call the household survey.\n\n  This is a survey of more than 60,000 persons living in the United \nStates which basically asked in many different ways, do you have a job? \nNow, this must include a lot of people the payroll service does not, \npeople such as farmers, people working at home, independent \ncontractors, and I suspect a lot of people who are here illegally.\n  I also believe that it paints a much clearer picture of employment in \nthe United States than the payroll survey. Common sense suggests to me \nthat the household survey also does not include many undocumented \naliens. If one is an illegal immigrant and they receive a phone call \nfrom the Government asking questions, they are not likely to give many \nanswers, I would not think, especially if the phone call is not in \ntheir native language.\n  So I see no basis to assume these 6 million workers--my guess is in \nmost cases hard workers but undocumented aliens--are being counted or \nthat they are being equally uncounted by the two surveys, which is what \nMr. Greenspan suggested might be the case. Our failure to find some way \nto consider the implications of having what I would judge to be so many \nundocumented aliens working has a great many policy implications.\n  Now I am not trying in these remarks to solve the great issues of \nimmigration, whether we should have it, how much we should have, what \nwe should do. That is another debate. I am just trying to understand \nwho is here. If 6 million are here and working, are we counting them? \nIt would be helpful to know the answer to that question, to know \nwhether we are understating the number of people living in America who \nare employed and stating the rate of people in America who are \nunemployed.\n  This is one of the principal debates in our presidential campaign: It \nis the economy, stupid. It is jobs. Well, how do these 6 million \nuncounted workers affect the information we put out each month upon \nwhich we make all of these debates? Also, if we have 8.4 million \nunemployed, according to our official statistics, and if 6 million \nillegal immigrants are working, are these 6 million taking jobs that \nthe 8.4 million want? Also, if these 6 million were not here, would we \nsuddenly have virtually full employment?\n  Another point might be, if these 6 million were not here and the 8.4 \nmillion still remained unemployed, or many of them did, that certainly \nwould tell us something about whether we need more or less unemployment \ninsurance, more or fewer training programs, or more or fewer lessons in \nEnglish. Or if the 6 million illegal workers are actually employed, \nthat would tell us something about the effectiveness of our immigration \nlaws and would help us make more accurate estimates of the \ncontributions these workers might\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nmake to the Social Security and Medicare systems.\n  So if we are going to rely on these monthly estimates from the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, my point is, if one is going to say to us we have \n138 million people at work in the United States, what about the 6 \nmillion who are here who probably are not counted, who are illegally \nhere? They are real people. They are working in real jobs. What about \nthem? Or if we are talking about the 8.4 million people who are \nunemployed in the United States, what is the effect of having 6 million \nillegal people on that rate of unemployment? It is information I think \nwe ought to know.\n  At the end of his answer to my question, Mr. Greenspan said that \nhaving better information about the number of undocumented aliens \nliving and working in the United States is a subject that has \n``bedeviled statisticians.''\n  I believe it is also a problem we ought to try harder to figure out \nthe answer to. In fact, I believe it is inexcusable that we would base \nso much of our public debate about unemployment on surveys that likely \nexclude several million employed workers in the United States, many of \nthem doing jobs that most Americans consider to be valuable jobs.\n  This failure to report accurate information may be leading us into a \nnumber of erroneous, ineffective, and expensive policy decisions. I \nhave asked Mr. Greenspan and his excellent staff and I have asked the \nBureau of Labor Statistics if they could examine this question in-depth \nand give me and perhaps other Members of the Joint Economic Committee, \nif Chairman Bennett finds the subject interesting, an opportunity to \ntalk with them about their conclusion.\n  It seems odd that we would continue to base so much of our national \ndebate upon information that may be flawed, and if it is not flawed, \nthen we need someone with reasonable authority to say that each month \nwe are counting the 5, 6 or 7 million people who have jobs in the \nUnited States and who are illegally here so that this cannot be an \nissue. If they cannot say that, then we need to work harder to find out \nthe answer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Chairman Alan \nGreenspan be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2004.\n      Hon. Alan Greenspan,\n      Chairman, Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System, \n         Washington, DC.\n        Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing to follow up on your \n     answer to my question about illegal immigration and \n     calculation of the employment rate during your testimony \n     before the Joint Economic Committee on April 21.\n        My concern is that there may be up to 6 million people \n     living and working in the United States who our government is \n     not counting when it makes our regular projections about who \n     is working and who is unemployed.\n        There is a consensus that there are 8 to 10 million \n     undocumented aliens or illegal immigrants in the United \n     States today. For example, estimates from the Urban Institute \n     and the Center for Immigration Studies, based on data from \n     the Current Population Survey, are 8 million and 10 million \n     respectively. The Urban Institute estimates that 6 million or \n     more undocumented persons have a job in the United States.\n        You indicated in your comments to my question that you \n     believe our government's job-counting surveys take these \n     illegal workers into account, or at least, they do a fairly \n     equal job of NOT taking them into account.\n        My guess is that the government is not counting most of \n     these 6 million illegal workers when we announce each month \n     the number of Americans who have jobs (138,298,000 for March, \n     seasonally adjusted) and the number who are unemployed (5.7 \n     percent of the workforce or 8.4 million people in March, \n     seasonally adjusted).\n        The Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers data for these \n     estimates in two main ways. The principal way is through the \n     Current Employment Statistics Program, or so-called payroll \n     survey of payroll records from 400,000 business \n     establishments. Since it is a violation of Federal criminal \n     laws for a company to employ an undocumented alien, I think \n     it is wrong to assume that most or even many of the 6 million \n     illegal immigrants who are working for established businesses \n     are reported by the payroll survey. These illegal immigrants \n     may be self-employed, agricultural workers, contractors, or \n     in some other kind of work that is not in any event covered \n     by the payroll survey.\n        Nor do I believe that most of the 6 million illegal \n     immigrants are likely to be included in the other principal \n     data-gathering mechanism of the bureau, the Current \n     Population Survey, commonly known as the household survey. \n     This is a telephone survey of more than 60,000 persons living \n     in the United States that basically asks in many different \n     ways, ``Do you have a job?'' The household survey must \n     include a great many persons that the payroll survey does \n     not--such as farmers, people working at home, and independent \n     contractors--which is one reason why it paints a larger \n     picture of employment in the United States than the payroll \n     survey. But common sense suggests to me that the household \n     survey does not include many illegal immigrants. If you are \n     an illegal immigrant and you receive a phone call from the \n     government asking questions, you are not likely to give many \n     answers--especially if the phone call is not in your native \n     language.\n        So I see no basis to assume that these 6 million \n     undocumented aliens are being counted--or that they are being \n     equally uncounted--by the two surveys.\n       Our failure to find some way to consider the implications \n     of having so many undocumented aliens working has a great \n     many policy implications:\n       Knowing the answer would help us know if we are \n     understating the number of people living in America who are \n     employed and overstating the rate of unemployment.\n       If we have 8.4 million unemployed and 6 million illegal \n     immigrants working, are those 6 million taking jobs that the \n     other 8.4 million want?\n       If the 6 million all went home, would we have virtually \n     full employment?\n       If the 6 million all went home and the 8.4 million still \n     remained unemployed, that certainly would tell us something \n     about whether we needed more or less unemployment insurance, \n     or more or fewer training programs, or more or fewer lessons \n     in English.\n       If the 6 million illegal workers are actually employed, \n     that would tell us something about the effectiveness of our \n     immigration laws--and it would help us make more accurate \n     estimates of contributions these workers might make to the \n     Social Security and Medicare systems.\n       You said at the end of your answer to my question that \n     having better information about the number of undocumented \n     aliens living and working in the United States is a subject \n     that has ``bedeviled'' statisticians. If is also a problem we \n     ought to try harder to figure out.\n       In fact, I believe it is inexcusable that we would base so \n     much of our public debate about employment on surveys that \n     likely exclude several million employed workers in the United \n     States. It may be leading us into a number of erroneous and \n     expensive policy decisions.\n       I would be very grateful if you could examine this question \n     in depth and give me an opportunity to talk with you about \n     your conclusions. I am also making the same request of the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Very best wishes,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1637, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1637) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to comply with World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/\n     ETI benefit in a manner that preserves jobs and production \n     activities in the United States, to reform and simplify the \n     international taxation rules of the United States, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin amendment No. 2881, to amend the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 to clarify provisions relating to \n     overtime pay.\n       Frist Motion to Recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance, with instructions to report back forthwith with the \n     following amendment:\n       Frist amendment No. 3011 (to the instructions of the Motion \n     to Recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Frist amendment No. 3012 (to the instructions (amendment \n     No. 3011) of the Motion to Recommit the bill to the Committee \n     on Finance), relative to the effective date following \n     enactment of the Act.\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\n       Frist amendment No. 3013 (to amendment No. 3012), relative \n     to the effective date following enactment of the Act.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad we are back on the jobs and \nmanufacturing act. This will be the third time we have attempted to \nmove this bill. President Reagan had a very famous quip: Here we go \nagain.\n  Here we go again, hopefully to conclusion of this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  I hope things are going to be different. This time the European Union \nsanctions are very firmly in place. There should not be any doubt in \nthe mind of any Member where Europe is headed. In the process of the \nEuropean tax on our exports to that continent, they are freezing out of \ntheir markets U.S. companies.\n  This time there is an agreement on the political message amendments \nthat will be addressed on this bill even though those amendments have \nnothing to do with the measures contained in the bill. This time we \nwill finally reveal with absolute clarity whether some on the other \nside of the aisle are ready to drop the political posturing and pass \nthis bipartisan bill to remove European Union sanctions against our \nfarmers and manufacturing workers.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post was an article saying that Senate \npartisanship was the worst in memory. It spoke about the long list of \nlegislation stalled in the Senate, stalled in the Senate because of \npolitical posturing. The article mentioned the bill that is before us \ntoday, this jobs and manufacturing bill. The paper said:\n\n       Foreign tariffs have been imposed on many American products \n     while the Senate dawdled over [today's bill]--to substitute \n     corporate tax cuts for subsidies that have been outlawed by \n     the World Trade Organization.\n\n  Dawdled? That is no compliment, obviously. It is, unfortunately, an \naccurate description of what opponents to passing the JOBS bill have \nachieved during the last 2 or 3 months. It is an accusation that all of \nus will hear back home if we continue to allow the European Union to \nsanction our agriculture, timber, and manufacturing exports.\n  I will have more to say about sanctions later, but I want to remind \npeople who might say, Why do you have to worry about the European \nUnion? They don't have any business doing that; we ought to be able to \nexport our products to Europe; that America has also imposed some \nretribution against European products coming to this country because \nEurope decided not to abide by the agreement on beef hormones. They \ndon't let our meat in. We won the case before the WTO, so we put duties \non their products coming here.\n  We lose a case before the World Trade Organization--and, by the way, \nwe win more than we lose by a long sight. But regardless, Europe is \ndoing what they can legally do under our international trade \nagreements. We all understand these international trade agreements have \nmoved us in the right direction, the direction of lowering barriers to \nour products in other countries so we can export because we are an \nexporting nation and because exports create jobs and because those jobs \npay 15 percent above the national average of jobs. It creates jobs and \nit creates good jobs.\n  You don't have to dispute the 50-year history of the advantage of \ninternational trade agreements to the United States when other \ncountries have higher barriers to trade than we do, and we bring those \nbarriers down. We have a process for settling our differences. That is \ncalled the World Trade Organization dispute settlement process. \nThis bill is before the U.S. Senate because we are changing our laws to \nbe within our international trade agreements, agreements this Senate \nhas already adopted. We have already voted on these international trade \nagreements, so now we have to live up to them in the same way we expect \nEurope to live up to those agreements when we win a dispute with \nEurope. That is why we are here. Only this legislation is going to go a \nlot further than just to make our laws comply with European laws; we \nare also going to do other things to our tax laws to encourage \nmanufacturing in America, to create more jobs in America.\n\n  This legislation has been held up, as the Washington Post said, while \nthe Senate dawdled. That was over partisan politics. There is no excuse \nfor allowing partisan politics to hold this bill up because this bill \nwas reported out of the Senate Finance Committee with only two \ndissenting votes, and those two dissenting votes were not Democrat \nvotes, those were Republican votes. The two Republicans who voted \nagainst it have a different philosophy on what we should do with this \nbill, and they are going to be offering an amendment. But I don't think \nthey are trying to kill this bill, even if they disagree with it. They \nare not standing in the way of passing the JOBS bill just because they \ndon't like exactly what it says.\n  That is the difference here. Senators do, in fact, have a right to \ntheir own opinions on this bill and are free to file amendments to \nchange it. That is exactly what they ought to be doing if they are \nrepresenting the people of their State. But that is a far cry from \ntrying to delay this measure just to score points on completely \nunrelated political issues that come before us in the form of \nnongermane amendments.\n  This is a bipartisan bill that reflects everyone's concerns, both \nRepublicans and Democrats. This is a bill that is going to pass 90 to \n10 when we get to finality. But you don't play political games with a \nbipartisan bill that affects jobs of manufacturing workers all across \nthis vast land.\n  I think it is worth looking at the history of this bill. The jobs in \nmanufacturing act is a bipartisan bill from the ground up. The \nframework was laid by my colleague and friend, Senator Baucus, when he \nwas chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in the last Congress. It \nbegan with a hearing in July 2002 to address the controversy within the \nWorld Trade Organization and our tax laws. We heard from a cross \nsection of industry that would be damaged by the repeal of the \nExtraterritorial Income Act. We also heard from U.S. companies that \nwere clamoring for international tax reform because our tax rules were \nhurting competitiveness in foreign trade. Their foreign competitors \nwere running circles around them because of our arcane and probably \noutmoded international tax rules.\n  During this hearing we had, for instance, Senator Bob Graham of \nFlorida and Senator Hatch of Utah express concerns about how our own \ninternational tax laws were impairing the competitiveness of the U.S. \ncompanies. That is almost 2 years ago.\n  After some discussion on forming a blue ribbon commission to study \nthis issue, we all decided that decisive action was more important than \na commission. During that hearing, Chairman Baucus formed an \ninternational tax working group that was joined by Senators Graham, \nHatch, and me, and was opened to any other Finance Committee Senator \nwho was interested in participating. The bipartisan Finance Committee \nworking group developed a framework that forms a basis for the bill \nthat has been before this Senate now, off and on, over the last 3 \nmonths. We directed our staff 2 years ago to engage in an exhaustive \nanalysis of many international reform proposals that have been offered. \nWe sought to glean the very best ideas from as many sources as \npossible.\n  Chairman Baucus and I formed a bipartisan bicameral working group \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee in \nan effort to find some common ground in dealing with the repeal of the \nForeign Sales Corporation Extraterritorial Income Act that was ruled \ncontrary to our international trade agreements. While that effort with \nWays and Means did not go so well, it did inspire Chairman Baucus and \nme to continue our Senate bipartisan development of the repeal of this \nlegislation and also to bring about international tax reform.\n  We continued our efforts in cooperation with Senator Hatch, Senator \nBob Graham, and others on the Finance Committee who wanted to do what \nwas fair and what was right in complying with the World Trade \nOrganization ruling.\n  We continued our bipartisan efforts when I became chairman again \nafter the 2002 election.\n  In July 2003, we held two hearings on the FSC/ETI and international \nreform issue. One hearing focused on the effects of our tax policy on \nbusiness competition within the United States, and the other hearing \nfocused on international business competition. These\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\ntwo hearings led to this bipartisan bill that has been before the \nSenate for the last 3 months.\n  Let me again emphasize that there is not one provision in this JOBS \nbill that was not agreed to by both Republicans and Democrats--not one. \nWe have acted in good faith to produce a bill that protects American \nmanufacturing jobs and also ensures our companies remain the global \ncompetitors we ought to want to be, are, and we ought to continue to \nbe. We did this in a fully bipartisan manner, which is what the \nAmerican people expect us to do on such an important issue as \nmanufacturing jobs and our Nation's economic health.\n  The core part of this bill repeals the current FSC/ETI provisions \nthat are now in our tax law. FSC/ETI reduces the income tax on goods \nmanufactured in the United States and exported overseas by as much as 3 \nto 8 rate points. That is, if the corporation tax rate is 35 percent, \nthe tax rate on export income is going to be somewhere between 27 to 32 \ninstead of the 35 percent it is right now. It lowered the U.S. \ncorporate rate on goods made in the United States and sold overseas.\n  The World Trade Organization has determined that FSC/ETI is an \nimpermissible export subsidy and has authorized the European Union to \nimpose a $4 billion a year tax against U.S. exports until we get rid of \nthe FSC/ETI legislation that has been on the books for about 3 decades.\n  We have sanctions put on us by Europe. They began on March 1 with 5 \npercent right off the bat, increasing 1 percent a month. You have \nMarch, 1 percent; April, 1 more percent; and May, 1 more percent. This \nis a 7-percent Euro tax on American exports. It is a very serious \nthreat for all members because sanctions are hitting commodity \nproducts, agricultural goods, timber, and paper.\n  Presently, about 89 percent of Foreign Sales Corporation export \nbenefits go to the manufacturing sector. Repealing this legislation \nraises around $55 billion over 10 years. If that money is not sent back \nto the manufacturing sector, that means an additional $55 billion cost \nto manufacturing. It is mathematically impossible for it to be anything \nelse.\n  That is why our bipartisan jobs in manufacturing bill takes all $55 \nbillion of the FSC/ETI repeal money and sends it back to the \nmanufacturing sector in the form of a 3-point tax rate cut on \nmanufacturing income. This rate cut is for manufacturing in the United \nStates, it is not for manufacturing offshore. We start phasing in those \ncuts this year if the Senate passes this jobs in manufacturing bill \nthis year. The cuts apply to sole proprietors, partnerships, farmers, \nindividuals, family businesses, multinational corporations, and foreign \ncompanies that set up manufacturing plants in this country. In total, \nthis bill provides $75 billion of tax relief to our U.S.-\nbased manufacturing sector to promote factory hiring here in the United \nStates.\n\n  We also include in this legislation international tax reforms, mostly \nin the foreign tax credit area and most of which benefit the \nmanufacturing sector. The international tax reforms largely fix \nproblems which our domestic companies face because of the complexity of \nthe foreign tax credit. These reforms are necessary if we are to level \nthe playing field for U.S. companies that compete with our trading \npartners.\n  You will hear arguments this week that the international tax reforms \nprovide an incentive to move jobs offshore. I am going to show you \nlater how adamantly I disagree with that argument. We have carefully \nselected on a bipartisan basis the international reforms that do not \nprovide offshore incentives.\n  Our bill also includes a Homeland Reinvestment Act which will \ntemporarily reduce tax on foreign earnings that are brought into the \nUnited States for investment here at home instead of leaving that money \noverseas to create jobs overseas. This provision is sponsored by \nSenator Ensign, Senator Boxer, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Smith \nfrom Oregon. It has broad support in the House and Senate.\n  The JOBS bill will extend the R tax credit through the end of 2005. \nThis is a domestic tax benefit that generates research and development \nhere in the United States. That translates into good, high-paying jobs \nfor workers here in America and not jobs overseas.\n  The legislation before us extends for 2 years many tax provisions \nthat expired in December of last year or, if they didn't expire then, \nwill expire during this calendar year. These items include the work \nopportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit. The JOBS \nbill will make the merger of those credits permanent.\n  We include a provision that allows Naval shipbuilders to use a method \nof accounting which results in more favorable income tax treatment.\n  There are enhanced depreciation provisions to help the airline \nindustry.\n  There are new homestead provisions. These are rural development \nprovisions to create businesses in counties that are losing population. \nFor example, they would provide incentives for starting or expanding a \nrural business in a rural high-outmigration county, something that \nwould benefit States such as mine in the Midwest where rural counties \nare losing population--not even maintaining but losing.\n  The jobs in manufacturing underlying bill also includes the new \nmarkets tax credit for high-outmigration counties. These credits help \neconomic development in rural counties that lost over 10 percent of \ntheir population.\n  The bill includes brownfields revitalization provisions which help \ntax-exempt investors that invest in cleanup and remediation of \nqualified brownfield sites.\n  The bill includes a mortgage revenue bonds measure which repeals the \ncurrent rule that doesn't allow mortgage revenue bond payments to be \nused for issuing new mortgages. There are 70 Senate cosponsors of this \nmortgage revenue bond bill. It is included because it has broad support \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  We allow deductions for private mortgage insurance.\n  The JOBS bill includes a tax credit to employers for wages paid to \nreservists if they are called to active duty.\n  We have extended and enhanced the Liberty Zone Bonds used in the \nrebuilding of Lower Manhattan. We also include $200 million in tax \ncredits to be used for rail infrastructure projects in the New York \nLiberty Zone.\n  The bill contains renewal communities provisions. We increase small \nbusiness industrial development bond levels to spur economic \ndevelopment in rural areas. We have bonds for rebuilding school \ninfrastructure. We have included tribal bonds in the JOBS bill which \nallow the same rules that apply to tax-exempt bonds for State and local \nGovernments to also apply to our constitutional relationship with \nNative American tribes so they are treated like States and other \npolitical subdivisions.\n\n  We have tribal school bonds. Under current law there is no class of \nbonds designated for the purpose of encouraging school construction on \nIndian reservations as we have for our States and local communities.\n  There is a new tribal markets tax credit which would add $50 million \na year for economic development on reservation lands.\n  We have included the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act.\n  The JOBS bill contains a change in section 815. The provision \nsuspends application of the rules imposing income tax on certain \ndistribution to shareholders from the policyholders' surplus account of \na life insurance company.\n  We have a special dividend allocation rule that benefits farm co-ops. \nOther farm provisions give cattlemen tax-free treatment if they replace \nlivestock because of drought, flood, or other weather-related \nconditions over which that farmer has no control.\n  We include a provision that allows payments under the National Health \nService Corporation Loan Repayment Program to be exempt from tax to \nhelp get health care providers into rural America.\n  We included the passenger rail infrastructure tax credits that \nprovide $500 million for inner-city passenger rail capital projects. We \nalso included so-called short-line railroads.\n  We have many other improvements in this bill. One I bring up deals \nwith the stalled Energy bill before the Senate. We have included in \nthis bill, because gasoline is so high, because this country needs a \nnational energy policy and because the Finance Committee Senator Baucus \nand I lead has so much\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nto do with tax credits for incentives for the production of fossil \nfuel, conservation and for alternative sources of energy--those all \nneed to be done now that we have gas over $2 a gallon. We need a \nnational energy policy.\n  We are taking advantage of this legislation being in the Senate, \nworking with Senator Domenici to include provisions in the Energy bill \nthat have previously been approved by the Finance Committee, but which \ndid not go to the President because of the filibuster in this body \nagainst that overall Energy bill. It is essentially the exact bill \noriginally cosponsored at the beginning of this Congress by this \nSenator and Senators Baucus, Domenici, and Bingaman. It is the first \ntime the chairman and ranking member of both committees of \njurisdiction, Finance and Energy, have crafted a bipartisan bill that \nwould serve as a national energy policy that represents the business of \nthe American people and the sort of cooperation by which things get \ndone around here. Too bad it is not done more often.\n  The energy provisions are balanced in all segments of our energy \nneeds, and we have expanded all provisions for renewable electricity to \ninclude wind and biomass, to promote conservation of energy and \nalternative cars and fuels. It does not abandon our tried-and-true \nenergy performers like traditional oil and gas production and the \nnewer, cleaner coal provisions for electricity.\n  The best aspect of the entire package is the energy part of this jobs \nand manufacturing bill creates jobs all by itself.\n  The volumetric ethanol excise tax credit provisions, known as the \nVEETC, in this package would add up to $14.2 billion in revenue to the \nhighway trust fund over the 6-year life of the transportation bill \npending before the Congress. This provision alone creates as many as \n674,000 new jobs across our country.\n  The energy tax package also includes a new incentive for the \nproduction of renewable biodiesel. This provision means jobs in the \nheartland. Renewable fuels have directly generated over 150,000 new \njobs. In fact, in this year alone, this industry will add 22,000 new \njobs.\n  Another provision creates a tax incentive for the production of super \nenergy-efficient appliances which is critical to the 95,000 employees \nin the U.S. home appliance industry.\n  The bill also includes a provision to accelerate the production of \nnatural gas from Alaska and the construction of a pipeline for natural \ngas from Alaska to the lower 48. According to the Department of Labor, \nBureau of Economic Analysis, construction of the Alaska natural gas \npipeline would create nearly 400,000 jobs in construction, trucking, \nmanufacturing, and other service sectors.\n  The jobs and manufacturing bill provides all this tax relief, nearly \n$170 billion worth, and remains revenue neutral, meaning there is no \nnet cost to the Federal Treasury. That cannot be, one would think--$170 \nbillion of tax changes; and we have not affected the income coming into \nthe Federal Treasury by one dime. That is pretty significant for people \nworried about the budget deficit. People ask: We have a budget deficit; \nhow can you reduce the corporation tax and create jobs? How can you \ngive all these tax incentives to bring about alternative energy and \nconservation and have a national energy policy, without costing a lot \nof money?\n  There are a lot of unfair things in the Tax Code and we take care of \nthose unfair things. Basically, there are some corporations playing \ngames with the Tax Code to avoid taxation. We are going to plug those \nloopholes.\n  This bill is paid in full by extending custom user fees, shutting \ndown abusive tax shelters, and attacking the abusive tax strategies \nused by companies such as Enron--strategies we unearthed during our \nFinance Committee Enron investigation last October. The Finance \nCommittee held hearings on the status of abusive tax shelter activity. \nDuring that hearing, we received anonymous testimony from a leasing \nindustry executive describing how U.S. corporations are able to take \ntax deductions for the Paris sewer lines and the New York subway \nsystem. Did you hear me right? American corporations are taking tax \ndeductions for Paris sewer lines and the New York subway system. They \nare claiming tax deductions on taxpayer-funded infrastructure located \nnot only in the United States but overseas.\n  One can imagine the surprise of the members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee upon learning the U.S. taxpayer is subsidizing the cost of \nelectric transmission lines in the Australian Outback.\n  This jobs in manufacturing bill is revenue neutral because we end \nthis abuse of the Tax Code. It was shortly after the attack on \nSeptember 11, 2001 we saw the beginning exodus of U.S. companies moving \ntheir corporate headquarters to tax havens for the sole purpose of \nevading U.S. taxes. It was the events of September 11 and the ensuing \nstock market plunge that provided companies with a cost-efficient way \nto get out of the United States, to cheat on their taxes.\n  You may recall the videotape of a Big Four accounting firm partner \nsaying U.S. companies were resistant to this scheme out of a post-9/11 \nsense of patriotism and national duty. But that employee said \npatriotism would have to take a backseat when they see their improved \nearnings per share.\n  Now here you have 3,000 Americans killed on September 11 when the \nterrorists attacked our country. Then you have these big accounting \nfirms marketing these tax shelters--that maybe would raise some \nquestion about the new patriotic fervor in this country because we have \nbeen attacked--telling people: You are going to forget all about that \nwhen you see your new earnings report. Corporations like that ought to \nget their heart into America or get their rear end out because what \nthis country is all about is pulling together, particularly now in time \nof war.\n  The JOBS bill includes measures to shut down corporate expatriation \nand to limit the tax benefits for those corporate cheats that manage to \nget out under the wire before Congress can enact this legislation. We \nwill shut down that abuse in this bill. All we have to do to do these \nobvious things is to convince a few people who are stalling this bill \nwith nongermane amendments that this bill needs to get passed.\n  There is so much good in this bill. We can rescue the manufacturing \nsector. We can end this European tax on our exports to Europe and \ncontinue to sell over there. Pretty soon that market is going to be \nshut down.\n  We can respond to the recent rise in gas prices because in this bill \nwe have a national energy policy for alternative fuels and conservation \nand for stimulating fossil fuel development, and we are going to pay \nfor it all by shutting down every known tax abuse.\n  But we cannot do any of this without the support it takes to pass \nthis bill. And I do not mean final passage, because when this bill \ncomes to final passage, it is going to pass overwhelmingly. What I am \ntalking about is getting to finality. People all over this body are \ntelling me: Well, this bill is going to pass. This bill is going to \npass. But those very same people are hooking this nongermane amendment \nor that nongermane amendment on to this bill. Well, we have \naccommodated even those people with nongermane amendments.\n  I do not have any fault with the legitimacy of the subject matter of \ntheir amendments because it is legitimate debate, particularly in the \nSenate. But it seems to me we should not be gambling with manufacturing \njobs in America. We should not be gambling with whether we ought to \nhave a national energy policy.\n  And, for sure, if you are one of the Members who is complaining about \ncorporations not paying their fair share--and we are shutting down \nthese tax shelters--you ought to be in the forefront of getting this \nbill passed. It is unbelievable to me this bill has been held up for so \nlong over political gamesmanship. It is time to put the adults back in \ncharge. It is time to pass this very important bill to aid our \nmanufacturing sector, to remove tariffs off our farmers and workers on \nproducts shipped to Europe, and to place the Senate back on its footing \nto do its job and move legislation--this legislation--that will benefit \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the battle to enact this bill has \ncertainly--thankfully--not been compared to a war. But I do believe we \ncan now say this bill is at least what Prime Minister Winston Churchill \nis reputed to have said after the British victory at El Alamein, when \nhe said: ``[I]t is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''\n  Perhaps we may even say what Talleyrand said after the Russian \nvictory at Borodino, when he said: ``It is the beginning of the end.''\n  In either case, I believe by obtaining an exclusive list of \namendments--that is, Senators already agreeing to a finite list--we \nhave a victory. We may now say we can work to the end of this bill. And \nwell we should, because we still have not won the battle to create jobs \nhere in America.\n  I refer you to this chart I have in the Chamber. Yes, the economy did \nturn in one good month of job growth in March. The American economy \ncreated a net of 308,000 new jobs. But as this chart shows, one good \nmonth does not a recovery make. On this chart, the green bars are the \nmonths of job creation, and the red bars are the months of job loss. As \nthe chart shows, March was, indeed, a strong month for job growth with \nmore than 300,000 new jobs. But March was the only month in the last 4 \nyears where there was that much job growth.\n  In contrast, during the 8 years of the Clinton administration, the \neconomy turned in 25 months with more than 300,000 net new jobs per \nmonth. The economy as a whole still has a long way to go before it is \ncreating jobs at that level.\n  Anyone who has talked to people trying to get a good job knows the \njob market remains soft. In March, for example, a record 354,000 \njobless workers exhausted their regular State unemployment benefits \nwithout qualifying for any additional Federal unemployment assistance. \nTo reduce the ranks of the unemployed, the economy will need to sustain \nstrong job creation.\n  Look at the next chart. This chart shows the number of private sector \njobs in the American economy, incorporating the latest numbers. It \nshows the private sector still has 2.7 million fewer jobs than it had \nin December of the year 2000. As shown on this chart, here we are in \nDecember of 2000, and you can see that is where the private sector jobs \npeaked. The chart clearly shows the number has declined significantly \nto the current date, a loss of, I think, about 3 million jobs on a net \nbasis.\n  This next chart shows manufacturing remains in a slump. The \nmanufacturing sector has lost more than 3 million jobs since July of \n2000. I might say, I can also see this state of affairs in my home \nState of Montana. In Montana, for example, wood products companies \nprovide nearly 37 percent of our manufacturing jobs--over a third. But \na decade ago, those jobs made up 47 percent of our manufacturing. That \nis almost one-half of all manufacturing jobs. Employment in wood \nproducts dropped almost 5 percent last year alone.\n  This final chart shows the number of jobs in American manufacturing \nremains at the lowest level in more than a half a century. A half a \ncentury ago--the level shown here on the chart--was roughly 14 million \njobs, a little bit more than 14 million jobs, the same as it is today. \nJust to repeat that: The number of jobs in American manufacturing \nremains at the lowest level in more than half a century. That is a \nstrong statement. So we continue to need to act on the legislation \nbefore us.\n  More importantly, I must say, I have heard from folks in my State of \nMontana who tell the reason why we need to act on this bill. Let me \ngive you an example of some of their frustration.\n  Keni from Hamilton, MT, wrote:\n\n       All our good jobs are being sent overseas to a cheaper \n     labor market, and we're fed bovine manure . . . [about] all \n     the great jobs [our American economy is] creating.\n\n  Then there is Christopher, who was laid off in February of 2003. \nChristopher writes:\n\n       Many of those individuals [with jobs] have to do two or \n     three other people's jobs in order to keep their own.\n\n  Now listen to Kay. Kay wrote that the economy ``bring[s] no new \nbusiness[es] to speak of in[to] Montana that pay any kind of decent \nwage, keeping the poor, poor. When is it going to end?''\n  We have to end the loss of good jobs. We need to do what we can to \nhelp create good manufacturing jobs here in America. That is what this \nlegislation before us is about.\n  We have conducted a number of battles on this bill. The Senate has \nconducted four rollcall votes on this bill.\n  The Senate has adopted 11 amendments: from tax shelters, major \nprovisions to close loopholes, to the R tax credit, which is very \npopular and needed by American industry; to government jobs offshore, \ndiscouraging jobs from going offshore, to expiring provisions; that is, \nthe provisions in the Code which have expired or are about to expire \nand need to be continued; to accelerating the manufacturing tax credit, \nan amendment offered by Senator Stabenow which improved the \nmanufacturing deduction of the bill; and we added in an amendment to \nthe energy tax provisions, the tax provisions that passed the Finance \nCommittee dealing with energy production.\n  At this point we have an exclusive list of additional amendments. \nSenators have preserved their rights and listed 83 amendments on that \nlist. Fifty of those listed amendments preserve the rights of Senators \nin the majority, while 33 preserve the rights of Senators in the \nminority. Of the total of 83 amendments, Senators have listed 36 simply \nwith the word ``relevant'' or similar language. Although we might \nexpect Senators to offer some of these amendments, experience tells us \nthat an overwhelming majority of those amendments, listed merely as \n``relevant,'' will probably be dropped from the list. Of the remaining \n47 amendments, I believe Senators will modify many of them so the \nSenate may agree to them without rollcall votes.\n  Realistically, I expect that probably fewer than 20 of the amendments \non that list will require rollcall votes. Nearly all Senators from this \nside of the aisle, those with amendments on the list, have indicated to \nthis Senator that they would be willing to abide by short time \nagreements, none more than 1 hour equally divided, so this exercise \nneed not take much time.\n  We have now been on the bill, counting today, on 9 separate days over \nthe course of 4 separate weeks. I hope we can now stay on this bill \nuntil its completion. I believe the Senate can now complete the bill \nover the course of a matter of days.\n  What the preacher said in Ecclesiastes applies to this bill:\n\n       Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.\n\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to the end of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nchairman and senior ranking member on this legislation. I know they \nhave talked about it in great detail and explained it thoroughly. My \npoint is, it is time for us to move forward.\n  We have been on the bill for a frustratingly long time. We have gone \nto the bill three times. But this isn't the only one. We seem to be \nhaving the same experience with many of the interesting bills, such as \nhighway legislation, the budget, moving forward with jobs. It seems to \nme we ought to examine ourselves and see where we are in terms of doing \nthe job we were assigned to do, and that is to move forward dealing \nwith those issues that are pertinent to this country.\n  I support passage of the JOBS bill. It is interesting that at a time \nwhen we are concerned about jobs, concerned about continued economic \ngrowth, having a deficit in the trade balance, concerned about \nmanufacturing jobs, here we are with some reasons to do things that \nwould impact all those issues, and we continue not to do it. It is time \nwe come to the snubbing post and talk about what we have to do to get \nthis job done.\n  There are, of course, different views of what should be done, and I \nunderstand that. There are different ideas. The bottom line is, when \nyou have a bill and it has a purpose, that is what we ought to be \ntalking about, not about loading it up with everything that everyone \nintended at one point or another to include so that it becomes so \ncontroversial that the core values, the reason it is there, never \nhappens. That is basically where we are.\n  This is basically a bill that was brought to the committee. The \nSenators have at one time talked about\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\ngiving 3 percent encouragement for people to send goods overseas. The \nWorld Trade Organization ruled against that and said it was unfair and \nsaid, If you don't do something about it, we are going to continue to \nadd penalties to this area.\n  We are now at 7 percent. Each week it can be added to be a higher \npercentage. That is what the basic bill is about. There are lots of \nthings involving taxes and lots of things involving a million things \nyou could do. But we ought not to forget what the purpose of it is, and \nwe need to go back to that purpose and say: Wait a minute here; we need \nto get that finished.\n  It is really interesting. At some point, this is broader than that, \nbut I think we have to take a look at the role of the Federal \nGovernment and what we are doing. We ought to take a little time, and I \nam in the process of trying to find out all of the various agencies and \nactivities that are funded by this Congress. I think we would be \namazed. Every time we see a little problem, every time we see something \nhere, every time a constituent wants something, suddenly we have a \nFederal program for it. And then it is amazing we say to ourselves: \nWhere is all this money going?\n  I can tell you where it is going. We are continuing to have more and \nmore programs, and we need to take a look at putting those in some kind \nof a priority as to what the role really is of the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, I am sure it is true, many of the things here are \nstrictly political. They are simply things that a Senator wants to \nspell out his political situation by offering an amendment. Whether or \nnot it ever passes, you can go home and tell the folks: I sure worked \non that one, you know.\n\n  Well, that is not what these things are for. That is not what they \nare for. Amendments should be perfecting the base, perfecting the \npurpose for the bill. Then if we want to do all these other things, let \nthem stand on their own.\n  I happen to be a big supporter of the Energy bill. We put together a \ntotal Energy bill. Frankly, if I had my way about it, we would keep it \ntogether because we are talking about the whole. It is a policy. You \nare talking about what you do about alternative sources. You are \ntalking about what you do about conservation as to how you can use less \nenergy. You are talking about the way you substitute and do research to \ndevelop new ideas. You are talking about domestic production--all those \nthings. But when you start taking it apart, then it becomes very \ndifficult to deal with all the issues that ought to be there. \nNevertheless, this is the way it is.\n  I support it because we do need to do something. But there are an \nawful lot of issues that aren't there that ought to be in the energy \npolicy that are being left behind. It makes it less likely they will be \npassed. We have things like trade adjustment assistance to service \nworkers. That is an issue that ought to be talked about, I suppose, but \nit should not be addressed in this bill. It costs $5 billion over 10 \nyears. We have that one on there. We have overtime rules, trying to go \nback and change the rules that are put in by the administration. What \ndoes that have to do with doing something about WTO? Nothing. But it is \none of the issues that is going to hold us up.\n  This JOBS bill is designed to save hundreds of thousands of \nmanufacturing jobs, alleviate the tax burden on businesses, and allow \nmanufacturers to freely compete with their European counterparts. That \nis what it is for. As a result of a 2001 WTO ruling, which I have \nalready mentioned, the European Union initiated a phase-in of punitive \ntariffs. That is in the process right now. It started at 5, it is at 7, \nand it is going to continue. So we need to focus on that issue and do \nsomething about it.\n  The bill reported by the Finance Committee represents a strong, \nbipartisan effort to accomplish key objectives for manufacturers. It is \none that enhances the ability of U.S.-based companies to compete in an \ninternational market; provides a lower tax rate on manufacturing goods; \nmakes the tax burden of U.S. manufacturers closer to the international \ncompetition; enhances the financial strength of U.S. companies, \ncreating incentives for them to invest in workers, facilities, and \ncommunity.\n  Our manufacturing sector, of course, has faced many challenges over \nthe last number of years and will continue to. We are in a changing \neconomic situation. Interestingly enough, many manufacturers produce \nmore goods through efficiency. They actually have less workers and are \nproducing more goods than before. That indicates we have to broaden our \nkinds of manufacturing and do more in different areas.\n  We need to stay focused on this bill. I am becoming rather impatient \nwith what is happening on the Senate floor, not only on this bill but \non lots of bills where we continue to have endless numbers of these \nissues put on that do not belong there at all. We ought to come to an \nunderstanding that this is the issue that is being dealt with here. \nLet's do it. This one is important and we should do it. These \namendments need to end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3107\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3107.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify \n                  provisions relating to overtime pay)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTION OF OVERTIME PAY.\n\n       Section 13 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 213) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Notwithstanding the provisions of subchapter II of \n     chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedures Act) \n     or any other provision of law, any portion of the final rule \n     promulgated on April 23, 2004, revising part 541 of title 29, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, that exempts from the overtime \n     pay provisions of section 7 any employee who would not \n     otherwise be exempt if the regulations in effect on March 31, \n     2003 remained in effect, shall have no force or effect and \n     that portion of such regulations (as in effect on March 31, \n     2003) that would prevent such employee from being exempt \n     shall remain in effect. Notwithstanding the preceding \n     sentence, the increased salary requirements provided for in \n     such final rule at section 541.600 of such title 29, shall \n     remain in effect.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I return to the Senate floor this \nafternoon to address an issue of utmost importance to working Americans \nand their families, and that is time-and-a-half overtime pay and the \nseemingly relentless campaign by the Bush administration to take away \nthe overtime rights of many American workers. This effort to take away \ntime-and-a-half overtime, to jiggle the rules, cloud it all up, is one \nof the most anti-worker, anti-family proposals to come along in my \ntenure in the Congress.\n  As most Senators know by now, my amendment serves the simplest of \npurposes. It lets stand the new threshold of $23,660 below that which \nall workers are automatically eligible for overtime. My amendment lets \nthat part of the proposal stand. My amendment also guarantees that no \nworker who currently is eligible to receive overtime pay will lose that \nright to overtime pay under the new rule.\n  Again, my amendment does two things. It lets stand that part of the \nfinal rule that raises the threshold to $23,660. The other part of my \namendment also guarantees that no worker who is currently getting \novertime pay will lose that right under any new rule. It is very \nsimple, very straightforward.\n  Madam President, this is a subject I feel very deeply about, and I am \nnot alone. Wherever I travel in the United States and in Iowa, people \ntalk to me about what overtime pay means to them and their families. \nMany become quite emotional about it. They know what the administration \nis trying to do and they are angry. They want action to be taken to \nstop these new overtime rules.\n  One of the reasons they are angry is because they know what this \nchart shows: The average annual working hours of the American worker in \nthe\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nUnited States is more than any worker anywhere in the industrialized \nworld. It is more than in Canada, Japan, Australia, France, and \nGermany. Our average annual work hours are more than anyone, anywhere \nin the world. American workers know that because they are the ones \ndoing the work.\n  Since passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, overtime \nrights and the 40-hour work week have been sacrosanct, respected by \nPresidents of both parties. Last year, the Bush administration launched \na frontal assault on this time-honored principle. The Department of \nLabor proposes changes to the overtime rules that, according to the \nbest analysis we could muster, would have taken overtime pay \neligibility away from up to 8 million American workers. That proposal \nreally was breathtaking. The administration proposed this without \nconsulting Congress, without holding public hearings. It actually took \nseveral weeks for many of us to realize the magnitude of what the \nadministration was proposing. In fact, some of the most harmful \nprovisions of the proposed rule were not discovered until months later.\n  Finally, we were shocked to discover that the administration was \nproposing to strip overtime pay from police officers, firefighters, \nveterans, nurses, and many others. The radicalism and audacity of this \nproposal is without parallel in modern day labor legislation. Of \ncourse, once the true intent and extent of the proposed rule became \nknown, many of those affected were in open rebellion.\n  As this issue spilled over into this election year, frankly, this \nbecame a huge political liability for the administration. Late last \nyear, during consideration of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation appropriations bill, I offered a similar amendment in the \nSenate--it passed by a margin of 54-45--to block the worst aspects of \nthe administration's overtime proposal. Following that, the House of \nRepresentatives, by a margin of 221-203, voted to instruct its \nconferees to support the Senate's position in conference. \nUnfortunately, White House officials instructed the conferees to delete \nmy amendment from the Omnibus appropriations bill, and that is why we \nare back here today.\n\n  It must be pointed out that since we last debated this amendment, the \nDepartment of Labor has issued its final rule on overtime. In this \nfinal rule, the Department appears to have had something of an election \nyear conversion. Under extreme pressure from working Americans, as well \nas critics in Congress, the administration has backed off its attempt \nto strip overtime from certain high-profile groups, such as rank-and-\nfile police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians.\n  I salute the efforts of many individuals and groups and labor unions \nwho have fought hard and forced the administration to abandon several \nof its offensive and egregious proposals. Let's be under no illusion \nabout this final rule. We have progressed--if that is the right term--\nfrom a proposed rule that was profoundly terrible to a final rule that \nis just plain terrible.\n  The administration's model seems to be that if at first you don't \nsucceed in limiting the overtime pay of American workers, try, try \nagain and spin like crazy. Again, Madam President, I ask that those who \nlook at this final rule not just compare it to the proposed rule. As I \nsaid, we went from profoundly terrible to just plain terrible. So I \nsuppose if you compared the final rule with the proposed rule, you \nwould say it is better. I think the proper yardstick of measurement is \nto measure the final rule compared to what we have today. Who loses? \nWhat happens to our right to overtime in that regard?\n  Make no mistake: Even with the changes from the proposed rule, this \nfinal rule is a radical rewrite of the rules governing eligibility for \novertime. It would deny time-and-a-half overtime pay to millions of \nworkers earning as little as $23,660 per year. By and large, these are \nlow- to middle-income workers who don't have a strong organized voice, \nso the administration may feel it can run roughshod over their rights. \nThat is why we in Congress must be their voice and their vote on this \nmatter.\n  Of course, the administration denies this. Its public posture is all \nsmiles and happy talk, including the audacious claim that no workers \nearning less than $100,000 a year will lose their right to overtime. \nFrankly, at this point, the administration has zero credibility on this \nissue.\n  As I said, when the proposed rule was issued a year ago, it took \nmonths of reading the fine print before one realized how destructive it \nwas, and only belatedly do we discover that the administration was \ngiving tips and advice to employers as to how they could avoid paying \novertime to employees under the new rule.\n  Here we go again. Once again, the administration is all smiles and \nhappy talk. Once again, the administration is assuring workers they \nwill not lose their overtime rights. When the Bush administration \nsmiles and says it is here to fix overtime, I have five words of advice \nfor American workers: hold on to your wallets.\n  Why exactly is the administration so eager to ``fix'' overtime? Now I \nknow why many corporations and employer groups want to fix overtime. \nThey want to pay fewer workers overtime. It is very clear. But is \nanyone clamoring for this?\n  I frequently visit manufacturing plants, and never, ever has a \nfactory worker come up to me and said: You know, Senator Harkin, too \nmany of us are getting overtime pay. It is broken and you need to fix \nit.\n  I frequently visit hospitals. Never has a nurse come up to me and \nsaid: Senator Harkin, it is not right that I am receiving overtime pay \nwhen I work 50 hours a week. You need to go back to Washington and fix \nthis overtime mess.\n  Back home in Iowa, I love to go to Dairy Queens. It is something my \ncolleague and I share when we go back to Iowa, Dairy Queen, but no one \never, in a Dairy Queen making hamburgers or Blizzards, or a working \nsupervisor, has come up to me and said: Senator Harkin, I don't deserve \ntime and a half overtime pay. You need to fix it immediately.\n  I will go one step further. Not one employer in my State of Iowa has \ncome up to me and complained about paying overtime pay under existing \nrules. Not one.\n  Now the Department of Labor is saying to the American workers: Hi, we \nare from Washington, and we are here to improve your overtime rights.\n  Is there anybody at this point in America who believes that? Working \nfamilies are not buying it. They have a simple message for the \nDepartment of Labor: Keep your hands off our right to overtime pay.\n  Let me repeat the administration's central claim. No workers earning \nless than $100,000 a year will lose their right to overtime. This claim \nis demonstrably false.\n  This chart shows in simplest terms the impact of the new rule. It is \nclear that employees earning less than $23,660 a year, automatically \nwill be paid overtime regardless of what they do. The new rule will \nmake it very easy to exempt most workers making over $100,000. It will \nnot totally, but most will be exempt.\n  We just learned that some of the oil rig workers, for example, in \nAlaska and off the coast of Louisiana who work under hazardous \nconditions and are away from their families a lot--some of them may \nmake a little over $100,000. I guess I can't blame them. These are \nhard-working people and they are away from their families. It is a \nhazardous occupation. They, too, may be stripped of their overtime \nrights simply because they make $100,000 a year. I don't think it is \ncorrect we should do that.\n  It has come to my attention in the last few hours that oil rig \nworkers would also have their right to overtime stripped.\n  The real gray area is from $100,000 to $23,000. People in that area \nare saying people will not lose their right to overtime. A careful \nanalysis of the new rule makes it abundantly clear that certain jobs \nand professional categories in this gray area will be ineligible for \novertime.\n  To cite one glaring example, under the new rule, a worker who leads a \nteam of other workers loses his or her right to overtime. Under the old \nrule, there was no provision concerning so-called ``team leaders.'' \nThere is no such term in present rules. But the new rule, under section \n541.203(c) states:\n\n       An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to \n     complete other\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\n     projects for the employer meets the requirements for \n     exemption--\n\n  Listen to the following words--\n\n     even if the employee does not have direct supervisory \n     responsibility over the employees on the team.\n\n  Talk about a loophole. This team leader loophole is big enough to \ndrive an Amtrak train through. Team leaders are commonplace throughout \nthe manufacturing and services sectors. They are especially common in \nfactories, refineries, chemical plants, and other places. MIT professor \nof management Thomas Kochan estimates that this team leader loophole \nalone could deny overtime rights to as many as 2.3 million workers \nmaking above $23,660 a year and less than $100,000 a year--a team \nleader.\n  Again, I point out that the term ``team leader'' exists nowhere in \nthe present rules. It is now put in the final rule, ``team leader.'' \nBut guess what. There is no definition of a team leader. There is no \ndefinition. It is up to the employer to define it. So any employer can \ndefine a team leader as they wish. And that team leader, as I pointed \nout in the rule, does not have to have direct supervisory \nresponsibility over employees on the team. That team leader could be a \nteam leader for, say, 5 minutes a week. Maybe it is a Friday afternoon \nget-together to discuss what went on the week before, and all of a \nsudden you are a team leader for that 1 hour of discussion. You are not \nexempt. Your employer can now exempt you from overtime simply by \ncalling you a team leader. So in the rules there is no definitional \nstructure of what a team leader is. It is a huge loophole.\n  Section 541.303(b) strips overtime rights from nursery school \nteachers earning more than $23,660. Under section 541.604, registered \nnurses who are salaried could be denied overtime. Large parts of the \nfinancial services industry are no longer eligible for overtime under \nthe new rule.\n  According to an analysis by the Houston Chronicle, labor relations, \npublic relations, human relations, and government relations employees \nwill be ineligible for overtime under the new rule. Funeral directors \nand embalmers will be ineligible. Insurance claim adjustors will be \nineligible. Many outside sales representatives will be ineligible.\n  In addition, many computer services employees will lose their right \nto overtime, including programmers, network, and database \nadministrators.\n  I would also point out that the new rule includes loopholes and \nartful language that will strip overtime from several broad \noccupational categories. For example, the new rule will make it much \neasier for management to reclassify workers earning as little as \n$23,660 a year as professional employees. So you could be making \n$24,000 a year and your employer could reclassify you as professional, \nand you will be ineligible for overtime.\n  Employees will no longer need college degrees to be considered \nprofessionals exempt from overtime. Work experience will be enough. \nUnder the present rules that have existed for many years, it pointed \nout to get an exemption under the professional status one had to have a \n4-year degree. That was sort of the minimum. That was the minimum one \nneeded to be exempt.\n  Now a person does not need that. All they have to have is work \nexperience. For example, section 541-301(d) strips overtime rights from \ncooks and chefs who have ``substantially the same knowledge'' and \nperform the same work as cooks or chefs with 4-year culinary arts \ndegrees. In addition, the new rule will make it much easier for \nmanagement to reclassify workers earning as little as $23,660 as \nexecutive employees who will be ineligible for overtime pay. Under the \npresent rule, employees that spend the majority of their time, 50 \npercent or more, doing administrative, management, or professional work \nlose their right to overtime under the executive category. Under the \nnew rule, employees who do even a small amount of administrative, \nmanagement, or professional work can lose their overtime rights.\n  For example, a McDonald's franchise assistant manager who spends most \nof her time making hamburgers or filling orders, making french fries, \nbut spends 10 percent of her time performing supervisory duties, could \nbe reclassified as executive and be ineligible for overtime. Think \nabout that. In the past, the threshold was 50 percent. One had to spend \nat least 50 percent of one's time in an executive or an administrative \ncapacity to be exempt from overtime pay. Now there is no threshold. It \ncan be as little as 5 percent, 10 percent; nobody knows. It does not \nmake any difference. It is whatever an employer says.\n  So guess what. A person is now working at a McDonald's franchise. \nThey are making hamburgers and french fries and filling orders, which \nis pretty tough work. They move pretty fast. They are making $24,000 a \nyear. All of a sudden the owner comes in and says: You are now an \nexecutive. Do you not feel good? I am going to put a little name up \nthere, Susan Smith, executive. Now you are an executive. You feel \ngreat. There is a certificate. You are now an executive. You can hang \nthat on your wall at home. By the way, you do not get anymore overtime \npay.\n  I wonder how many American workers would feel good about that, that \nnow they are an executive but they lose their right to overtime pay.\n  I can go on at great length naming others who will be denied overtime \nunder the new rule, but I have made my point. The administration claims \nno workers earning between $23,660 and $100,000 a year will be denied \novertime. That statement is false. All of these people, veterans, \npolice, nurses--I talked about the team leaders--journalists, I have \ntalked about that, cooks, financial services, computer workers, working \nforemen, and many others, because they can be reclassified as \nexecutive, administrative, or professional, under very ambiguous and \nclouded procedures or definitions, could lose their right to overtime \npay.\n  My second chart is very revealing again as to what is going on. There \nare 152 pages in the new rule. As the chart goes, only 15 pages are \ndevoted to the highly compensated employees test, which is $100,000 or \nmore, and the minimum salary test, which is $23,660 or less. Fifteen \npages are devoted to those two categories, and 137 pages are devoted to \nthose who make between $23,660 and $100,000.\n  I have to tell my colleagues something. If the administration were \nsincere in its assertion that no worker earning between $23,660 and \n$100,000 a year would lose their overtime rights, believe me, it would \nnot take 137 pages to say so. The administration could have said it in \none or two sentences. Instead, the new rule spends 137 pages spinning a \nweb of artful language, calculated ambiguity, and outright loopholes \nsuch as the team leader loophole, a complex web designed to catch \nworkers and strip them of their overtime.\n\n  It is ironic that one of the administration's main justifications for \nproposing a new rule on overtime was to bring clarity and reduce \nlitigation. They said this is one of the reasons they are doing it, to \nbring clarity and reduce litigation.\n  This final rule is shot through with artful, ambiguous language that \nclearly favors employers. This is guaranteed to lead to scores of \nlawsuits and years of litigation as workers fight to retain their \novertime rights. If increasingly conservative courts rule in favor of \nemployers, countless additional workers will lose their right to \novertime.\n  For example, in several places, the final rule broadens what used to \nbe a narrow test. By definition, this will mean less position, less \nclarity, not more. The final rule is far from clear. As I said, who can \nbe classified as team leaders? It is not defined. The employer defines \nthat.\n  What is a working foreman? It is up to the employer to decide what is \na working foreman. Once they decide, a person is ineligible for \novertime.\n  When Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, it \nanticipated there would be a number of less than honorable employers \nwho would try to cheat workers out of overtime, so Congress included a \npenalty provision that would act as a strong deterrent. Under the \npresent rule, if an employer is cheating employees out of overtime, the \npenalty can be massive. If found guilty, all employees in the \nenterprise, including salaried employees who are exempt from overtime, \nmust be paid time and a half overtime for the period the improper \npractices were taking place. That is a tough deterrent.\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n  In other words, if an unscrupulous employer was cheating an employee \nout of overtime and they were taken to court and found guilty of doing \nthat, they did not have to pay only that employee back, they had to pay \neveryone in the enterprise time and a half overtime for the entire \nperiods in question. They even had to pay time and a half to exempt \nemployees who were exempt from overtime. As I said, a very tough \ndeterrent.\n  What does the new rule do? Under the new rule, the penalty is limited \nto the work unit where the violation was detected. This ignores the \nfact that in nearly all instances, overtime violations are not limited \nto a renegade supervisor. They are almost always a result of some \ncompanywide practice.\n  So again, if an unscrupulous employer cheats an employee out of \novertime and is caught and convicted, the company has to pay that \nemployee back, and whoever is in that little work area, maybe two or \nthree people. Before, they had to pay the entire enterprise. So we can \nsee they have really watered this down. We have gone from kind of a \nnuclear deterrent under the old rule to kind of a pussycat deterrent \nunder the new rule.\n  Let me summarize. Under the new rule, many workers will legally lose \ntheir right to overtime and employers who cheat their workers out of \novertime illegally will receive a penalty that amounts to less than a \nslap on the wrist. No wonder the Wall Street Journal has called the new \nrule a victory for business groups.\n  It is time for Washington to listen to Main Street and not just Wall \nStreet. Listen to ordinary working Americans. They are telling us \nloudly and clearly their number one issue is economic security. They \nare telling us they fear losing their jobs. They fear losing their \nhealth care. They fear losing their retirement. Now they fear losing \ntheir right to time-and-a-half compensation for overtime. They fear, \nwith good reason, that under the Department of Labor's new rule they \nwill be obliged to work 45, 50, 60 hours a week with zero additional \ncompensation. For millions of working Americans, this is unacceptable, \nand the last straw.\n\n  For 65 years, the 40-hour week has allowed workers to spend time with \ntheir families instead of toiling past dark and on weekends. At a time \nwhen the family dinner is becoming an oxymoron, this standard is more \nimportant than ever. As I said earlier, this final rule on overtime is \nanti-worker and anti-family.\n  Given the fact that we are stuck in a jobless recovery, the timing \ncould not be worse. It is yet another instance of the economic \nmalpractice of this administration. Bear in mind that time-and-a-half \npay accounts for some 25 percent of the total income of Americans who \nwork overtime. With average U.S. income declining, the proposed changes \nwould slash the paychecks of countless workers. Moreover, the proposed \nnew rule is all but guaranteed to hurt job creation in the United \nStates. This is just basic logic. If employers can more easily deny \novertime pay, they will push their current employees to work longer \nhours without compensation. Workers without overtime rights are twice \nas likely to work more than 40 hours a week, according to the current \nstatistics. They are three times as likely to work more than 50 hours a \nweek. With 9 million Americans currently out of work, why in the world \ndo we want to give employers yet another disincentive to hire new \nworkers?\n  It is bad enough to deny American workers their overtime rights, but \nwhat is striking is the approach taken by the Department of Labor and \nthe administration on this issue. As I already mentioned, no public \nhearings were held. There was no consultation with Congress. I have \nlooked back and have done research. Every time I have been able to find \nin the past when we made changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nCongress always had hearings, consulted with business, consulted with \nlabor, and there was a process by which the public believed they had an \ninput. That is not so this time.\n  Also, something I think that is beyond comprehension, the Department \nhas offered employers what amounts to a cheat sheet. It has offered \nemployers helpful tips on how to avoid paying overtime to the lowest \npaid workers. I mean these, the ones who make less than $23,600 a year, \ndown here. The administration has basically put out information. They \nsay they want to help these people. They raise it to $23,660 from about \n$8,000 a year--a good step. I compliment the administration for doing \nthis. But they turn right around and tell employers how they can get by \nwithout paying them overtime.\n  They recommend raising a worker's salary slightly to meet the \nthreshold. If you are an employee who is near this $23,660 level, they \nmight want to raise your wages to $23,661. Guess what. Then you are no \nlonger exempt.\n  They also suggest cutting a worker's hourly wage so any new overtime \npayments will not result in a net gain to the employee. Think about \nthat. You say we are going to raise the threshold. Now, here is what \nyou can do: cut the hourly wages so if you do have to pay them overtime \nit will all be the same. The employee will get the same amount of \nmoney, but the employee would be working 42, 43, 45, 48 hours a week. \nThis is from the Department of Labor. They have actually put this out \nin print. It is disgraceful.\n  There is one group that is disproportionately harmed by the new \novertime rules--women. The fact is, women tend to dominate in retail, \nservices, and sales positions, which would be particularly affected by \nthe new rule. Married women increased their working hours by nearly 40 \npercent from 1979 to 2000. As women have increased their time in the \npaid labor market, their contribution to the family income has also \nrisen. These contributions are especially important to lower and \nmiddle-income families. Yet now the administration's new rule will take \naway overtime protections from millions of American women.\n\n  Women in the paid workforce will be forced to work longer hours for \nless pay. And, of course, this means more time away from families and \nmore childcare expenses, with no additional compensation. Not \nsurprisingly, prominent women's groups are adamantly opposed to the new \novertime rules. The American Association of University Women, the \nNational Organization of Women, the National Partnership of Women and \nFamilies, the YWCA, 9 to 5, the National Association of Working Women--\namong others, are all strongly supporting my amendment.\n  Listen to what Sheila Perez of Bremerton, WA, says. She is a single \nparent working hard to support her family. When she leaves work after a \ndifficult 8-hour shift, she says:\n\n       My second shift begins. There is dinner to cook, dishes to \n     wash, laundry, and all the other housework that must be done, \n     which adds another three or four hours to my workday.\n\n  Ms. Perez said something also very powerful. She said:\n\n       My time at home with my kids and family is truly my premium \n     time . . . it is personal time. . . . it is the most valuable \n     time of my day. So if I am required to work longer than eight \n     hours . . . if I have to sacrifice that premium time with my \n     family . . . then I ought to receive premium pay, that is, \n     overtime pay.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with Sheila Perez. If she is sacrificing \npersonal time, her premium time with her family and her kids, it is \nonly fair she be compensated on a premium basis with time-and-a-half \novertime pay.\n  I think there is a broader context for this discussion of overtime. \nIt is sort of a bigger picture. As I said, the No. 1 issue for \nAmericans today is economic security, and with good reason, because it \nis abundantly clear that America is stuck in a largely jobless \nrecovery. Since the administration took office, nearly 3 million \nprivate sector jobs have been lost, including one in every seven jobs \nin manufacturing. President Bush--George W. Bush--has presided over the \ngreatest job loss of any President since the Great Depression. Yet he \nremains wedded to policies that make it worse.\n  His administration has praised the outsourcing of jobs as something \ngood for our economy. He has opposed any increase in the minimum wage. \nHe has opposed extending unemployment benefits. Now, this \nadministration wants to destroy the overtime rights of many hard-\nworking Americans.\n  There is no question, I suppose, that those policies have been good \nfor wealthy investors. Corporate profits are rising, the stock market \nis up, CEO pay is up, and once again the rich are getting richer. But \nsomething is missing. Ordinary Americans are not participating in this \nso-called recovery. In\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nfact, more and more Americans live in fear of losing their jobs, their \nhealth benefits, their retirement, and now their right to overtime pay.\n  The truth is, we cannot build a sustainable recovery by exporting \njobs, driving down wages, and making Americans work longer hours \nwithout compensation. Moreover, such a recovery is not desirable. A \ntrue recovery must include all Americans. It can only be built on a \nfoundation of good jobs with good wages in America, not overseas. It \ncan only be built on a foundation that includes a minimum wage that is \na living wage and not a poverty wage. And it can only be built on a \nfoundation that reserves Americans' rights to time-and-a-half overtime \npay over 40 hours.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to protect the \novertime rights of American workers. Again, I repeat, my amendment will \nlet stand the positive provision of the rule which raises the low-\nincome threshold to $23,660 and makes more workers automatically \neligible for overtime.\n  Now the administration again says it does not want to take away the \novertime rights of anyone earning less than $100,000. If that is the \ncase, then the administration should have no problem embracing my \namendment because this amendment has a simple purpose: to guarantee \nthat workers who are entitled to overtime pay now, today, will not lose \ntheir right under the new rule.\n  I think the new rule is disingenuous. The administration is being \ndisingenuous about it and knows full well this new rule will strip \novertime eligibility for many workers earning less than $100,000. That \nis the reason it is being pushed aggressively. That is exactly why many \ncorporations and groups are so keen to see this new rule adopted. But \nit is unfair. It is an attack on a basic right American workers have \nenjoyed for over 65 years, and it is bad economic policy. It will hurt \njob creation and reduce disposable income.\n  I want to point out a few statements from others in support of my \namendment.\n\n       The Effect of Final Rules Silence on Police Sergeants.\n\n  This is an April 28 press release from the International Union of \nPolice Associations, the National Association of Police Organizations, \nand the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations.\n\n       The DOL has done nothing to define the line between \n     management and police duties for those above line-level \n     officers. Once the final complex rules go into effect, their \n     very ambiguity regarding the line between supervisory duties \n     and traditional policing duties will undoubtedly shift the \n     ball from the legislature to the courts.\n\n  That is why they support my amendment.\n  Here is a press release from the United American Nurses.\n  The Effect of Final Rules Silence on Registered Nurses.\n\n       In the midst of a registered nursing shortage that is \n     projected to reach 808,000 RNs by 2020, it is \n     incomprehensible why this President wouldn't do everything in \n     his power to make sure that RNs are fairly compensated for \n     the life-saving work we do.\n\n  I mentioned earlier the professional loophole. This is from the code \nitself. This is the current regulation on learning professionals.\n\n       As is well known, there are still a few practitioners who \n     have gained their knowledge by home study and experience. \n     Characteristically, the members of the profession are \n     graduates of law schools, but some few of their fellow \n     professionals whose status is equal to theirs, whose \n     attainments are the same and whose word is the same did not \n     enjoy that opportunity. Such persons are not barred from the \n     exemption. The word ``customarily'' implies that in the vast \n     majority of cases, the specific academic training is a \n     prerequisite for transfer into the profession.\n\n  This is what we have been operating under for years.\n\n     . . . in the vast majority of cases, the specific academic \n     training is a prerequisite . . .\n\n  Under the proposed rule, work experience--even the experience you \nmight have gotten in the military--would disqualify you from overtime.\n  I want to make a point on this. I want to make a point on the \nveterans. When we debated this last year, we pointed out in the \nproposed rules it specifically mentioned those who were not learned \nprofessionals because they had a 4-year college degree but who had \nlearned on-the-job training, including training in the military--those \nwere the words: ``including training in the armed forces.'' We pointed \nout here on the floor this means someone going into the military and \nwho received training in the Army and came out, because they received \ntraining in the military, they would be exempt from the right to get \novertime.\n  Guess what the administration did. In the final rule, they took those \nwords out--``training in the armed forces.''\n  But what they didn't do was change the underlying language which says \nbasically you don't have to have a 4-year college degree; you can have \non-the-job training or work experience. It doesn't say they couldn't be \nin the military. They didn't specifically exempt the military; they \ntook out those four words.\n\n  Under this final rule, veterans in the future will be different than \nveterans in the past if they receive training while in the military \nwhich they then use on the job later on. They may have their right to \novertime pay taken away from them.\n  This is sort of an example of the learned professional exemption. \nLet's take a look at chefs. It basically says: Chefs, such as executive \nchefs who have attained a 4-year specialized degree in the culinary \narts program, generally meet the duty requirement of the learned \nprofessional exemption. The learned professional exemption is not \navailable to cooks who perform predominantly routine mental, manual, \nmechanical, or physical work.\n  In other words, an executive chef who has fewer years is \nautomatically exempt, but also if you, for example, at some point in \ntime supervised someone at a McDonald's, or whatever, then you would be \nexempt.\n  That is the ambiguity of these rules.\n  I could point out more and more. There are all kinds of different \nworkers who are caught up in this kind of web of ambiguity. But I close \nby saying again the new rule is unfair. This kind of a process should \nhave been done in Congress. It should have been done with the \nappropriate committees, with appropriate hearings and consultation and \nbeing very careful about how we are going to address this.\n  I see nothing wrong--in fact, I see everything right--in what the \nadministration is proposing in raising the threshold to $23,660. It \nshould have been done a long time ago. But most of the rules do not \npertain to them. The 137 pages out of 152 pages pertain to those making \nover $23,660 a year, and it provides one loophole after another to deny \nthe right to overtime pay for employees.\n  I am hopeful we can have a strong bipartisan vote in support of this \namendment. We can save the administration from making a terrible \nmistake. We can protect American workers' right to overtime \ncompensation and we can support an economic recovery that includes all \nAmericans--a recovery that respects and preserves the American dream. \nOur workers deserve an ironclad guarantee that their overtime rights \nwill be safe and nurtured as they have been in the past and are today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to my \ncolleague from Iowa in his presentation. I rise to disagree with the \npositions he has taken. I will do my best to do it in a manner that is \nnot disagreeable either to him or to others who are in support of this \namendment.\n  Let us understand, of course, the Fair Labor Standards Act is one of \nthe most important protections American workers have. We all agree on \nthat. But these provisions have not been updated, some for as long as \n50 years. Some kind of clear updating is essential. In the process of \nupdating regulations that go back as long as 50 years, some explanation \nwas, of course, necessary which results in the number of pages my \nfriend from Iowa has referred to.\n  My problem with the Senator's amendment is with a very broad brush \nand strong ax he cuts out a large chunk of the pages that have been \nmade and says those things that are in place are going to stay in \nplace. We are not going to allow any changes in these areas. His \namendment is relatively short but very powerful in its impact on the \noverall bill.\n  In an effort to understand this--because I am not an expert in these \nareas--my staff and I have reached out to HR directors throughout the \nState\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nof Utah to get their reactions to the new proposal, and at the same \ntime ask them what their response would be to what we understood the \nHarkin amendment to be. The reactions have been unanimous--No. 1, that \nthe action of the Department of the Labor Department is long overdue \nand very welcome.\n\n  One of the things I had not known until we got into this particular \nsubject was the trial lawyers, whom we hear so much about in the \nSenate, have found a bonanza in class action lawsuits dealing with the \nFair Labor Standards Act. Indeed, the bonanza has been primarily for \nthe trial lawyers and not for the workers in whose name they bring \nthese class action cases. This should not come as a surprise. We have \nseen other examples where this goes on.\n  To quote from the Texas lawyer: Overtime litigation is attractive to \ntrial lawyers because of the ``astonishingly'' high amount of money at \nstake.\n  And Lawyers Weekly USA says: Boom in overtime suits, a danger for \nemployers but a gold mine for plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  In the opinion of the HR directors we have spoken to on this issue, \nthis boom for trial lawyers would not go away if the Harkin amendment \nwere passed. Indeed, in their opinion, if the Harkin amendment were \npassed, it would mean more ambiguity, more uncertainty, and more \nopportunities for trial lawyers to file class action lawsuits. The \nreason for that is by freezing certain classifications that are in the \ncurrent regulations forever forward as a result of the Harkin amendment \nand allowing other classifications to remain as they are in the new \nregulations, you could very well end up with two employees doing \nabsolutely identical work, but because one of them was in place when \nthe Harkin amendment was passed and the other was hired after this \nlegislation was passed, they would have different classifications. A \ntrial lawyer would come along and have a great deal of fun with that, \nperhaps win a judgment of some kind, tremendous fees for himself and \nnot that much for the workers.\n  Everyone we have spoken to on this issue has said over and over \nagain: The Harkin amendment would make things much more difficult; the \nHarkin amendment would create an administrative nightmare to try to \nwork our way through; the Harkin amendment should be opposed.\n  They are all unanimous in saying the proposal by the Department of \nLabor is a good proposal. It will make their lives a whole lot easier \nbecause it will bring the regulations up to date, bring the regulations \nthat are 50 years old into the 21st century, and allow people to begin \nto deal with these challenges in ways that are consonant with today's \nlabor market.\n  My friend from Iowa talks about the jobless recovery. I recommend he \nspend a little time looking at the jobless claims that are being filed. \nThe number of jobless claims being filed keeps going down week after \nweek. People are no longer being laid off in the degree they were \nduring the recession. As we saw in the month of March, 308,000 new jobs \nwere created. We are waiting for the April figures. The expectation is \nit will be over 100,000 new jobs created in April. The effects of the \nrecession and the recovery period are wearing off, the jobs are coming \nback, the labor market is tightening up, and the Federal Reserve is \ntalking about raising the overnight rate because they say the economy \nis coming back. They have not given a date for that. Economists have \nbeen expecting that to happen in September. After Chairman Greenspan's \nappearance before the House Banking Committee, some thought it would \nhappen as early as July. I do not have a crystal ball on that and do \nnot pretend to know. As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, I do \nknow that virtually every economic indicator we have is up and pointing \nup. The economy is coming back very strongly.\n\n  I hope the rhetoric about the terrible economic conditions in which \nwe are currently operating will begin to change in light of the current \neconomic information that contradicts it and says the economy is coming \non very strongly. In that kind of economy, in that kind of situation \nwhere we are looking to the 21st century workforce, it only makes sense \nto upgrade, revamp, and modernize those portions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act that are, in fact, 50 years old and have been languishing \nfor a long time. There are definitions in that act of jobs that no \nlonger exist. There are circumstances described in that act that are \nclearly out of touch with today's economic reality and today's labor \nmarketplace.\n  I congratulate Secretary Chao and the Department of Labor in the very \ncareful way in which they have approached this issue. As nearly as I \ncan tell, the only people who have any reason to fear these new \nregulations, the only people who have any reason to fear their incomes \nmight go down as a result of these regulations are the trial lawyers \nwho have taken advantage of the anachronisms in the existing regulation \nand filed all of these class action suits I have talked about.\n  I have some examples of how the class action suits have muddied the \nwater, based on the current regulations, many of which would be frozen \nin place by the Harkin amendment. Courts have interpreted the confusing \nregulations differently. In the Virginia court, a designer of electric \nequipment gets overtime; but in a New York court, a designer of \nelectric systems does not get overtime as they have tried to determine \na different meaning of these phrases. This would be cleared up by the \nnew regulations proposed by the Department of Labor. In a Louisiana \ncourt, purchasing agents are entitled to overtime; but in an Oregon \ncourt, log merchandise buyers--to me, that is a purchasing agent--are \nnot entitled to overtime. This is because these definitions are in the \nold regulations, the existing regulations. These definitions are \nanachronistic, they are uncertain, and they are being brought up to \ndate, brought up to standard by Secretary Chao and her associates at \nthe Department of Labor.\n  But the Harkin amendment says, no, we will freeze these changes in \nplace to make sure the past pattern does not change. Quite frankly, I \nwant the past pattern to change. People who are involved, caught up in \nthe difficulties of trying to handle the past pattern want them to \nchange. They want modernization. They want these things to be updated. \nIt is not being done in an effort to try to deny anybody overtime. If \nthat had been the case, the administration would have left the number \nat 8,000 instead of raising it close to 24,000 as the threshold by \nwhich people could be reclassified.\n  No, this is not an attempt to deny overtime to anyone. This is simply \nan attempt to bring the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations into the \n21st century, bring them up to date with current economic reality, make \nthem available and understandable to the HR directors in the various \nfirms that deal with these challenges, and remove from the lives of \nthose HR directors the tremendous ambiguity, uncertainty, and, frankly, \nstupidity that comes from regulations that are half a century old.\n  I say to my colleagues, if there are portions of the work that the \nLabor Department has done that Members think you can improve upon, let \nus hear your arguments, let us look at your amendments. I am willing to \ndo that. But to take a whole section of the bill and lock it in place \nin the way the Harkin amendment does, in my view, cuts against the \nwhole purpose of this revision. It says we are going to keep in the law \nanachronistic positions that are 50 years old just because we are \nafraid something might happen. In a dynamic economy, something is \nalways happening. Yes, sometimes it can be very painful.\n  I know what it is to be looking for a job. I know what it is to be \nlaid off. I know what it is to go without health insurance. I know what \nit is to dig into one's savings and then see those disappear and slip \ninto debt in an effort to keep things going. I have founded businesses, \nsome of which have failed. And I do not get unemployment compensation \nwhen I am the boss and my business fails. I know how difficult this can \nbe.\n  So it is not a matter of not having appropriate sympathy or \nappropriate experience with those who are caught in economic changes. \nBut at the same time, I recognize the genius of the American economic \nsystem is its ability to grow under all circumstances, as we \ntraditionally have. We have had fewer recessions and more shallow \nrecessions than our friends around the\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\nworld who have attempted, through government, to monitor the economy \nand keep it under some kind of governmental control.\n  Yes, it can be painful. But ultimately it produces more jobs, more \nwealth, more opportunity, and more security for more Americans if you \nallow the free market to work better.\n  The regulations that are being proposed by the Department of Labor, \nin my view, meet that criteria. They provide a change in the situation \nthat will allow the economy to be more responsive to today's economic \nopportunities and challenges in a worldwide, borderless economy. I \nbelieve they should be adopted, as proposed, without the encumbrance of \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to join with \nmy friend and colleague, the Senator from Iowa, in urging the Senate to \naccept this amendment he has proposed on overtime. I want to take a \nmoment or two this afternoon to review, very quickly, where we are in \nterms of what our workers in this country are facing at this time in \nterms of our economy.\n  First of all, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nexcellent editorial entitled ``Timeout on Overtime Rule'' in the Los \nAngeles Times be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will mention, very quickly, some of the points that \nwere made in this editorial, ``Timeout on Overtime Rule.'' This is what \nthey mention:\n\n       Unfortunately, the new Labor Department overtime rule \n     intended to clear things up just makes them murkier. . . . \n     Despite [Secretary] Chao's assurances that she's worked hard \n     to ``get it right,'' the National Assn. of Police \n     Organizations determined that ``while many police are \n     protected, others are not.''\n       A former Department of Labor investigator last week told a \n     House committee the ambiguous wording threatens [many] \n     protection[s] now afforded to many workers--including nursery \n     school teachers, nurses, chefs, team leaders, outside sales \n     people and financial service employees--who earn from $23,660 \n     to $100,000 a year.\n\n  It continues: ``American workers have fueled recent productivity \ngains but failed to share in the newly created wealth because, as Alan \nGreenspan recently told the Senate, `virtually all of the gains in \nproductivity ended up in rising profit' '' suggesting that \nthe investments are not going back to those in terms of the increasing \nproductivity but are all going back into profits.\n\n  And then it points out:\n\n       A panic about their overtime is the last thing workers \n     need. . . .\n\n  As we know--and the figures point out very clearly--American workers \nwork longer and harder than any other workers in the world. They \naverage working longer than any other nation in the world--2\\1/2\\ weeks \nlonger in a year than workers in the United Kingdom; 7 weeks longer in \na year than workers in France; 4, 5 weeks longer every year than most \nof the industrialized countries in Western Europe. American workers \ntoday are working longer, and they are working harder. But what has \nhappened is we have seen that 8.4 million Americans are out of work. We \nhave seen the loss of jobs over the period of the recent years. We have \nseen the economic record of 2.4 million more unemployed workers today \nthan we had in 2001. So American workers are working longer, they are \nworking harder, and we have seen a significant loss of jobs.\n  I heard my friend and colleague from Utah refer to those who have \ngone back into the labor market. But as the Senator knows very well, \nmany of those people are working part-time because they still can't \nfind full-time work. This is a reflection of the fact that we have seen \nAmerican workers working longer and working harder. And there is also a \nloss of some 2 million jobs.\n  What has happened to the wages of those workers? Look at the \ndifference in the wages of those workers who were working in the year \n2000 versus 2002. In the year 2000, they were averaging $43,848, and \nnow they are averaging $42,408. We have seen a significant reduction--\nsome $1,400--in wages that have been lost during the period of the last \n2 years for jobs that are already in existence. And this administration \nis trying to cut back even more.\n  What is the administration's problem with working families? They \noppose an increase in the minimum wage. They oppose extending \nunemployment compensation. And now they are trying to cut back on the \nincome of working families.\n  Well, we hear: Look, we have created, under this administration, some \nnew jobs. The interesting point is, the new jobs that have been created \nare averaging 21 percent less in pay than the old jobs that were there. \nSo we have seen a significant reduction in the pay that workers receive \nif they have been able to hold their job. If you have lost your job, \nand then you get a new job, it is paying 21 percent less than what it \nwas paying in the year 2001, and still the administration wants to \nreduce those figures even more for hard-working Americans who are \ntrying to make it.\n  Now, what has happened? What are these families doing? These families \nwho were making $44,000, and maybe now they are coming back into the \nmarket and making 21 percent less? Let's look at the kind of burden \nthose families are under. Let's look, for example, at what has happened \nin terms of if those families are sending one of their children to \ncollege. We find out if they are sending their children to a 4-year \ncollege, the average increase in college tuition has increased 26 \npercent since 2001. Virtually nothing has been done by the Bush \nadministration to try to get a handle on that.\n  There are things that can be done. We have had good ideas and good \nsuggestions of trying to work with colleges, work with States, work \nwith the Federal Government in trying to get a handle on the increased \ncosts. We have families working harder, working longer, and making \nless, and finding out--when they are trying to put their children \nthrough college--college tuition, in the last 2\\1/2\\ years, has gone up \nsome 26 percent. They see they are making less money now. If they have \ntheir old job or even if they have a new job, they are finding out, if \ntheir children are going to college, what is happening at a 4-year \npublic school.\n  Let's look at what has happened in terms of their health care \npremiums. The costs are virtually out of control. This chart shows \ntheir premium increase versus the CPI. The CPI might represent what \nsome of these workers are getting in their increased wages in terms of \ntheir employers, but look what has happened to the costs that are out \nof control. Over the period of the last 4\\1/2\\ years, the increase in \nhealth care costs have gone up 43 percent. How are the average working \nfamilies in this country able to make it? Their pay is going down. \nThere are new jobs paying less. Tuitions are going up. Health care is \ngoing up. We have a proposal on the floor of the Senate. That is not \nbad enough, if they work even harder and longer, we are going to cut \nback on that.\n  You can take the same with regard to the issue of prescription drugs. \nI see my friend from Oregon in the Chamber, Senator Ron Wyden, who has \ndone so much in the area of prescription drugs and trying to get a \nhandle on the costs of prescription drugs. He is a real leader in the \nSenate on this issue.\n  If you look at what families are paying in increased costs for \nprescription drugs, those costs are virtually out of control.\n  That is why those of us on this side of the aisle have asked: What in \nthe world does this administration have against working families? Why \nnow, the first time in more than 60 years, are you going to undermine \nor assault or attack overtime pay for workers? Why? It just isn't right \nand it just isn't fair.\n  Look at what has happened in the recovery we have had, briefly, in \nthe last several months. Let's look at how that recovery has affected \nworkers and how it has affected the profits for companies. Here we have \na chart that shows the difference between the recovery in the early \n1990s and today's recovery. This chart reflects what the difference is \nbetween workers wages and corporate profit.\n  In the early 1990s, when you had a recovery in the 1990s, you found \nout that the workers participated in expansion of wages 87 percent and \nthe corporate profits went up 13 percent. Here it is today. With \ntoday's recovery, it is 60 percent goes to corporate profits and 40 \npercent to wages. And company after\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\ncompany, industry after industry is trying to cut that back in terms of \nwages.\n  Just look at some of the industries, what they requested in terms of \nthis administration. I will illustrate with the restaurant association, \nbut the list goes on.\n  The National Restaurant Association requests that DOL include chefs \nunder creative professional categories as well as the learned \nprofessional category.\n  Then from the Federal Register, April 23: The Department concludes \nthat to the extent a chef has a primary duty of work, requiring \ninvention, imagination, originality, or talent--imagine telling a chef \nthat he didn't have those, how long would he work in a restaurant; of \ncourse, it means all the chefs--such chef may be considered an exempt \ncreative professional.\n  There is the request of the National Restaurant Association. There is \nthe result.\n  Take the insurance companies. Here is their request, the National \nAssociation of Mutual Insurance Companies' letter to the Department of \nLabor: The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies supports \nthe section of the proposed regulations that provides that claims \nadjusters, including those working for insurance companies, satisfy the \nfair labor administrative exemption. Therefore, will not qualify for \novertime.\n  From the Federal Register just 10 days ago: Insurance claim adjusters \ngenerally meet the duty requirements for the administrative exemption.\n  There is the request of the special interest; there is the result. I \ncould take the rest of the afternoon. You could go industry by \nindustry. We are talking about modernization, to make these regulations \nmore understandable. This is what it is all about. It is the bottom \nline. The bottom line of those industries, taking it out of the pockets \nof the men and women who are working hard, working longer, as the first \nchart showed, more than any other industrial nation in the world, \nhaving a hard time making ends meet, paying for the education of the \nkids, affording the health care, paying for the prescription drugs. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  Here are the various groups that are affected: nurses, nursery school \nteachers. Imagine this, nursery school teachers. I looked through the \nregulations. Imagine denying nursery school teachers. When we \nunderstand the importance, anyone who has had the opportunity to read \n``From Neurons to Neighborhoods,'' Jack Shonkoff's brilliant book that \nsummarized three Academy of Sciences studies that showed that the \nintervention in the early years make the greatest difference in terms \nof children.\n  We are concerned about education and we are going to make sure those \nnursery school teachers, even if they are qualified, even if they \ndeserve it, no way, are they going to be excluded. The list goes \non. The list goes on.\n\n  Finally, I want to mention this chart that shows what happens when \nyou either have protections for overtime or you don't have protections. \nProtections meaning if you are required, you pay time and a half versus \nyou don't pay time and a half, what is going to be the impact on \nworkers.\n  Workers ought to listen to this. Workers ought to take a look at this \nchart. If you have overtime protection and you work more than 40 hours \na week, only 19 percent of the workers are going to be required to work \novertime. But if you don't, if the employer doesn't have to pay the \novertime, it goes up to 44 percent, more than double. Workers beware. \nThat is how you are going to end up. You are going to be required to \nwork much more than the 40-hour workweek and you are not going to get \ncompensated for it.\n  And it isn't only the 40-hour workweek. If you have a 50-hour week, \nyou are three times as likely to work longer than if you have the \ncoverage under overtime.\n  This can be summarized very easily as a continuation of this \nadministration's war on working families. Working families are not \nasking for much. They want a decent job with decent pay and decent \nopportunities for the future. They have a sense of pride, and they want \nto do a good job in the job they are doing. And they want to work. We \nare stacking it against them. We are saying we will not increase the \nminimum wage, even though it is 7 years since the last time we saw an \nincrease and even though its purchasing power is at an all-time low and \nthat it affects 7 million Americans, fellow citizens who work hard, \nplay by the rules, primarily janitors, teachers assistants, people who \nwork in nursing homes. Those are the recipients of the minimum wage. \nAnd it is mostly women. This overtime issue is a women's issue. This \novertime issue is a women's issue because we have seen the expansion \nand the growth of hours that women are putting in in the workplace.\n  This administration has been opposed to an increase in the minimum \nwage, opposed to unemployment compensation, and now opposed to \novertime. It is basically wrong. It is unfair.\n  This Harkin amendment addresses the unfairness. Americans understand \nfairness and unfairness. This underlying proposal of the administration \nis unfair.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an excellent summary \nby Eileen Appelbaum from Rutgers University that talks about \nreinvestment in the United States as a share of corporate profits has \nhit a postwar low.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       It is not a lack of profits that has kept U.S. corporations \n     from investing. As Figure 3 shows, the after-tax capital \n     share is at its highest level in the post-War period. Indeed, \n     the Wall Street Journal reports that 60 percent of U.S. \n     companies and 70 percent of foreign-owned companies in the \n     U.S. didn't pay ANY federal taxes for the years 1996 to 2000 \n     (Wall Street Journal, April 6, 2004, p.1). Nevertheless \n     profit reinvested in the U.S. as a share of corporate profits \n     has hit a post-War low.\n       In 2003, corporate taxes fell to just 7.4 percent of \n     federal tax receipts--its second lowest share since 1934. \n     Further tax cuts for corporations are not likely to spur \n     investment or create jobs. The problem is the overhang from \n     overinvestment in IT and telecommunications during the latter \n     half of the 1990s and the on-going restructuring of \n     companies. This, combined with a lack of attention to \n     strengthening manufacturing where nearly 40 percent of \n     investment takes place, suggests that low rates of business \n     investment are likely to be a drag on the economy and private \n     sector job creation for several more years.\n       Investment has begun to rise over the last two quarters, \n     but the growth in corporate profitability has been even more \n     impressive. If companies continue to grab productivity gains \n     and a larger slice of the economic pie for themselves, and \n     profits continue to squeeze wages, consumption growth will \n     not be able to continue to sustain the economy. Growth in \n     investment is unlikely to be able to overcome the drag on the \n     economy from giving workers a smaller slice of the economic \n     pie.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Make no mistake about it. What this is about is \nincreasing the profits. Do we think those profits are going to be \nreinvested in the worker? There is no indication that they will be. \nThis is about the bottom line.\n  The question is, Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of \nworking families trying to make it in America or are you on the side of \nthe companies trying to increase the bottom line? That is what the \nissue is.\n  I applaud the Senator from Iowa and hope the Senate will support that \neffort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Los Angeles Times Editorial, May 3, 2004]\n\n                        Timeout on Overtime Rule\n\n       Overtime pay makes ends meet for many U.S. workers. But the \n     federal regulations that determine who merits overtime are so \n     complex that employers and employees end up in court way too \n     often, Unfortunately, the new Labor Department overtime rule \n     intended to clear things up just makes them murkier. A \n     timeout is called for, if just to figure out who the winners \n     and losers really are.\n       An earlier version of the new rule drew 80,000 comments \n     from befuddled workers and employers alike. The final rule \n     published in April--though a clear improvement--has provoked \n     outright argument about what some of its provisions really \n     mean.\n       Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao maintains that, when the \n     rule takes effect in four months, it will guarantee overtime \n     protection to workers earning less than $23,660 a year and \n     strengthen overtime rights for 6.7 million other American \n     workers, including 1.3 million low-wage, white-collar workers \n     who previously didn't qualify. Workers, though, aren't taking \n     Chao's word for it.\n       Despite Chao's assurances that she's worked hard to ``get \n     it right,'' the National Assn. of Police Organizations \n     determined that ``while many police are protected, others are \n     not.''\n       A former Department of Labor investigator last week told a \n     House committee that\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\n     ambiguous wording threatens protection now afforded too many \n     workers--including nursery school teachers, nurses, chefs, \n     team leaders, outside sales people and financial service \n     employees--who earn from $23,660 to $100,000 a year.\n       American workers have fueled recent productivity gains but \n     failed to share in the newly created wealth because, as Alan \n     Greenspan recently told the Senate, ``virtually all of the \n     gains in productivity ended up in rising profit.''\n       The economy isn't spinning off jobs quickly enough to get \n     the unemployed back to work, and young workers are frustrated \n     by a minimum wage that hasn't budged since 1997. A panic \n     about their overtime is the last thing workers need, even \n     though the regulations surely do need some straightening out.\n       Rather than take Chao's word, Congress should order the \n     Labor Department to delay implementation of the complex \n     overtime regulations until everyone knows what really will \n     happen to workers' paychecks. Get a think tank on the job.\n       Replacing one flawed set of regulations with another won't \n     diminish lawsuits and may allow unscrupulous employers to \n     take advantage of more workers. As Chao has noted, key \n     portions of the rule hadn't been changed in more than 50 \n     years. A few more weeks isn't going to matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the overtime rules. I believe they are a marvelous step in the \nright direction. After 40 to 50 years of inaction and lack of review, I \nbelieve we are in a position to make some changes today. Secretary of \nLabor Elaine Chao is one of the finest members of this administration. \nShe is a determined public servant. She advertised those changes. She \nsolicited information from various groups and individuals and got \n70,000 responses. They evaluated those responses and made the proposed \nrule changes that are before us. I think it is clearly a step in the \nright direction and will add to the number of people who are covered. \nThe final rule updating part 541 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \nregulation is important.\n\n  When these rules were established, we used words and terms that don't \nreally exist today. They used terms like ``gang leader.'' That has \nquite a different tone today than it did when that rule was set up. \nThere was also ``linotype operator'' and overtime was guaranteed only \nfor persons who made less than $8,060 a year. So this rule change \nimproves the regulations in quite a significant way.\n  I had the personal experience of working as a lawyer and representing \ntwo individuals who had problems with overtime. I represented the first \nindividual against a company. I had not studied the law that much, but \nI had been a Federal prosecutor and I knew the people. One was a friend \nfrom my high school days and he operated heavy equipment. He said: \nJeff, I think I have been entitled to overtime. I worked extra hours. \nWhen the weather was good, we worked extra hours.\n  They saw him as a contractor and he saw himself as an employee. I \nbegan to look at the law and I thought he was right. We filed a lawsuit \nand the company knuckled under and paid him. I took a fee out of it, \nand I am sure the company paid their lawyers a fee for representing \nthem. A pretty significant chunk of the man's overtime had to be paid \non litigation fees.\n  I represented an administrative assistant. The group she worked for \nhad meetings at night. She would be required to go take notes and keep \nrecords, but they didn't pay her overtime. We filed an action on that \nand, eventually, they agreed to pay her. Interestingly, that lady \nworked for a union. So the union wasn't paying one of its own employees \novertime as they were required.\n  What we need is more clarity in this situation. We need a legal \nsystem that everybody can understand. When you know who is covered, \nthen people can demand their overtime and they will get it. It is my \nexperience that you will not have quite as many situations where people \nblatantly violate the law if they know what the law is. If the law is \nconfusing, they will play in the gray areas and take advantage of \npeople. If it is clear, people will tend to follow it--most employers \nwill. I think that is what we are looking at here.\n  The Department of Labor did not prematurely propose this rule. It was \nafter a great deal of work and effort and listening and evaluation and \nchanging and updating and altering the proposal. I think they have done \na terrific job. It meets the realistic needs of the modern workplace so \nmuch better than this 50-year-old rule that has not been changed since \nthe beginning.\n  I have been disappointed that our friends in the labor movement \nleadership have sought to utilize this change as an opportunity to \nattempt to scare working Americans and cause them to believe they are \nsomehow being taken advantage of in this process. That is not so. I was \ndisappointed to learn that the AFL-CIO prepared ads attacking the rule, \nbefore it was even published. That is not the right way to do things. \nWe all ought to be a part of the process. If you have a specific \nexample of something that is wrong, bring it up with the Secretary of \nLabor, as many did, and as labor groups did, and they will evaluate it \nand make the changes that work.\n  This is an attempt--and a successful attempt--to make the rules \nsimpler, fairer, and clearer. We have to do better than the current \nlaw. Under this final rule--and this is so significant--workers making \n$23,660 or less per year are absolutely guaranteed overtime. In the \npast, a worker making $14,000 annually could be classified as a manager \nand be denied overtime.\n\n  Under the new rules, that worker and 6.7 million others will be \nguaranteed overtime protection regardless of whether you call them a \nmanager, a boss, or whatever you want to call them. If they make less \nthan that, they are classified as eligible and have to be paid overtime \nif they work more than the 40 hours per week. This will cover the \nperson at the print shop, the fast food place, and the laundry. Maybe \nthey have been classified as a manager because they do the business and \nmanage some. Under this, if they are paid less than $23,660, \nautomatically they will be covered. That is 6.7 million workers who are \ngoing to be guaranteed overtime protection.\n  This is not something that is trying to harm the worker. I know my \nfriend, Senator Kennedy, is quite an advocate. But I have to tell you, \nI don't appreciate him saying that this rule change is a war on \nAmerican workers. What kind of rhetoric is that? What kind of \npartisanship is that? What kind of collegiality and respect for the \nprocess is that? This is a good series of rules, not a war on the \nAmerican worker.\n  He talks about college tuition, health care, prescription drugs, and \nall these issues he wants to talk about but not specifically what is \nwrong about this regulation. There is not anything wrong with it. It is \na step forward. It is good for American workers and we need to do that.\n  I know he talked about a lot of things. One thing he did not suggest \nwas that if we got a handle on the number of illegal workers in this \ncountry, there would be more jobs for American workers? We will get \nmore people at that $18, $20, $25 range. That is where we want people \nto work at. He didn't talk about that.\n  There are lots of things we can do to improve the life of the working \nAmerican man and women. One of them is to update the overtime rules. I \nbelieve this has been done openly and publicly by a Secretary of Labor \nwho is a lady of integrity and great ability, who listened to the \ncomplaints and ideas and suggestions, and she has made progress.\n  For example, I believe Senator Harkin mentioned law enforcement \nofficers. The largest law enforcement group in America, a workers \ngroup, a labor group, the Fraternal Order of Police, has clearly \nsupported this rule change. They participated in the process and they \nmade their suggestions. They were happy when it was over. This is what \nthe president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Chuck Canterbury, said \nwhen the Department of Labor issued the final regulation. He said it \nwas ``an unprecedented victory for police officers and their \nfamilies.'' These are America's first responders, the police, firemen, \nand EMTs.\n\n       He goes on to say that ``the Fraternal Order of Police is \n     extremely grateful for the work of the Secretary of Labor, \n     Elaine Chao, and Wage and Hour Administrator, Tammie \n     McCutchen, to take into consideration and incorporate the \n     views of the FOP in developing their final regulations.''\n\n  He goes on in great praise of them. It has also been repeated on the \nfloor earlier today that somehow veterans are unhappy with this bill \nand it is going to hurt veterans.\n  But I have a letter from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. They are one \nof the\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nlargest veterans groups. They say in a letter to Secretary Chao on \nApril 22:\n\n       The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \n     appreciates your soliciting our comments and recommendations \n     on the revision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to strengthen \n     and clarify\n\n  That is how he referred to it, ``strengthen and clarify''--\n\n     the overtime protection provisions; particularly provision \n     addressing veterans and the training they received while \n     serving in the Armed Forces. Much confusion and erroneous \n     misinformation was disseminated.\n\n  Boy, that is true. There has been so much misinformation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, for a question, without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator is correct in the fact that the \nearlier provisions certainly apply to the training veterans received. I \nthink my own reading of this is that they may very well apply to this \ngroup of veterans who have specialized training. Why didn't the \nadministration add a line saying that anyone who received training in \nthe Armed Forces would not be covered? That would have resolved the \nissue. If the Senator wanted to add that as an amendment, I would \nencourage the Senator from Iowa to accept that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ncomments. As a lawyer--and I know Senator Kennedy is a lawyer--these \nthings get pretty complicated. Sometimes making blanket rules like that \ncan create unfairness in the system.\n  Let me go on and continue with what the Veterans of Foreign Wars said \non April 22 about this legislation:\n\n       Much confusion and erroneous information was disseminated \n     with respect to how the proposed regulations could adversely \n     affect veterans. You and the staff of the Veterans Employment \n     and Training Service and the Wage and Hour Division's \n     willingness to engage the VFW and other Veterans Service \n     Organizations in constructive dialog resulted in the removal \n     of language pertaining to ``training in the Armed Forces,'' \n     thus ensuring veterans would not be denied overtime as a \n     result of such training. Again, the VFW appreciates your \n     recognition of those who serve our Nation in war and peace.\n\n  The Disabled American Veterans, a good, strong group that does a lot \nof good work here:\n\n       Dear Secretary Chao: On behalf of the 1.2 million members \n     of the Disabled American Veterans, I would like to express \n     our gratitude for keeping us and other veterans' service \n     organizations informed throughout the revision of rules \n     governing overtime eligibility for workers under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act. We also commend your efforts to protect \n     veterans by ensuring that a worker's status as a veteran \n     cannot be used as a basis for exemption from overtime pay.\n\n  And from the American Legion--I suppose they know what is good for \nveterans. I certainly know they advocate for them on a daily basis. \nNational Commander John Brieden III wrote to Secretary Chao, April 26, \nlast week:\n\n       I am writing in support of the recently released regulatory \n     changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act. The American Legion \n     has a long history of advocating in support of veterans \n     employment and training entitlements, and we are pleased with \n     the Department of Labor's part 541 final regulations that \n     seek to clarify overtime pay eligibility rules.\n\n  They are happy with them.\n\n       He goes on to write, recent assertions that the proposed \n     regulatory changes target veterans who rely on overtime pay \n     caused undue concern for those proud veterans who have \n     successfully transitioned into the civilian workforce.\n\n  Who has been telling them all this misinformation? They are all \nsaying that. How are they being told this? I am afraid the truth is, we \nare in a political season, and the Secretary of Labor stepped up to the \nplate to make some changes that needed to be made. They have not been \nchanged in 50 years, and those who have a political agenda who want to \ntry to embarrass President Bush, frankly, because Secretary Chao is a \nCabinet Secretary in his administration are going to blame him for \nadversely harming workers, and it is not right. Listen to the people \nwho were there:\n\n       Recent assertions that the proposed regulatory changes \n     target veterans who rely on overtime pay caused undue concern \n     for those proud veterans who have successfully transitioned \n     into the civilian workforce. The removal of language \n     referencing training in the Armed Forces will ensure that no \n     worker will be unjustly penalized for their veteran status as \n     a result of these regulatory changes. At a time in our \n     history when American service members are answering the \n     Nation's call--\n\n  Indeed they certainly are--\n\n     to arms in more than 130 countries worldwide, this country \n     must ensure that all military and veterans entitlements are \n     preserved rather than stripped away.\n       The American Legion supports the Department of Labor's \n     efforts to clarify eligibility for overtime pay, and we \n     applaud you, Madame Secretary, for ensuring that the \n     employment rights of America's veterans are protected.\n\n  It is time for us to deal with this situation. These rules are \nbetter. A lot of people who have been called managers, who are making \n$18,000, $19,000, $20,000, $21,000, $22,000 a year and are being denied \novertime because their employers crafted a job description that made \nthem a manager, will be guaranteed overtime. If you make below $23,660, \nyou are guaranteed overtime. If you make over $100,000, you are not. \nBut for the others this will be guaranteed.\n  This is a step forward for clarity. It is going to reduce litigation. \nIt is going to reduce class action lawsuits. It is going to reduce the \nexcessive cost that comes from those lawsuits, and it will make lives \nbetter for American workers. That is our only goal. If I thought it \nharmed our American workers, I would not support it.\n  I believe the Secretary of Labor is on the right track. I ask our \ncolleagues to oppose the Harkin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I wish to respond this afternoon to some \nof the statements that have been said, and also to rise in opposition \nto the Harkin amendment.\n  First, I wish to join in what the Senator from Alabama was saying \nabout the outstanding leadership of our Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. \nIf there has ever been an American success story, she is it. She is a \nminority woman who has been in several very critical leadership \npositions, has always done a wonderful job, and she is showing real \ncourage as Secretary of Labor. Anybody who would suggest she would be \nadvocating positions or rules that would be antiwomen, I don't think \nthere is any possibility that would be something she would do. I have a \nknowledge of her and a faith in the leadership she is providing.\n  She is trying to change rules that have not been touched in 50 years. \nWhatever they were 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, one would \nthink they probably need some reconsideration and updating. That is \nwhat she is trying to do.\n  As far as being concerned about the low income and entry level of \nworking Americans, I feel a real concern for that. My dad was a \nshipyard worker, a pipefitter, a union member. My mother taught school. \nShe subsequently kept books because she could not make enough money \nteaching school. My son employs a lot of entry level, low-income, unwed \nmothers, and he worries about his need for insurance coverage.\n  I do not step aside for anybody as far as coming from a low-income, \nmiddle-income background. I want to make sure we do right by the low-\nincome people and the entry level people.\n  In that connection, in talking about the economy and what is \nhappening, I remind all Americans and my colleagues the economy is not \nperfect. The economy would never be as good as we would like for it to \nbe. We would like it to be growing at 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 percent GDP and \nhope we can make that happen. I believe we in America can always make \nthe pie bigger. We do not have to make the slices smaller. We can \nchallenge every American to think about what the opportunities are that \nare being offered and try to take a part of the American dream. And we \nare moving in that direction. Productivity is up.\n  The point was made maybe it is going to the bottom line, the profit. \nI figured out if Litton Industries did not have a profit, my dad \nprobably would not have had a job doing pipefitting in that shipyard.\n  Jobless claims are down, housing starts are at an all-time high, and \nthe American dream of owning your own home is doing fantastically. I \nmet last week with homebuilders from my home State. They are doing \ngreat. They are providing good quality, affordable housing like never \nbefore, probably because interest rates are low, historically low, and \nhave been so. The markets are up.\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n  When I hear, woe is me, the economy is not good--it is not perfect, \nbut there are a lot of indicators going in the right direction.\n  Then when I hear our workers in America work more than people in \nFrance, are we now trying to imitate France? Pretty soon they will be \ndown to working maybe 25 hours a week, and they have huge economic \nproblems because they have not been able to bring themselves to address \nthe difficulties they are getting into with all their pensions and all \nthe stuff they are committed to they are not going to be able to pay \nfor.\n  I do not want to follow France's example, for Heaven's sake. So what \ndo we have in this particular instance? Again, we are trying to update \nthe rules on overtime. It looks to me as though for low-income workers, \nthey are going to be the beneficiaries. The Department estimates that \nfew, if any, workers between $23,660 and $100,000 would lose their \novertime. As a matter of fact, 1.3 million salaried workers who earn \nless than $23,660 would get the overtime, and they would not need to go \nto court or to try to deal with the difficulties of the vague language. \nThey are going to clarify when these workers would be eligible for \novertime.\n  Certainly, people who are making $23,000 or $24,000 ought to get \novertime when they work extra hours. I think we ought to be commending \nthe Secretary of Labor. She listened to us. She heard our complaints. \nWhere there were weaknesses that were pointed out, they went back and \ntried to address those. These are not the same rules we were debating a \nyear ago. They went back and raised the level that would be applied. \nThe salaried level was $65,000. In the final version of rules, it is up \nto $100,000.\n  There are new provisions in the rules that specify certain classes of \nemployees also, such as police officers and firefighters, as \nautomatically eligible for overtime pay. Do we not want to make that \nclear? Do we not want to specify that firefighters and police officers \nwould be entitled to get overtime pay?\n  It also declares that licensed practical nurses and certain veterans \nwould be eligible for overtime pay. So there is a clarification with \nregard to the nurses. When one looks at what has happened, what they \nare trying to accomplish is to bring the rules up to date with the \nrealities of employment today, and this is the first time we have done \nit in 50 years. As a matter of fact, low-income workers have certainty \nthat they are going to get overtime. Specific groups such as \nfirefighters, policemen, veterans, and licensed practical nurses will \nbe guaranteed that they will get this overtime pay.\n  Now there are certain categories of people I am sure are defined in \nthese rules who are executive or administrative in position. They may \nmake over $100,000, $120,000, or $130,000 a year. They may have to work \novertime. How many people in our offices work overtime? How many \novertime hours do we work, 50, 60, 70, 80? We understand when we run \nfor the Senate that we are not going to get overtime pay. I am not \nadvocating that. That is my point. I do not expect it, and I work 70, \n80 hours a week because of the opportunities, the way of honor and \nbecause of the understanding of what we would be paid.\n  I think these rules are the right thing to do. There is clarity about \nthe fact that more people would be covered. I do not know how many \npeople might actually have some risk of not getting overtime, but it \nwould be in the higher brackets. The number is probably 107,000 workers \nearning more than this $100,000 might lose their overtime pay.\n  This effort has shifted the emphasis to the low-income people who \nhave not been certain that they could get overtime. We should be \ncommending the Secretary of Labor, not trying to pass the Harkin \namendment that would block these changes.\n  I fear once again what we have is people wanting more. They are not \nsatisfied that this is good enough. Good, maybe, yes, that maybe it is \nfine if it applies to first responders, nurses, blue collar workers, \ncooks, paralegals, public service inspectors, union contracts, and \nveterans. That is all good, but we want more. We are going to defeat \nthe good in pursuit of the perfect.\n  It will not happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this Harkin amendment. Let us \nput these rules in place. It will not be the last pass at this. We are \ngoing to find that there are some weaknesses, or we should have maybe \nconsidered another group. The rules will be changed again.\n  I had to take a little time to talk about the facts with regard to \nSecretary of Labor Elaine Chao, to talk about the economy and talk \nabout how these rules have been modified. They have moved in the right \ndirection, and we should allow them to go into place and continue to \nwork to make sure they are applied properly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORNYN). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine and the Senator \nfrom Oregon would each like to offer an amendment. I would like to get \nthem in a queue for consideration after the Harkin amendment. I have \ncleared this with the majority manager.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Harkin amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside so that Senator Collins may offer an amendment; \nthat after she has been able to do so and speak to her amendment the \nCollins amendment be temporarily laid aside, and that Senator Wyden be \nrecognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3108\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3108.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I turn to the subject matter of \nthe amendment which I have just submitted, I rise to take a moment to \nthank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their courtesy, and \nin particular to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee and their staffs for their assistance in advancing \nthis important legislation and in helping to bring this amendment to \nthe Senate floor.\n  Over the past year, the American economy has emerged from a period of \nrecession and slow growth into a period of economic recovery. The last \nhalf of 2003 saw the strongest growth in two decades and the growth \ncontinues to be strong, 4.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, \na clear sign of a healthy and sustainable economic rebound.\n  There are hopeful signs on the job front, too. Last month, 308,000 \nnew jobs were added to our Nation's payrolls. This is very good news, \nbut the recovery has not affected all sectors equally. One sector in \nparticular, manufacturing, is struggling to cope with the long-term \ndecline that has cost so many workers their jobs.\n  Job losses in the manufacturing sector did not begin with the recent \nrecession, nor with this administration. It is not a Democratic issue \nor a Republican issue. In each decade since World War II, employment in \nthe manufacturing sector has declined as a share of total employment. \nIn absolute terms, the number of American manufacturing jobs has fallen \neach year since the end of 1997. In fact, if one examines the past 84 \nmonths since March of 1997, the number of manufacturing jobs has \ndeclined each and every month except 7.\n  No State has been harder hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs than \nmy home State of Maine. According to a study by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, on a percentage basis Maine has lost more \nmanufacturing jobs than any State in the Nation. We have lost nearly \n18,000 jobs during that period, good jobs that once provided lifelong \nemployment to Mainers living in communities such as Millinocket, \nBrewer, Wilton, Waterville, Fort Kent, Dexter, Westbrook, and Sanford.\n  Many people are asking: Why are so many manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry disappearing?\n  According to a recent study conducted by the National Association of \nManufacturers, one answer is the disparity in manufacturing costs in \nour country versus other countries. In fact, compared to other \ncountries, it costs an average of 22 percent more to manufacture goods \nin the United States.\n  While it would surprise no one that U.S. manufacturers face a higher \ncost of doing business compared to manufacturers in countries such as \nChina or Mexico, it would be a mistake to assume wage rates alone \nexplain this difference. They do not. In fact, the productivity of the \nAmerican worker is unrivaled, allowing American workers to receive more \nvalue in terms of wages for the goods they produce. As the NAM study \nstates, if wages were the only factor, then:\n\n       U.S. manufacturers would be much more dominant . . . in the \n     global markets than the current trade situation suggests.\n\n  It is other structural costs such as the high corporate tax rate we \nimpose on manufacturers that make it much more expensive to manufacture \ngoods here in the United States relative to the costs elsewhere. \nIndeed, the NAM study shows it is significantly cheaper to produce \ngoods even in high-wage industrialized nations such as Japan and \nFrance. This fact illustrates the critical impact these high structural \ncosts have on manufacturers in our country.\n  In essence, these costs have the same effect as imposing a 22-percent \nadditional tax on making goods here, rather than overseas. To compete, \nAmerican manufacturers must somehow do more with less, move operations \noverseas, or get out of manufacturing altogether. None of those is a \ngood solution. The result is fewer jobs, a weaker economy, and a \nmanufacturing sector in crisis.\n  Earlier this session I introduced legislation known as the Growing \nOur Manufacturing Employment Act. This legislation provides a 9-percent \ndeduction for manufacturing income, and contains additional provisions \nbenefiting the forest products industry, an industry critical to \nmanufacturers and jobs, good jobs in my home State. I am very pleased \nthe underlying bill we are considering, the JOBS Act, has already been \namended to accelerate the deduction for manufacturing income and it \ncontains these important forestry provisions. But I believe we need to \ngo further to address the loss of these vital manufacturing jobs. For \nthat reason, I am offering the final provisions of the Growing Our \nManufacturing Jobs Act as an amendment to this bill. My amendment is \naimed at reinvigorating the manufacturing sector, boosting the level of \ndomestic manufacturing, and preventing the further loss of these \nimportant jobs.\n  My amendment would help to reduce the 22-percent cost differential \nAmerican manufacturers face by providing a jobs tax credit to those \nmanufacturers that increase their payrolls by hiring displaced workers \nwho are receiving trade adjustment assistance. That would mean we would \nbe providing an important incentive for manufacturers to rehire workers \nwho have been laid off because of the impact of foreign competition.\n  In Maine alone, nearly 60 manufacturers are currently TAA-certified, \nand more than 4,200 Maine workers have been deemed eligible for \nbenefits under TAA since the start of 2002. The credit I have suggested \nwould provide a powerful incentive to hire these workers and help them \nget back to work.\n\n  This credit is very carefully targeted. For that reason, it carries a \nmodest pricetag, which, thanks to the efforts of the Finance Committee, \nwould be fully offset by other provisions included in the amendment.\n  Finally, this amendment is designed to ensure only those companies \nthat are helping to build America's manufacturing base obtain the \ncredit. It has both a carrot-and-a-stick approach. Companies that move \njobs offshore will see their benefits reduced. Most important, \ncompanies that chose to reincorporate in offshore tax havens to avoid \nAmerican taxes will not be eligible for this credit.\n  I am hopeful that by working together on this proposal and the \nimportant provisions of the underlying bill, we can take the important \nsteps that are needed to strengthen American manufacturers, to preserve \nour manufacturing capacity and, most of all, to help ensure hard-\nworking Americans have the jobs they need and deserve.\n  Let me once again thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nongoing efforts to advance this significant legislation. It has been a \npleasure working with them to bring this proposal before the Senate. \nFew subjects the Senate will address this year are as important as \ncreating and protecting good jobs, and few bills are as important to \nadvancing that goal as the legislation before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3109\n\n (Purpose: To provide trade adjustment assistance for service workers, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Coleman, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Dayton, Senator Brownback, Senator Dodd, and Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] for himself, Mr. \n     Coleman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3109.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Montana on the \nfloor, and the Senator from Massachusetts,\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nboth of whom have done so much for working families, as has the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  I bring this bipartisan amendment to the floor tonight because I \nthink it illustrates a point Senator Lott expressed earlier when he \ntalked about updating our laws to make sure they are fair and practical \nfor the times.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, which this amendment speaks to, \nhas been a great asset to folks who have been laid off in the \nmanufacturing sector. It was written more than three decades ago. Of \ncourse, that was the key sector in our economy and still is \ntremendously important today, but the fact is, the trade adjustment law \ntoday doesn't apply to about four-fifths of our workers, the folks who \nhave been laid off in the service sector and in the high-technology \nsector. So what we have is millions of unemployed workers in the \nservice sector and in the high-tech sector who are walking on an \neconomic tightrope every single day, balancing their food costs against \ntheir fuel costs, and their fuel costs against the skyrocketing medical \nbills, as Senator Kennedy has pointed out.\n  What this bipartisan amendment seeks to do is establish parity \nbetween folks in the service and technology sector and those in the \nmanufacturing sector. So people who lose their jobs when their employer \ncloses or lays them off because of import competition, people in the \npublic and private sector who lose their jobs when their facility moves \noverseas, and secondary service workers who provide services to a \nprimary firm where workers are eligible for trade adjustment and whose \nclosure causes the layoff or closure at the secondary firm--when those \npeople are in the high-tech and service sector of our economy, under \nour bipartisan amendment those people would be able to get benefits \nunder the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.\n  In effect, this bipartisan coalition wants to persuade the Senate to \nsupport it. It is a proposition that no matter where an American works, \nif you lose your job because of imports, because your job moves \noffshore, you ought to be able to get retraining, income support, and \nhelp with your health insurance.\n  Workers in the high-tech sector in my home State and across the \ncountry have taken a pounding in recent years. The American Electronics \nAssociation reported recently the tech sector lost 775,000 jobs in 2001 \nto 2003 and another 3.3 million jobs could be lost in the next decade. \nA Deloitte & Touche survey of telecommunication companies forecasts \nthat well over 275,000 jobs, or 5 percent of the total workforce, will \nmove offshore in the next 4 years and more than half of all Fortune 500 \ncompanies are outsourcing software development or expanding their own \noperations overseas.\n  The fact is when you have a software developer earning $6 an hour in \nBangalore, India, and 10 times that amount in Beaverton, OR, every \nsingle day this critical sector of our economy--services and high \ntechnology--faces extraordinarily tough competition. When the starting \nsalary of a software engineer in India is $5,000 and top level IT \nprofessionals earn $20,000 there, you can be sure the competition is \nintense. The question is, Who is going to stand up for these American \nworkers in the high-technology and service sector that plays such a \ncritical role in our economy?\n  Some argue increased trade is an overall plus to the United States \nbecause it lowers prices for consumers. There is no doubt about that. \nThat is why I have consistently supported trade. But there are negative \neffects on some of our workers.\n  Exports of high-tech products from my home State jumped 18 percent \nfrom 2001 to 2002, but in the technology industry jobs fell 11 percent. \nThe Oregon Employment Department reports in the 2001 to 2003 period, \n3,300 computer systems and design jobs were lost, 5,300 professional \nand technical service jobs have been lost, and 1,400 architectural and \nengineering service jobs were lost. Many of these have been lost due to \ntrade.\n  I say it is time to update--as Senator Lott has said--this critical \nlaw, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, so millions of workers in the \nhigh-tech and services sector are not left without a safety net. They \nhave a safety net in the trade adjustment law if they are in the \nmanufacturing sector, and that has been a great benefit to those \nfamilies. But for four-fifths of our workers, those in the high-tech \nand service sector, that safety net has not been there. This bipartisan \namendment will restore it.\n  High-tech workers, as we know, have been the envy of the American \nworkforce. Certainly during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, they \nwere responsible for a tremendous amount of economic growth. The \ningenuity of these programmers, engineers, and designers helped drive \nour economy into the 21st century. The creativity of these workers \ngenerated an exceptional wave of economic prosperity. Trade agreements \non services and intellectual property helped carry the fruit of these \ndedicated workers around the globe.\n  Globalization of technology is unquestionably globalizing the \ntechnology workforce. Geography is increasingly less important in \ndetermining where a job can be done. Globalization of information \ntechnology hardware production from 1995 to 2002 cut information \ntechnology hardware costs 10 to 30 percent, translating into higher \nproductivity growth and adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the \nU.S. gross domestic product. Information technology became affordable \nto business sectors previously bypassed by the productivity boom, \nsmall-sized and mid-sized companies, health care and construction.\n\n  But as information technology hardware prices decline, the importance \nof information technology services and software increased, to almost 70 \npercent of information technology spending in 2001. One economist found \noffshoring reportedly saved most information technology organizations \non the order of from 15 to 25 percent in the first year. With growth in \nsoftware and services outpacing hardware spending by almost two to one, \nthe demand for cheaper information technology services has lent \nstrength to this ``offshoring tsunami'' and hammered many of our \ninformation technology workers in the process.\n  Certainly no one could have anticipated the shocking speed or scale \nof globalization in information technology. The American Electronics \nAssociation 2003 Cyberstates report found unemployment among computer \nprogrammers jumped from 4.5 percent in 2001 to 6.2 percent in 2003; \nthat high-tech employment fell by 540,000 jobs to 6 million in 2002; \nand that a further loss of 234,000 jobs was expected in 2003.\n  Hardly a day goes by without a front-page story in virtually hundreds \nof communities across the country about an American programmer on his \nor her way out having to train a foreign worker who will replace them. \nIt is a very rich irony that some of the same workers who launched the \ntechnology revolution have in fact become its victims.\n  The average American may think the Federal Government is helping \ntechnology and service workers displaced by trade, but it is not. That \nis because a law written in 1962, when so many of our workers were in \nthe manufacturing sector, has not been updated. Now we have tens of \nthousands who have lost jobs in the services sector and the technology \nsector who are not eligible for the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. \nThe bipartisan amendment I offer today will open the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act door to these and other displaced services and \ntechnology sector workers.\n  The act is a lifeline for millions of these workers. It provides \nretraining, income support, a health insurance tax credit, and other \nbenefits to workers who lose their jobs due to trade. It can also help \nsecondary workers who supply parts and services who may lose their jobs \nwhen the facility or service shuts down due to import competition. This \nis exactly the type of help trade-displaced services workers need.\n  A self-described ``newly unemployed software engineer'' from \nHillsboro, OR wrote in December: ``My job was moved to India where the \ncompany can pay Indians a fifth of what they pay Americans.''\n  Another wrote: ``As a 50-year-old high-tech manufacturing engineer \nwith 26 years of experience, I was laid off in December 2002. I am sure \nthe new factory the company is building in China will prevent my ever \nreturning to the company. I can't even get hired into an\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nentry-level position anywhere because I am over-qualified.''\n  These unemployed Oregonians--and there are thousands of others who \nare employed in the information technology sector and the service \nsector who have lost their jobs--deserve to have this law, as our \nfriend from Mississippi, Senator Lott said, updated so they can get \nbenefits in the safety net the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act offers. \nI have heard the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts champion \nthis.\n\n  It is in effect a trampoline that allows individuals in our country \nwho have been laid off through no fault of their own to get the \ntraining and the assistance and the kind of health care to in effect \nbounce back in our economy.\n  It seems to me workers reeling from the offshoring of service sector \njobs cannot afford to wait for the higher skilled jobs that economists \nkeep promising them are just around the corner. Higher value, higher \npaid systems integration jobs may come along, but I am telling you in \nmy home State--and I think in communities across the country--a lot of \nunemployed information technology professionals think they are more \nlikely to see Elvis than a sudden proliferation of help-wanted ads for \nnew, highly skilled information technology jobs.\n  When a worker is displaced by trade, it should be irrelevant whether \nthe person worked in services or technology or manufacturing. Every \nworker displaced by trade should be eligible for this very same \nbenefit. This bipartisan amendment ensures that will be the case.\n  I again thank the distinguished Senator from Montana, my friend \nSenator Baucus. He has been so helpful to me on this and so many other \nmatters during my service in the Senate.\n  I also thank the Senator from Minnesota who will be joining us. He \nhas worked with the distinguished Senator from Montana and me on this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has joined us. But we have colleagues who \ncome from every part of the country who have joined us. Senator \nBrownback has joined us, Senator Snowe has joined us, Senator Dodd has \njoined us, and Senator Coleman, Senator Baucus, and Senator \nRockefeller. * * * very hopeful that the Senate will resoundingly \nsupport this bipartisan amendment. This is about updating a law that is \nnow more than three decades old, a law that does not cover services and \nhigh technology, to the detriment of millions of workers. We have a \nbipartisan proposal that allows that. I thank my good friend from \nMontana.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon. He has \nworked very hard on this issue. It is, frankly, a very bright spot in \nthis whole bill. That is, it is a major way to help people who need \nhelp. It has been worked out very aggressively and thoroughly by an \nawful lot of Senators.\n  The real leader is the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. He has done a \nwonderful job talking with lots of different Senators and working out \nthe different points of view to come together with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         prescription drug card\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Bush administration drug cards do not \npass the truth in advertising test. They are no solution to sky-high \ndrug prices, and there will not be a solution until we have a President \nand Congress who care about fairness for patients instead of higher \nprofits for pharamaceutical companies. The drug companies keep gouging \nall Americans on exorbitant drug prices, and the Bush administration \nkeeps cheering them on. It is no accident that the drug companies are \nworking ``hand in pocket'' with the administration in hyping these \ncards and keeping prices high.\n  The Bush administration has a perfect batting average on providing \ninformation to the American public about Medicare--they are misleading \nevery single time, and the drug cards are no exception. In the great \ntradition of suppressed cost estimates and false advertising comes the \nnew revelation that the administration cannot even give the public \nhonest figures about prices for drugs under the new cards.\n  The millions of taxpayer dollars that the Bush administration is \nspending to peddle its plan cannot disguise the fact that seniors would \nget a better deal taking a bus to Canada to buy drugs at fair prices \nthere.\n  The drug cards will offer small discounts from already inflated \nprices. It is like used car dealers who raise prices just before \ncustomers come to the lot, so they can offer phony discounts and make \nit sound like a bargain. Studies show that the savings from the cards \nare not significantly better than those provided by already existing \ndiscount programs.\n  Unfortunately, there is no lemon law for these drug cards. If seniors \nsign up for a card that does not deliver the promised discounts, too \nbad. They are stuck with it. The card companies can change their \ndiscounts every week, but seniors are locked in for a year on the card \nthey choose. The card companies don't even have to pass all the \ndiscounts from drug companies along to patients. They can keep their \nkickbacks and let seniors foot the bill.\n  Let's end these deceptive tricks and find honest solutions to the \ncrisis of excessive costs for prescription drugs. Americans should be \nable to buy safe drugs from abroad at the same fair prices that \nCanadians or Europeans pay. Medicare should be able to use the \npurchasing power of 40 million beneficiaries to negotiate the same low \nprices on prescription drugs that the Veteran's Administration \nnegotiates for veterans. But the Bush administration won't allow that. \nWhy not? Because it is joined at the wallet with drug companies and \ntheir armies of lobbyists and tens of millions of dollars in campaign \ncontributions.\n  Senior citizens want a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nAmericans want fair prices for prescription drugs. The Bush \nadministration and Republicans in Congress offer slick advertisements, \na well-oiled public relations machine, and lots of promises, but no \nperformance. It is time for a change.\n  I will share with the Senate exactly what these cards will do and \nwhat they will not do. This chart is entitled, ``The Medicare Drug \nCards: No substitute for real cost savings.'' This is the cost of a 1-\nmonth supply of the top 10 drugs which seniors most often use. This \nline represents the U.S. Federal supply schedule, $587. That is the \ncost under the VA system through the negotiation. It is $596 for the \nsame 1-month supply of the top 10 drugs for Canada; $972 at Walgreens. \nRXSavings is $1,046, with $1,061 for the PCA, the two Medicare drug \ncards.\n  If we had in the Medicare bill the ability for the Secretary of HHS \nto negotiate the prices down, we would be at $587 or the $596. Instead, \nit is the higher figure.\n  This next chart shows the same thing. These prices available to \nMedicare beneficiaries are well below the prices available with the new \nMedicare discount cards. Again, the price for the market basket of the \ntop 10 drugs, drugstore.com, $959. This is without any annual fee. The \nannual fees can go up to $30 in Medicare. You cannot go above $30. \nUnder Costco.com, $990 with no fee. Total cost is $959 and $990. Under \nWalgreens, it is $972. The annual fee of $20 puts it at $992. Pharmacy \nRXSavings is $1,046 with a $30 annual fee, to put it at $1,076. At \nPharmacy Care Alliance, $1,061, plus $19 for the annual fee, and that \nequals $1,080.\n  This is what could be received today. It clearly reflects no savings \non this. The other chart showed the difference if we had in the \nMedicare bill the ability for real negotiations. We would have the \nsavings reflected in the VA or as it is in Canada.\n  The administration now is pulling out all the stops in terms of what \nit is going to do for the seniors. This does not pass the truth in \nadvertising test. It is not effective savings at all. Our seniors are \nable to receive better pricing through drugstore.com and Costco.com.\n  This is a continuation of the kind of challenge we are facing. \nHopefully, before the end of this session we will have the opportunity \nto get back to doing something about real negotiations on prescription \ndrugs.\n\n\n                                 Sudan\n\n  Mr. President, I commend the Foreign Relations Committee for its \naction last week in reporting a resolution urging action by the United \nStates and the international community to respond to the ongoing ethnic \nviolence in Sudan. The Senate should act on this resolution as soon as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\n  It has been 10 years since the Rwanda genocide. A decade ago, 8,000 \nRwandans were being killed every day, yet the international community \nwas silent. We did not stop the deaths of 800,000 Tutsis and \npolitically moderate Hutu, in spite of our commitment that genocide \nmust never again darken the annals of human history.\n  Sadly, we may now be repeating the same mistake in Sudan.\n  In 1998, President Clinton made a special visit to Kigali, Rwanda's \ncapital, ``partly,'' he said, ``in recognition of the fact that we in \nthe United States and the world community did not do as much as we \ncould have and should have done to try to limit what occurred'' in \nRwanda. His visit and strong words remind us that we must not hesitate \nto act, when the horror is clear and when so many lives may be lost.\n  Over the past few weeks, reports of severe ethnic violence have come \nfrom Darfur, a region of western Sudan. We have heard accounts of \nthousands or even tens of thousands of people murdered, of widespread \nrape, and of people's homes burned to the ground.\n  The Sudanese government has refused to allow full access to western \nSudan. International monitors and humanitarian workers have been \nprevented from reaching the area. We need immediate access to gather \nmore information on what is happening and to provide urgent \nhumanitarian relief to the one million people the United Nations \nreports have been displaced internally in Sudan or across the border to \nChad.\n  Many of us hoped that the humanitarian cease-fire and agreement \nearlier this month between the Sudanese Government and rebel forces in \nwestern Sudan would end the many months of violence against entire \ncommunities. It has not. The bombing of villages by the Sudanese Air \nForce continues, and so does the mayhem by the paramilitary forces \nunleashed by the Government of Sudan.\n\n  The burning of homes and crops of desperately poor villagers has left \nin its ashes a humanitarian disaster. Without immediate relief, experts \npredict deaths in the hundreds of thousands. The cruelty of the \nGovernment of Sudan and its paramilitary allies against other ethnic \ngroups raises the very real specter of genocide.\n  The United States and the international community need to act now, to \nstop this brutality, to save lives.\n  President Bush should make a strong public statement alerting the \nworld to the violence in Darfur. He should call the international \ncommunity to action, and increase pressure on the Sudanese Government. \nDoing so would send a strong signal that the international community \nwill not accept these continuing atrocities. Sudan has been seeking \nbetter relations with the United States. It must be told that our \nNation will have no relations with a genocidal government.\n  The United States should propose a resolution in the United Nations \nSecurity Council to condemn the violations of international law being \ncommitted in Darfur, particularly the indiscriminate targeting of \ncivilians and the obstruction of humanitarian aid by the government. \nThe U.N. should demand immediate international access to the region to \nassess the full scale of the need for assistance. The U.N. should also \ninsist on adequate support for international human rights monitors and \nfor monitors of the cease-fire agreement reached last week.\n  The international community must demand that Sudan stop the violence \nnow, and give full humanitarian access to Darfur without question or \nqualification.\n  To minimize the suffering of those affected by the violence, we \nshould immediately identify funds and food aid to meet at least the \ntraditional U.S. share of the $110 million appeal from the U.N. Office \nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to support urgently needed \nassistance for internally displaced persons and refugees. These \ninternally displaced persons and refugees must also be allowed by the \nSudanese Government and militias to return safely to their homes, to \nrebuild their lives and communities, as soon as possible.\n  The European community, African countries and the rest of the \ninternational community should use their considerable influence to \npressure Sudan to end the violence in Darfur, and end it now.\n  If the international community fails to act--and to act now--the \nconsequences will be dire.\n  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan was eloquent in his \nstatement at the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Rwanda \ngenocide. He said that he would not permit Darfur to become the first \ngenocide of the 21st century.\n  There will be discussion in Washington and around the world about \nwhether the ethnic violence in Darfur is, in fact, genocide, but we \ncannot allow the debate over definitions obstruct our ability to act as \nsoon as possible.\n  It is a matter of the highest moral responsibility for each of us \nindividually, for Congress, for the United States, and for the global \ncommunity to do all we can to stop the violence against innocents in \nDarfur. We must act, because thousands of people's lives will be lost \nif we don't.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see Senator Coleman of Minnesota on the \nfloor. I want to say how much I deeply appreciate all the effort he has \nundertaken on behalf of the pending amendment. He is one of the two or \nthree who worked mightily to get this amendment in shape. I want the \npeople in Minnesota and our Senators to know how much he has done. I am \nvery honored to have been a part of his team in working with him as he \nhas crafted and offered this amendment we are now debating.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Montana for his kind words and for giving me the opportunity to \nwork with him in a bipartisan manner on this important amendment. \nActually, earlier this year, I was able to join with my friend, Senator \nBaucus, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, in introducing \nlegislation to extend trade adjustment assistance to American service \nsector workers. I call that good Minnesota commonsense legislation.\n  Today I rise to join Senators Wyden and Baucus to offer a modified \nversion of this important legislation as an amendment to the JOBS \nbill. Our amendment not only extends trade adjustment assistance to \nservice sector workers, but also improves and strengthens the TAA \nprogram for all American workers.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, if you care about the issue of offshoring and \noutsourcing and are searching for a positive, constructive, forward-\nlooking way of addressing these challenges, this is it. I say to my \ncolleagues, if you support trade and expanding trade opportunities, but \nrecognize that along the way there are going to be some workers who are \ngoing to be hurt as we grow and expand--and we need to grow and expand; \nand trade is part of that--we can address that.\n  I am a strong supporter of trade adjustment assistance because trade \nadjustment assistance is critical to achieving a balance: the expansion \nof trade but meeting the needs of those workers who are negatively \nimpacted.\n  Earlier when Senator Wyden, my colleague from Oregon, spoke, he \ntalked about the bipartisan support this amendment appreciates and \nenjoys. Senator Smith has supported this legislation, and Senator \nSnowe, Senator Brownback, and many others.\n  It is also important to note this legislation has received industry \nsupport--most notably support from the Information Technology Industry \nAssociation and the Business Roundtable--for extending TAA to service \nsector workers.\n  The TAA program has a history that dates back more than 40 years. The \nprogram was created in the early 1960s, and it is fascinating to go \nback and review the speeches President Kennedy and Members of Congress \nmade on this same topic more than 4 decades ago.\n  We often assume issues such as globalization and the offshoring and \noutsourcing of jobs are new issues, but it is striking to note how some \nof the arguments we hear being made today were made 40 years ago. Of \ncourse, some of the terms used, such as ``globalization,'' are of \nrecent vintage. But the underlying desire to address the needs of these \nwho are harmed by\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\ntrade is almost identical to those discussed 40 years ago.\n  At that time, the President and Congress agreed to go forward in the \npursuit of free trade, but they also agreed to provide financial \nsupport to workers who lose their jobs and to provide retraining \nbenefits to assist them in finding new jobs.\n  Over the years, some of the specifics of the program have changed. \nSome initiatives have worked and others have not worked so well. The \nTAA program has evolved as we have learned more and faced new \nchallenges.\n  The most comprehensive effort to update TAA was in the Trade Act of \n2002. In much the same way they had 40 years ago, the President and \nCongress decided to pursue a policy to go forward, seeking the benefits \nof free trade, and decided to build a comprehensive program to deal \nwith the needs of those harmed by trade.\n  I will not try to list every single amendment to TAA made in that \nlegislation; There are simply too many to mention. But in the 2 years \nthat have passed, we have seen things that have worked and seen things \nthat need improvement. Addressing the shortcomings is the impetus for \nthe amendment we are offering now.\n  This amendment may not address all the problems with regard to TAA. \nIn a number of areas, such as the new program for farmers, the solution \nmay simply be more vigorous congressional oversight to ensure the \nprogram lives up to the law. The Court of International Trade has \ncriticized some of the administrative decisions made in implementing \nthe program. This may be a place where Congress should step in to see \nthat the ideas it put into legislation become a reality.\n\n  Our amendment makes at least one commonsense fix to a problem our \ndairy farmers are having with the program. We worked closely with the \nNational Milk Producers Federation on a solution to this problem.\n  I would add that although President Kennedy advocated TAA for farmers \nsome 40 years ago, it did not come about until a couple years ago, and \nprobably never would have come about but for the hard work and efforts \nof the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley. Senator \nGrassley said at that time:\n\n       I am very concerned that if we lose farm support for free \n     trade it will be very hard for us to win congressional \n     support for new trade deals when they are concluded.\n\n  Some good food for thought for the folks who administer this program: \nWe have to make this program work for the farm industry.\n  With regard to the taconite workers in my State, I believe vigorous \noversight can help the Department of Labor find ways to use TAA to \naddress their concerns. Here again, we have made one legislative \nmodification in hopes of putting this issue to bed for good. This is \ngood news for the Iron Range in Minnesota.\n  In other areas, new problems requiring legislation have become \napparent. There have been numerous newspaper stories in recent months \ncovering the tragedy of computer programmers and others who have seen \ntheir jobs move to India and elsewhere. From reading these stories, one \nmight think these are obvious cases for TAA, but most of these computer \nworkers have been denied TAA because they produce ``services'' and TAA \npresently only covers ``goods.'' Since the overwhelming majority of \nworking Americans are officially classified as service workers, this is \nan enormously significant distinction.\n  I note that in conversation with many of my colleagues, I am not sure \nthey are even aware the current law does not cover service \nworkers. There was a sense, when we passed TAA, that we covered the \nneeds of those who were impacted negatively by trade. But the reality \nis, 80 percent of the workers are service workers. They are not \ncurrently protected. This amendment would do that.\n\n  This is an area where I understand some litigation is underway, but \nwe do not have to wait for a court to decide. It seems obvious that \nworkers employed as computer programmers are just as unemployed as \nworkers in a textile factory when they lose their jobs. They should be \nentitled to the same benefits. Splitting hairs in defining services and \ngoods misses the undeniable point that service workers deserve no less \nthan workers in the ``goods'' sector.\n  Specifically this amendment would make three important changes to the \nTAA program to ensure service workers are treated fairly.\n  First, in cases in which service workers lose their jobs because of \nservice imports, these workers are made eligible for TAA. The best \nknown example of a situation similar to this is the case of Mexican \ntrucking firms which are striving to carry freight within the United \nStates. U.S. truck drivers that might lose their jobs to such \ncompetition would be eligible for TAA under this amendment.\n  Second, service workers who lose their jobs when the facility they \nwork in moves out of the United States--the problem we have read about \nin recent months--would be eligible for TAA. Thus, under this \namendment, if a call center or computer programming facility moves from \nMinneapolis to India, the workers would be eligible for TAA.\n  Finally, in those cases where the service workers provide services to \na plant or facility that closes, moves, or reduces employment, these \nworkers are eligible for TAA if the primary plant or facility is \neligible for TAA. This simply parallels the so-called secondary workers \nprovisions now in the law for workers producing goods.\n  For example, under present law, if a U.S. plant producing lawnmowers \ncloses due to import competition, the workers at the plant and the \nworkers at the facilities that supply lawnmower parts to the \nmanufacturing plant would be eligible for TAA. But if the closed \nlawnmower plant contracted for janitorial services, the janitorial \nworkers that lose their jobs would not be covered. This amendment \neliminates this obvious inequity and treats the workers that provide \nservices to the lawnmower plant just as it does those who assemble \nlawnmower motors.\n  The issue of TAA has special significance to airline workers from my \nState and around the country. Last night members of the Aircraft \nMechanics Fraternal Association flew from Minnesota to Washington to \nshare their stories and the stories of workers they represent from all \naround the country with some of my colleagues who represent their \nmembership. These folks represent service workers who, when they lose \ntheir jobs, receive little if any help in getting back on their feet. \nFolks like George Sleva of Forest Lake, MN, and Kurt Kulschar from \nLakeville, MN, are just some of the airline mechanics left out in the \ncold under the current TAA program. One of the guys described it this \nway:\n\n       I worked hard. I was a great taxpayer. Everything was going \n     well. And then the table turned and now I'm in a world of \n     hurt.\n\n  Our amendment would take some of the sting out of this world of hurt \nthat thousands like George and Kurt have had to go through.\n\n  The second major feature of this amendment provides TAA benefits to \nall workers who lose their jobs when the plant or facility that employs \nthem closes and moves out of the United States, regardless of where the \nplant moves. Thus, if the lawnmower plant closed and moved out of the \ncountry, its workers and those supplies would be covered regardless of \nwhether the plant moved to Canada or to China or to India. I was \ndisappointed to learn recently that the 2002 law apparently requires \nthat if a factory closes and moves to Mexico, its workers are \nautomatically eligible for TAA, but if the same plant moves to China, \nthey are not. This is one of those things that Lincoln talked about, a \n``skunks giving their own publicity'' kind of thing. It doesn't make \nsense. It is obvious to make the change, and this amendment makes that \nkind of change.\n  But we can clear up the air, if you will, or any ambiguity by \nrewriting the law to clearly state that all workers who lose their jobs \nwhen their employers leave the country are eligible for TAA regardless \nof the country they move to. That makes sense. That is what this \namendment does. I want to applaud President Bush's strong leadership in \nthis area. I appreciate the administration's shared goal that TAA \ncoverage should be expanded to include workers affected by shifts in \nproduction to any country, not just Mexico or Canada.\n  One of the most valuable portions of the 2002 act was the extension \nof a tax credit for health insurance to TAA\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nworkers. Without some assistance to gain health insurance for \nthemselves and their families, it is hard to imagine that workers could \nreally take advantage of TAA. The amendment we are offering improves \nthis health insurance provision in several important ways. First, it \nmakes a series of technical amendments to ensure that TAA recipients \nget a meaningful opportunity to really obtain health insurance. The \nmost important provision on this topic, however, raises the percentage \nof health insurance costs covered by the program from 65 percent in \nexisting law to 75 percent. This is the same level of health insurance \npremium assistance that workers in the private sector receive.\n  I understand this was the provision when TAA was passed in 2002 that \nthe Senate advocated at 75 percent. Affordability of health insurance \nis a problem for everyone, but for people who have lost their jobs, it \nis of particular hardship. This amendment improves affordability of \nhealth insurance, which will improve access to care, a goal we all can \nagree upon.\n  One of the problems that have limited the effectiveness of the \ncurrent health care system is dislocated workers have had difficulty \nfinding the 35 percent of the health insurance bill that must come out \nof their pocket. I am sure that for many workers it will still be a \nchallenge to find 25 percent as required under this amendment, but our \namendment will make it a little bit easier.\n  I know that some will say that including health care provisions in \nTAA is controversial, but it is important for all Senators to \nunderstand that this concept was originally advanced by a bipartisan \nTrade Deficit Review Commission, a bipartisan group with some very \nprominent Republican members, including Ambassador Robert Zoellick, \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and former President Bush's Trade \nRepresentative Carla Hills. I emphasize that the recommendation for \ntransitional health insurance was supported unanimously by the \nCommission.\n\n  Finally, this amendment would allow wage insurance to be extended to \nworkers who are 40 years of age or older. The current law only applies \nto workers over 50. In my opinion, wage insurance makes sense for \nworkers over 50, but I think it also makes sense for workers who are 20 \nyears old. It may be that traditional retraining will also benefit \nworkers in their 20s just as it might workers in their 50s, but I think \nthat is a decision best left to the individual worker and not one best \nmade by government.\n  Given the fact that we are still building a record on wage insurance, \nthis amendment only lowers the requirement to 40 years of age. This is \ncertainly a step in the right direction and is likely to allow many \nworkers to make choices with where they want to go in their career and \nhow best to prepare for their new jobs.\n  Also I note the maximum cost of wage insurance under the law is less \nthan the maximum cost of traditional TAA under current law. In other \nwords, wage insurance might also be a cheap approach to retraining. We \nshould make it available to as many TAA recipients as possible for \ntheir own good and to limit the burden on the Federal budget.\n  There are many other good ideas for improvement in the TAA program, \nbut this amendment makes some important steps forward and deserves the \nsupport of the Senate.\n  In my opinion, TAA is an honest, responsible, productive way to \ndirectly address the needs of those harmed by trade and globalization. \nThere are real needs out there as evidenced by the hundreds of \napplications from my home State of Minnesota alone, hundreds of which \nhave been certified and probably nearly as many denied for the reasons \nthis amendment today seeks to address.\n  When I was mayor of St. Paul, I used to point out that the best \nwelfare program was a job; the best housing program was a job. Access \nto health care often comes with a job. Putting people back to work in a \njob is exactly what TAA is designed to do. Of course, there is no \nsingle solution to all the problems, but TAA is a real solution not \njust a snake oil suggestion.\n  It is a real chance to address the needs of workers, and as such it \ncan do a great deal to help Americans adjust and prosper through the \nchallenges of globalization and offshoring. TAA is not free. It will \nrequire an investment of resources to make it work. But if it can help \nall Americans grow and prosper in a competitive global economy, it is \nmoney well spent. I note in this regard that we have identified a full \nbudget offset for our amendment, an offset recognized by Treasury and \nOMB as saving about $5.7 billion over the course of 10 years.\n  America cannot turn its back on trade. To do so would be bad policy. \nBut America must not turn its back on our working men and women either. \nTo do so would be wrong. Trade adjustment assistance is a way to \nembrace both trade and our Nation's hard-working men or women. It is \nthe right thing do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first, I thank, again, my good friends \nfrom Minnesota and Oregon, Senators Coleman and Wyden, for their very \nstrong work on this amendment. I support this very strongly for a \nspecial reason. I have the privilege of representing the State of \nMontana. About 20 years ago, Montana lost a lot of copper miners and \nsmelter workers. Why? Because of foreign competition. At the time it \nwas probably employment overseas--in Chile, for example--and, in \naddition, it was the subsidized smelter operations north of the border \nin Canada. These folks worked very hard, and it affected the lives of a \nlot of these men, and sometimes women, who held these jobs for a few \ngenerations. We had created trade adjustment assistance for these \nworkers.\n  I can tell you a lot of people who lost their jobs on account of \ntrade were able to get some retraining, get a lifeline thrown to them \nbecause they had no place else to go. Many of them were 45, 50, 55 \nyears old. They didn't know what to do. There were no other jobs \naround. Those were good-paying jobs, very good-paying jobs. We had TAA. \nI remember that I had to do battle with the Department of Labor to get \nthe Montanans who were laid off; in this case, they were smelter \nworkers. Finally, we got a little relief from the Department of Labor \nat the time when trade adjustment assistance was granted--not in very \nlarge measure, but it was granted to smelter workers particularly in \nMontana. You could see it was just enough to keep them from being \ntotally despondent. Those were the early days of TAA. The retraining \nprovisions really didn't work terribly well. But based upon my \nexperience with TAA in Montana, I see the great need for training.\n  Now, clearly, the need for retraining workers who lose their jobs on \naccount of trade is even greater than it was back then. It is much \ngreater now for a few reasons. No. 1, the United States is much more \nengaged in a global economy. We are so interrelated worldwide. It is \nmuch more likely, therefore, that the actions taken by a headquarters \nin Tokyo, or in any other country around the world, has a direct affect \non workers in the United States, and vice versa. American global \ncompanies, or multinational companies, have to compete vigorously in \norder to stay in existence. It is a very competitive world.\n  Other countries have very aggressive ways to help their companies. We \nknow many of them are subsidized in ways that are not available in the \nUnited States. Other companies are helped by their host countries. In \nmany ways, American companies are not helped by America. It is \nbasically because we have much more of a free enterprise system. Our \nFounding Fathers came over from England years ago and wanted freedom \nand independence--``go West young man,'' and sending a man to the Moon. \nWe are an entrepreneurial country. We like freedom. We like doing \nthings more on our own. It is probably one of the main reasons the \nUnited States has become such a great country. That is why we are, in \nsome respects, the biggest and strongest and wealthiest country in the \nworld.\n  Global competition has been very good for the United States. I think \nthat is probably because we are a little more entrepreneurial. We try a \nlittle harder and we are probably a little more creative. It is because \nof the nature of what it is to be an American. At\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nthe same time, clearly, the jobs in America are in greater jeopardy as \na consequence than they were 20 or 30 years ago. It is because of this \ncompetition. You will also find that a category of jobs is in greater \njeopardy today, and those are service industry jobs. Why? Because of \nthe unbelievable advances in technology, particularly communications \ntechnology. Information is now digitized. We have much more broadband \ncapability worldwide. So a lot of services, whether financial services, \nmedical services, or many kinds of services, can be sent by wire or by \nspeed of light anyplace in the world. People around the world are \ntaking advantage of that. They are training people maybe at a lower \nwage, so the American jobs that otherwise were here can go overseas, \nand vice versa. All countries are finding that their employees are \nlosing jobs on account of trade. All the major countries are finding \nthat. Germany is finding that, as are France, Japan, and others.\n\n  We are also finding that we are all losing jobs due to outsourcing, \noffshoring. In effect, jobs are going overseas. But on a net effect, we \nare still creating many more jobs than we are losing.\n  Having said all that, the purpose of this amendment is to address one \npart of the competitiveness problem. That is, what do we do about the \npeople who lose jobs through no fault of their own? Clearly, we should \ncome up with something. The answer in this bill is trade adjustment \nassistance. It is expanding the current trade adjustment assistance \nprogram that applies only to manufacturing workers to also service \nindustry workers who lose their jobs. We have heard some describe some \nadditional provisions of this trade adjustment assistance amendment. It \nis attractive in some cases and has good health benefits. That is \nimportant, too, because the current trade adjustment assistance hasn't \nbeen working terribly well. One reason is because the health provisions \ndon't work well. The lingo is the ``uptake,'' or whatever it is. What \nit comes down to is, how many people who theoretically qualify for \nhealth insurance benefits under trade adjustment assistance actually \ntake them? The answer is a very low percentage, 2 or 3 percent. It is \nbecause there are so many bureaucratic hurdles, procedural hurdles, and \nit is so difficult.\n  We made a lot of changes in this bill so that more people who lose \ntheir jobs on account of trade also are able to get not only retrained, \nbut get health insurance benefits, where they pay 25 percent and the \nGovernment will pay the rest for a certain period of time. As we all \nknow, when you lose your job, you often lose your health insurance. If \nyou lose your health insurance, it is a double whammy. Not only have \nyou lost your job, but you cannot pay the medical bills.\n  This throws in a lifeline and helps people who lose jobs on account \nof trade. As has been stated, it is totally bipartisan. We are working \non both sides of the aisle. Why is it bipartisan? It is because it is \nthat important, it makes that much common sense, and it is very much \nthe right thing to do. I am very proud to be associated and working \nwith the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Minnesota. I thank \nthem very much for their good effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I see my colleagues still in the Chamber. I \nthank the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Minnesota, \nespecially as the Senator from Montana touched on the issue of health \ninsurance costs for people who have been laid off in high-tech and the \nmanufacturing sector. As we heard earlier, these are folks who are \ngetting hit by a wrecking ball with respect to health care. They \nliterally have nowhere to turn. Many of them are not old enough for \nMedicare, not poor enough for Medicaid. They don't fit into a lot of \nthe categories--these boxes by which you get health care in our \ncountry.\n  So what we did in these bipartisan negotiations--and the Senator from \nMinnesota was particularly helpful, but I also commend the Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, who is very much involved in this \neffort to get a bipartisan agreement with respect to a 75-percent \nallocation of the coverage--we were able to add critical benefits for \nspouses, which is something that was so important to help people where \nthere was an interruption in coverage.\n  So what the Senator from Montana has outlined with respect to health \ncare issues was exactly, in my view, how the Senate ought to move to \ndeal with a very real problem but to do it in a bipartisan way. As we \nbegan those discussions, we had some folks who wanted to go even higher \nthan the number we set out. Some people said you cannot go there at all \nbecause of the deficit.\n   But we made the judgment on a bipartisan basis that you could not \nafford not to cover these people because if, for example, as has been \ndocumented in the Finance Committee, these people cannot get coverage \non an outpatient basis, what will happen again and again is they will \nface the need to have more extensive and much more expensive medical \nservices. I was very glad the Senator from Montana brought up the \nbipartisan agreement as it related to the health care issue.\n  The Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller, were especially helpful in the efforts led by the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask my friend a question? Is it \nalso true that other Senators have contributed to portions of this \nlegislation, such as Senator Bingaman who added a provision with \nrespect to trade adjustment assistance on communities; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator from Montana is absolutely right. A lot of \nSenators have been at this issue for many of years. Senator Bingaman's \ncontribution with respect to community services in the health care area \nis very important. I heard my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, \ntalk about the health care needs of folks laid off in the high-tech and \nservice areas. He has been supportive as well.\n  The Senator from Montana is absolutely right. There have been a lot \nof Senators who have been at it with respect to this issue. It is a \nbipartisan proposal, but right at the heart of that is dealing with the \nhealth care issue. Health care, as we all know, has been the toughest \nissue for the Senate to deal with for some time. This is an area where \nthere has been a real breakthrough with respect to health care. It had \nto be bipartisan--the Senator from Montana is right--or a lot of \nSenators would not be involved.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I also ask a question of my good friend from \nMinnesota? This amendment adds new dollars for retraining. Doesn't the \nSenator agree that the new jobs in the future are going to have to be, \nfor want of a better expression, smarter jobs; that is, even someone \nwho repairs automobiles today has to understand computers? You do not \njust have a wrench and a screwdriver these days to build and repair \ncars; you have to learn computer skills, maybe programming skills. \nIsn't it true, if we are going to compete in the world, that we have to \nspend a lot of time and effort on retraining because of the additional \nneeds in the future, and that is another reason for supporting this \namendment?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my friend, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, is absolutely correct. We have the strongest economy \nin the world. The way we are going to keep that strong economy and keep \nmoving forward is if we have the best training and the best skilled \nworkers.\n  The reality is the jobs of yesterday may not be the jobs of today or \ntomorrow. So my friend from Montana is correct in what this amendment \ndoes. It provides opportunity for those who may be impacted by a job \nthat may be a job of yesterday, to give them an opportunity to have a \njob of tomorrow to take care of their families.\n  I also note in response to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, in \ntalking about the health insurance provisions, we are talking about a \ntax credit. This is a tax credit. I think that is important. I support \ntax credits. I think that is a very fiscally responsible way to provide \nopportunities.\n\n  I also note that under the existing TAA, I believe less than 5 \npercent of those eligible are using this tax credit. The Senate \noriginally intended to do better than that. I was not here in 2002. I \nam still relatively new in this body, but I have to believe that my \ncolleagues, when they enacted the tax credit, the health insurance \nprovision,\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nanticipated that more folks would take advantage of it. The reality is \nthey have not. What we are doing here is providing an opportunity to \nmake use of something that I believe was the intention of my \ncolleagues.\n  As I noted earlier, I found it fascinating in talking with many of my \ncolleagues about the idea that we should extend this to service workers \nthat many of them actually presumed they were included. I think there \nwas an intention in extending TAA 2002 to cover those impacted. What \nthis amendment does is expand it.\n  I ask a question of my colleague from Oregon, and Oregon is a State \nknown as one of the high-tech centers of this country, is it correct, \nas I understand, that both the Business Roundtable representing \nemployers and the High-Tech Council have indicated their support of \nextending TAA to service workers?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is right. In addition to the bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, there has been very significant bipartisan \nsupport in the business community. There are an awful lot of business \nleaders who have been looking for these kinds of ideas that the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has really touched on. This is a question of updating \nour law. I don't think anybody got up in the morning years ago and \nsaid: Let's be rotten to service workers. That was not what happened at \nall. I think people just did not really see what a critical role \nservice and high technology were going to play in the economy. The \nbusiness organizations that the Senator from Minnesota has mentioned \ndo. They get it. They understand it is absolutely critical to not leave \nsomething like four-fifths of the workers behind.\n  I join with the Senator from Minnesota and commend him and thank him \nfor his support.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. If the Senator will yield for another question, in \naddition to updating this law, would it be fair to say it would make it \neasier for folks to use? Today, for instance, current law makes it \nautomatic that you get TAA if it is with a country that has an \nagreement with the United States. So Mexico and Canada fit into that \nlaw. As we read the papers, so many jobs we are talking about today \nthat negatively impact workers are jobs that may be lost to China and \nIndia. Would it be fair to say in addition to updating, we make it \neasier for workers negatively impacted to take advantage of provisions \nunder law?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is right. I think it is fair to say that the \ncertification process today for the workers is almost a kind of \nbureaucratic water torture. It involves essentially a different process \nwith different countries.\n  What we tried to do in our bipartisan discussions is to try to \nstreamline the process, make it worker friendly. I think this is really \ngoing to expedite the processing, expedite the certification.\n  Obviously when these families are hurting--and we are talking about \npeople who have been laid off after years and years of employment--they \nare on this economic tightrope trying to figure out how to balance and \npay for essentials. The last thing they need to do is jump through hoop \nafter bureaucratic hoop to get these benefits. The Senator from \nMinnesota is right, that is a significant improvement as well.\n  Nobody knows more about this subject than the Senator from Montana \nbecause he and his staff have worked on this issue at length. \nStreamlining is very helpful.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, again I thank the Senator from Oregon and \nthe Senator from Montana for the opportunity I had to work with them on \nthis amendment. I am pleased we are able to include Senator Snowe's TAA \nfor communities bill and Senator Allen's Homestead Act that will \nprotect dislocated workers' mortgages and their homes. Those are also \nincluded. I think it adds to the broad bipartisan support this \namendment enjoys.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at one time I had the floor. I yield at \nthis point and again hope the Senate will support the bipartisan \ninitiative that has involved many months of work and is critically \nneeded in the economic challenges we face today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have made good progress today. The \nSenate has had good debate on the Harkin overtime amendment, finally. \nSenator Collins has proposed an amendment on manufacturing jobs credit. \nSenator Wyden and Senator Coleman have offered their amendment on trade \nadjustment assistance. I am hopeful the Senate will be able to vote in \nrelation to these amendments tomorrow afternoon.\n  We are also looking forward to Senators Dorgan and Mikulski having an \nopportunity to offer their amendment on runaway plants tomorrow. \nThereafter, we hope to continue to work through other amendments as \nthey become available. We hope to continue to make good progress with \namendments and completion of this bill on a fairly timely basis.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues very much for the work we have done \ntoday. We are off to a very good start.\n  I just feel that we are going to make our way through this bill this \nweek. At least that is my hope. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What is the status of the Senate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Harkin amendment is pending to S. 1637.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    A Positive Presidential Campaign\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very happy for all Nevadans today that \nSenator Kerry is now beginning a message of positive accomplishments in \nthe State of Nevada. We have waited some time for this. The Democratic \nnominee was really selected the first part of March. During the 60 days \nsince then, Senator Kerry has been obligated to get his campaign in \norder after the very difficult and hectic primary.\n  Of course, during this period of time there has been $70 million \nspent to try to define him in a way that was very negative. Senator \nKerry's message beginning today is one of a very positive message. It, \nof course, talks about his being a combat veteran and having received a \nnumber of awards for heroism during the time he fought in the jungles \nof southeast Asia. Senator Kerry not only was decorated for his \nbravery, but some of those acts of bravery occurred during a time when \nhe was injured.\n  One time when he was injured, he directed fire to protect somebody \nwho had been knocked off his swift boat into the water, and Senator \nKerry himself brought this man to safety even though Senator Kerry \nhimself was injured at the time.\n  The message to the people of Nevada is that he cares about people, \nespecially the middle class. He is a man of principle. I have served \nwith Senator Kerry now in Congress for some 22 years. He has had \nextensive experience in State government. He has served the people of \nMassachusetts now for 30 years. I believe he is a man of integrity and \nthat he will establish to the people of this country that he believes \nin a stronger America. I am very happy the message that is being \npronounced today in the State of Nevada and other places in the country \nis one of a positive nature. I think we need that.\n  I hope this campaign for the Presidency of the United States can talk \nabout the positive of each of the two men running for President. I can \nremember when I first ran for public office, no one would ever consider \na negative campaign ad. You searched for what was in your record that \nyou could give to the people, in my instance the State of Nevada, and \nsometimes as a young man it was very hard to find things because you \nhad not had much experience. But these two men now are very mature and \nboth should run on what they can give the American people and not try \nto downgrade and belittle the other. I repeat that I hope the campaign \nwill be kept on that high basis. There is no reason it should not. The \nAmerican people, I think, are tired of negative campaigning.\n\n  I see my friend is here. I had a longer statement, but I can work on \nthat\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nlater. I don't know if the Senator is wishing to close this body this \nevening? I am waiting for him to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in November of 1864, when the ``awful \nuniverse of battle'' raged across America, President Abraham Lincoln \npaused to write a letter to one Mrs. Bixby, the mother of five sons \nserving in the Civil War.\n\n       Dear Madame, I have been shown in the files of the War \n     Department a statement of the Adjutant General of \n     Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have \n     died gloriously on the field of battle.\n       I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine \n     that should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss \n     so overwhelming.\n       But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation \n     that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to \n     save.\n       I pray our heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your \n     bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the \n     loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to \n     have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  In the face of tragic death, it is beyond my capacity to conceive of \nthe words that could justify the cause of freedom.\n  Yet with President Lincoln's words of 140 years ago, I cannot \nconceive of any better words to consecrate the cause of freedom in the \nface of such tragedy.\n  As long as freedom last, these words are immortal.\n  Every President and every leader in the free world since who has had \nto call upon their soldiers to defend freedom knows of Abe Lincoln's \nletter to widow Bixby.\n  Upon hearing of the death in combat of any of our fine young men and \nwomen in uniform, all leaders of freedom have searched for the right \nwords and likely returned to those used by the Great Emancipator almost \na century and a half ago for inspiration.\n  Eleven days ago, another costly sacrifice was laid upon the altar of \nfreedom.\n  Today the people of San Jose, CA will gather to remember one of their \nhonored fallen.\n  Pat Tillman was no different than any other soldier who served. Those \nwho survive Pat Tillman grieve no differently than the survivors of any \nother soldier killed in freedom's cause.\n  Yet Pat Tillman embodies to a Nation the honor and duty of all those \nwho serve in uniform.\n  Not every soldier is like Pat Tillman, but in each soldier, we find a \nlittle of the likes of Pat Tillman.\n  In my home state of Kentucky, the sacrifice for freedom is real and \npainful with the loss of too many fine young men.\n  On April 7, Staff Sergeant George S. Rentschler, 31, of Louisville \nwas lost in action with the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad.\n  Marine Corporal Nicholas Dieruf, 21, of Lexington was killed in \naction in Husaybah on April 8.\n  Sergeant Major Michael B. Stack, 48, of Fort Campbell, serving with \nthe 5th Special Forces Group was lost on April 11 in the al Anbar \nProvince.\n  And 1st Lieutenant Robert L. Henderson II, 33, of Alvaton, serving \nwith the Kentucky National Guard was killed in Diwaniyah on April 17.\n  Each of these heroes volunteered knowing that one day they might be \ncalled upon for the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.\n  Like Sergeant Rentschler, Corporal Dieruf, Sergeant Major Stack and \nLieutenant Henderson, Pat Tillman heard the call and paid the \nsacrifice.\n  With our fallen Kentucky natives, he joins that band of brothers, \nthat noble breed of volunteer militia who so long ago picked up the \nmusket so that freedom might find one sanctuary here on Earth.\n  Where his forefathers put down their hoe in a cornfield, he put down \nhis helmet on a football field and walked onto the battlefield of \nfreedom.\n  In dedicating the final resting place of those who died at \nGettysburg, President Lincoln stated\n\n       But in a large sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot \n     consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, \n     living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far \n     above our poor power to add or detract.\n\n  President Lincoln concluded:\n\n       It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task \n     remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take \n     increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their \n     last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve \n     that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this \n     Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and \n     that government of the people, by the people, for the people \n     shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  Mr. President, the sacrifice of Pat Tillman--like all those who serve \nand perish in our Nation's duty, has consecrated the cause of freedom \nfar greater than our words could ever do.\n  From the last full measure of devotion he gave for a new birth of \nfreedom, it is we who must dedicate ourselves to the unfinished \nbusiness of government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4761-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4761-S4763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PROPER ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for many months the President's critics \nhave asserted the situation in Iraq would improve if only the \nadministration would cede control over the reconstruction and \ndemocratization of Iraq to the United Nations.\n  While the presumptive Democratic nominee, Senator Kerry, has yet to \noffer a detailed plan for Iraq, he has made it abundantly clear it \ninvolves transferring a significant measure of authority to the U.N. In \nfact, on December 3rd of last year, he noted:\n\n       Our best option for success is to go back to the United \n     Nations and leave no doubt that we are prepared to put the \n     United Nations in charge of the reconstruction and \n     governance-building processes. I believe the prospects for \n     success on the ground will be far greater if Ambassador \n     Bremer and the Coalition Provisional Authority are replaced \n     by a U.N. Special Representative for Iraq.\n\n  The U.N. is an immensely valuable organization, and America's \nsignificant contributions to the U.N. are a worthwhile investment. The \nU.N. is often the only entity that can bring international humanitarian \nrelief to needy and impoverished societies across the globe, and its \nemployees and volunteers deserve the highest praise for their selfless \nacts to bring comfort to the downtrodden.\n  When civil authorities in dysfunctional states collapse, the U.N. has \nsometimes averted humanitarian disaster. It can bring relief to failed \nstates in isolated backwaters of the world where the major powers are \nunlikely to intervene themselves.\n  The U.N. in such cases plays a critical role and deserves our support \nfor its important efforts. But the United Nations is not a blue-\nhelmeted knight here to slay the dragons of aggression and evil. When \nthe stakes are high and the threat of violence is real, the United \nStates is too often helpless in the face of danger.\n  Before I turn my attention to the specific reason that Americans \nshould be wary of abandoning Iraq to the United Nations, let me dispel \na myth about the administration's foreign policy.\n  The President's critics often refer to America's efforts in Iraq as \nunilateralist. This politically expedient fix is an insult to the \nthousands of men and women from the 30-plus countries who are risking \ntheir lives to bring peace and democracy to the people of Iraq. If the \nPresident's critics still believe his policy to be a go-it-alone \napproach, let them repeat that assertion to the families of the \nItalian, Spanish, Polish, British, Danish, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Thai, \nEstonian, South Korean, Japanese, and Salvadoran soldiers and aid \nworkers who have given their lives in Iraq.\n  Some say United Nations oversight in Iraq would confer legitimacy to \nthe coalition's occupation and reconstruction of that country. I find \nthat hard to believe. Given its role in sustaining the Saddam Hussein \nregime via the alleged mismanagement of the Oil for Food Program and \nthe refusal to enforce its own resolutions, the United Nations is not \nin a position to lend legitimacy to a free Iraq. In fact, I think it \ncould be\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\nargued it would take away legitimacy from a free Iraq. The only thing \nthat can confer legitimacy in Iraq is a series of national elections. \nHowever, these elections must not occur too soon as democracy cannot be \nturned on at the flip of a switch. But they will come in due time. If \nwe stay the course, by December of next year the Iraqis will likely \nelect the most representative government in the Arab world.\n  I might say to put that in context it was 12 years between the \nDeclaration of Independence and the United States Constitution being \nadopted.\n  So the Iraqis will have gone from liberation to election in under \n1,000 days and even though we have 24-hour television these days, that \nis still a remarkably fast evolution from dictatorship, brutal \ndictatorship to representative government.\n  The Oil for Food scandal highlights another reason we should not rush \nto put the United Nations in charge of Iraq's reconstruction. Although \nwe do not yet know the full story, we can draw some initial lessons.\n  First, an organization that apparently so mismanaged the Oil for Food \nProgram cannot be trusted to manage a $34 billion budget for Iraqi \nreconstruction.\n  Second, the alleged corruption of some United Nations officials and \nmember states raises a serious concern about the U.N.'s commitment to \nits stated mission. Instead of sanctioning Saddam Hussein's regime, a \nnumber of United Nations officials and foreign diplomats may have used \nthe Oil for Food Program as a slush fund to enrich themselves while \nallowing profits and goods to be diverted away from needy Iraqis and \ntoward the Saddam Hussein regime.\n  Free Iraqis have ample reason to be wary of entrusting their future \nto those who allegedly had no qualms about doing illicit business with \ntheir oppressor.\n  United Nations control will not stop the violence in Iraq. Quite \nfrankly, the United Nations is not capable of managing the security \nsituation in Iraq. Terrorists do not respect blue-helmeted peacekeepers \nbecause the U.N. has proven itself to lack either the firepower or the \nwill to quell violent uprisings. In Somalia, when Aidid's thugs took to \nthe streets, United Nations peacekeepers stayed in camp while American \ntroops fought to restore order.\n\n  How can we expect United Nations forces that fled from Somalia's \nuntrained gangs to confront the professional fedayeen and suicidal \nradicals behind this insurgency in Iraq? Few seriously believe the U.N. \ncan be trusted to provide security for the Iraqi people. Indeed, the \nUnited Nations has demonstrated its inability to provide security even \nfor itself. The U.N.'s own scathing report on the bombing of its \nheadquarters in Baghdad last summer documented the culture of \ncomplacency and poor planning within the U.N.'s security forces. The \nUnited Nations has already cut and run in Iraq in the wake of the \nAugust bombings of its headquarters. How can the Iraqis trust the U.N. \nnot to abandon them yet again to the lawless insurgents who seek to \nderail the democratic process?\n  There is a further problem subjugating American foreign policy \nauthority to the United Nations Security Council. The veto-wielding \npermanent members of the security council were chosen because they were \nsimply the world's major powers at the time the United Nations was \nestablished. It therefore does not accurately reflect the distribution \nof world power today, and its composition discriminates against the \ncurrent major powers that share principles of democracy and of freedom.\n  For example, Communist China is a permanent member, but democratic \nJapan, the world's second largest economy, is not. Newly democratic \nRussia is a member, but neither Canada nor Spain, democracies with \ntwice the size of Russia's economy, is a member; nor is Italy, with an \neconomy four times as large as that of Russia; nor is India, the \nworld's largest democracy.\n  Even France, although democratic, often has different strategic and \npolitical interests than the United States. As evidenced by the Oil for \nFood scandal, it is possible that France, sometimes a more zealous \ncompetitor than an ally, had a significant financial stake in the \ncontinuation of the Saddam Hussein regime.\n  When the security council deliberates, there are often too many cooks \nin the kitchen and all of them have different tastes.\n  If the United Nations takes a larger role in Iraq, so too will the \ngeneral assembly. I am not convinced that will be a good thing. There \nare, to be sure, responsible nations in the general assembly but, \nfrankly, they are few and very far between.\n  The irony that so many authoritarian regimes are represented in such \na democratic body is often lost on American politicians who so \ndesperately seek approval of our foreign policy from this very body. \nThe general assembly, in fact, provides funds for despotic member \nstates to pour sand onto the clogs of international peace and \nstability. These regimes are unremittingly hostile to the United States \nand to democracy, and they will continue to exploit their authority at \nthe U.N. to halt freedom's progress.\n  Sudan, Syria, and Iran did not oppose the liberation of Iraq because \nthey wanted to peacefully resolve the growing international crisis. \nThey opposed the war because they didn't want to see a precedent \nwhereby their own tyrannies could be undermined.\n\n  The ability of rogue states to thwart the U.N.'s efforts to do the \nright thing is exemplified by the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission whose members include--listen to this, the United Nations \nHuman Rights Commission whose members include Cuba, China, Pakistan, \nSaudi Arabia, and Sudan, among others.\n  Joanna Weschler of Human Rights Watch has called the commission a \nrogue's gallery of human rights abusers--that is the Commission on \nHuman Rights at the United Nations--and correctly noted ``an abusive \ncountry cannot honestly pass judgment on other abusive countries.''\n  So does Senator Kerry really want to give these nations a say in \nIraq's future? Does he expect them to share America's interest in a \nfree and stable Iraq, even though a democratic Iraq would undermine \ntheir own authoritarian rule? Why do some American politicians want the \nfox to guard the henhouse?\n  If the President's critics still believe that authority in Iraq \nshould be transferred to the U.N., then we should have waited for the \nUnited Nations' approval before liberating Iraq. Let them explain to \nthe American people why they have such trust in the UN.\n  Let them explain why China, France, or Russia deserves a veto over \nU.S. foreign policy.\n  Let them explain why the very countries that allegedly negotiated \nclandestine oil leases with Saddam Hussein deserve a say in the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  Let them explain how an organization that cannot manage its own \nfinances deserves to manage those of the Iraqis.\n  Let them explain why an organization that cannot provide for its own \nsecurity should be entrusted with stabilizing Iraq. There are many \nthings the United Nations can do well, but I don't believe managing \nIraq's fragile transition to democracy is one of them. I wish the \nUnited Nations could be helpful on issues that are critical to American \nsecurity, but it is unsuited to that mission.\n\n  I support the United Nations. I hope it can reform itself and prevent \nthe worst abusers of human rights from sabotaging its laudable efforts \nto protect the rights and dignity of mankind. I want the United Nations \nto play a role in Iraq's reconstruction, and I hope it will send \nhumanitarian teams and election monitors to assist in building \ndemocracy on the ruins of tyranny.\n  But the United Nations is not a collective security organization, and \nit cannot replace America as a defender of liberty and democracy in \nconflicts that are important to American security because too many of \nits Members share neither our principles nor our interests.\n  Entrusting democracy in Iraq to the blue-helmeted bureaucrats at the \nUnited Nations is not a plan, it is a fantasy.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield the floor for me to make a couple \nof statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n  Mr. REID. First of all, Mr. President, the quote the Senator from \nKentucky gave of Abraham Lincoln is one of my favorites. I have a \nlittle book called ``A Book of 100 Poems.'' In that book, in addition \nto the poem, is the letter President Lincoln wrote to Mrs. Bixby. It is \nnot a poem but is as beautiful as any poem written.\n  I have, over the years, taken those words, ``assuage the anguish of \nyour bereavement'' and I have used that phrase in letters that I write \nto many people who have suffered deaths in their families.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, that is a beautiful letter that \nPresident Lincoln wrote. In my ``Book of 100 Poems,'' the letter is \ncopied that he wrote in hand to Mrs. Bixby.\n  I appreciate the Senator reading that most magnificent letter, the \nwords of President Lincoln.\n  Of course, talking about Pat Tillman makes everyone understand a \nlittle better the sacrifices being made in Iraq.\n  In response to my friend from Kentucky, the distinguished assistant \nRepublican leader, in the first war, I voted for it. I was the first \nDemocrat to announce it publicly. For the first President Bush's \nexcursion into Iraq, over 90 percent of the costs of that war were \nborne by other countries. The casualties were not all U.S. casualties \nin that first war.\n  In this war, more than 90 percent of the costs of the war are borne \nby American taxpayers. More than 95 percent of the casualties in Iraq \nare Americans. That number is now approaching 800. Twenty-one Americans \nwere killed on Saturday and Sunday in Iraq.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, talks disparagingly--\nwhether he means to or not--about the United Nations. The President \ncannot have it both ways. At his press conference he was asked what his \nplan was. He said he was waiting to hear from the envoy of the United \nNations in Iraq. He and his administration continually refers to \nBrahimi as a person who is beginning to bring some degree of stability \nto the plan.\n  The reason the President answered the question that way is the United \nNations brings some sense of legitimacy to what is going on there. More \nimportantly than that, if the plan goes forward as some anticipate, \nthere would be others coming to help. It would take the burden off of \nthe U.S. taxpayer and especially the men and women of our armed \nservices.\n  We are bearing a tremendous burden, not only with our Regular Army, \nNavy, and Air Force but with our Reserve Forces, a tremendous burden on \nour Reserve and Guard. Those, including the President, obviously, who \nrefer to Mr. Brahimi are thinking about the need to cut some slack \nthere to the United States.\n  The United Nations is an organization we helped create. We are the \nlargest donor to that organization. It is an imperfect organization, I \nwould be the first to recognize that. However, it must play a role. It \nis one of the only ways that I can see that we can move forward with \nmore of the support of the American people, which is being lost.\n  I voted for the resolution to go to Iraq the first time--you have \nalready heard me say that--and the second time. We cannot cut and run \nin Iraq. We have to do what we have to do to bring stability to that \nvery unstable part of the world.\n  However, let's not run down the United Nations. We need them to help \nbring in others so we do not bear 95 percent of the casualties and more \nthan 90 percent of the costs of what is going on there. There are other \ncountries there and I appreciate them being there, but as far as \nnumbers of troops, we have 135,000 troops; the British have 10,000. The \nnext largest contingency of troops we have is hired security guards. We \nneed to do better than what we are doing in Iraq. This is not in any \nway to take away from the valor of the men and women serving in that \ncountry.\n  Just last night, somebody lobbed a mortar shell into a military \ncompound there. The soldiers are running around thinking that is all of \nit and in comes another one and kills five or six of them. These \nsoldiers, these servicemen of ours serving in Iraq, every minute of \nevery day are fearing for their lives, whether they are carrying a gun \nor driving a truck. We need to have this matter resolved in a way that \nis not happening now.\n  I cannot give a blueprint of what needs to be done, but I am grateful \nthe President is recognizing Mr. Brahimi can do some good there. That \nmay not be the only answer, but it is an answer. I hope we can move \nforward in this matter and bring peace and stability to an area that \nneeds it. I recognize if we could bring peace and stability to Iraq, it \nwould help the whole Middle East. If we could help establish a \ndemocracy in Iraq, it would add to the democracy we already have in \nthat area, Israel. It could set a system where other countries would \nhave to focus on how they treat their people. I am all in favor of our \nbringing about a better situation in Iraq than certainly existed under \nthe regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Kentucky. I know his \nheart is in the right place. Hopefully, we can join in moving forward \non this most important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had not come to the floor to debate \nmy good friend from Nevada, but let me add a couple of words before we \nadjourn.\n  I certainly agree with him, we need more forces in Iraq. Where they \nneed to come from is from the Iraqi people. General Petraeus, the \nCommander of the famed 101st Airborne who took that unit into Iraq and \nstationed it in northern Iraq around Mosul for about a year, has now \nbeen given his next assignment. His next assignment is to go back to \nIraq--and he is there now--to help the Iraqi people develop a military \nthat can deal with the threat.\n  In the end, the area will be secure only if the Iraqi military and \nIraqi police have both the skill and the desire to protect their \ncountry from these terrorists.\n  So, far from hoping we will get additional troops from around the \nworld, even though we have 20,000 troops there from other countries \nnow, the key to additional military in Iraq is in Iraq itself--Iraqi \nsoldiers, well trained, fighting for their own country. And that \ntraining is well underway under the skilled leadership of General \nPetraeus.\n  With regard to the U.N., I readily concede there are a few things \nthey can do well. They can put on elections. They can hand out \nhumanitarian aid. But they do not have an army. And they are \ndiscredited in Iraq because of their involvement in the oil-for-food \nscandal which robbed Iraqis, for 10 years, of the opportunity to eat \nwhile this deal was enriching Saddam Hussein and his henchmen.\n  So the U.N. does not have a great reputation in Iraq, with good \nreason. We hope the U.N. will be able to play a useful role in moving \nIraq from where it is today to a representative government, where it \nwill be by the end of 2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4763-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4763-S4764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SPACE DAY 2004\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mervin Iverson \nElementary School's Erin Berkey, Sarah Boyer, and Carissa Buckley on \ntheir selection as one of the 18 Stellar Design Challenges teams for \nSpace Day 2004. I also want to recognize their teacher Katheryn Grimes \nfor her strong instruction and guidance of the student team.\n  Space Day is an international celebration of the accomplishments and \nopportunities of space exploration aimed at promoting student interest \nin math, science, and technology. It reaches hundreds of thousands of \nteachers and millions of students around the world.\n  Developed by the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, \nDesign Challenges is a national competition that encourages students to \ncreate innovative solutions to the challenges of space exploration. The \n18 Stellar Design Challenges teams were selected from more than 300 \nteams who participated in the competition.\n  The Iverson Elementary School team designed a tool to help explorers \non Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. The tool is designed to drill into \nice ridges on Europa that have already been discovered by the NASA \nspacecraft Galileo.\n  The remotely operated tool would also collect samples of ice and \nwater, analyze their chemical compositions, measure temperatures of the \nsurface\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nice and hypothesized ocean water underneath, and relay this data back \nto Earth. The team's project included scale drawings of the tool, and a \nscience fiction story highlighting the tool being used by explorers on \nEuropa.\n  As a Stellar Design Challenges Team, the Iverson students will attend \nthe national Space Day 2004 ceremony and meet former Senator John Glenn \nand NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. They will also have the \nopportunity to share their knowledge by displaying their project to \nmore than 1,200 sixth graders in the Washington, DC, area on Space Day.\n  Their efforts reflect a lot of hard work, dedication and creativity \nas well as Iverson Elementary School's strong commitment to academic \nexcellence. Please join me in congratulating Iverson Elementary School \nand its Stellar Design Challenges team on their impressive \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4764-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate the American Lung Association \nas it celebrates its centennial year.\n  The American Lung Association, established in 1904 as the National \nAssociation for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, was the first \nnationwide, voluntary health organization aimed at conquering a \nspecific disease.\n  While still committed to its initial cause, the Lung Association has \nexpanded its research, education, and advocacy to combat other \nchallenges to the respiratory health of the American people.\n  In the 1950s, the ALA realized that it was becoming increasingly \ndifficult to concentrate on the eradication of tuberculosis without \npaying attention to other related illnesses. So it expanded its program \ngoals to include the elimination of all forms of lung disease and their \ncauses.\n  In 1960, long before the dangers of smoking were understood, the ALA \nestablished a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. It \nsubsequently began an aggressive campaign to educate the public--\nespecially young people and those with chronic respiratory disease--\nabout the hazards of cigarette smoking.\n  In the 1970s, the ALA sought to reduce the harmful effects of air \npollution and played a major role in the adoption of the landmark Clean \nAir Act.\n  More recently, the ALA has partnered with schools to provide \neducation programs for children with asthma and public information \ncampaigns to prevent smoking among America's youth.\n  Today, more than 35 million Americans are living with chronic lung \ndisease, and every year, close to 344,000 Americans die of lung \ndisease, making it the Nation's No. 3 killer.\n  In Nevada, which has one of the highest rates of lung cancer in the \nNation, nearly 1,300 people died of the disease last year, and another \n1,500 new cases were diagnosed. These numbers underscore the importance \nof the ALA's goal of a world free of lung disease.\n  I salute the thousands of volunteers and staff of the American Lung \nAssociation for their tireless work in fighting lung disease over the \nlast century, and extend my best wishes for a successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4764-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          20TH ANNIVERSARY OF PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today marks the beginning of Public \nService Recognition Week, which has been celebrated annually since \n1985. It is a time in which we honor the hundreds of thousands of \npublic servants who perform the essential services that Americans \ndepend on every day.\n  This year marks the 20th anniversary of this event, and I thank my \ncolleagues for their support in passing, under unanimous consent, \nlegislation I introduced to commend public servants for their \ndedication and continued service to the Nation during Public Service \nRecognition Week. The resolution, which was cosponsored by the \nleadership of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senators \nCollins, Lieberman, Fitzgerald, Durbin, Voinovich, Levin, and Coleman, \nas well as Senator Murray, the ranking member of the Transportation, \nTreasury, and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, was \nintroduced on April 8, 2004.\n  Public Service Recognition Week provides us with an opportunity to \nacknowledge the work that public servants perform and their commitment \nto community and country. The work they do affects all of us. Public \nservants include teachers, members of the Armed Forces, civilian \ndefense workers, postal employees, food inspectors, law enforcement \nofficers, firemen, social workers, crossing guards, and road engineers.\n  These men and women are the backbone of what makes America great. \nThey deserve our respect and gratitude; and yet for too long, public \nservants have not been given the recognition they deserve. We must do \nall we can to foster a better understanding of public service among all \nAmericans and promote public service as an option for young people. As \na former educator, I believe it is time to call on a new generation of \nAmericans to consider public service, which is why I am pleased that \nsome schools are now requiring a period of public service in order to \ngraduate.\n  The Federal Government should be viewed as an employer of choice, not \nas a safe harbor in times of economic weakness. But to attract, retain, \nand train the best and the brightest, Federal agencies must have \nadequate funding for Federal employee incentive programs, such as the \nrepayment of student loans. I call on my colleagues to ensure that \nCongress plays an active role in supporting the Federal workforce. \nEliminating funding for these programs does not benefit Federal \nemployees or the ultimate end user: the American taxpayer.\n  In closing, I wish to pay particular attention to the men and women \nwho serve in our Armed Forces and the civilian employees who support \nmilitary missions. All are key to the security and defense of our \nNation. From the war against terrorism to the ongoing conflict in Iraq, \nour military and civilian support staff show courage in the face of \nadversity. As with the country's Armed Forces, Federal employees are \nready, willing, and able to make the world safe.\n  As we begin Public Service Recognition Week, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in saluting our Nation's public servants and thanking them for \nthe jobs they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4764-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4764-S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL TIRE SAFETY WEEK\n\n   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about tire \nsafety. Just last week, we recognized National Tire Safety Week. Now in \nits third year, National Tire Safety Week is sponsored by the Rubber \nManufacturers Association, and supported by numerous other \norganizations, to help educate consumers about the importance of tire \nsafety.\n  Combined with safer roads and more responsible drivers, improved \nvehicle safety is essential to help reduce the tragic number of motor \nvehicle injuries and fatalities that occur each year. Tire pressure and \ntread depth are critical safety components of any automobile. Under-\ninflated tires and worn or damaged tread can cause tire blowouts and \nhydroplaning--both of which can lead to devastating accidents on our \nhighways. The Rubber Manufacturers Association estimates that only 15 \npercent of drivers properly check their tire pressure, and only 30 \npercent of all drivers know how to tell when their tires are ``bald.'' \nTire safety week is an important means to improve these numbers.\n  The goal of National Tire Safety Week is to raise public awareness of \ntire safety and provide consumers with simple, common sense, and \ninexpensive ways to help increase the safety of their tires and \nvehicles. Consumers can greatly maximize the safety of their vehicles \nby properly checking tire pressure, maintaining proper alignment and \nrotation of their tires, and replacing worn tires. These simple \nprocedures can greatly reduce an individual's risk of a motor vehicle \naccident--and in some cases, save lives.\n  I thank the Rubber Manufacturers Association, as well as tire and \nauto service dealers and innovators in the tire safety community for \nparticipating in this important week and for\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\ntheir sustained effort to increase automobile safety. I also encourage \nthem to continue their significant progress on the development of safer \ntires and improved consumer awareness. Working together, we can all \nenhance tire safety and save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4765-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WE THE PEOPLE CIVIC EDUCATION PROGRAM\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, and over the weekend, more \nthan 1,200 students from across the United States came to Washington to \ntake part in the national finals of ``We the People: The Citizen and \nthe Constitution,'' the most extensive educational program in the \ncountry developed to educate our youth about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We \nthe People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education \nthrough the No Child Left behind Act, passed into law just 2 years ago.\n  I am proud to announce that a group of students from Trumbull, CT are \nin our Nation's Capital to represent my home State in this prestigious \nnational event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of \nthe U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the \nchance to come to Washington and compete at the national level.\n  Modeled after hearings in Congress, the ``We the People National \nFinals Competition'' gives students an opportunity to demonstrate their \nknowledge of the Constitution and Bill of Rights before a panel of \nadult judges. Students evaluate, take and defend constitutional \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary issues, and are \nsubject to a barrage of questions designed to further probe their depth \nof understanding as it relates to our ``founding documents.''\n  Last year, Russell Berg, a student from Trumbull, testified at a \nCongressional hearing on civic education mentioning his participation \nin the ``We the People'' program. Russell said that civic education \n``is the key to comprehending, appreciating and eventually \nparticipating in our democratic process.'' I could not think of a \ngreater endorsement for civic education in our schools. Clearly, an \nunderstanding of history and civics is critical to our ability as a \nnation to continue as a thriving, functioning democracy.\n  Our Constitution is a great document, but it is neither a simple nor \nself-implementing one. For it to work, it requires an educated \npopulace, and a populace that understands that American citizenship \nbrings with it both great benefits and great responsibility. If we want \nto ensure that our society remains faithful to democracy, and its \nunderlying ideals, we must teach our children what those ideals are. \n``We the People'' does just that.\n  I applaud the achievements of all the students who qualified for this \nyear's competition and all of those students who participated in local \nand State rounds of competition. We should all be proud that these \nstudents are learning and advocating the fundamental ideals that \nidentify us as a people and bind us together as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4765-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF JEREMIAH GUMBS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly pay \ntribute to Jeremiah Gumbs. Jeremiah Gumbs was a patriot of both the \nUnited States and Anguilla, West Indies. Gumbs served in the U.S. Army \nin World War II and was a successful businessman in New Jersey, owning \nGumbs Fuelers. He went back to his native Anguilla, opened a popular \nresort on beautiful Rendezvous Bay, and helped Anguilla become less \ndependent on Britain. Jeremiah and his wife Lydia educated their four \nchildren in the U.S.\n  I am pleased to submit for the Record, Jeremiah Gumbs obituary of his \nremarkable life, which appeared in the New York Times on April 10, \n2004:\n\n       Jeremiah Gumbs, a hotel keeper who became a hero in \n     Anguilla when that sliver of sand upended Britain's \n     postcolonial design for the Caribbean islands known as the \n     Lesser Antilles, died there on Thursday, his family \n     announced. He was 91.\n\n  Mr. Gumbs, an institution on an island that today has a population of \n12,000 people, reached a world audience in 1967 when he went before the \nUnited Nations with the islanders' objections to a British plan that \nlumped Anguilla's 35 square miles into a self-governing state, St. \nKitts-Nevis-Anguilla, associated with Britain.\n  Considering the 70 miles of blue waters between Anguilla, the \nnorthernmost of the Leeward Islands, and the new authorities in St. \nKitts, not to mention the many different flags that flew on the islands \nin between, such as St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, the Anguillans \nbalked.\n  ``After 300 years of neglect as a British Colony,'' Mr. Gumbs told \nthe United Nations, ``the people feel they are able to take care of \ntheir own affairs.'' Indeed, he said Anguillans wanted independence.\n  The people of Anguilla voted for it, 1,813 to 5, but Britain did not \nrecognize either the referendum or Mr. Gumbs as a leader of the \nsecessionist movement. But a special United Nations subcommittee on \ncolonialism listened to his formal arguments for Anguilla.\n  It was a ``natural paradise,'' Mr. Gumbs said of the island, but had \nbeen left undeveloped under British rule, without running water, \nelectricity, phones, or a decent road. A new highway, built with \nEuropean aid, has recently been named for Mr. Gumbs.\n  The British protested United Nations involvement, while other \nCaribbean commonwealth islands sought to mediate.\n  Britain asserted that the island was ``completely dominated by a \ngangster-type element,'' referring to Mr. Gumbs and the chosen leader \nof the rebellion, James Ronald Webster. It sent a troop of London's \nMetropolitan Police force to keep order and stop the secession \nmovement.\n  But efforts to patch the link to St. Kitts failed. In the end, \nAnguilla got part of what it wanted, becoming a self-governing British \ndependent territory with its own elected officials, an arrangement \ncodified in 1971 and brought up to date with Anguilla's new \nconstitution in 1982.\n  Jeremiah Gumbs was born in Anguilla, the youngest of nine children; \nhis mother was a baker and his father, a fisherman. He started school \nin Anguilla, but economic hardship drove him as a boy to work the cane \nfields in the Dominican Republic. Starting at age 15, he worked for 2 \nyears in oil refineries in Aruba and Curacao before returning to \nAnguilla to teach himself tailoring.\n  At age 25, he went to live with a sister in Brooklyn and took night \nclasses at City College on a scholarship. He hoped to become a dentist, \nbut was drafted into the Army in 1941 and was given American \ncitizenship at the time.\n  After the war, he married Lydia Gibbs of Perth Amboy, NJ, and, using \nhis G.I. bill money, trained as a furnace installer. He started his own \ncompany in Perth Amboy, Gumbs Fuelers, and made a success of it.\n  When he took Lydia to show her Anguilla, it was she who planted the \nidea for another venture-tourism on the island's untouched beaches. \nThey bought 14 acres, later doubling the amount, and in 1959 started \nbuilding Anguilla's first beach resort with their own hands.\n  They rented the first rooms in 1962, opening what has become the \nRendezvous Bay Hotel and Villas, a cornerstone of the island's growing \ntourism industry. As a businessman with local roots and a civic leader \nacquainted with the ways of the world, Jeremiah Gumbs became a natural \nchoice to serve as the island's roving ambassador during the Anguillan \nrevolution of 1967-1969.\n  He managed the hotel until about 5 years ago and remained a jovial \nhost after that. Lydia Gumbs died about 3 years ago. Jeremiah Gumbs is \nsurvived by three sons, J. Alan, the managing director and owner of the \nRendezvous Bay; Clyde, of Atlanta; and Duane, of Edison, NJ; a \ndaughter, Una, of Edison and Anguilla; and seven grandchildren.\n  It is my honor to share Jeremiah Gumbs impressive life with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4765-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4765-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4765-S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4766-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on April 30, 2004, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1904.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans during the period \nthat a military reservist or a National Guardsman is called to active \nduty. Specifically, the provision would allow individuals who are \ncalled to active duty for at least 179 days between September 11, 2001, \nand September 15, 2005, to avoid the 10-percent penalty tax that is \nnormally imposed on early distributions.\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives by unanimous consent \nlate last month, and it is my hope that this important and appropriate \nlegislation will receive the same resounding support by my colleagues \nin the Senate.\n  Nearly 3,000 reservists and Guard members from my home State of Utah \nhave been called to active duty and are currently stationed in the \nPersian Gulf and Afghanistan. I believe it is safe to say that when \nmany of these brave young men and women were informed by their \ncommanding officers they would be placed on full-time active duty, they \nwere not only concerned with the extended time period they would be \ncalled away from their families, but also with the reality that by \ntemporarily leaving behind their full-time civilian jobs, many of them \nwould leave behind a higher paycheck. Many reservists are suddenly \nfaced with the prospect that their income may no longer cover all of \nthe expenses for themselves and their families.\n  Some may say that allowing reservists to make withdrawals from their \nretirement accounts without incurring a penalty is too small a step and \nnot worthy of our time. But to many reservists and Guard members, these \nretirement accounts can be a significant resource in helping to \nalleviate some of their financial stress. Providing our soldiers with \nan additional option to support their families certainly seems like a \nworthwhile cause to me.\n  The cost of this bill to the U.S. Treasury is estimated to be only $4 \nmillion over 10 years. I think we can all agree this cost is minimal \nconsidering the tremendous sacrifices that our reservists, Guard \nmembers, and their families are making each day. In addition, there is \na provision in this bill that would allow our soldiers to repay any \namount withdrawn, without penalty, for 2 years after leaving active \nduty.\n  There is no doubt that there are many additional much needed \nimprovements to our policies that each of us must work together towards \nto ensure the financial peace of mind for our Guard and Reserve members \nand their families. It is imperative for each of us to give our \nsoldiers not only all of the tools, armor, and technology to fight \nthose who seek to destroy peace, but we must also do everything within \nour power to give our soldiers every appropriate resource to make it \neasier to care for their loved ones they have left behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to this bill, and \nit is my hope that it can be passed by unanimous consent. I am \nconfident that President Bush would have no hesitation in signing this \nimportant bill into law, if we can pass it in the Senate and send it to \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4769-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4769-S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 348--TO PROTECT, PROMOTE, AND CELEBRATE MOTHERHOOD\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lott, Mr. Miller, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Specter, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Byrd, Mr.  Alexander, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Santorum) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 102\n\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown is the namesake of the landmark \n     United States Supreme Court decision of 1954, Brown v. Board \n     of Education (347 U.S. 483, 1954);\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown is honored as the lead plaintiff in \n     the Topeka, Kansas case which posed a legal challenge to \n     racial segregation in public education;\n        Whereas by 1950, African-American parents began to renew \n     their efforts to challenge State laws that only permitted \n     their children to attend certain schools, and as a result, \n     they organized through the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People (the NAACP), an organization \n     founded in 1909 to address the issue of the unequal and \n     discriminatory treatment experienced by African-Americans \n     throughout the country;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown became part of the NAACP strategy \n     led first by Charles Houston and later by Thurgood Marshall, \n     to file suit against various school boards on behalf of such \n     parents and their children;\n       Whereas Oliver L. Brown was a member of a distinguished \n     group of plaintiffs in cases from Kansas (Brown v. Board of \n     Education), Delaware (Gebhart v. Belton), South Carolina \n     (Briggs v. Elliot), and Virginia (Davis v. County School \n     Board of Prince Edward County) that were combined by the \n     United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, \n     and in Washington, D.C. (Bolling v. Sharpe), considered \n     separately by the Supreme Court with respect to the District \n     of Columbia;\n       Whereas with respect to cases filed in the State of \n     Kansas--\n       (1) there were 11 school integration cases dating from 1881 \n     to 1949, prior to Brown v. Board of Education in 1954;\n       (2) in many instances, the schools for African-American \n     children were substandard facilities with out-of-date \n     textbooks and often no basic school supplies;\n       (3) in the fall of 1950, members of the Topeka, Kansas \n     chapter of the NAACP agreed to again challenge the ``separate \n     but equal'' doctrine governing public education;\n       (4) on February 28, 1951, the NAACP filed their case as \n     Oliver L. Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka \n     Kansas (which represented a group of 13 parents and 20 \n     children);\n       (5) the district court ruled in favor of the school board \n     and the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court;\n       (6) at the Supreme Court level, the case was combined with \n     other NAACP cases from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia, \n     and Washington, D.C. (which was later heard separately); and\n       (7) the combined cases became known as Oliver L. Brown et \n     al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, et al.;\n       Whereas with respect to the Virginia case of Davis et al. \n     v. Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors--\n       (1) one of the few public high schools available to \n     African-Americans in the State of Virginia was Robert Moton \n     High School in Prince Edward County;\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\n       (2) built in 1943, it was never large enough to accommodate \n     its student population;\n       (3) the gross inadequacies of these classrooms sparked a \n     student strike in 1951;\n       (4) the NAACP soon joined their struggles and challenged \n     the inferior quality of their school facilities in court; and\n       (5) although the United States District Court ordered that \n     the plaintiffs be provided with equal school facilities, they \n     were denied access to the schools for white students in their \n     area;\n       Whereas with respect to the South Carolina case of Briggs \n     v. R.W. Elliott--\n       (1) in Clarendon County, South Carolina, the State NAACP \n     first attempted, unsuccessfully and with a single plaintiff, \n     to take legal action in 1947 against the inferior conditions \n     that African-American students experienced under South \n     Carolina's racially segregated school system;\n       (2) by 1951, community activists convinced African-American \n     parents to join the NAACP efforts to file a class action suit \n     in United States District Court;\n       (3) the court found that the schools designated for \n     African-Americans were grossly inadequate in terms of \n     buildings, transportation, and teacher salaries when compared \n     to the schools provided for white students; and\n       (4) an order to equalize the facilities was virtually \n     ignored by school officials, and the schools were never made \n     equal;\n       Whereas with respect to the Delaware cases of Belton v. \n     Gebhart and Bulah v. Gebhart--\n       (1) first petitioned in 1951, these cases challenged the \n     inferior conditions of 2 African-American schools;\n       (2) in the suburb of Claymont, Delaware, African-American \n     children were prohibited from attending the area's local high \n     school, and in the rural community of Hockessin, Delaware, \n     African-American students were forced to attend a dilapidated \n     1-room schoolhouse, and were not provided transportation to \n     the school, while white children in the area were provided \n     transportation and a better school facility;\n       (3) both plaintiffs were represented by local NAACP \n     attorneys; and\n       (4) though the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the \n     plaintiffs, the decision did not apply to all schools in \n     Delaware;\n       Whereas with respect to the District of Columbia case of \n     Bolling, et al. v. C. Melvin Sharpe, et al.--\n       (1) 11 African-American junior high school students were \n     taken on a field trip to Washington, D.C.'s new John Philip \n     Sousa School for white students only;\n       (2) the African-American students were denied admittance to \n     the school and ordered to return to their inadequate school; \n     and\n       (3) in 1951, a suit was filed on behalf of the students, \n     and after review with the Brown case in 1954, the United \n     States Supreme Court ruled that segregation in the Nation's \n     capital was unconstitutional;\n       Whereas on May 17, 1954, at 12:52 p.m., the United States \n     Supreme Court ruled that the discriminatory nature of racial \n     segregation ``violates the 14th Amendment to the \n     Constitution, which guarantees all citizens equal protection \n     of the laws'';\n       Whereas the decision in Brown v. Board of Education set the \n     stage for dismantling racial segregation throughout the \n     country;\n       Whereas the quiet courage of Oliver L. Brown and his fellow \n     plaintiffs asserted the right of African-American people to \n     have equal access to social, political, and communal \n     structures;\n       Whereas our country is indebted to the work of the NAACP \n     Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Howard University \n     Law School, the NAACP, and the individual plaintiffs in the \n     cases considered by the Supreme Court;\n       Whereas Reverend Oliver L. Brown died in 1961, and because \n     the landmark United States Supreme Court decision bears his \n     name, he is remembered as an icon for justice, freedom, and \n     equal rights; and\n       Whereas the national importance of the Brown v. Board of \n     Education decision had a profound impact on American culture, \n     affecting families, communities, and governments by outlawing \n     racial segregation in public education, resulting in the \n     abolition of legal discrimination on any basis: Now therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Congress recognizes and honors the 50th anniversary \n     of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education \n     of Topeka;\n       (2) the Congress encourages all people of the United States \n     to recognize the importance of the Supreme Court decision in \n     Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka; and\n       (3) by celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. \n     Board of Education of Topeka, the Nation will be able to \n     refresh and renew the importance of equality in society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3107.

Mr. President, tomorrow, following morning business, \nthe Senate will resume consideration of the JOBS bill. The chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee will be here throughout the day \ntomorrow to work through additional amendments. Rollcall votes should \nbe expected throughout the day tomorrow as the Senate continues the \namending process on the JOBS bill. Senators will be notified when the \nfirst vote is scheduled. However, no votes are expected prior to the \npolicy luncheon recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \ntomorrow we have our usual party luncheons, as has already been \nannounced. We also have the First Lady's dinner that we will go to on a \nbipartisan basis tomorrow evening, starting at about 6:30, so it is \ngoing to be a short day tomorrow.\n  The overtime issue has been kicking around here for a while. That \namendment has been laid down with a couple of others. I am wondering if \nthe Senator from Kentucky is going to be in a position to offer a \ncompanion to the overtime amendment that we have offered so we can vote \non those sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it is \nlikely there will be a side-by-side amendment offered. It is also \nlikely we will get to vote on both of those amendments tomorrow. I \nwould not want to call it a guarantee at this point, but I think it \nextremely likely we will be able to vote on both tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, if we could get rid of \nthe overtime issue and move on to some of the other matters, I think we \ncan move through these amendments. As the Senator will recall, we had \n18 on our side originally that we had whittled down to. When the \nmajority came back with a larger number, we added some to it. But I \nstill think we have 18 amendments, and maybe even that is a puffy \nnumber. We also, on the 18, had time agreements on every one of them. \nSo we are ready to move through those. The managers have indicated they \ncould probably accept some of our 18.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know I am safe in saying the majority \nleader wants to finish this bill this week. I do understand that part \nof the problem lies on this side of the aisle with the proliferation of \namendments prior to the agreement we entered into limiting the \namendments. We will be working hard on this side of the aisle to narrow \nthe list and put us in a position to complete action on this bill this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/03/senate-section/article/S4778-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
