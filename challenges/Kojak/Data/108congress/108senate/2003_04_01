Madam President, we are now 12 days into Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. As I mentioned yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the \npost of the 101st Airborne Division this weekend. It was a remarkable \nopportunity for me, and I wish to share with you a couple of my \nthoughts on that visit.\n  Our troops over the last 12 days have advanced 220 miles and now are \nsitting about 50 miles outside of Baghdad. We are all exposed, on the \ntelevision and through our briefings, to the repetitive pounding of \nmilitary targets day and night throughout Iraq. The key point, I \nbelieve, is that we do keep building our momentum both in Iraq and in \nAmerica.\n  We have achieved many key objectives, and we will--there is no \nquestion--we will achieve our ultimate objective, and that is to disarm \nSaddam Hussein and to liberate the Iraqi people from his oppressive \nrule.\n  I am confident about that for so many reasons, but a lot of it has \nbecome real to me in a very personal sense after my visit to the 101st \nAirborne Division. For example, SP John G. Young is assigned to the A \nCompany, 8th Battalion, 101st Airborne Division. He left Fort Campbell \non March 1 of this year for Kuwait. He is crew chief on a CH-47 \nsomewhere in the Iraqi desert. He is newly married. He is expecting a \nchild in a few months and is doing an extraordinary job in Operation \nIraqi Freedom. We thank him, we thank his mother, and we thank his wife \nfor their courage.\n  At the 101st Airborne Division, Karyn, my wife, and Jonathan, my son, \nand I attended church services with the spouses and children of the \nFort Campbell 101st Airborne Division. There are 50 chaplains as part \nof the 101st Airborne Division and 46 of those chaplains are overseas \nin Iraq and Kuwait. Seeing these families and the faces of these very \nyoung children as the pastor gathered them around the pulpit and\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\ncame down and sat on the floor with the children asking them what their \nimpressions were, what they pray for--the children were very young, 2, \n3, 4, up to about 7 years of age.\n  One said: I pray for my daddy who is somewhere in the desert.\n  Another little girl raised her hand as they sat, about 20 of them, \naround the pastor, and said: I pray that Saddam Hussein quits doing bad \nthings to other people.\n  The innocence, the understanding, and the wisdom of these young \nchildren was very apparent.\n  I also had a chance to talk to Michele Schumer, whose husband is a \nmember of the Special Forces and is currently deployed in Iraq. Michele \nis the mother of a child in kindergarten and has another child on the \nway.\n  We talked to Adra Barna, a mother of 3-year-old twin girls, who \nclearly had her hands full as we watched her manage them during the \nchurch service. Her husband is deployed in Iraq as well.\n  I talked to Julie Sparkman. She and her husband are newlyweds. It is \nhard for anyone at any point to be separated, but to be separated \nshortly after marriage clearly introduces all sorts of feelings that we \nall can share with Julie and her husband. Having just been married, \nimagine the fear when there was that first grenade attack at Camp \nPennsylvania: Was my husband involved in that or not? Was he injured or \nnot? He was not, but again, we can personalize in many ways the \nexperiences that result from the tremendous service of these young men \nand women.\n  Above all, these families are patriotic. I thought the atmosphere \nwould be very somber. In truth, it was very upbeat, optimistic, and \nenergetic. These young spouses are so proud of their husbands being \nable to serve all of us and able to literally put their lives on the \nline for those causes of freedom, democracy, and peace.\n  In closing, the families of Fort Campbell did ask me to share with \nthe President their support and their prayers for the tremendous job he \nis doing as Commander in Chief. They are concerned about their loved \nones but proud they are able to serve the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4594-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to share another story that comes \nfrom the battlefield of Iraq. There are a thousand of these stories, \nbut I think it is the way we start our day as a reminder of exactly \nwhat is going on at ground level--in other words, where the rubber hits \nthe road.\n  In the last 12 or 13 days, we have seen how deeply committed our men \nand women in uniform are. They fight for a great cause of disarming \nSaddam Hussein's regime from its weapons of mass destruction, but also \nat the same time they understand that they are our brother's keeper.\n  What brought this home to me was a picture of this one marine \ncarrying his injured comrade from the battlefield. It is as awe \ninspiring as any imagine that might come from the field of conflict. \nOne man hurt his leg. His buddy slings him over his back and carries \nhim safely, like a firefighter rescuing somebody from a burning \nbuilding. Only in this case, it looks as though the enemy was not being \ncooperative or too helpful.\n  Men serving in battle form iron bonds. They have to because it is for \nthe person next to them and for their country. Those bonds often forge \nthe determination and the will to win. We can see the grim \ndetermination etched in the face of the marine who is doing the \ncarrying. He seems to be thinking: It is all right, buddy. We will be \nout of here. You are in good hands.\n  Then perhaps when they reached the point where they were saved, the \nguy being carried likely responded: You do it for me, Semper Fi.\n  Some would say these two marines are heroes. But I would not put them \nin the hero class. They are America. They are the story of America. The \nmarine who was hurt is from Oregon. The marine who saved him is from \nSouth Carolina. It does not matter what State one is from; their bond \nis in the unit in which they serve and in the miniature stars-and-\nstripe patch sewn on every shoulder of every sleeve.\n  For the marine from Oregon, his bond was his family heritage. His \nfather was a career marine who rose to the top rank of sergeant major. \nHis father was in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983 when terrorists bombed the \nMarine barracks, losing 241 of his buddies. The father served in combat \nin 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. The day after the son shipped \nout for Kuwait, that marine's father died. The son returned home to the \nfuneral, returned to the scene, and caught up with his unit.\n  The depth of commitment of our brave Americans is shown on the \nbattlefields not only here but also in our history. It is a cause to \nthem and one that inspires us. May we who are in the policy business \nlearn our lesson to be that inspiring. We, too, should be where most of \nthem are, where the rubber hits the road. This is where it is carried \nout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to the more \nthan 43 United States soldiers who have sacrificed their lives in the \nmission to liberate the Iraqi people and to disarm Saddam Hussein: The \n16 who are missing, the 7 who have been captured, the 109 who have been \ninjured, and all of those men and women on the ground, in the skies, \nand on the seas, who are so bravely supporting the cause of Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  By now, we have all seen the images on our television screens, yet \nlittle can we truly comprehend the real nature of the dangers they \nface, and the courage they must summon. Let us then dedicate these days \nto the acknowledgment of their heroism, for how profoundly grateful and \nblessed we are that these men and women are committed to serving our \nNation and the ideals for which it stands during this pivotal and \ntumultuous chapter in America's proud history.\n  In particular, I rise this morning to honor two Maine sons--Marine \nMAJ Jay Thomas Aubin and Marine CPL Brian Matthew Kennedy--who were \namong the twelve U.S. and British Marines killed Thursday, March 20 \nwhen their CH-46E Sea Helicopter crashed in Kuwait, just seven miles \nfrom the Iraq border. While I never had the opportunity to meet these \ntwo exceptional Marines in person, over the last week I feel I have \ncome to know them, at least in some small but very meaningful way.\n  MAJ Aubin and CPL Kennedy embodied the Marine Corps values of honor, \ncourage and dedication--no matter the odds, no matter the fight. They \nhad the mental, moral and physical strength to follow the U.S. Marine \ndecree to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons. \nBoth men willingly and knowingly laid their lives on the line to \nsupport and defend the U.S. Constitution and protect our national \nsecurity. Both men believed in their mission.\n  Marines are often described as a family. They are initiated en masse \nby boot camps and extreme conditions many of us cannot even begin to \nimagine. They train together day in and day out and understand each \nother's struggles, fears, and feelings of pride. And they fight \ntogether, bound by a common code and a calling, gallantly facing any \nenemy whose goal is the destruction of our way of life.\n  Indeed, they live by one simple truth, that risking American lives is \nsometimes necessary to defending America's freedom. This realization \nand their willingness to act upon it is what makes the sacrifice of MAJ \nAubin and CPL Kennedy all the more poignant.\n  So we must celebrate their lives and memories as the extraordinary \npeople\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\nthey truly were. I attended a service this past weekend in Winslow, ME, \nfor MAJ Aubin. The day was made all the more special as CPL Kennedy's \nmother, Melissa Derbyshire, was also in attendance, and my heart goes \nout to both families brought together by sorrow in what for them is \nsurely the most difficult of times. It is through remembrance that \nthese two great Mainers will live on, so today and forevermore we will \nremember.\n  The eldest of three sons, MAJ Jay Thomas Aubin was a native of \nSkowhegan. As a young child, his undying first love was flight. His \ngrandfather was an airplane mechanic and his father spent his spare \ntime buying, selling and flying airplanes. His mother, Nancy \nChamberlain, said Jay started flying when he was two years old. She \nrecalls that his father, Thomas Aubin, had some two-seater planes and \nwould take him flying from Norridgewock Airport. His brothers Joel and \nJeffrey always considered him to be the ``overachiever of the family'', \npointing out his ``student of the month'' and ``student of the year'' \nawards from Skowhegan Area High School and his participation in after-\nschool activities, like band and wrestling. He even set up his own \n``boot camp'' in his senior year so he would be in top physical shape.\n  Jay joined the Marines straight out of high school and was fortunate \nenough to meet the woman who would later become his wife, Rhonda who \nwas also a Marine at the time. They were married and have two children, \nAlicia, 10 and Nathan, 7. Jay was in the Marines for 4 years, came home \nto Maine and enrolled in Southern Maine Technical College in 1989 and \nearned an associate's degree in applied science and, later, a \nbachelor's degree in business management from the University of \nSouthern Maine.\n  His love and dedication to the Marines was so strong that upon \ngraduation Jay re-enlisted as an officer. A true testimony to his skill \nand leadership, he was invited to join the elite corps that pilots the \nPresidential helicopter, Marine One. But before he was able to assume \nthis new duty, he was asked to become a ``Top Gun'' instructor in night \nflight for helicopter pilots. He, Rhonda and their children moved to \nYuma, AZ, in June, 2002 to complete his latest mission and he remained \nthere until he was called to go to Kuwait.\n  After his tragic death, his mother received a letter Major Aubin had \nmailed two days before his helicopter went down. It said, ``I want to \nthank you for everything over the years. You always tried your best to \nput us first at your expense.'' With that letter, it was as though his \nmother, Nancy, could hear her son's voice one last time--and what she \nheard was a message of undying gratitude and love.\n  In recent days, his friends and family have described him as \n``genuine and friendly and always smiling'' and ``passionate about his \njob and his country.'' His alma mater held a memorial service to honor \nhim and has established a scholarship in his name. This is a man who \nwas well loved and who touched the lives of everyone around him, \nespecially his family. His aunt, Rella Collins, describes him as ``the \nbest of the best. He did us all proud.'' According to his mother in his \nlast conversation before he departed, Jay was at peace with his \nmission, remarking ``If anything happens to me, just remember I'm happy \nand I'm doing what I love to do.''\n  The same has been said about Corporal Brian Matthew Kennedy, whose \nmother, Melissa Derbyshire, and stepfather, John Derbyshire, live in \nPort Clyde, Me. John's description of Brian gets to the heart of his \ncharacter--``This man loved living and life itself. His greatest \npleasures were cooking, eating lobster and mussels, his friends, \nlacrosse, rock climbing and doing his best at any task he was given to \ndo--just as he did his job as a Marine crew chief aboard the CH-46 \nhelicopter.'' Corporal Kennedy graduated from Glenbrook South High \nSchool in Glenview, IL with honors in 1995 and then attended Purdue \nUniversity before transferring to Texas Tech. He enlisted in the \nMarines in 1999, according to his own words, ``because he thought he \ncould do the best job.''\n  He had been a Marine for 3 years when he was lost to us in last \nweeks' helicopter crash. His family members speak of his sacrifice. His \nmother, Melissa, recalls him having to wait in line for 3 hours to just \ncall home. Brian told his mother he would do his best to come home, but \nshe says she ``was lucky enough to know him for 25 years'' and she \nremembers him ``always laughing and having a good time.'' Brian's \nfather, Mark Kennedy, speaks of his son's time in the Marines, saying \nBrian was ``very pleased to be in Kuwait and was thrilled to have the \nassignment he had. He gave his life in an effort to contribute to the \nfreedom of the Iraqi people.''\n  We will all agree that these brave young men did not die in vain--\nindeed, in the words of Melissa Derbyshire, ``they died for all of \nus.'' The loss of life is the ultimate tragedy of war, but from it, we \ncan hope, will come peace. It is the Jay Aubin's and Brian Kennedy's of \nour unique history that have enabled America to become the greatest \ndemocracy civilization has ever known. They are a constant reminder of \nthe sacrifice of one generation for the next. It has been said we are \nthe land of the free precisely because we are the home of the brave.\n  At the first national Memorial Day service, in 1868, General James A. \nGarfield, the future President, addressed the difficulty in speaking of \nfallen Americans. During a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, \nGarfield said:\n  ``With words,'' Garfield said, ``we make promises, plight faith, \npraise virtue. Promises may not be kept; plighted faith may be broken; \nand vaunted virtue may be only the cunning mask of vice.\n  ``We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they gave, \none word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and perfected, by \none supreme act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of \ncountry they accepted death and thus resolved all doubts, and made \nimmortal their patriotism and virtue.''\n  James A. Garfield could not have said it better. The enormity of the \ncontribution made by our military men and women overwhelms the words we \nhave within our grasp to honor that contribution. The entire nation \nwill be forever indebted to Major Jay Thomas Aubin and Corporal Brian \nMatthew Kennedy. The Aubin, Chamberlain, Kennedy and Derbyshire \nfamilies are in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope all of the Senate \nwill join me in honoring these two outstanding, exceptional, \nextraordinary Marines today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, Senator Lincoln has been coming here \nevery morning on behalf of the Democratic side of the aisle, and I know \nSenator Hutchison and others have come on behalf of the Republican \nside. Senator Lincoln asked me to come down here to pay tribute to our \nyoung men and women. It is an honor for me to do this.\n  Very sadly, this morning I come down to pay tribute to five young \nAmericans who were killed in the Iraqi war, all of them from California \nor based in California. I have done this before. We have lost an \nadditional 10 to whom I have payed tribute already, and that is a very \nlarge proportion of those who have been lost.\n  As we pray for all of those in harm's way, I think it is important to \nput a human face on war, and therefore I come down to discuss the great \nloss we feel in our State.\n  First is Navy Hospital Corpsman Third Class Michael Vann Johnson, \nJr., age 25, killed on Tuesday, March 25, in Iraq, while attending to \ninjured marines. He was assigned to the Naval Medical Center, 3rd \nMarine Division Detachment, in San Diego, CA. Michael was born and \nraised in Arkansas and graduated from Parkview High School in Little \nRock. He attended the University of Central Arkansas in Conway before \njoining the Navy in 1997. He is survived by his wife in San Diego, his \nparents, and his seven siblings. I send them my deepest condolences.\n  MAJ Kevin Nave, age 36, was killed March 26, in a vehicle accident in \nIraq,\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\nassigned to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine \nDivision, Camp Pendleton, CA. His wife and his two children live in \nOceanside, CA. He is from Union Lake, MI. He was on the football team \nand wrestling squad at Waterford Kettering High School in White Lake \nTownship, MI.\n  LCpl William W. White, age 24, was killed in a vehicle accident on \nMarch 29, in Iraq. He was assigned to the 3rd Amphibious Assault \nBattalion, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, CA. He was from \nBrooklyn, NY.\n  GySgt Joseph Menusa, age 33, from San Jose, CA, died on Thursday, \nMarch 27, from a gunshot wound. He was assigned to the 1st Combat \nEngineer Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, CA. He was \nborn in the Philippines and moved to San Jose when he was just 10 years \nold. He served in the 1991 gulf war and was a marine recruiter in the \nSan Francisco Bay area. His wife and his young son live at Camp \nPendleton.\n  LCpl Jesus A. Suarez Del Solar, age 20, died Thursday, March 27, in \ncombat action in Iraq. He is from Escondido, CA. He was assigned to the \n1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Camp \nPendleton, CA. He moved from Mexico to the United States in the late \n1990s with his family. He attended San Pasqual High School in Escondido \nand graduated from Escondido's Valley High School in 2001. He is \nsurvived by his wife and his 1-year-old son, as well as many family \nmembers in Los Angeles County, San Diego, and Mexico.\n  As I said, I have already read the names of 10 others into the \nCongressional Record:\n  CPL Randal Kent Rosacker, age 21; LT Thomas Mullen Adams, age 27; \nCAPT Ryan Beaupre, age 30; 2LT Therrel Shane Childers, age 30; LCpl \nJose Gutierrez, age 22; CPL Brian Matthew Kennedy, age 25; SSG Kendall \nWatersbey, age 29; SGT Michael Bitz, age 31; CPL Jose Garibay, age 21; \nCPL Jorge Gonzalez, age 20.\n\n  So, Madam President, out of the 43 who were killed, 15 were from or \nbased in the State of California. And my State mourns them. May these \nbeautiful young Americans rest in peace. And may the war end soon.\n  I pray for the wisdom of those who send these young men and women on \ntheir mission.\n  The people of my State feel very strongly on both sides about this \nwar. I say to them today that they have every right to express \nthemselves for and against this war; that those are indeed the freedoms \nthat are the basis of our Nation. I also say to both sides that however \none feels about the policy of this war--people know how I felt--I voted \nfor the Levin resolution because I did not want us to go it alone, or \nvirtually alone, because I was fearful of what could happen; and I felt \nit was important to lead the world as a superpower. Whether you are for \nor against this war, this isn't about who loves the troops more.\n  These troops are our children. I am a mother. I am a grandmother. \nThese troops are our children. Some of them are parents themselves. So \nlet us not deal with who loves our young people more. The debate is \nabout policy, and there will be much time to debate that policy as \nthere was before this war. And anyone who has a feeling about that \npolicy has a right--I would say a duty--to express that view regardless \nof what that view is because that is what makes our country strong, \nthat is what makes us different from other places.\n  So that is my message to the people of my State: to respect each \nother's differences. This isn't a debate about who loves the troops \nmore; it is about policy.\n  California is contributing mightily to the military effort in Iraq. I \nhave read you the names of many who have died so far. Tens of thousands \nof military men and women have been deployed from my State.\n  One of them, Patrick Sailors, is a chief warrant officer in the \nMarine Reserves, and he is the brother of one of my most treasured \nstaff members, Kelly Gill, who works out of my Fresno office. He is a \nmember of the Marine Wing Communications Squadron 48, attached to the \n3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force that is now in \nIraq.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Sailors has spent 17 years in the Marine Corps \nand is a second-generation marine. His wife Liz and their two children \nare awaiting his return to their home in Galt, CA. His parents, Delbert \nand Carol Sailors, live in California as well.\n  I pray that Patrick Sailors and all of our men and women are safely \nreturned to their families as soon as possible.\n  Madam President, one of the things I have noticed--I am sure you have \nnoticed--is that many of those who are losing their lives are parents. \nBefore the vote on the resolution giving the President the authority to \ngo to war without U.N. backing, I had a conversation with one of the \nmost treasured Members of this body who had fought in World War II. He \npointed out to me that so many of our people who are over in Iraq are \nmembers of the Reserves and the Guard. They have families. They have \nchildren. They have spouses.\n  I am very concerned about those families and about the children of \nthose dual-military families. I am very concerned about deploying a \nmother and a father into a combat zone at the same time.\n  Two weeks ago I introduced S. 687 which would prohibit the concurrent \ndeployment of both parents with minor children to a combat zone. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in this legislation.\n  In discussing education legislation back home, it has come to my \nattention that in school districts where there is a heavy population of \nmilitary families, they are finding that the young children there are \ncrying out for help during this time. Impact aid is something that we \ngive to these areas to help them meet the needs of those families. \nClearly, they need this help at this time.\n  There are two ways to help: One is to push forward with impact aid--I \nhope we will do that--and, secondly, to help me with this legislation \nwhich would say that two parents of a minor child cannot go to a combat \nzone at the same time.\n  Last week there was an editorial in the Washington Post entitled \n``Mothers at War.'' The editorial calls on the Department of Defense to \nconsider staggering the deployment of two parents so the impact on \nchildren is minimized. That is exactly what my legislation does. I hope \nI will get help with it.\n  It is a horror to lose one parent in a war and one that one never, \never gets over. To lose two parents in such a circumstance would be \nbeyond devastation. The Department of Defense should work to ensure \nthat the children of dual military families never have to suffer seeing \nboth parents sent off to a combat zone at the same time. This is an \nissue whose time has come.\n  I ask, what is the order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Morning business is to conclude \nat 10.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it the understanding, further making a parliamentary \ninquiry, that the Democrats have until 10 or is that not determined?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will continue until 10.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator from California will yield, \nthe Senator from Texas is here to speak. I am sure the Republican \nleadership would not care if we extended morning business so she could \ncomplete her statement. I have spoken to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado who will speak about a Colorado judge who will be up next.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Texas be allowed to \ncontinue as in morning business after the hour of 10 until she \ncompletes her statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to make sure I was functioning under the rules. \nIt is very important that we have a chance to pay tribute to the young \nmen and women who are out there. The debate over what the expectations \nwere in this war will go on for many weeks and months and years. I am \nnot here to debate that. What I am here to say is that when all of us \nsaid that war is a last resort--and that was stated by everyone--I \nthink we see daily why we said that. We see daily why we have to try \neverything short of war that we can.\n  In my own history in the Senate, I have voted to go to war twice. I \nvoted\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\nnot to go twice. Each of us in our own mind makes this decision. Of \ncourse, our voters will decide whether we were correct or not. But \nregardless of the policy fights, what we have to continually remember, \nevery single minute, is that we have our sons and daughters over there \nright now.\n  Unlike other wars, many of them are parents. So the tragedy of losing \nthem cuts deeper and deeper than were they not, because the tragedy \ncuts to the parents and the grandparents and to the spouses and to the \nchildren. And for a child to really never know their father or mother \ncuts very deep.\n  I pray that this war ends soon. I pray that we don't see more of \nthese deaths and casualties and POWs. I pray that the POWs are treated \nright--they must be treated right according to the Geneva Conventions--\nthat we find out more about them and that the Red Cross can get in \nthere and see that they are OK. I pray that we won't see casualties to \ninnocent children and women. I pray for a lot.\n  Today I pay tribute to my Californians who will never come back and \nsee our beautiful State. I hope I won't have to come here in the days \nand weeks to come with more names.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I begin by saying I appreciate \nSenator Enzi. Senator Enzi came to the floor to speak about a subject \nvery important to him. I asked him if he would mind letting us spend \nthis entire hour in a tribute to the troops. He readily agreed. I \nappreciate his courtesy because we are reserving the first hour of \nevery day when our troops are in the field to giving tribute to them, \ntalking about some of the events that have happened in the field, \ntalking about some of the acts of heroism, the individual acts, showing \npictures of what life is like over there. I have done that on several \noccasions. I will again.\n  Today I want to talk about our prisoners. As the distinguished Chair \nunderstands--the Presiding Officer at this time is the other Senator \nfrom Texas--Texas is the base for the largest number of our active-duty \nmilitary. One in 10 active-duty personnel calls Texas home. It is the \nhome base for 114,000 active-duty service members. California comes in \nsecond with 107,000. North Carolina comes in third with 86,000. So we \ndo feel a personal effect of this war. We also feel a sense of pride \nthat it is our young men and women, along with all of those from the \nother States, who are out there on the front lines, protecting the \nfreedom we enjoy so much every day.\n  I would like to talk about some of those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice and some of those about whom we are not sure at this time. \nCpl Brian Matthew Kennedy, U.S. Marine Corps, 25 years old, from \nHouston, TX, grew up in Glenville, IL. He called his mom on March 18 to \ntell her he was about to go into action. ``It was very short and very \nspecial,'' she says of the call. Three days later, he died, when his \nSea Knight helicopter crashed in Kuwait. He said to his dad: We are \nready. We are ready. We are trained. We are ready to go. He was very \nproud. His parents are very proud of him.\n  SSgt Phillip Jordan, U.S. Marine Corps, 42 years of age, Brazoria, \nTX: Everyone called him Gump because he was so relentlessly upbeat. His \nson Tyler, 6, wants to be a marine like his father who was killed in a \nfire fight after a group of Iraqi soldiers feigned surrender.\n  Some are missing. Specialist James Kiehl, U.S. Army, 22, Comfort, TX, \na computer technician with the 507th Maintenance Company: Kiehl was \namong the missing in the convoy ambush near An Nasiriya. His father \nRandy has been monitoring war news on two televisions, three phone \nlines, and a computer, keeping up a strong front and a strong face for \nthe media, just in case they showed James any footage from back home.\n  PVT Ruben Estrella-Soto, U.S. Army, 18, El Paso: His father opposed \nhis enlisting but he wanted to study engineering, and he was \nenthusiastic about going into the military and getting his education. \nHe disappeared in the ambush on March 23 along with his friend Edgar \nHernandez, who later turned up on Iraqi TV. But Estrella-Soto's fate \nwas unknown. ``Not knowing anything is hard,'' Ruben Estrella, Sr., \ntold reporters.\n\n  CWO Johnny Villareal Mata, U.S. Army, 35, Pecos, TX: Mata grew up in \na desert town just 200 miles from Fort Bliss, where his 507th \nMaintenance Company is based.\n  SP Edgar Adan Hernandez, U.S. Army, 21 years old, Alton, TX: ``He's \ngot a noble character,'' his mother, Maria de la Luz Hernandez, says in \nSpanish. She then inadvertently slipped into the past tense: ``He was a \ngood brother, a good son, respectful to the whole world.'' Hernandez, \nthough, she believes is really alive. And he, too, was shown on Iraqi \nTV.\n  Captured: Army SP Shoshana Johnson, 30 years old, El Paso, TX: Her \nname means ``rose'' in Hebrew, the inspiration of an aunt who once \nworked as a nurse in Brooklyn. But her family is Panamanian American, \nand although she grew up in an Army family, she never expected to find \nherself on the front line. She is funloving, her younger sister Nikki \nsays. She also says, ``She is outgoing, independent and trustworthy--\ndefinitely not the kind of person who stays in front of the TV day in \nand day out.'' Shoshana's dream was to be a chef, but culinary school \ncosts a lot of money, and Army cook was close enough. It seemed safe \nenough, too.\n  But early on the morning of March 23, her father, Claude, was \nflipping through the channels looking for a cartoon show for Shoshana's \ntwo-year-old daughter, Janelle. He happened to catch a newscast on the \nSpanish language network, Telemundo. ``They said five Americans had \nbeen captured in Iraq. I caught one African-American female, 30 years \nold, from the 507th. Her name was Shana. I said it's got to be her.''\n  It was. Now her large extended family, including more than a dozen \ncousins, is watching and waiting. They are inspired by the relatives of \nElizabeth Smart who helped stay in the forefront of the press until \ntheir 15-year-old kidnapped daughter was returned. ``We just want her \nto be treated humanely,'' Nikki told Newsweek, ``and to return home \nswiftly and safely.''\n  I talked to the mother of one of those killed in Afghanistan last \nweek and she said, ``What I want is to make sure that my son did not \ndie in vain.'' I assured her that her son did not die in vain; that the \nwar on terrorism is going to protect the freedom for children and \ngrandchildren throughout America, and our staying vigilant and staying \non course will ensure that none of those who are already dead or are \nmissing will be forgotten. They have paid a heavy price for freedom and \nwe will always revere and respect them for what they have done for our \ncountry.\n  That concludes the tributes for today. The Senate is setting aside 1 \nhour every day for people to come to the floor and talk about some of \nthe wonderful acts that are being done by our young men and women on \nthe field as we speak today--protecting the way of life we have come to \nenjoy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I speak today with a profound sense of \nloss. A brave, young soldier from my home State of Oregon, Brandon S. \nTobler, was killed in Iraq. Oregon's first war fatality, Army Reserve \nSP Brandon Tobler, who was only 19, lost his life in a Humvee accident \nduring a sand storm. I have the last correspondence Brandon's parents \nreceived from their son, an e-mail sent just 2 weeks prior to his death \non March 22, 2003.\n  Brandon was the only son of Leon and Gail Tobler of Portland. He grew \nup there and joined the military to help pay for college. He was in a \nconvoy headed to Baghdad providing engineering support to the combat \ntroops. Private Tobler's death reminds us that a soldier doesn't have \nto be on the combat line to face tremendous danger and possible death. \nHis letter reminds of the bravery of each and every person who puts on \na uniform for the United States. Private Tobler will be laid to rest in \nthe Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, OR, on April 3, 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Brandon's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Hey Mom and Dad, How are things with you, I hope you are \n     both doing ok. I am doing fine, things here are going ok we \n     are just keeping busy. I am a little stressed but other than \n     that I am alright, I have been loaded down with a lot of \n     tasks that I have\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\n     not even been trained for, but I think I am doing an ok job. \n     Anyway I am sorry that I have not written you guys lately and \n     I know I have been writing Val a bit more than you guys and \n     that is something I really intend to change, I just want you \n     guys to know that I miss you guys a lot and love you guys \n     even more and I thank you both for the person you made me \n     become and all of the things you have struggled to get me \n     over the years. I really appreciate the support that you guys \n     have given me and accepting my enlistment in the Army. I feel \n     that if I can make a difference out here then I have done my \n     part. If I can save one life, if I can do something that \n     makes a family sleep easier at night without fear then I have \n     done my purpose, cause I know now that's what my calling is \n     in life, not to make money or be powerful and wealthy but to \n     simply make a difference. And I thank you my loving parents \n     for all that you have done to get me this far, but now I have \n     to take the next step and make a difference for someone else \n     out there. Well go ahead and pass this around to everyone in \n     the family, Val too . . . And to the family my love and best \n     wishes and prayers go out to you, little Veronica or shall I \n     say big Veronica, I miss playing with her and being her big \n     cousin but at least my being here will help keep her safe and \n     grow up happy and full of life as she is already. So to my \n     family, if you see a soldier one of my comrades in arms, \n     please thank them for the service they give, pray for them \n     because we as soldiers give up sooo much to come out here and \n     in sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of \n     freedom and soldiers could always use encouragement and a \n     thanks. . . Well my love to you guys and I'll see you soon. . \n     .\n           Love to all,\n     Brandon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4598-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TYMKOVICH, OF COLORADO, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 55, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Nomination of Timothy M. Tymkovich, of Colorado, to be \n     United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 6 \nhours of debate, with the time equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I strongly support the confirmation of Tim \nTymkovich as a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The \nnomination is before the Senate. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting his confirmation.\n  Two years ago, one of the most talented lawyers in the State of \nColorado faced a rather large but very exciting dilemma. Most of us \nwould not look at his particular situation as a dilemma at all but, \ninstead, view it as a welcome set of exciting career opportunities.\n  With the new administration filling vacancies and political \nappointments, he was offered the chance to serve the people of the \nUnited States, a chance to use his skills as a premier attorney through \nthe Federal Government. This lawyer had practiced both civil litigation \nand appeals with an emphasis on regulatory and administrative law, \nparticularly in the areas of telecommunications and public utilities. \nHe served for 5 years as Colorado's solicitor general. He served as a \nlaw clerk to Justice William H. Erickson of the Colorado Supreme Court.\n  With all this experience under his belt, he had to decide whether to \npursue a career with the Department of the Interior under the \nleadership of fellow Coloradan Gale Norton or to continue working in \nhis successful law practice and to answer the call of his countrymen \nand President and to strive to serve the Nation as a judge on the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  What choice did the attorney of whom I speak make? What path did Tim \nTymkovich choose? He chose to pursue the Federal judgeship and to \nfulfill his sincere desire to lead a life of public service, a life \ndedicated to upholding the law and our Constitution.\n  On May 25, 2001, President Bush nominated Mr. Tymkovich to the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. On February 12, 2003, under the leadership of \nSenator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nMr. Tymkovich finally received a hearing. Today, nearly 2 years later, \nthe Senate has picked up his nomination for consideration by the entire \nbody.\n  Today's actions, 23 months after his nomination, move us closer to \nfulfilling the Senate's duty as laid out in the Constitution through \nthe advise and consent clause of article II. This vote has been a long \ntime in the making. After several letters, several floor statements, \nand almost 2 years after the original date of his nomination, Tim \nTymkovich is finally getting an up-or-down vote.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for moving his nomination out of the committee. \nI thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, for scheduling this debate \nand the vote later on today.\n  The nominating process is a grueling one. To be confirmed, Mr. \nTymkovich, along with his fellow nominees, put his life on hold to \nawait action by the Senate on his nomination. In Mr. Tymkovich's case, \nhe had to endure 2 years of uncertainty, not knowing whether he should \nchange his law firm partnership, pursue other options, or wait for the \nSenate to grind forward, with each step and every decision scrutinized \nby the Senate. Undoubtedly, he had other career opportunities, other \nchoices that would have led to remarkable successes. As you will \nrecall, I mentioned the Department of the Interior possibility at the \nbeginning of my remarks. Yet he chose to pursue the Tenth Circuit court \nnomination.\n  As we have witnessed with the Miguel Estrada debate, the judicial \nnomination process has broken down into partisan politics and \nentrenchment, taking a heavy toll on the life of the nominee and on the \nquality of justice delivered to the American people.\n\n  Today we have the opportunity to begin to correct this dangerous path \nwe have been traveling. Tim Tymkovich has my unqualified support. \nConfirmation of his nomination by this body will prove to be a great \nservice to the people of the United States. His nomination has enjoyed \nbroad bipartisan support--support from judges and colleagues, both \nDemocrat and Republican policymakers.\n  I have a series of charts highlighting support for his confirmation, \ncharts I would like to share with you today.\n  The first chart quotes Roy Romer, former Governor of Colorado, and, I \nmight add, former Democratic National Committee chairman who served \nunder the tenure of President Bill Clinton and who is now \nsuperintendent of the Los Angeles United School District. Mr. Romer is \na strong supporter of Mr. Tymkovich and has expressed his sentiment to \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Governor Romer, in a letter to the committee, wrote:\n\n       Mr. Tymkovich served the State of Colorado from 1991 \n     through 1996 during the latter part of my tenure as Governor \n     of the State of Colorado. He served with distinction and was \n     a strong advocate in legal matters for Colorado. He also \n     demonstrated a capacity to work closely with Colorado \n     Democrats, as well as Republicans, as Solicitor General. . . \n     . He was always a straight shooter in giving legal advice to \n     me and my top staff.\n\n  Governor Romer believes his past legal experiences have given Mr. \nTymkovich a broad understanding of the varied legal issues that may \ncome before him on the Tenth Circuit. Governor Romer believes Mr. \nTymkovich will bring strong legal credentials to the court and a \njudicial temperament that should garner the support of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Governor Romer be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\n\n                                        Los Angeles Unified School\n\n\n                                 District, Board of Education,\n\n                                                September 6, 2002.\n     Re Nomination of Timothy M. Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit \n         Court of Appeals.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I write \n     this letter in support of the nomination of Timothy M. \n     Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado. \n     I have both worked with Mr. Tymkovich in his capacity as \n     Colorado's Solicitor General or as a private practitioner in \n     Denver.\n       Mr. Tymkovich served the State of Colorado from 1991 \n     through 1996 during the latter part of my tenure as Governor \n     of the State of Colorado. He served with distinction and was \n     a strong advocate in legal matters for Colorado. He also \n     demonstrated a capacity to work closely with Colorado \n     Democrats as well as Republicans as Solicitor General, both \n     in my Administration and in Colorado's General Assembly. He \n     was always a straight shooter in giving legal advice to me \n     and my top Staff. He is currently in private practice in \n     Denver and has represented Chris Romer's Colorado Education \n     Network on state taxation and public policy matters. He \n     recently helped craft an analysis of Colorado's \n     constitutional budget law that could have important positive \n     implications for our State in a lean economic year.\n       Mr. Tymkovich is a native of Colorado and I believe his \n     past legal experiences have given him a broad understanding \n     of the varied legal issues that may come before him in the \n     Tenth Circuit. In addition, he has served Colorado in many \n     ways in both the public and private sectors. He presently \n     serves as Chairman of the Colorado Board of Ethics (which \n     advises the Governor and executive branch on state ethics \n     matters) and he recently chaired a bipartisan task force on \n     civil justice reform. He currently is a member of the \n     American Bar Association's American Bar Foundation and the \n     American Law Institute, two important organizations dedicated \n     to the impartial administration of justice. The ABA has \n     already found him qualified to serve on the Tenth Circuit.\n       Mr. Tymkovich's nomination is currently waiting review by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has bipartisan support in \n     Colorado and both major newspapers in Colorado have praised \n     his nomination. I believe that he will bring strong legal \n     credentials and a judicial temperament that should garner the \n     support of the United States Senate.\n       I urge you to favorably review Mr. Tymkovich's nomination \n     and refer it to the full Senate of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Roy Romer,\n                                        Superintendent of Schools.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Mr. Tymkovich is well respected for his \napproach to the law and for problem solving. He manages cases and \nclients with civility and understanding, setting a high example for the \nlegal community.\n  On a second chart, I highlight excerpts from an editorial written by \nthe Rocky Mountain News. On June 3, 2001, the paper editorialized:\n\n       If Senators give Tymkovich a serious look, they'll find \n     someone who combines intellectual heft and steady \n     temperament.\n\n  On February 16, 2003, the News restated their endorsement of Mr. \nTymkovich, writing:\n\n       We wish him prompt confirmation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two editorials from \nthe Rocky Mountain News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, June 3, 2001]\n\n                         Good Choice for Court\n\n       It remains to be seen whether Tim Tymkovich's nomination \n     for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals will founder on U.S. \n     Senate partisanship. He once was, after all, state solicitor \n     general under Gale Norton, now one of President Bush's most \n     controversial Cabinet members.\n       But if senators give Tymkovitch a serious look, they'll \n     find someone who combines the intellectual heft and steady \n     temperament that most senators profess to seek in a \n     prospective Federal judge.\n       Previously, Tymkovitch's most visible moment involved the \n     state's defense of voter-passed Amendment 2, which the courts \n     overturned. But however unsuccessful his defense of that \n     amendment may have been, his arguments were measured and \n     well-crafted--just as they have been on many other legal \n     topics.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, Feb. 16, 2003]\n\n                          Tymkovich's Hearing\n\n       Tim Tymkovich, former Colorado Solicitor General, waited \n     nearly 21 months for a hearing before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on his nomination for the 10th Circuit U.S. Court \n     of Appeals.\n       Why, that's just about long enough for an elephant to give \n     birth, which is no accident, because the intolerable delays \n     in judicial confirmations is very much a matter of \n     elephants--and donkeys.\n       When Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont defected from the \n     Republican party and turned over control of the Senate to the \n     Democrats, they made a determined effort to prevent President \n     Bush from naming philosophically compatible judges, as \n     presidents of both parties have long done.\n       Tymkovich, nominated just days after Jeffords' switch, was \n     caught in the political gridlock.\n       He finally had his hearing Wednesday. We wish him prompt \n     confirmation.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Denver Post, a paper that endorsed Al \nGore over George Bush, stated on May 30, 2001, that Tim Tymkovich:\n\n       has gained a local reputation as a thoughtful, insightful \n     attorney who knows the law and works hard to uphold it. . . \n     .We urge the Senate to confirm Tymkovich to fill a seat that \n     has sat vacant since 1999. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Denver Post article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, May 30, 2001]\n\n                      Tymkovich Should Serve Well\n\n       We hope the new Democratic majority on the U.S. Senate will \n     set aside partisan politics when it considers Denver attorney \n     Tim Tymkovich's nomination to serve on the 10th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       But we also hope the American Bar Association will continue \n     to voluntarily scrutinize all nominees headed to the Senate, \n     even though the Bush administration stripped the ABA of its \n     official role in screening judicial candidates prior to their \n     nomination.\n       Tymkovich should be no exception, though he has gained a \n     local reputation as a thoughtful, insightful attorney who \n     knows the law and works hard to uphold it.\n       He first gained real notice when, as state solicitor \n     general, he was assigned to defend amendment 2, a Colorado \n     initiative that would have banned laws to protect gays.\n       Then-Attorney General Gale Norton was legally obliged to \n     defend the amendment. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court \n     rejected this sloppily worded and unconstitutional amendment \n     doesn't reflect on Tymkovich's legal skills or politics.\n       Indeed, Jean Dubofsky, a former Colorado Supreme Court \n     justice who successfully led the legal challenge against \n     Amendment 2, supports Tymkovich's nomination.\n       Tymkovich is only 44, but he has been practicing law in the \n     public and private arenas since 1982 and is a long-time \n     member of the American Bar Association, the American Law \n     Institute and the International Society of Barristers.\n       He also is a member of the Federalist Society, which comes \n     as no surprise considering how that group's conservative, \n     Libertarian orientation dovetails with the conservative slant \n     of the Bush administration.\n       Still, we don't expect Bush to be nominating liberal \n     Democrats to lifelong positions on the federal bench anytime \n     soon. And Tymkovich is far less conservative than his fellow \n     nominee to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court. Michael McConnell, a \n     law professor at the University of Utah, has defended \n     vouchers for religious schools and argued to reinterpret the \n     Constitution's division between church and state.\n       The conservative Christian's experience in pubic law is far \n     deeper than Tymkovich's, but his reputation as an ideologue \n     likely will stymie his chances with the Senate.\n       While we cannot support McConnell, we urge the Senate to \n     confirm Tymkovich to fill a seat that has sat vacant since \n     1999, when Judge John Porfilio took senior status.\n       We also encourage the Senate to carefully defend the \n     Judiciary from any Bush efforts at `court packing,' whereby \n     nominees are selected for their political philosophy rather \n     than their legal expertise.\n       Federal judges and justices are obligated to carefully \n     apply the law of the land, not the politics of the president \n     in power.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. Tymkovich understands the West, its community, and \nits past. He has traveled extensively throughout the States of the \nTenth Circuit with his wife Suzanne, a western historian and novelist, \nas well as an accomplished attorney in her own right. Together they \ntraveled near and far, covering the old stomping grounds of legendary \nwestern figures such as Butch Cassidy and others.\n  Undoubtedly, this deep knowledge of western heritage will aid in his \nduties and his understanding of the law, as well as the rich judicial \nhistory of the Tenth Circuit.\n  Tim Tymkovich's commitment to public service is unparalleled. I have \nhad many conversations with him, and know him to be a man of keen \nintellect and integrity. Through our many conversations, I have \ndeveloped a strong understanding of Tim's deep commitment to public \nservice and his strong personal respect for the rule of law in \nprotecting people and the interests of the State.\n  Tim Tymkovich's legal credentials reveal a man who values \nindependence\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nand fairness in the judicial process. A man who understands the \nimplication of a lifetime appointment to our Nation's courts, a man who \ntruly believes that there is no higher professional calling than to \nserve the American people through the impartial administration of the \nlaw. He will serve our Nation with the utmost of respect to our country \nand our Constitution, and for this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote \nfavorably to confirm his nomination.\n  No one has a better understanding of the character and intellectual \nprowess of an attorney than his or her co-workers and peers. The legal \nprofession is filled with practicing attorneys, lawyers who work in \nprivate firms, in the public sector, and who serve the public from the \nbench. The impression left on other attorneys by encounters with them \nat various stages of litigation and negotiation is obviously an \nimportant factor in determining whether a nominee is well suited for \nthe bench. They work day-in and day-out with the nominee and have first \nhand knowledge about the type of judge a particular attorney will make. \nAt this time, I would like to share some of the comments made by Mr. \nTymkovich's colleagues.\n  In the third chart, I have reprinted a statement from William H. \nErickson, former Chief Justice to the Colorado Supreme Court, and to \nwhom Mr. Tymkovich served as a law clerk. Justice Erickson stated:\n\n       I served on the Colorado Supreme Court for twenty-five \n     years and had the privilege of working with a number of \n     outstanding law clerks. Tim was one of the finest clerks that \n     served in my chambers. He has an outstanding legal background \n     that qualifies him for service on the Tenth Circuit.\n\n  Justice Erickson has maintained a close relationship with Tim, his \nwife, and their two sons, and has expressed over and over again his \nstrong belief that he would--and will--make a significant addition to \nthe Tenth Circuit.\n  In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Justice Erickson wrote \nthat,\n\n       As counsel to the Columbine Review Commission that \n     investigated the Columbine High School shooting, Tymkovich \n     served with great distinction and materially assisted the \n     Commission's preparation of a report that hopefully will \n     prevent other school shootings.\n\n  In a letter to Senator Hatch dated January 23, 2003, five former \njustices of the Colorado Supreme Court urged the Senate's timely \nconsideration of his nomination. The justices, including Justice Jean \nDubofsky, wrote:\n\n       Over the past nearly twenty years, each of us has had the \n     opportunity to observe Timothy M. Tymkovich as a practitioner \n     employed by or appearing before the Colorado Supreme Court. \n     During that time, Mr. Tymkovich served as a law clerk \n     employed by one of the justices of our court and later as \n     counsel representing the State of Colorado before the Court. \n     We have also had the opportunity to observe Mr. Tymkovich as \n     an attorney serving in bar organizations such as the American \n     Law Institute, the American Bar Foundation and as a staff \n     attorney of public commissions. Based on our professional \n     experiences, we are of the unanimous judgment that he is well \n     qualified and most able to serve as an appellate judge of the \n     United States Court of Appeals.\n\n  This group of justices, coming from varied political backgrounds and \ndiffering professional experiences and diverse legal careers and \ndifferent racial, gender and ethnic backgrounds, unanimously support \nthe confirmation of Tim Tymkovich by the entire Senate. An endorsement \nof this kind cannot, and must not, be taken lightly. These justices, \nJean Dubofsky, Joseph Quinn, William Neighbors, Gregory Scott, and Luis \nRovira, consider Mr. Tymkovich to possess the necessary attributes of a \nFederal judge, and that Colorado and the Nation should no longer be \nsubjected to undue delay on his nomination.\n  The justices' letter ends with this powerful statement:\n\n       . . . [W]e speak as one voice, resolute in our belief that \n     the people are entitled to and that Mr. Tymkovich is most \n     deserving of consideration . . . Mr. Tymkovich's experience, \n     practice, public service, temperament and skills will serve \n     the people of the United States well.\n\n  Their unqualified support speaks volumes about Tymkovich's \ncredentials. This powerful and unequivocal endorsement deserves \nrepeating:\n\n       . . . [W]e speak as one voice, resolute in our belief that \n     the people are entitled to and that Mr. Tymkovich is most \n     deserving of consideration . . . Mr. Tymkovich's experience, \n     practice, public service, temperament and skills will serve \n     the people of the United States well.\n\n  This statement deserves our attention and our respect.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the letter from these five justices \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  January 23, 2003\n     Re Senate consideration of the nomination of Timothy M. \n         Tymkovich as a Judge of the United States Court of \n         Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman Hatch: We are all former justices of the \n     Colorado Supreme Court. We write to express our personal and \n     professional concern and seek the timely consideration of the \n     nomination of Timothy M. Tymkovich as a Judge of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ever mindful \n     of the Separation of Powers Doctrine as well as the Supremacy \n     Clause of the United States Constitution, we do not write to \n     impose or suggest our will should prevail over that of the \n     United States Senate. Instead, as private citizens with a \n     unique perspective concerning the attibutes and abilities of \n     Mr. Tymkovich, we write to petition your attention to our \n     concern to urge that a hearing be scheduled for Mr. \n     Tymkovich.\n       Over the past nearly twenty years, each of us has had the \n     opportunity to observe Timothy M. Tymkovich as a practitioner \n     employed by or appearing before the Colorado Supreme Court. \n     During that time, Mr. Tymkovich served as a law clerk \n     employed by one of the justices of our court and later as \n     counsel representing the State of Colorado before the Court. \n     We have also had the opportunity to observe Mr. Tymkovich as \n     an attorney serving in bar organizations such as the American \n     Law Institute, the American Bar Foundation and as a staff \n     attorney of public commissions.\n       Based on our professional experiences, we are of the \n     unanimous judgment that he is well qualified and most able to \n     serve as an appellate judge of the United States Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Consistent with our professional assessments, the President \n     of the United States has seen fit to nominate Mr. Tymkovich \n     to serve as a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     However, while nominated more than a year ago, we understand \n     that his nomination is currently awaiting consideration by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee that you chair. We do not \n     propose to instruct the Chair in the conduct of the Senate's \n     business, for we are not able nor do we intend to assume such \n     a role or purpose. Nonetheless, we do ask that the \n     President's nomination of Mr. Tymkovich be considered \n     expeditiously.\n       Mr. Chairman, despite coming from varied political \n     backgrounds and differing professional experiences as diverse \n     legal careers and different racial, gender and ethnic \n     backgrounds, we are of the unanimous opinion that Mr. \n     Tymkovich should be considered by your Committee and \n     confirmed by the entire Senate. We also conclude and share \n     the opinion that he not only possesses the attributes we \n     appreciate in judges, both federal and state, but that he is \n     entitled to fair and civil treatment by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. The citizens of Colorado and indeed our Nation \n     should no longer be subjected to undue delay confronted by \n     anything other than a full and fair review of his nomination \n     in accordance with the rules of the United States Senate.\n       Without listing his considerable accomplishments as an \n     attorney engaged in public service and private practice, we \n     speak as one vote, resolute in our belief that the people are \n     entitled to and that Mr. Tymkovich is most deserving of \n     consideration by your Committee. The President's nomination \n     is a considerate one and Mr. Tymkovich's experience, \n     practice, public service, temperament and skills will serve \n     the people of the United States well.\n       Together, therefore, we respectfully urge you to place his \n     nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee so that a \n     fair and prompt review of Mr. Tymkovich's credentials can be \n     made without much further delay.\n       Moreover, we most strongly recommend and heartily urge the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee refer his nomination to the full \n     Senate of the United States for a definitive vote as soon as \n     practicable.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Jean E. Dubofsky,\n       Justice.\n     Joseph O. Quinn,\n       Chief Justice.\n     William D. Neighbors,\n       Justice.\n     Gregory Kellan Scott,\n       Justice.\n     Luis D. Rovira,\n       Chief Justice.\n\n  As the end of the second year of his nomination approaches, I \nsincerely hope that my colleagues will act today to fill the 4-year \nvacancy on the Tenth Circuit, so that the people of Colorado, Utah, New \nMexico, Oklahoma and Nebraska, and indeed the Nation, will no\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nlonger be short-changed by a vacant bench. While this seat has remained \nempty for nearly 4 years, the States that comprise the Tenth Circuit \nhave experienced unprecedented population growth, and causing a docket \noverload at the Federal level. The vacancy must be filled, and \nTymkovich is the proper person to fill the seat.\n  The events of September 11 clearly demonstrate an active effort by \nthe enemies of the United States to destroy the liberties and freedom \nof our Nation. The most basic of our country's values and traditions \ncame under attack, and now we are taking action against those \nperpetrators. In the wake of tragedy, Congress has enacted new laws \nthat provide financial assistance to businesses, families and defense, \nand we are currently taking strong military measures to suffocate \nterrorists and destroy the hateful organizations that work to undermine \nour society and destroy our liberty.\n  I am sure that my colleagues will agree that a necessary component of \nproviding justice and protecting liberty and freedom is an efficient \ncourt system, a court equipped with the personnel and resources that \nenable it to fulfill its constitutional role. Today, this body has \nanother opportunity to restore the faith of the citizenry and to fill a \n4-year vacancy. I urge the Senate to show the American people that the \nSenate is indeed interested in serving justice, in protecting our laws \nand our people, and to support the nomination of Tim Tymkovich. He is \nhighly qualified and will serve his country with the utmost of \npatriotism, and respect for adherence to constitutional principles. He \nrespects our laws. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the \nnomination of Tim Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the time used during the quorum \ncall time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the nomination of \nTimothy Tymkovich to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit in the Judiciary Committee, and I will do so again today. \nI would like to take a few minutes to explain my decision.\n  I cannot support the nomination of Mr. Tymkovich because I am not \nconvinced that he will give all those who appear before him a fair and \nimpartial hearing. I am concerned that he lacks a commitment to apply \nand uphold our Constitution's equal protection guarantees, especially \nin protecting gay Americans from discrimination.\n  In 1996, in a case called Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court ruled \nunconstitutional a Colorado ballot initiative that sought to overturn \ncity ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. \nAs solicitor general of Colorado, Mr. Tymkovich defended the ballot \ninitiative on behalf of the State. Obviously, I know it was his job to \ndo that. But I am concerned that it is his personal belief--his \npersonal belief--that gay Americans do not have a right to equal \nprotection and equal justice under the laws, and he did not convince me \nhe would put aside those personal beliefs when he becomes a judge.\n  Mr. Tymkovich wrote a law review article that was published in 1997 \nby the University of Colorado about the Romer decision. In this \narticle, which, I might add, he wrote and published after he left his \njob as Colorado's solicitor general, he, in my view, went beyond \nrepresenting his client and actually presented his personal views. He \nforcefully promoted the view that laws against discrimination based on \nsexual orientation in activities like employment, housing, and \neducation in places like Denver, Aspen, and Boulder somehow conferred \n``special rights or protections'' on gays and lesbians. Let me quote a \nbit from his article. He wrote:\n\n       A number of governmental entities in Colorado had granted \n     special rights or protections to homosexuals and bisexuals: \n     the cities of Denver, Boulder, and Aspen enacted ordinances \n     prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in \n     jobs, housing, and public accommodations; the Colorado Civil \n     Rights Commission had moved to extend the state's civil \n     rights act to ban discrimination based upon sexual \n     orientation; the governor of Colorado issued an order \n     prohibiting job discrimination for state employees based on \n     sexual orientation and began to fashion ``sensitivity'' \n     training for the state's executive branch; and public \n     educational institutions had begun adopting policies \n     prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich's view is that employers and landlords have the \n``liberty,'' or right, to discriminate against individuals based on \ntheir sexual orientation. He wrote:\n\n       Eliminating the liberty of landlords and employers to take \n     account of homosexuality send the unmistakable message that \n     homosexual behavior, like race, is a characteristic which \n     only an irrational bigot would consider. By restoring \n     government neutrality of this difficult and divisive moral \n     issue, Amendment 2 promotes freedom and diversity by allowing \n     different groups in the community to hold, and act on, \n     different views on this question.\n\n  I sought to question Mr. Tymkovich about this. And when I attempted \nto probe Mr. Tymkovich at his confirmation hearing about his view that \ncivil rights laws like the city ordinances at issue in Romer somehow \nconfer ``special rights'' on gay Americans, he was suddenly and, to me, \nalmost inexplicably evasive. I was frustrated with Mr. Tymkovich's \nreluctance to answer questions that would reveal his thought process. I \nwas interested in his views on an important issue for our Nation--civil \nrights and the distinction he saw between rights for African Americans \nand rights for gay Americans. Even though he had already shared his \npersonal views on the question of gay rights in a law review article--a \npublic forum--he suddenly seemed reluctant to discuss those views with \nthe committee.\n  I asked Mr. Tymkovich a question as follows:\n\n       As you discussed in your article, you believe that the \n     Supreme Court was wrong to be hostile to the political \n     decision of a majority of Colorado voters who supported \n     adoption of the Colorado amendment. You state that Colorado \n     voters made ``a seemingly good-faith policy choice.''\n       If I understand you correctly, you agree with Justice \n     Scalia's dissent in Romer and that the court improperly \n     injected itself into a political debate. Is that your view?\n\n  That was the conclusion of my question. Here was Mr. Tymkovich's \ninitial response:\n\n       Senator, that's an excellent question, and I appreciate the \n     opportunity to clarify and reflect on the issue below.\n       As you know from your participation in this body, there are \n     important issues of public policy debate that cross party \n     lines or are bipartisan and very difficult issues. In \n     Colorado, the question of whether or not to add sexual \n     orientation to State and local anti-discrimination laws has \n     been a very important and ongoing political debate in our \n     State. And certainly, Amendment 2 was in part within that \n     context and dialogue. And certainly many people respectfully \n     disagreed with the legislative pronouncement there, and I \n     think the point I was trying to make in those remarks and \n     certainly in the case is that the courts were not a good \n     forum for airing sort of political or legislative policy-type \n     arguments, and that the courts are best able to address a \n     constitutional principle when they have the concrete facts \n     and law before them and not sort of rhetorical or \n     legislative-type pronouncements.\n       The Amendment 2 case had a strong mix of sort of a policy \n     debate in that sense, and I think my comment was that the \n     policy debate and certainly the arguments we made to the \n     courts is that that would be better left to the political \n     process.\n\n  I then followed up by saying:\n\n       I am taking that as a yes, that you agree with Justice \n     Scalia that the Court improperly injected itself into a \n     political debate. Do you believe that the Court should have--\n     is that fair?\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich responded:\n\n       Senator, I think Justice Scalia accepted some of the \n     presentation of the State, but then rejected others. So I \n     don't wholly agree or disagree with the dissent in the case, \n     but it does reflect some of the arguments that were made.\n\n  I then asked:\n\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\n\n       Do you agree with that point?\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich responded:\n\n       I agree--the presentation that the state made to the \n     Supreme Court was that it was a policy debate and not subject \n     to the Supremacy Clause of the equal protections. But, again, \n     as I testified earlier, that argument, that presentation was \n     not accepted by the Court, and regardless of my personal \n     views, I am perfectly capable and willing to impartially \n     apply that precedent.\n\n  The reason I am going through this is that it is important to make a \nrecord for this point. Mr. Tymkovich and I then had a dialog that \nlasted quite a few pages of the transcript where I repeatedly asked him \nto discuss his personal views on this issue, not simply the position he \nhad argued on behalf of the State, given that he had discussed them in \nthe law review article. He essentially refused to answer the question.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full transcript of my questioning of \nMr. Tymkovich be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Feingold. I will go back to the issue of gay rights \n     and your involvement as Solicitor General of Colorado in the \n     case that led to the U.S. Supreme Court's Romer v. Evans \n     decision. As has been discussed by Senator Schumer and \n     Senator Sessions, you defended the ballot initiative on \n     behalf of the State of Colorado. It was, I agree, your job to \n     do that and I accept that. But I do want to ask you a bit \n     about what perhaps goes beyond the zealous advocacy for your \n     client, and this is the article that we are discussing, the \n     1997 University of Colorado Law Review, that forcefully \n     presents your view that laws against discrimination based on \n     sexual orientation in activities like employment, housing, \n     and education in places like Denver, Aspen, and Boulder \n     somehow conferred special rights or protections on gays and \n     lesbians.\n       Let me ask you this: Do you believe that title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964, the landmark legislation \n     prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, confers \n     special rights on African Americans?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, the anti-discrimination laws in \n     Colorado and at the Federal level are important protections \n     to minorities and others that have faced discrimination. So \n     to the extent that the baseline was no, you know, Federal or \n     State protections based on ethnicity or race, the addition of \n     those laws to the legislative pronouncement provides a \n     protection, an additional protection that would not be \n     available under the common law. So in that sense, certainly \n     under Colorado law, additional protections are provided \n     through the discrimination laws, and I might add that's an \n     important part of the legislative process to identify and \n     protect injustices out there.\n       Senator Feingold. But what about my question? Does Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 confer special rights on \n     African Americans?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by \n     ``special rights,'' Senator, but I would say----\n       Senator Feingold. Well, I am referring to the fact that \n     your article seemed to say that the Colorado law conferred \n     special rights or protections on gays and lesbians. I am \n     asking you whether or not Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964 in that same spirit in your view confers special \n     rights on African Americans?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. No, Senator. I think it provides a civil \n     remedy, some laws provide a criminal remedy, on behalf of \n     discrimination, and certainly that's the intent and purpose \n     of those laws.\n       Senator Feingold. In that same spirit, do you think that \n     Title VII wrongly protects Americans from employment \n     discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, \n     religion, age, disability, or gender? Do you believe that an \n     American who brings a claim of job discrimination based on \n     any one or more of these categories is somehow enjoying \n     special rights or protections?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. No, Senator. They're simply enjoying the \n     protections that this body has provided to those particular \n     groups.\n       Senator Feingold. As you discussed in your article, you \n     believe that the Supreme Court was wrong to be hostile to the \n     political decision of a majority of Colorado voters who \n     supported adoption of the Colorado amendment. You state that \n     Colorado voters made ``a seemingly good-faith policy \n     choice.''\n       If I understand you correctly, you agree with Justice \n     Scalia's dissent in Romer and believe that the Court \n     improperly injected itself into a political debate. Is that \n     your view?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, that's an excellent question, and I \n     appreciate the opportunity to clarify and reflect on the \n     issue below.\n       As you know from your participation in this body, there are \n     important issues of public policy debate that cross party \n     lines or are bipartisan and very difficult issues. In \n     Colorado, the question of whether or not to add sexual \n     orientation to State and local anti-discrimination laws has \n     been a very important and ongoing political debate in our \n     State. And certainly Amendment 2 was in part within that \n     context and dialogue. And certainly many people respectfully \n     disagreed with the legislative pronouncement there, and I \n     think the point I was trying to make in those remarks and \n     certainly in the case is that the courts were not a good \n     forum for airing sort of political or legislative policy-type \n     arguments, and that the courts are best able to address a \n     constitutional principle when they have the concrete facts \n     and law before them and not sort of rhetorical or \n     legislative-type pronouncements.\n       The Amendment 2 case had a strong mix of sort of a policy \n     debate in that sense, and I think my comment was that the \n     policy debate and certainly the arguments we made to the \n     courts is that that would be better left to the political \n     process.\n       Senator Feingold. I am taking that as a yes, that you agree \n     with Justice Scalia that the Court improperly injected itself \n     into a political debate. Do you believe that the Court should \n     have--is that fair?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, I think Justice Scalia accepted \n     some of the presentation of the State, but they rejected \n     others. So I don't wholly agree or disagree with the dissent \n     in the case, but it does----\n       Senator Feingold. Do you agree with that point?\n       Mr. Tymkovich [continuing]. Reflect some of the arguments \n     that were made.\n       Senator Feingold. Do you agree with that point?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. I agree--the presentation that the State \n     made to the Supreme Court was that it was a policy debate and \n     not subject to the Supremacy Clause of the equal protections. \n     But, again, as I testified earlier, that argument, that \n     presentation was not accepted by the Court, and regardless of \n     my personal views, I am perfectly capable and willing to \n     impartially apply that precedent.\n       Senator Feingold. That isn't what I am asking. I have asked \n     your personal view, and I take it that your personal view is \n     that the Court did the wrong thing here and improperly \n     injected itself into the political debate. I understand that \n     you would follow the law based on the Court's decision.\n       Mr. Tymkovich. I would follow the law.\n       Senator Feingold. Do you believe that the Court should have \n     given more consideration to the privacy, associational, and \n     religious rights of persons who do not condone homosexual \n     behavior?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, the lower courts in Colorado had \n     identified that there were religious and associational \n     factors that would be implicated by the laws that were \n     preempted by Amendment 2. I think, again, that that, as I've \n     tried to explain in my previous testimony, is part of the \n     political give-and-take, the public policy give-and-take in \n     crafting a gay rights law that would accommodate certain \n     interests, and certainly that's part of the policy debate \n     that we've seen in our State. Certainly the Amendment 2 \n     provision would have required that debate to go at the \n     statewide level, and as I recall, even during the \n     judicial proceedings on Amendment 2, there was a move to \n     enact a statewide initiative that would----\n       Senator Feingold. Okay. I accept that, but I am asking you \n     your personal view. You are an expert on this. Do you think \n     the Court should have given more consideration--you, do you \n     think the Court should have given more consideration to the \n     privacy, associational, and religious rights of persons who \n     do not condone homosexual behavior?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, I think that in that case, as \n     others, as an advocate, as a representative of my client, we \n     were presenting what we thought were the best arguments based \n     on the applicable case law----\n       Senator Feingold. I am asking your view right now.\n       Mr. Tymkovich [continuing]. To the Supreme Court.\n       Senator Feingold. I am not asking in your role as an \n     advocate. I am asking in your view should the Court have \n     taken that more into account?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. I think, as I've testified earlier, \n     indicated in my article, that I believe that we had strong \n     arguments based on the existing precedent at the time and \n     asked that the Court accept that.\n       Senator Feingold. Well, you seem to be refusing to give \n     your own view on this, and I don't know why. This isn't a \n     pending case. This is a case that was resolved by the Supreme \n     Court. You have strong opinions indicated I here, and I don't \n     understand why you can't give me your personal view.\n       Mr. Tymkovich. I think I've reflected the views that we \n     presented to the Court, and as I've testified----\n       Senator Feingold. You did do that and that is all you have \n     done, and you are not answering my question.\n       Throughout our Nation's history, proponents of racial \n     discrimination have used the argument that they should be \n     free to discriminate based on their privacy, associational, \n     or religious rights. In Brown v. Board of Education of \n     Topeka, Kansas, the Supreme Court injected itself into a \n     contentious political debate where in some parts of the \n     country separate but equal schools were defended to the point \n     of literally spilling blood over the issue.\n       Do you believe that Brown v. Board of Eduation was wrongly \n     decided and that the Supreme Court should not have injected \n     itself into the policy question of maintaining school \n     segregation?\n       Mr. tymkovich. Senator, it's an important question because \n     certainly the history of discrimination in this country has \n     had a very mixed and very sorry record at times, and the \n     Brown decision is certainly a reflection of part of that \n     history.\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n       One of the reasons I went to law school was the influence \n     of a book I read about the Brown case called ``Simple \n     Justice'' that traced the history of the legal development \n     from Plessy v. Ferguson to the Brown decision, and a very \n     powerful historical book about the legal and social and \n     ideological aspects of discrimination in this country.\n       So certainly Brown is one of the cornerstones of American \n     jurisprudence, and certainly its foundation is a very \n     important part----\n       Senator Feingold. So you obviously don't disagree with that \n     decision, and that is why I want to ask you: What is the \n     difference in your mind between African Americans and gay \n     people in terms of whether laws protecting them from \n     discrimination are permissible?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, I think that it's a very important \n     part of the public policy debate to analyze the rationale and \n     the reasons for a particular legislative judgment. I don't \n     sit here today as having a legislative agenda. I do not. My \n     goal as a Tenth Circuit judge, if confirmed, would be to \n     impartially and fairly and open-mindedly apply the law. \n     You're asking me for a legislative judgment, and I \n     certainly----\n       Senator Feingold. No. I am asking you your personal \n     opinion, having studied this in law school, having the \n     question of discrimination having been one of the \n     inspirations for your going to law school, and \n     doing extremely well, I might add, and being a very \n     distinguished lawyer. I am asking you what your thought \n     process is here. I am asking you what your thought process \n     is here. What is the difference between discrimination \n     against African Americans and gay people?\n       Mr. Tymkovich. Senator, I think that, you know, again, to \n     answer your question from a public policy standpoint, I \n     believe that this body, Congress, which has debated whether \n     or not to add sexual orientation to Title VII or to Federal \n     law, and certainly the debate at the State level would be to \n     take the testimony and the experiences of gay and lesbian \n     Americans and apply that to the particular circumstances at \n     work.\n       In Colorado, that's an important dialogue that is ongoing \n     about to what extent the laws ought to be modified and \n     changed to prevent discrimination and violence and harassment \n     against gay and lesbian people. I support that legislative \n     debate in our State. I don't think it's appropriate for me to \n     take a personal view to the Federal bench, and I can commit \n     to the body that I'd be able to apply the discrimination laws \n     faithfully and carefully as a Tenth Circuit judge----\n       Senator Feingold.--Well, Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but \n     let me just say that I certainly respect Mr. Tymkovich and \n     wish him well. But this process where we can't even get at \n     sort of the thought process of a nominee on something as \n     simple and important as how you relate discrimination against \n     African Americans to the issue of discrimination against gay \n     people, to me, Mr. Chairman, this is the problem we are \n     having, that we are really not being given a chance to \n     examine how these individuals will simply go through their \n     thought process as judges, not whether there is a right \n     answer or a wrong answer, but how will they go through the \n     judicial process and how will they go through that thought \n     process.\n       I think that is legitimate, and, again, I respect you and \n     certainly you have tried to respond to me. But it makes it \n     very, very difficult to analyze, especially in light of the \n     fact that this nominee wrote an article, an extensive article \n     about this very important subject, and all I am trying to do \n     is to get his thought process as it compared to another body \n     of law that he obviously thinks is valid.\n       So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I conclude and thank you and \n     thank Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this kind of evasive testimony only \nmakes it more difficult to analyze whether or not a nominee is well \nsuited for a position on a Federal appeals court.\n  I was also troubled by Mr. Tymkovich's insistence that the Romer case \npresented a political question and should not have been decided by the \ncourts.\n  The courts have played an important role in ensuring civil rights for \nall Americans. If our Nation left all questions of civil rights to the \nlegislatures, school segregation might still be practiced in parts of \nthe country today. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS, the \nSupreme Court did its job by injecting itself in a contentious \npolitical debate and protecting the right of African Americans to equal \neducation.\n  I understand that these are President Bush's nominees and that he has \nthe right to nominate whomever he wants to the bench. But as much as it \nis our duty to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary, it is also our \nduty to give great scrutiny to those nominees who have a record that \ncalls into question their ability to give all those litigants who would \nappear before them a fair and impartial hearing.\n  I am more than pleased to vote to confirm judicial nominees that are \nfair-minded and supported by a consensus of Senators and the legal \ncommunity, and, once again, I urge the President to send such nominees \nto the Senate. I have voted in favor of three previous Bush nominees to \nthe Tenth Circuit, but I do not believe that Mr. Tymkovich is the right \nperson for this seat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time under the \nquorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased that Timothy Tymkovich's \nnomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has come \nbefore the full Senate for consideration here today.\n  Almost 7 weeks ago today, on February 12, 2003, along with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Allard, I was pleased to introduce Tim Tymkovich \nto the Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing.\n  Today, I am once again pleased to be able to speak in strong support \nof Tim Tymkovich's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Tim Tymkovich is well qualified to serve on the Tenth Circuit. He is \na native Coloradan, an excellent jurist and an all-around outstanding \nperson. I believe he will be a terrific addition to the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Since he earned his juris doctor at the University of Colorado's \nSchool of Law back in 1982, Tim has had an outstanding career, \nincluding a well-balanced combination of service in both the public \nsector and in private practice.\n  Tim's public service experience includes his service as a clerk to \nthe former Colorado Supreme Court Chief Justice William Erickson from \n1982 to 1983.\n  From 1991 to 1996, Tim Tymkovich skillfully served as Colorado's \nsolicitor general.\n  In between these years of public service, Tim earned an excellent \nreputation in private practice with several leading law firms.\n  For the past 2 years, Tim has served as counsel to Colorado Governor \nOwen's Columbine Review Commission, which reviewed the public agency \nand law enforcement response to the tragic Columbine High School \nshootings of 1999.\n  At the same time, he co-chaired the Governor's Task Force on Civil \nJustice Reform, which has led to significant improvements in Colorado's \ncivil justice and practice.\n  Tim currently serves as a partner in the prestigious Denver-based law \nfirm, Hale, Hackstaff, & Tymkovich.\n  Two of Colorado's leading newspapers have positively endorsed Tim, \nsaying among other things, that he has gained a local reputation as a \nthoughtful, insightful attorney who knows the law and works hard to \nuphold it. That was the Denver Post, May, 2002.\n  They have also commented that if the Senate gave Tim Tymkovich a \nserious look, we would find someone who combines intellectual heft and \nsteady temperament.\n  I have taken a good look at Tim Tymkovich, and I fully agree with \nthese insightful assessments.\n  Tim's nomination enjoys substantial bipartisan support, including the \nsupport of Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar and Colorado's well-\nknown former Governor, Roy Romer.\n  Tim Tymkovich's nomination for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has \nbeen pending since he was first nominated for this position back on May \n25, 2001.\n  it is now approaching 2 years since he was first nominated. Despite \nTim Tymkovich's outstanding qualifications, it has not been an easy \ntask for the Judiciary Committee to get this nomination to the floor of \nthe Senate today.\n  I want to take a moment to say a special word of heartfelt \nappreciation for my good friend and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin \nHatch for his remarkably fair, evenhanded and steadfast stewardship of \njudicial nominees, including Tim Tymkovich's nomination. Senator Hatch \ndeserves all of our appreciation.\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\n  It is time for the full Senate to complete our work and hold a \nstraight up-or-down rollcall vote on Tim Tymkovich's worthy nomination.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Tim Tymkovich's \nnomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bunning are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we are on the nomination of \nTimothy Tymkovich to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. As he knows, \nbeing a member of the Judiciary Committee, while the debate time was \nscheduled by the committee, at the same time they scheduled hearings on \nvarious judicial nominees, including a very controversial nominee to \nanother circuit court. As have others, including the distinguished \nChair, I have tried to balance my time from place to place and attend \nto both matters ongoing simultaneously. I am sorry that I could not be \nhere to open the debate but was at the hearing helping to open those \nproceedings.\n  Today we consider Mr. Tymkovich as the fourth of President Bush's \nnominees to this circuit to be considered by the Senate. Three of the \nnominees to the Tenth Circuit were given hearings and confirmed during \nthe time I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  President Bush sent up Harris Hartz of New Mexico to the Tenth \nCircuit. I arranged to get him a hearing and vote on the floor. In \nfact, I voted for him. President Bush sent up Terrence O'Brien of \nWyoming. I arranged to get him a hearing and a vote on the floor. I \nvoted for him. President Bush sent up Michael McConnell of Utah, a \nhighly controversial, extraordinarily conservative nominee, heavily \nbacked by the Federalist Society and others. I arranged to get a \nhearing for him, and I voted for him.\n  I mention that because it is in stark contrast to the treatment of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to vacancies on the Tenth Circuit. We were \nfair and took action on three of President Bush's nominees to the Tenth \nCircuit last year. Today the Senate is debating and voting on his last \nremaining nominee to that circuit.\n  Let us recall what happened when Republicans were in charge and there \nwas a Democratic President. President Clinton nominated two outstanding \nlawyers to this vacancy, the one about which we talk today. James \nLyons, whom I have known it seems forever, is a brilliant lawyer. He \nwould have been an outstanding federal judge, one who in that position \nwould be totally impartial, would fit the qualifications necessary for \na judge--that is, when you walked in the court, you would know, whether \nyou are Republican or Democrat, rich, poor, plaintiff, defendant, \nblack, white or anything else, that you would be treated fairly. Mr. \nLyons was not treated fairly. He was not even allowed to have a hearing \nlet alone consideration by the Judiciary Committee or a vote by the \nSenate.\n  Then President Clinton nominated Christine Arguello, an outstanding \nHispanic woman. She was not allowed to have a hearing either. It was \nnot that she was not qualified. In fact, speaking of these two, Mr. \nLyons was among the many Clinton nominees given the highest \nqualification by the American Bar Association. Like so many others who \nfit in that category, he was never allowed even to have a hearing. It \nwas not a question of voting up or down. Republicans were in the \nmajority. They could have voted him down. But both these well qualified \nnominees were not even allowed to have a hearing.\n  Ms. Arguello is a talented Hispanic attorney. Her nomination had \nwidespread support from her community and State. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats called and wrote to me on her behalf. But as with so many \ncircuit court vacancies on the Tenth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, the \nFifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Ninth \nCircuit, the District of Columbia Circuit, and around the country, \nthese qualified nominees, whose only sin was that they were nominated \nby a Democratic President, were not allowed to have hearings or votes.\n  The Republican-controlled Senate made it very clear: We will not hold \nhearings or vote on them. Someday there will be a Republican President, \nand then we will fill these seats in a campaign to stack the courts.\n  This was very clear. This happened during President Clinton's first \nterm in the Senate--the Republican Senate blocking his nominations from \neven having a hearing because Republicans thought he would never get \nreelected and then they could put in Republicans to fill those judicial \nvacancies. It is very clear. Everybody here heard the comments in the \ncloakroom and in the Senators' dining room. Look at the record, in the \n1996 session, the Republican Senate majority would not consider or \nconfirm a single nominee to a circuit court anywhere in the country, \nnot one. During that entire year only 17 judges were confirmed and all \nwere to the district courts.\n  President Clinton then had a landslide reelection victory. We naively \nassumed that the Senate Republicans would work with us to help fill the \nmany judicial vacancies that had been perpetuated. Not so. They thought \nmaybe 4 years later they might have another chance and there might be a \nRepublican administration and they could get the courts to do what we \nwanted. Despite vacancies that reached over 100, Republicans denied \nthere was a vacancies crisis and insisted on slow and searching \ninquiries on those lucky nominees who were considered at all. Of \ncourse, more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were \nnever given a hearing and a vote. Others, the lucky ones, were delayed \nfor years and years before Senate Republicans would allow a vote.\n  Then in the most recent presidential election, as we know, Al Gore \ngot half a million more votes but did not become President. I respect \nthe electoral system. President Bush won the electoral vote, and there \nwas a 1-vote margin in the Supreme Court determining that. All of a \nsudden, all these seats that have been kept open year after year \nbecause Republicans would not allow anybody to come forward, were \nvaluable opportunities.\n  When Democrats were the Senate majority, we tried to help, to work \nwith the administration and with Senate Republicans. Take, the Tenth \nCircuit. Even though President Clinton's nominees had been unfairly \nheld up, we did not do the same thing to President Bush's nominees. We \nproceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial nominees in 17 months. We \nproceeded on three of his nominees to the Tenth Circuit and filled \nthree of the four vacancies on that circuit by adjournment last year.\n  With respect to this remaining nomination, that of Timothy Tymkovich, \nI\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nmust say--not just because of the shameful, inexcusable way James Lyons \nand Christine Arguello were treated by the Republicans--I have serious \nmisgivings about this nomination. Mr. Tymkovich has worked to undermine \nenvironmental protections and other Federal programs in the name of \nStates rights. He has a particular view of States rights, one that I \nbelieve will color his decision making and result in hostility to \nFederal legislation designed to protect all Americans' civil rights and \nall Americans' environmental rights.\n  In 1996, Mr. Tymkovich testified before the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee, where he made strident comments about his \nperceptions of States' rights. His testimony indicated that his support \nfor ``States' rights'' was conveniently focused on rolling back Federal \nregulation in areas where he had substantive disagreements with Federal \npolicy. He testified in favor of the so-called Tenth Amendment \nEnforcement Act, which called on Congress to eliminate implied \npreemption, a form of preemption that has been consistently recognized \nby the United States Supreme Court.\n  He claimed that the Federal Government had interfered in Colorado's \nState's rights. Mr. Tymkovich complained that the Federal Government \nhad been ``especially intrusive into State affairs in the area of the \nenvironment.'' He cited as examples of such interference and \n``overreaching'' the EPA's opposition to a State ``self-audit'' \nprogram. That State program would have granted enforcement immunity to \npolluters that voluntarily came forward and agreed to address problems \nin the future. Immunity would have applied no matter how damaging the \npolluters' actions had been. The State legislation was opposed by the \nEPA because it violated State obligations under several Federal \nstatutes--the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, among others. Mr. \nTymkovich chided the EPA for refusing to give the same immunity to \npolluters. In addition to his statements about the self-audit program, \nMr. Tymkovich protested the EPA's rejection of State programs in water \nand air quality programs that did not meet Federal standards.\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich also complained in his hearing testimony that the \nFederal Government violated States' rights by requiring Colorado to \nfollow Federal Medicaid law if the State chose to accept Federal \nMedicaid funding. He argued that States should be allowed to accept \nFederal Medicaid funding and then refuse to use those funds as \nprescribed by Federal law; that is, to deny the termination of \npregnancies in the limited situation where a Medicaid-qualified woman \nhas been the victim of rape or incest. He argued that States should be \nallowed to accept Federal Medicaid funding, but absolutely refuse to \nuse these funds--funds that come from all of us from the State of \nVermont, the State of Alabama, and every place else as prescribed by \nFederal law. He argued: We will use your money, but you have no say in \nhow we use it.\n  Finally, Mr. Tymkovich claimed that the Federal ``motor voter'' law \nwas an ``intrusion'' that ``impose[d] special burdens.'' He called the \nlaw an ``unfunded mandate'' that ``unquestionably interferes with the \nStates' internal affairs.'' In summary, he argued that ``Congress has \nlong ignored State interests.''\n  I am also concerned about Mr. Tymkovich's involvement in attempts to \nweaken Title IX. As State solicitor general, Mr. Tymkovich appealed a \ndecision by a Federal District Court finding that Colorado State \nUniversity had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. \nThe suit, Roberts v. Colorado State Board of Agriculture, was \noriginally brought by members of the women's fast-pitch softball team, \nwhich had been cut by the university. The plaintiffs argued that the \ntermination of support for the team was a violation of Title IX. The \nDistrict Court issued a permanent injunction that required the \nuniversity to reinstate funding for the program and to provide the team \nwith equal benefits to other sports programs at the college.\n  Mr. Tymkovich appealed the case to the Tenth Circuit, arguing that \nadditional evidentiary requirements should be placed upon Title IX \nplaintiffs. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling, \nfinding that the university had not shown that it had fully and \neffectively accommodated the interests and abilities of women athletes.\n  Title IX has been vital to the inclusion of women and girls in all \nfacets of education, especially athletics. You do not have to be a \nparent or grandparent to know that now, if you go into any schoolyard \nand you look at those playing sports at the grade school and high \nschool level, you see boys and girls playing. At the college level, you \nsee both young men and young women playing sports. This has been \nimportant to all of us.\n  I am also concerned about the personal hostility Mr. Tymkovich has \nshown to Americans based on their sexual orientation, and about his \nfailure to accept the importance of civil rights laws. As Colorado \nsolicitor general, he argued a case before the Colorado and U.S. \nSupreme Courts, in which he unsuccessfully defended Colorado's 1992 \nballot initiative that added a broadly-worded provision in the Colorado \nConstitution prohibiting any legal protections based upon sexual \norientation. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of the United States found \nthat the Colorado law was motivated by prejudice, not rationality, and \nthus ran afoul to the most basic premise of the equal protection \nclause.\n  So after he litigated the Romer case, and after a conservative \nSupreme Court ruled against him, he authored a bitter law review \narticle both defending his position and chastising the decisions of the \nSupreme Court of the United States and of the Supreme Court of \nColorado. He criticized Justice Kennedy's decision in Romer as ``an \nimportant case study of the Supreme Court's willingness to block a \ndisfavored political result--even to the point of ignoring or \ndisfiguring established precedent.'' He also referred to the U.S. \nSupreme Court's oral argument process as ``judicial histrionics.'' He \nconcluded by saying this was ``another example of ad hoc, activist \njurisprudence, without constitutional mooring.''\n  Mr. President, I say this because this is a man who claims he would \nbe perfectly willing to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. In \nfact, the most revealing aspect of his law review is his failure to \nacknowledge and respect the decision of the Supreme Court and the views \nand integrity of those on the other side of the argument from him.\n\n  I have voted for hundreds of judges nominated by both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents. My personal belief is that it is not whether \nthey are Democrats or Republicans, liberal or conservative, pro-life or \npro-choice, or whatever they might be; that is not the issue. The issue \nis whether, when somebody comes before that court, that they know that \nthey are going to be treated with fairness, treated with respect, with \ncourtesy, no matter which side they are on or what legal position they \nsupport in that litigation.\n  A Federal judge has an enormous amount of power. If somebody comes \ninto court and they know the case is already decided, that the judge \nhas already determined, based on who you are, how the case is going to \nbe decided, then I think you have a real problem that goes to the \nintegrity of the courts and certainly to the independence of the \ncourts, and it determines which way those courts are going to be seen.\n  Why is that important in Mr. Tymkovich's case? Because he shows what \ntype of a judicial temperament he would have. A most revealing aspect \nof his law review article is his failure to acknowledge and respect the \nviews or integrity of those on the other side of the legal debate. His \narticle made me ask myself why he felt compelled to continue to \nadvocate for the positions he was taking once the case had been \nconcluded, once the Supreme Court had determined what the law was.\n  He obviously feels very strongly personally about these matters. That \nis fine and that is his right. But that does not mean that he should be \nconfirmed to a lifetime appointment on a Federal circuit court. Had he \nmerely served as the attorney advocating a position in court, he could \nhave chalked his involvement in the Romer case up to professional \nadvocacy in support of a provision adopted in Colorado. Instead, he \nwent well beyond professional legal advocacy. His advocacy went to the \npoint of raising the question whether this\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nman will be able to be fair to all litigants. He wrote that ``our \nsociety prohibits, and all human societies have prohibited, certain \nactivity not because they harm others, but because they are considered, \nin the traditional phrase `contra bonos mores', i.e. immoral.''\n  In short, the article seems replete with heavy anti-homosexual \nrhetoric. The hallmark of a good judge is his or her ability to be fair \nto all who come before the court. I have very grave doubts that Mr. \nTymkovich can or will act in an unbiased or fair manner involving civil \nrights. His expressions seem otherwise.\n  Equally disturbing about this incident is Mr. Tymkovich's apparent \nunwillingness candidly to admit error either to the courts or the \nJudiciary Committee. You have to wonder if he would be fair and \nimpartial as a judge in a court.\n  In a case in which Mr. Tymkovich was involved in private practice, he \nrepresented the Republican and Libertarian parties, along with several \nState legislators, in their challenge to the constitutionality of \nColorado's Fair Campaign Act. In the course of his representation, \nwhich saw him before both the trial court and the Tenth Circuit, Mr. \nTymkovich erroneously agreed to consensual dismissal of one of his \nclient's claims before the district court. While each court differed \nabout the merits of the alleged claims, both agreed that Mr. Tymkovich \nvoluntarily dismissed a claim that (1) there was no other means of \nchallenging and (2) which he evidently still desired to litigate. In a \ncase of such high importance, and for a person being nominated to a \ncourt of such significance, his actions in this case appear to include \na rather serious mistake that reflects upon his competency.\n  Equally disturbing about this incident is Mr. Tymkovich's apparent \nunwillingness to candidly admit his error either to the courts or the \nJudiciary Committee. Mr. Tymkovich continued to argue the matter and \nassert that the District Court behaved improperly and without reason in \ndismissing his client's first amendment claim. So, too, did he fail to \nreveal his error in his Senate Questionnaire. Although he truthfully \nstated that he won some of the claims he pursued, his careful wording \non his Senate Questionnaire seems particularly crafted to avoid this \naspect of the case.\n  I note for those who have recently trumpeted the ABA ratings as an \nimportant indicator of professional competence--especially when a close \nfriend of President Bush is in charge of those ratings--Mr. Tymkovich \nreceived a rating that was partially ``not qualified,'' indicating that \na number of evaluators did not consider him suited to the position on \nthe Tenth Circuit in which he was nominated.\n  I am concerned that Mr. Tymkovich is yet another of President Bush's \nnominees to the circuit court who is going to work to undermine Federal \nlaws and programs designed to guarantee protection of civil rights and \nthe environment. I will vote against him.\n  I will vote against him because I do not believe that people can walk \ninto his court and believe they are going to be treated fairly. I fear \nthat people who come into his court and see that the person on the \nother side fits into the judge's narrow view of who is acceptable and \nwhat is acceptable will think that other person is going to win and I \nam going to lose no matter what the merits are.\n  This is the last remaining vacancy on the Tenth Circuit. We had 7 \nyears without a new judge of that circuit. Even though President \nClinton tried, Republicans refused to allow his nominees to go forward \nto be considered.\n  When I became chairman, we moved three judges who were nominated by \nPresident Bush through to confirmation. None of them were people I \nwould have ever nominated. I voted for all of them. I thought even \nthough we were opposed and apart philosophically that they could be \nfair. I did it notwithstanding my own deep concern about the \nunreasonable unfairness of the Republicans in not allowing a vote, not \neven a hearing, on President Clinton's nominees. I was determined not \nto do that to President Bush. I thought it was absolutely wrong when it \nwas done to President Clinton. So three of those four nominees went \nforward and they all sit on that court today as President Bush's \nlifetime appointments to the Tenth Circuit.\n  We have worked hard to reverse the growing number of vacancies on the \nFederal courts and on the circuit courts, vacancies that were \nmaintained under the Republican Senate majority when President Clinton \nwas in the White House. Even though President Clinton nominated \nqualified, moderate people, they were not allowed to have hearings. We \ntried to change that. Perhaps it is a case where no good deed goes \nunpunished. We tried to demonstrate to this new White House that we \ncould be different.\n  In January 1995, when the Republican majority took control of the \nconfirmation process, there were only 16 vacancies on the circuit \ncourts. When I became chairman in the summer of 2001, there were 33 \ncircuit court vacancies. At the end of last year, these vacancies had \nbeen cut by almost 25 percent, even though 9 new circuit vacancies \narose during that time.\n  We held the first hearing for a nominee to the Fourth Circuit in 3 \nyears, and confirmed him and another most controversial nominee, even \nthough seven of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit never \nreceived a hearing.\n  We proceeded with the first hearing for a nominee to the Fifth \nCircuit in 7 years and confirmed her, even though three of President \nClinton's nominees to that circuit were never given a hearing.\n  We proceeded with the first hearing on a nominee to the Sixth Circuit \nin almost 5 years, confirmed her, and another controversial nominee to \nthat circuit, even though three of President Clinton's nominees to that \ncircuit never received a hearing.\n  We proceeded with the first hearings on a nominee to the Tenth \nCircuit in 6 years. We confirmed three, even though two of President \nClinton's nominees to that circuit were never allowed hearings.\n  There is today no current vacancy on the First Circuit to which we \nconfirmed a conservative nominee last year. There are no current \nvacancies on the Eighth Circuit to which we confirmed 3 of President \nBush's nominees in spite of the irresponsible treatment the Republican \nSenate majority had afforded Bonnie Campbell of Iowa.\n\n  I have been in the Senate with six Presidents, President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, President \nClinton, and the current President Bush. On judicial nominees, each of \nthe five previous Presidents had their own views of who they wanted on \nthe courts, and that is their prerogative whom they nominate. Each one \nof those Presidents sought to unite rather than divide when it came to \nthe Federal judiciary. I think each understood that the integrity and \nindependence of the Federal courts has to be protected. Each one of \nthose five Presidents actually worked with Members of both parties in \nthe Senate for nominees to go forward. I remember sitting in many \nmeetings with Presidents of both parties.\n  This President is the first one in my experience in 29 years, who \nseems to have no interest whatsoever in working with the Senate. He \nseems perfectly happy with what was done in the past by members of his \nparty, and now with members of his party willing to change the rules--\nignore the rules and go forward and do things that have never been done \nbefore--so long as they win.\n  In the short run, you win. In the long run, you hurt badly the \nintegrity and the independence of the Federal court. That is one thing \nwe should think of. These are lifetime appointments. They are not the \nterms of Senators or Presidents. Presidents have 4-year terms. Senators \nhave 6-year terms. The Federal bench has a lifetime term.\n  Finally, even though his term is approximately halfway over, I urge \nthe President to try for a few months to be a uniter, not a divider and \nwork with the Senate on nominating judges. We showed we were willing to \nmove judges much faster for him when the Democrats were in control than \nthe Republicans did when they were in control and there was a \nDemocratic President.\n  Work with us. You are going to have better courts; all Americans will \nhave better courts. You can still appoint a lot of Republicans--that is \nfine. But you could have an independent court, not courts that are \ngoing to be seen by a growing--and it is growing--number\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\naround this country as an arm of the Republican Party. Professor \nSheldon Goldman was recently quoted in an article by Stephanie B. \nGoldberg in MS. Magazine as saying: ``If courts are perceived as being \ngoverned by political ideology, they lose public support and are no \nlonger seen as an independent branch of government. They're just an arm \nof the regime.'' Courts should not be an arm of the Democratic Party or \nthe Republican Party. It is one branch of Government that should be \nindependent. This White House seems to want to change that.\n  Over more than 200 years of history, Presidents occasionally have \nbeen unable to resist the temptation of court-packing schemes, such as \nin the case of John Adams or Franklin Roosevelt. Those were wisely \nrejected. If the White House is unwilling to have an independent \njudiciary, I hope the Senate will show enough courage to reject that.\n  Before observing the absence of a quorum I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TYMKOVICH, OF COLORADO, TO THE UNITED STATES \n             CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the order of business on the floor, if I \nam not mistaken, is the nomination of Mr. Timothy Tymkovich for \nlifetime appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nTenth Circuit. I rise in opposition to that nomination.\n  Initially, it is worth noting that the Tenth Circuit is closely \ndivided between Republican and Democratic appointees, and the seat for \nwhich Mr. Tymkovich was nominated is a seat that the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate has denied on more than one occasion. In fact, they \nhave denied it to a moderate Hispanic-American Clinton nominee in the \nyear 2000, Colorado Attorney General Christine Arguello. She would have \nbeen the first and only Hispanic-American judge on the Tenth Circuit, \nbut the Republicans, then in control of the Senate, refused to give Ms. \nArguello a hearing or a vote.\n  The Republican-controlled Senate also refused to give a hearing or \nvote to another Clinton nominee for the Tenth Circuit, James Lyons, \nthus ensuring that this vacancy which we debate today would be theirs \nto fill. That is what led us to this moment in time where this \nnomination is being considered on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  I asked Mr. Tymkovich some questions when he appeared before the \nJudiciary Committee, and I would like to relate to you some of his \nanswers. One of them relates to his membership in the Federalist \nSociety.\n  There is nothing illegal about the Federalist Society, nor any reason \nwhy someone would deny their membership, but it has become a strange \ncoincidence how many Bush administration nominees are members of the \nFederalist Society. I have said that when you chart the DNA of Bush \nadministration judicial nominees, you are likely to find, more often \nthan not, the Federalist Society chromosome.\n  So I started asking questions, and some of my colleagues are now \njoining me. Why? What is it about this organization that is becoming \nsuch an important element on a resume of someone seeking a judgeship in \nthe Bush administration?\n  I asked Mr. Tymkovich, who is not only a member of the Federalist \nSociety, but who is on its Colorado board of advisers, the following \nquestion:\n\n       One of the goals of the Federalist Society is ``reordering \n     priorities within the legal system to place a premium on \n     individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of \n     law.''\n\n  I went on to ask him:\n\n       Which priorities do you believe need to be reordered? What \n     is the role of federal judges and the courts in reordering \n     such priorities? On which traditional values should there be \n     a premium, and why? The Federalist Society also states that \n     its objective ``requires restoring the recognition of the \n     importance of these norms among lawyers, judges, and law \n     professors.''\n\n  I asked Mr. Tymkovich:\n\n       If you are confirmed, how will you as a judge restore, \n     recognize, or advance these norms?\n\n  I do not believe these were trick questions. I believe they were \nopen-ended questions so Mr. Tymkovich could tell us what it is about \nthe Federalist Society that he understands to be their mission, and \nwhether he agrees or disagrees.\n  Mr. Tymkovich's entire response is the following:\n\n       I am not aware of the context of the quotations in the \n     question, but all seem to address the role of a policy \n     commentator as contrasted with the role of a federal judge. \n     If confirmed as a judge to the Tenth Circuit, I would set \n     aside any personal views and apply the precedent of the \n     Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit.\n\n  The quotations in my question are straight from the ``Our Purpose'' \npage of the Federalist Society Web site. They constitute the mission \nstatement of the organization and are central to its identity.\n  Mr. Tymkovich's assertion that he is not aware of them raises \nimportant questions. His responses to this committee during the hearing \nindicate that he was, at times, evasive in other answers as well.\n  But there is one particular reason why I oppose Mr. Tymkovich, and it \nrelates to the issue of discrimination.\n  I have said on the floor of the Senate and in the Judiciary Committee \nthat several weeks ago I had a unique opportunity to visit the State of \nAlabama for the first time, to go there with Democratic and Republican \nMembers of Congress, on a delegation led by our Congressman from \nAtlanta, GA, John Lewis, to visit some of the most important spots in \nAmerica in the civil rights movement.\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\n  We went to Birmingham, AL, and visited the Baptist church where four \nlittle girls were killed with a firebomb on a Sunday morning.\n  I went to Selma, AL, with Congressman John Lewis, and stood at the \nspot where he was beaten by the Alabama State troopers and the militia, \nsuffering a concussion, at the time the march to Montgomery was turned \nback.\n  We went to Montgomery, AL, and stood on the street corner where Rosa \nParks boarded the bus and refused to give up her seat.\n  The importance of this cannot be overstated for a person in my \ngeneration because the civil rights movement was part of my formation \nas a young person. The civil rights movement was something I valued for \nwhat it brought to America. It was a struggle I witnessed as a young \nstudent and appreciated as I grew older.\n  Congressman John Lewis said to us, as we were visiting these \nimportant historic sites, something that was not part of the formal \nprogram. He said: There never would have been a civil rights movement \nin Alabama, there would not have been a march from Selma to Montgomery, \nwere it not for one Federal judge, Frank Johnson.\n  Frank Johnson, a Federal district court judge--Republican, appointed \nby President Eisenhower--had the courage to stand up to the \nestablishment in Alabama and other Federal courts and to fight against \ndiscrimination. He made important rulings, striking the Montgomery \nCounty ordinance which allowed for segregation on buses, striking laws \nwhich did not allow fair representation in the legislature of Alabama, \nand, of course, signing the order which allowed the march from Selma to \nMontgomery.\n  Because of his courage, he was shunned by leaders in society. He \ncould not go back to his old country club. He had to start using the \npublic golf courses. But there was worse. His mother's life was \nthreatened. Bombs were going to be detonated at his home and her home. \nSecurity was necessary around the clock. But he persevered. And because \nof his courage and his determination, the civil rights movement was a \nreality.\n  America is a better place because of one Federal district court judge \nwho, given a chance to stand up against prejudice and bigotry, did the \nright thing for America.\n  I thought to myself, as all of these judicial nominees come to the \nSenate, through the Judiciary Committee, where is the next Frank \nJohnson? Where is the next person who will stand up and fight for civil \nrights, the challenge of our generation?\n  I thought over that particularly when I considered the candidacy and \nthe nomination of Mr. Tymkovich for this circuit court judgeship. Mr. \nTymkovich already has had his chance to speak out on the issue of \ndiscrimination. Sadly--sadly--he came out on the wrong side. Mr. \nTymkovich appears to be hostile to laws prohibiting discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation. This isn't an easy issue for a lot of \nMembers of Congress. There are people who feel very strongly against \nthose with a different sexual orientation, gays and lesbians in \nAmerican society. I, for one, was raised in a conservative small town, \nEast Saint Louis, IL. I raised my family in another small town, \nSpringfield, IL. It was not until I got involved in congressional \npolitics that I stepped back and said: I have to take a look at this \nissue. I have to decide whether this is a civil rights issue and, if it \nis, which side of history I will be on.\n  I have tried, though my record is not perfect, to stand for the \nproposition that discrimination against any American based on race, \nreligion, national origin, gender, disability, age, or sexual \norientation is wrong. I think that is a standard that America--all of \nAmerica--should hold high. But, unfortunately, when it came to Mr. \nTymkovich, and discrimination against people because of sexual \norientation, he took an opposite course. He zealously supported \nColorado's amendment 2, which eliminated the legal rights for gays, \nlesbians, and bisexuals by banning all legislative, executive, or \njudicial action at any level of State or local government designed to \nprotect them. In other words, amendment 2 commanded that there be no \nrecourse for any gay person in Colorado who was fired or not hired, \ndenied housing, harassed in school, or subject to similar acts of \ndiscrimination.\n  When I took a look at the Supreme Court case where this amendment was \nchallenged, they listed some of the local ordinances that were at \nissue. They listed Colorado municipalities and what they were \nattempting to protect: Aspen, CO, had a local ordinance prohibiting \ndiscrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodation based \non sexual orientation; Boulder, CO, and Denver, CO the same thing; an \nexecutive order prohibiting employment discrimination for all State \nemployees classified and exempt on the basis of sexual orientation; the \nColorado insurance code, forbidding health insurance providers from \ndetermining insurability and premiums based on an applicant's or a \nbeneficiary's or an insured's sexual orientation; and other provisions \nprohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation at State \ncolleges.\n  These were the laws which amendment 2 in Colorado would have wiped \noff the books. Mr. Tymkovich came to the U.S. Supreme Court and argued \nthat these local ordinances should be wiped off the books, or at least \nthat amendment 2 should be allowed to stand.\n  The amendment was approved by a majority of Colorado voters, so the \nSupreme Court had to really face the basic issue as to whether \namendment 2 was an equal justice issue, and whether, in fact, the \nColorado voters could vote to take away the rights of individuals \nbecause of sexual orientation.\n  The Supreme Court decided by a vote of 6 to 3 that the position \nargued by Mr. Tymkovich was wrong. Only three of the most conservative \nJustices on the Supreme Court felt otherwise: Justices Scalia and \nThomas, and Chief Justice Rehnquist. They dissented, but six other \nSupreme Court Justices said the Colorado decision to pass amendment 2 \nviolated the equal protection of the laws in the United States and that \nMr. Tymkovich's position arguing in favor of it was wrong by a vote of \n6 to 3. The man before us today asking for a lifetime appointment to \nthe Tenth Circuit was found by the U.S. Supreme Court to be mistaken in \nhis position.\n  That is not the first time that has ever occurred. Lawyers argue \ncases, and sometimes they have no choice. They need to come before the \ncourt representing their clients. Whether it is a State, locality, \nbusiness or an individual, they come before the court and make the best \ncase, and the court rules. Sometimes they are on their side and \nsometimes they are opposed. In this case the Supreme Court ruled \nagainst Mr. Tymkovich.\n  What troubles me is what happened after that. After the Supreme Court \nissued its decision, Mr. Tymkovich decided to author a Law Review \narticle. It is a lengthy article in the 1997 University of Colorado Law \nReview. It is entitled ``A Tale of Three Theories: Reason and Prejudice \nin the Battle Over Amendment 2.''\n  Mr. Tymkovich and a couple other writers went on to explain why the \nSupreme Court was just plain wrong. Mr. Tymkovich wrote that the \nSupreme Court decision in Romer v. Evans is ``merely another example of \nad hoc activist jurisprudence without constitutional mooring. If the \ntest of an independent judiciary lies in its response to difficult \npolitical decisions, Romer is cause for great uneasiness about the \nhealth of self-government.''\n  There is a paragraph in this article which I find particularly \noffensive. Mr. Tymkovich, in describing the lifestyle of those with \ndifferent sexual orientations, likens them to people who practice \nbestiality. Those are not my words. They are the words written by \nTimothy M. Tymkovich who now seeks a lifetime appointment to the second \nhighest court in the nation.\n  Mr. Tymkovich decided in this article to establish what he considers \nto be a moral rationale for discrimination. It is not the first time \nthat has happened. If you will look back in our history, there has \nscarcely been a time when discrimination was practiced in America that \nsomeone didn't rationalize it or moralize it. Whether the objects of \nthat discrimination were Native Americans, African Americans, Asians, \nCatholics, the Irish, they have used some sort of moral rationale to \nsay that a position of discrimination is actually the moral thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich took exactly that position when it came to \ndiscrimination against people based on sexual orientation.\n  That position goes way beyond the norm in America. Mr. Tymkovich \ntries to argue in his article that this is all about States' rights. I \nunderstand there is an important balance between Federal power and \nState power. The Constitution acknowledges that. But, historically, \nthose who want to support discrimination have usually found their \nrefuge in the dark shadows of States' rights. The Federal Government \nshould not step in, they argue, to establish constitutional principles \nof equal justice under the law. They argue: let the States establish \nthose standards, knowing full well that you won't have a uniform \nstandard across the country. You will not have uniform protection under \nthe law.\n  The Supreme Court, in the case of Romer v. Evans, saw it differently. \nThank goodness they did. ``One century ago,'' Justice Kennedy wrote, \n``the first Justice Harlan admonished this Court that the Constitution \nneither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.''\n  They went on to say, during the course of this opinion:\n\n       ``If a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets \n     a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative \n     classification so long as it bears a rational relation to \n     some legitimate end.''\n\n  They said Mr. Tymkovich's logic and argument in Romer v. Evans were a \nbasic denial of equal protection under the law. Now Mr. Tymkovich wants \nan opportunity to go to the second highest court in the land and argue \nhis point of view for a lifetime. I am sorry. That is a bad choice. It \nis a bad choice for the Tenth Circuit and a bad choice for America.\n  Throughout my service in Congress, I have tried to support every \neffort to end discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic origin, \nreligious belief, age, disability, or sexual orientation. Fair and \nequal treatment of all Americans is a cornerstone of our society and \nour political system. Unfortunately, despite the great progress we have \nmade, the struggle for civil rights and equal treatment under the law \ncontinues today.\n  Federal judges, such as Frank Johnson, stood up 40 years ago under \nrisk of personal harm and risk to their families and said: I will stand \nup for equal protection under the law--when it came to African \nAmericans. I am sorry to say that based on his arguments and his own \nwords, I cannot believe that Mr. Tymkovich could ever rise to that \nchallenge.\n  If we want to turn our backs and ignore the reality of people who \nhave polished their prejudices to a high sheen with legal niceties, we \nare ignoring a basic responsibility of the Senate of the United States. \nIf we tolerate intolerance, that is a form of intolerance. The \nintolerance of Mr. Tymkovich, as evidenced in this Law Review article, \nfrom which he has not backed away, is something we should not sustain, \nshould not encourage, and should not approve with our vote. If Mr. \nTymkovich has his way, the struggle for civil rights and equal \ntreatment under the law will be even greater and more difficult for \nfuture generations. That is why I will vote to oppose his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would have to say that Tim Tymkovich's \nnomination is far from a partisan process. In fact, he has been \nsupported in a bipartisan way. I have a list of people who have \nsupported him. I would like to share some of the comments, letters, and \nstatements made in support of Mr. Tymkovich's nomination.\n  He is widely respected in Colorado as a fair attorney who works well \nwith others regardless of political philosophy. Just listen to the \nnames of these supporters and you will quickly recognize that there is \ntremendous and broad support for his nomination from people who have \nworked with him on a daily basis, his peers; for example, Roy Romer, \nformer Democratic Governor of Colorado, with whom Mr. Tymkovich had to \nwork on a fairly regular basis since he was Solicitor General.\n  Let's look at what the Governor of the State of Colorado said about \nTim Tymkovich:\n\n       Mr. Tymkovich served the State of Colorado from 1991 \n     through 1996 during the latter part of my tenure as governor \n     of the State of Colorado. He served with distinction and was \n     a strong advocate in legal matters for Colorado. He also \n     demonstrated a capacity to work closely with Colorado \n     Democrats as well as Republicans as Solicitor General . . . \n     He was always a straight shooter in giving legal advice to me \n     and my top staff.\n\n  We are all involved in politics. Sometimes in the political process \nthere is a disconnect from what politicians may say and what they may \ndo. Timothy Tymkovich is not a politician. He a dedicated public \nservant. People like the former Governor of Colorado, the former head \nof the National Democratic Party, recognize his commitment to doing the \nright thing.\n  I cannot believe, if he carried on with some of the arguments that \nhave been made by the opposition, that we would have support from \nindividuals such as the former head of the national Democrat party.\n  The following are supporters of Tim Tymkovich:\n  Michael Huttner, partner in Foster, Graham, and Huttner, a law firm \nin Denver; William H. Erickson, former Chief Justice on the Colorado \nSupreme Court; John M. Hereford, executive director of Great Outdoors; \nWilliam H. Hanson, a Colorado attorney; Robert F. Nagel, a resident of \nBoulder, Colorado, a professor of law at the University of Colorado \nSchool of Law; the Rocky Mountain News; the Denver Post; Jean Dubofsky, \nColorado Supreme Court Justice. On amendment 2, she took the opposite \npoint of view in arguing the case between the Supreme Court. Mr. \nTymkovich, as solicitor general for the State of Colorado, had an \nobligation, regardless of his personal feelings, to argue on behalf of \nthe people of Colorado. Jean Dubofsky, arguing on the opposite side \nbefore the Supreme Court, argued against the amendment. She has written \na letter in support of his confirmation. She was his opposition on \narguing on amendment 2, which my colleague from Illinois just mentioned \nin his remarks; she argued against Mr. Tymkovich in the position of the \npeople of Colorado, as far as amendment 2. She said she had to respect \nhim because he was such an eloquent advocate for the people of \nColorado, he was intellectual, he made great intellectual arguments, \nand he is recognized throughout the legal profession in Colorado as \nsomebody who is objective, straightforward and, above all, respects the \nlaw, respects the rule of law.\n  I want to just note that, again, Jean Dubofsky, an ``unabashed \nliberal,'' according to the Denver Post, supports Tim Tymkovich in the \nstrongest terms. Not only was Dubofsky a justice on the Colorado \nSupreme Court, but she argued against Tim Tymkovich on amendment No. 2; \nshe was opposing counsel. Tim Tymkovich now has the endorsement of not \nonly her but five other former supreme court justices for Colorado. He \nis well recognized for his legal efforts in trying to enforce the law.\n  I think in the committee hearing Tim Tymkovich answered the questions \nthat were put forth, and he answered them in a straightforward manner. \nHere are a couple of key statements he made in committee I think we \nneed to keep in mind on the floor of the Senate. I quote what he said \nin committee:\n\n       I believe an appellate judge has to set aside his or her \n     personal views and faithfully apply applicable Supreme Court \n     precedent.\n\n  In other words, he sets aside his own personal views to enforce and \nto properly interpret the law. What more can you ask? We have three \nbranches of Government: executive, legislative, and judicial. Our \nforefathers had in mind the legislative branch where we make the laws. \nWe have the executive branch, which administers the laws passed by the \nCongress, and we have the judicial branch, which is set up to interpret \nthe law and to apply the law.\n  In response to other questions before the committee, this is what he \nsaid about amendment No. 2, and what he said about the article referred \nto in my colleague's comments earlier in the debate, where Mr. \nTymkovich referred to the article written on amendment No. 2:\n\n       The article itself describes the public policy arguments \n     that were presented to the voters during the initiative's \n     political campaign, not my own.\n\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\n\n  As solicitor general of the State of Colorado, he was invited by the \nJournal to write the article, and he complied to write that article, \nstating in a factual way the arguments both pro and con for amendment \nNo. 2 in the State of Colorado.\n\n  My colleague from Illinois also talked about the previous nomination, \nand he implied that somehow or other, with the Christine Arguello \nnomination by President Clinton, there was a political process. Again, \nI state in the strongest terms that that simply is not true. Carlos \nLucero, a Hispanic from Colorado, is the first to serve as a Hispanic \non the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I supported him at the time. \nChristine Arguello's name came up for district court. I am the one who \nnominated her to be on the District Court of Colorado. It wasn't a \nnomination, but I sent a recommendation to the President of the United \nStates. She was never nominated by the President. Then at the last \nminute, her name was put forward--right at about the time we were ready \nto adjourn the Senate--for a position on the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Frankly, the Senate didn't have time to act on a last-minute \nnomination put forward by the President.\n  Many of us have worked hard to make sure that Hispanics have an \nopportunity to serve on our courts. I think it is important that we \ncontinue to push for that. So let me make it clear. I am the Senator \nwho nominated Christine Arguello. I was working with the White House \nand the Clinton administration to get Mrs. Arguello nominated in the \nfirst place. As we have witnessed many times, the politics of August \nnominations are often nothing more than political gestures aimed at \ngrabbing headlines but have no chance of completing the confirmation \nprocess simply because the nomination came too late in the process.\n  Again, I emphasize, I nominated Christine Arguello. This is the plain \nand simple truth and we need to recognize that.\n  Mr. Tymkovich is further recognized for his work by Joseph Quinn, \nColorado Supreme Court Justice; Gregory Scott, Colorado Supreme Court \nJustice; Luis Rovira, Colorado Supreme Court Justice; the Colorado \nDepartment of Public Safety, Suzanne Mencer, and Nancy Lewis of the \nColorado Organization of Victims' Assistance; Barbara O'Brien, \nPresident of the Colorado Children's Campaign; Rebecca Coppes Conway, a \nColorado attorney. They have all listed their names as supporters.\n  You have already heard statements and letters from Governor Romer, \nthe justices, and the newspapers. Here is what the rest of them had to \nsay about Mr. Tymkovich. Suzanne Mencer and Nancy Lewis of the Colorado \nDepartment of Public Safety and the Colorado Organization for Victim's \nAssistance wrote a letter to Chairman Hatch, and I quote:\n\n       We have each known Mr. Tymkovich for a considerable period \n     of time and believe that his sensitivity to the rights of \n     crime victims, as well as his great legal skills, will serve \n     our citizenry well. As Solicitor General, Mr. Tymkovich was \n     instrumental in the creation of the first appellate victim \n     services unit within the office of the Attorney General. Mr. \n     Tymkovich's legal expertise was also significant in the \n     determination of the proper course of action for passage of \n     the Colorado Constitutional Victim Rights Amendment.\n  The letter went on to describe his superb legal skills and well-\nrecognized victims expertise, and concluded:\n\n       His performance has shown not only an understanding of \n     legal issues surrounding crime victimization but also a very \n     great sensitivity to the attendant human cost.\n\n  I can go on and talk about the number of people who respect the \nexpertise and the capabilities of Mr. Tymkovich, but the fact is that \nhe has bipartisan support and the Senate should go ahead and confirm \nhim without any further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 3:45 be equally divided \nin the usual form for the consideration of the pending nomination, and \nthat at 3:45 today the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of \nthe nomination with no further intervening action or debate. I \nunderstand both leaders have agreed to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided \nduring the quorum call between advocates and opponents of the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the confirmation of \nthis nominee. I do so because his stated views on important judicial \nmatters are not only wrong but also wrong minded, wrong about the \nparticulars of the decisions which he opposes, wrong minded about the \nproper role and responsibilities of the judiciary under our \nConstitution.\n  The nominee has stated: Our society prohibits, and all human \nsocieties have prohibited, certain activities not because they harm \nothers but because they are considered immoral.\n  In this category, the nominee includes sadomasochism, cock fighting, \nbestiality, sodomy, and homosexuality. The nominee made those comments \nin an article he wrote for the University of Colorado Law Review. He \nwas expressing his pique at a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, with \nsix Judges in the majority, which overturned a Colorado ballot \ninitiative prohibiting any legal protections based upon sexual \norientation. As Colorado Solicitor General, he had unsuccessfully \ndefended that initiative before the U.S. Supreme Court. By his own \nwords, in that law review article, the nominee demonstrated why the \nmajority of the U.S. Supreme Court was right in its understanding and \napplication of the U.S. Constitution and the role of the judiciary in \nour society and the nominee is wrong.\n  The nominee's personal opinion presumably is that homosexuality is \nimmoral. He is entitled to his own opinions. He is not entitled, \nhowever, to make his personal opinions the moral code of American \nsociety and then to make judicial decisions based upon them. Our \ncountry is based upon a foundation of laws which are, in turn, based \nupon the U.S. Constitution. It is not a society run on the personal \nprejudices imposed by those who are in power upon the rest of the \ncitizenry.\n\n  The judiciary is the ultimate protector of individuals whom some \ncultural gestapos would otherwise ostracize, demonize, and criminalize. \nIn the extreme, where countries have their laws made that are enforced \nby the self-proclaimed guardians of the public more or less, which \nalways quite conveniently match entirely with their own personal \nbeliefs, democracy is always and inevitably sacrificed on the altar of \nprejudice and intolerance, masquerading as higher ideals. A democracy \nmust be able to permit people's differences, especially in their \npersonal lives. We are not required to like someone else's actions. We \nare not required to agree with their particular views. But we do have \nto understand and accept their rights to their personal differences \nfrom us and our society's tolerances of those differences as being the \nessence and the test of a democracy.\n  Any totalitarian government--communist, fascist, Saddam Husseinist--\ntolerates the behavior and beliefs which conform to their own personal \nviews, but those whose words, beliefs, or actions are different from \ntheirs are not tolerated and not permitted. They are dehumanized, \nincarcerated, and even executed because they or their views or their \nactions are different from those who hold the power.\n  For those of us in a democracy, this is one of the most difficult \nprinciples to really understand, and even more difficult for us to put \ninto practice, but that is why we have the judiciary. That is why these \nare lifetime appointments to the U.S. Federal courts: so that the men \nand women the President nominates and we confirm can make unpopular \ndecisions, take positions that would get elected officials probably \nunelected because they do not follow the laws that are derived from the \nU.S. Constitution. The more unpopular those rights are, the more \ncrucial it is for the judiciary to uphold them.\n  Unfortunately, this nominee would rather pander to his ideological \npals\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\nand perhaps to popular opinion than respect the greater wisdom of the \njudiciary and the U.S. Supreme Court which he now wishes to join at a \nlower level. If he does not respect their wisdom and their courage now, \nit is extremely unlikely that he will acquire either of those qualities \nwhen he dons judicial robes. It is a reason again why the penchant of \nthis administration to nominate to high judgeships people who have \nnever before been a judge, as this nominee has not, assures a lack of \nunderstanding of the responsibilities and the role, a shallowness, an \nignorance and, if they are confirmed, the likely regular abuses based \non those misunderstandings and those biases.\n  I also disagree with the nominee and his characterization that gay \nmen and lesbian women are seeking special rights when, in fact, anyone \nwho views these matters with any understanding of reality, whether he \nor she disagrees or agrees with those practices, cannot possibly \nbelieve they are not subject to regular and sometimes brutal violations \nof legal rights, civil rights, and human rights. To twist and distort \nthat need for the protections which the United States court system has, \nto afford to those who are oppressed and discriminated against and who \nare the victims of prejudices of those who are not willing to relent, \nby either greater wisdom in the spirit of our democracy or often the \nbiblical junctions which they purport to represent, if the courts will \nnot stand with those individuals to protect them, then there is no \nrecourse and there is no protection.\n\n  With this nominee, sadly, there is an unwillingness to even admit the \nreality of circumstances, much less to evidence any understanding of \nhis responsibilities as a judge to uphold this Constitution and what it \nmeans for all citizens: The right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Remember the admonition: Inasmuch as you have done so to these the \nleast of my brothers, you have done so unto me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 24 minutes, and \nthe minority has 14 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reiterate what five former Colorado \nSupreme Court justices say about Mr. Tymkovich in their letter of \nrecommendation to Chairman Orrin Hatch on the Judiciary Committee in \nthe Senate. These are individuals who know Mr. Tymkovich. He practiced \nbefore them. He worked with them because he was solicitor general for \nthe State of Colorado.\n  Based on our professional experiences, we are of the unanimous \njudgment that he is well qualified and most able to serve as an \nappellate judge of the United States court of appeals.\n  Mr. President, we need to recognize that this letter comes from \nformer Colorado Supreme Court justices with varied political \nbackgrounds. They all differ on professional experiences. They all had \ndiverse legal careers. They had different racial, gender and ethnic \nbackgrounds. But they came up with a unanimous opinion that Mr. \nTymkovich should be confirmed by the entire Senate. That speaks loads. \nHis peers, working with him on a daily basis, understand his \ncapabilities.\n  Mr. President, we have heard both sides present arguments, discuss \nthe nominee, as well as the mechanics of our constitutional judicial \nnomination process. Now it is time to finish the job and to move to an \nup or down vote on his nomination. I believe Mr. Tymkovich to be a very \nwell-qualified attorney, an attorney who will maintain high principles \nand a strong dedication to the law. He has the overwhelming support of \nthe Colorado legal community. His support comes from professionals and \nclients with varied political backgrounds and differing professional \nand real-life experiences. His support comes from people with diverse \nlegal careers and job history, and different race, gender and ethnic \nbackgrounds. He is unanimously supported by five former justices of the \nColorado Supreme Court, including Jean Dubojsky, an attorney who served \nas opposing counsel to one of our Nation's most high profile \nconstitutional cases.\n  Dubofsky and fellow justices consider Tymkovich to possess the \nnecessary attributes of a Federal judge, and that Colorado and the \nNation should no longer be subjected to undue delay on his nomination. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Mr. Tim \nTymkovich. His confirmation would fill a vacancy on the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals that has sat vacant for 4 years.\n  In my opening statement, I concluded by stating that a necessary \ncomponent of providing justice and protecting liberty and freedom is an \nefficient and properly equipped court. A court that has the personal \nand judicial resources that enable it to fulfill its constitutional \nobligations. Tim Tymkovich is highly qualified, and will serve the \njudiciary in the best tradition of our Nation's most respected courts.\n  Before I conclude, before we move to a final vote, I would like to \nleave you with a final thought, an important statement made by five \njustices of the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\n     ``. . . [W]e speak as one voice, resolute in our belief that \n     the people are entitled to and that Mr. Tymkovich is most \n     deserving of consideration . . . Mr. Tymkovich's experience, \n     practice, public service, temperament and skills will serve \n     the people of the United States well.\n\n  Their unqualified support tells us a great deal about Tymkovich's \ncredentials and his suitability to the Federal bench. This statement \ndeserves our attention and our respect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nominee, and to vote for the \nconfirmation of Tim Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit of the United States \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business, with the time allotted against the time \nfor the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sununu pertaining to the submission of the \nresolution are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted \nResolutions.'')\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on Senator Leahy's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the nomination of Timothy \nTymkovich\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nto the Tenth Circuit because I do not believe he has met his burden of \nshowing that he has the qualifications, fairness, and commitment to \ncore constitutional values required of an appellate court judge. The \npositions that Mr. Tymkovich has taken raise serious questions about \nhis ability to be open-minded in cases involving gay rights and \nprivacy, reproductive choice, and the power of the Federal Government \nwith regard to the States.\n  As State Solicitor General, Mr. Tymkovich defended Colorado's antigay \nballot initiative, Amendment 2, which was struck down by the Supreme \nCourt in Romer v. Evans for violating the equal protection clause. The \nRomer decision vindicated the ability of gays and lesbians to employ \nthe political process to secure antidiscrimination protections, in the \nsame manner as other American citizens. Justice Kennedy, the author of \nthe Romer decision, perhaps put it best when he said ``it is not within \nour constitutional tradition to enact laws like Amendment 2. . . . \nCentral to both the idea of the rule of law and to our own \nConstitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that \ngovernment and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all \nwho seek its assistance.''\n  As State solicitor, Mr. Tymkovich had a duty to defend Amendment 2, \nbut I am concerned about the content and the tenor of the comments made \nby Mr. Tymkovich in a law review article he wrote after the Court \ndecided Romer in which he harshly criticized the Court's reasoning and \nits decision. Not simply content to disagree with the Romer decision, \nMr. Tymkovich berates the Romer Court for its ``ad hoc, activist \njurisprudence'' and its ``willingness to block a disfavored political \nresult.'' Mr. Tymkovich defends the antigay ordinance as the exercise \nof freedom against immoral behavior. Employing language that is a \nfrightening parallel to that used by advocates against Federal laws \nprohibiting racial discrimination in the 1960s, Mr. Tymkovich suggests \nthat prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is \nan improper infringement on an individual's liberty interest.\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich's statements lead one to question whether he will \nunderstand the vital role that the equal protection clause and \nantidiscrimination legislation plays in protecting minorities against \npopularly-enacted laws. According to Mr. Tymkovich, ``it is always \nlegitimate public policy for voters or legislatures to repeal \ndisfavored laws. No law, including civil rights legislation can be seen \nas a one-way street. In the end, this important point was lost on the \nU.S. Supreme Court.'' The harsh tone of the criticism raises concerns \nabout how Tymkovich will approach the civil rights cases that come \nbefore him, and raises questions about his judgment and temperament.\n  At his hearing and in answers to written questions, Mr. Tymkovich did \nstate that he would follow Romer, and that he would be fair in \nantidiscrimination cases involving sexual orientation and other \nmatters. But it is difficult to reconcile the assertion she made at his \nhearing with the strong statements in his article.\n  As solicitor general, Mr. Tymkovich unsuccessfully defended \nColorado's decision to cut off, in violation of Federal law, State \nMedicaid funding for abortions for poor women who had become pregnant \ndue to rape or incest. Again here, Mr. Tymkovich can argue that he was \nsimply doing his job. However, in testimony before Congress in 1996, \nMr. Tymkovich criticized the Medicaid requirements as an unwarranted \nintrusion into a matter of state concern. In that same testimony, Mr. \nTymkovich also criticized the Federal ``Motor Voter'' law as intrusive \nbecause it poses ``special burdens'' on States; criticized the EPA's \ndecision to prosecute polluters who violated Federal environmental law \nstandards as infringing on state prerogatives, and argued against the \ndoctrine of implied preemption. This testimony, in his capacity as one \nof the top legal advisors to the State Attorney General, leads me to \nquestion whether Tymkovich would have the proper respect for \ncongressional authority to pass laws that impact States.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Tymkovich received a partial rating of ``not-qualified'' \nfrom the American Bar Association. While such a rating is not \nautomatically disqualifying, when combined with my other questions \nabout Mr. Tymkovich, it leads me to conclude that I cannot support his \nnomination.\n  Our Federal courts and the American people deserve judges of the \nhighest caliber: judges who are fair, open, and impartial, who are \nhighly qualified, who possess unimpeachable integrity, and who are \ncommitted to core constitutional values. The nominee has the burden to \nshow the Senate that he or she meets that standard and is worthy of \nconfirmation. Unfortunately, Mr. Tymkovich has failed to do so.\n  I am concerned about what seems like the right-wing ideological bent \nof the nominees that the administration continues to send forward. I \nurge this administration to work with the Senate, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to nominate moderate judges who are qualified, fair, and \nhave bipartisan support. This can be easily done. But the \nadministration continues to insist on its unilateral right to pack the \ncourts with judges hostile to civil rights and to the enforcement of \nimportant Federal laws with profound impacts on the lives of Americans.\n  The central values of our society--whether our society will continue \nto be committed to equally, freedom of expression, and the right to \nprivacy--are at issue with each of these nominations. The Constitution \ndoes not contemplate a Senate that acts as a rubber stamp. A genuine \nadvice and consent role is essential. If the administration continues \nto nominate judges who would weaken the core values of our country and \nroll back the civil rights laws that have made our country a more \ninclusive democracy, the Senate should reject them. I urge the Senate \nto reject his nomination.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination \nof Timothy Tymkovich to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit. Having reviewed his record and his testimony at his \nconfirmation hearing, I am left with only one conclusion--he does not \nwarrant confirmation to an appellate judgeship.\n  It is not merely the extreme, highly ideological positions he has \ntaken on a variety of important legal questions that compels me to \noppose his confirmation. But his record is replete with these positions \non issues from environmental protection to a woman's right to choose. \nHe has consistently advocated an extreme reading of ``States rights'' \nthat would eviscerate the ability of the Federal Government to protect \nAmericans from a variety of dangers. He believes that Federal clean air \nand water regulations, Federal funding for abortions for victims of \nrape and incest, and even ``motor voter'' provisions designed to make \nit easier for citizens to exercise their fundamental right to vote all \nunconstitutionally interfere with State sovereignty and autonomy.\n  But what most disturbs me concerning Mr. Tymkovich--and, in my view, \nplainly disqualifies him for a Federal appellate judgeship--is the \nanimus he has shown towards one group of Americans. He has argued that \nit is appropriate for the State to forbid localities from passing laws \nforbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. And his \nadvocacy of this position was not limited to representing his client, \nthe State of Colorado, in the courts. After the Supreme Court rejected \nthese arguments, and held such laws were contrary to basic principles \nof equal protection, he published a law review article defending his \nposition. In this article, he stated that it was permissible for the \nState to deny protection from discrimination to gays just as it would \nbe permissible for the State to forbid certain immoral activity such as \n``sadomasochism, cockfighting, bestiality, suicide, drug use, \nprostitution and sodomy.'' Such ugly arguments reflect an intolerance \nand hostility to equal rights that have no place in our Federal courts.\n  Anyone who reviews my record on judicial nominations knows that I do \nnot lightly oppose Federal judicial nominees. But this nominee's \nextreme positions and opposition to equal rights for all Americans--\nregardless of their sexual orientation--leave me no choice.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that the full Senate is \nconsidering the nomination of Timothy Tymkovich to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n  Timothy Tymkovich, a graduate of Colorado College and the University \nof\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nColorado School of Law, has worked as a partner in private practice \nsince 1996 with the firm of Hale Hackstaff Tymkovich, representing \nclients in matters involving State licensing and regulatory issues. He \nhas also acquired some expertise in State and Federal election issues, \nand he has represented a variety of political parties and candidates. \nSince 1997 he has represented Great Outdoors Colorado, a highly \nsuccessful State program which devotes lottery monies to fund wildlife \nand land conservation efforts and State recreation programs.\n  Mr. Tymkovich has been a great public servant for the State of \nColorado, serving from 1991 to 1996 as the State Solicitor General, \nwhere he acted as the chief appellate lawyer for the citizens of \nColorado. In that capacity he ably represented the State in State and \nFederal courts, including the Colorado Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. He provided legal \nassistance to the Colorado General Assembly and acted as a liaison to \nColorado's congressional delegation. He acted as the Attorney General's \ndelegate to Colorado's judicial selection process. He also worked to \nreform State criminal, consumer protection and antitrust laws.\n  When he left the office of Solicitor General, the Denver \nPost editorialized, ``In an age in which lawyers and government workers \nare often held in low esteem, Tymkovich, a member of both groups, has \nstood in stark contrast to both stereotypes.'' The Post added, \n``Tymkovich has set a high standard of service.''\n\n  Mr. Tymkovich is well respected by his peers for his professionalism \nand commitment to the field of law. He is a member of the prestigious \nAmerican Law Institute, which selects members on the basis of \nprofessional achievement and demonstrated interest in the improvement \nof the law; the International Society of Barristers, an honor society \nmade up of 650 trial attorneys in the United States and elsewhere; the \nAmerican Bar Foundation, which is the research arm of the American Bar \nAssociation; and the Colorado Bar Foundation. He currently serves as \nChair of the Colorado State Board of Ethics, which acts to advise the \nColorado governor and executive branch on ethics issues.\n  From 1999 to 2001 he served as counsel to the Columbine Review \nCommission, which was responsible for reviewing all aspects of the 1999 \nshootings at Columbine High and making recommendations to the Governor \nregrading ways to respond to, and even prevent, future assaults of the \nsame type. From 1998 to 2000 he served as Chair to the Colorado \nGovernor's Task Force on Civil Justice Reform, which issued findings on \nthe status of civil justice in Colorado and offered recommendations for \nimprovements.\n  Mr. Tymkovich's nomination has drawn powerful support from all \ncorners. He enjoys the unqualified endorsements of Colorado Senators \nCampbell and Allard; a number of former Colorado Supreme Court \njustices, including Justices Erickson, Dubofsky, Neighbors, Rovira, \nQuinn, and Scott; Colorado Governor Bill Owens; the Colorado Attorney \nGeneral, Ken Salazar; and Colorado's major newspapers, the Denver Post \nand the Rocky Mountain News. Significantly Mr. Tymkovich is also \nsupported by former three-term Colorado Governor Roy Romer, who has \nserved as the national vice chair of the Democratic Leadership Council, \nnational co-chairman of the Clinton-Gore `96 campaign, co-chairman of \nthe Democratic National Platform Committee in 1992, and chair of the \nDemocratic Governors' Association in 1991.\n\n  I firmly believe Mr. Tymkovich will make a great member of the Tenth \nCircuit. I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm this highly \nqualified nominee.\n  Unfortunately there seems to be confusion about Mr. Tymkovich's \nrecord on several fronts.\n  First, some have confused Mr. Tymkovich's advocacy with his personal \nviews. As an advocate for Colorado, Mr. Tymkovich had a duty to defend \nthe laws of Colorado, including Amendment 2. It is entirely unfair and \nerroneous to state that Mr. Tymkovich has provided his personal views \nor opinions on these issues. He has not.\n  Second, it has been said that Mr. Tymkovich compared Amendment 2 to \nprohibitions on cockfighting and other activities. He has not. As he \npointed out to Senator Leahy on February 26, he was quoting a Supreme \nCourt opinion for the simple proposition that there is Supreme Court \nprecedent for a moral component as a rational motivation for an \nelectorate. This wasn't Mr. Tymkovich's personal opinion, it was what \nthe Supreme Court has said on this issue. Mr. Tymkovich made this point \nclear a month ago.\n  I raise these points because some seem to be attempting to reshape \nMr. Tymkovich's record on the floor into a form I do not recognize. \nThis man has a distinguished legal career. He is supported by Democrats \nand Republicans alike. He has served as a successful litigator and he \nwas an excellent Solicitor General for Colorado. Those who know him \nsupport him and know he will be a terrific judge.\n\n\n                           ``special'' rights\n\n  I would like to respond to the allegation that Mr. Tymkovich views \nprotection for gays and lesbians as providing ``special treatment'' for \nthem.\n  First of all, Mr. Tymkovich's use of the term `'special treatment'' \nmirrored the terminology used by participants in the political debate \nover Amendment 2's passage.\n  Second, as part of his job as Solicitor General, Mr. Tymkovich had to \ndefend the provisions of Amendment 2, which was intended to disallow \nlaws recognizing ``minority states,'' ``quota preference,'' ``protected \nstatus,'' or ``claim of discrimination'' on the basis of sexual \norientation.\n  Never did Mr. Tymkovich in his brief or his law review article argue \nthat homosexuals should not enjoy the Fourteenth Amendment protections \navailable to all.\n  In the Colorado brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. Tymkovich \nspecifically pointed out, sponsors of the Amendment intended to prevent \na new preferred status designation. To quote the brief: ``Individuals \nwould retain precisely the same rights under State and Federal law that \nthey had prior to the enactment of the special protections'' disallowed \nby Amendment 2, and Through Amendment 2, Colorado has simply defined \nthe package of civil rights available to homosexuals and bisexuals \nunder the Colorado Constitution as no larger than that provided by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.''\n  It is important to note that Mr. Tymkovich's testimony before \nCongress in 1996 represented the views of the Colorado Attorney \nGeneral. He was not there to provide his own views; he was there as an \nofficial representative of the State. In fact, Mr. Tymkovich noted \nduring his February 12 hearing that he agreed with some of the \ntestimony, while he disagreed with other parts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have less \nthan a minute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to make a brief comment before we \nvote to remind the Members of the Senate that they have heard evidence \ntoday that indicates Tim Tymkovich is fairminded, he respects the rule \nof law, and he has exhibited intelligence and the proper temperament to \nserve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in voting to confirm Tim Tymkovich \nas a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. In my view, \nwhen confirmed, he will be not just a good judge, he will be a great \njudge.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Timothy M. \nTymkovich, of Colorado, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Tenth \nDistrict?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to you today on behalf of students \nand 4-H members and Scouts around the world. Start counting backwards \nfrom 10 to zero: 10, 9, 8, 7--and depending on the context, people will \ninstantly be reminded of their youth, sitting in front of a dimly lit \ntelevision, watching a rocket take flight as we began the study of \nspace flight and space travel. We were much younger then and all around \nme kids from all over the State and all around the country were excited \nand fascinated by the new age of rocketry and, later, space travel.\n  When Russia launched its Sputnik, it created a sensation, and their \nsuccess, spurred on by the climate of the cold war, challenged us in \nthe United States to reach for the skies.\n  Wyoming isn't called the Pioneer State for nothing, and so my \nclassmates and I were determined we would do everything we could to \nlearn about this new branch of science and involve ourselves in the \nrace for space. It was not too long after that President John F. \nKennedy issued a challenge to the Nation to land a man on the Moon and \nreturn him safely to Earth.\n  What seemed to be against all the odds soon became reality when Neil \nArmstrong walked on the Moon, taking a small step for man and a giant \nleap for mankind.\n  Even today, those of us who saw those events firsthand on the \ntelevision will never forget what a miracle it was. It fired our \nimaginations as it taught the Nation a powerful lesson: If we can make \nthis impossible dream come true for the Nation, of what more are we \ncapable if we dare to try? Perhaps that lesson is what made our Nation \nwhat it is today and why we have continued to defy the odds of what is \npossible for us as a nation, and even for each of us as individuals.\n  Then came September 11 and we, as a nation, faced another challenge. \nThe call for increased security that resulted from those cowardly and \ncruel attacks has had some unforeseen consequences, however.\n  One of them was brought to my attention when a constituent called to \nshare his concern regarding the future of his favorite hobby, model \nrocketry. He said some of the restrictions of the Homeland Security Act \ncould make it more difficult, if not impossible, for him and his fellow \nenthusiasts to purchase fuel for their model rockets.\n  As I looked into his problem, I was surprised to see that the use of \nammonium perchlorate composite propellant, better known as APCP, had \ncaught the eye of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. \nAlthough it had been regulated in the past by its placement on the \nexplosives list, the ATF had considered consumer rocket motors as \npropellant-activated devices and exempt from any ATF permit \nrequirements.\n  Then, in 1997, the ATF decided to regulate rocket motors that \ncontained more than 62.5 grams of APCP. Those that contained less than \nthat amount were still exempt, but those that contained more would not \nbe available for interstate purchase and transport without a permit.\n  Since many rocket enthusiasts travel from State to State to \nparticipate in their events, this provision could have made for a lot \nof needless redtape. To avoid it, many of those participating in this \nhobby carried their rocket bodies to the events and purchased the \nrocket motors from vendors at the local launch. With a little ingenuity \nand cooperation from local vendors, most rocketeers legally avoided the \nneed to purchase and obtain permits.\n  Now the provisions of the Homeland Security Act have created a new \nproblem. Under the new law, a permit will be required for all rocket \nmotors containing more than 62.5 grams of APCP, whether or not the \nmotor is used in or out of State. And that begins on May 24 of this \nyear--a problem rapidly approaching. The new law creates a problem \nwhere there was none before and imposes a solution that will only \ncreate unnecessary hardship for those who are studying about rockets or \npursuing a hobby as a model rocket enthusiast.\n  According to the U.S. Product Safety Commission, a rocket motor with \nless than 62.5 grams of APCP can be used by minors without adult \nsupervision. That is the U.S. Product Safety Commission: 62.5 grams or \nless can be used by minors without adult supervision. It could not be \nvery bad. Now a rocket with any more than that requires adult \nsupervision and a permit. Such an arbitrary limit makes no sense when \nit means a 62-gram rocket can be used by your children out playing in a \nfield with their friends, while another gram of fuel puts it in a \ncategory that requires adult supervision, Federal intervention, \nattention, inspection, and expensive, cumbersome permits.\n  The permit that is required costs $100, and it requires the \nsubmission of fingerprints, a photograph, and a background check. \nAlthough the homeland security bill tried to introduce a limited permit \nthat could be obtained for $25 and a background check, the newly \ndesigned permit is restricted to intrastate use and purchase only and \nwould not have any use for rocketeers who travel to events in other \nStates.\n  My concern about the impact of these regulations, and the process \nnecessary to obtain permits, and the bureaucracy that would be \nnecessary to do that, and to fulfill the requirements for background \nchecks is that it will certainly slow the participation of our young \nadults in studying rockets and pursuing their dreams of space travel.\n  As I learned from my own experience--and I was one of those rocket \npeople back at the time of Sputnik--the study of rockets had a ripple \neffect throughout my own education. It taught me a lot about math, when \nwe had to calculate the amount of fuel we needed and the rate at which \nthe rocket would travel at speed-calculating heights, figuring \ntrajectories, figuring the amount of Gs that would be on a passenger. \nIt taught us about the study of weather, as we would examine reports \nabout our own launch date and temperature and cloud cover that would \naffect our ability to observe the\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\nlaunch, and weather balloons for measuring the winds aloft, to better \ntell where it would go, and to make the calculations about how high we \nwere able to fly on any particular day.\n\n  We invented much. When I started doing rockets, there were not the \nmodel rockets available at the hobby shops. We had to have the motors \nturned out at the local shop, after we designed them for the proper \ncharacteristics. It led to a lot of invention.\n  It also expanded our horizons, as our experiences with rockets \ntranslated to our own lives. My friends and I often thought, if we \ncould master the skies and heavens with our rockets, what more would we \nbe able to do in our daily lives? It is an answer we are still \ndeveloping as we each pursue paths in life--some very far away from \nrockets.\n  As we grow older, we all want to make sure our children and our \ngrandchildren have it better than we did. This is one area in which \nthey will not have it better than we did--in fact, may not have it at \nall--if we fail to act. If we fail to come up with a reasonable \ncompromise on this issue, we will have failed to fuel the dreams of the \nnext generation in a vital field of science by our shortsighted efforts \nto regulate the fuel of the rockets.\n  Our children will not be the only ones affected by this provision, \nhowever. The impact of this regulation will also be felt by the \ntrucking industry which was recently told that it would be liable for \nthe prevention of the possession of explosives by prohibited persons \nwho are their employees. As some shippers do not currently do extensive \nbackground checks on their employees, they have decided to stop \nshipping the motors, including these rocket motors, at all.\n  Although some companies will continue to ship rocket motors, they \nwill charge very high hazardous material fees that would hit the \nconsumers in the pocketbook. Small businesses will be hit hard by the \nfees which will have to be paid by the consumer, and even larger and \nmore successful businesses will be unable to avoid the one-two punch of \nthe permit process and the higher transportation and delivery fees.\n  Even small businesses in other countries will feel the pinch. I was \nsurprised to receive a call from the president of the United Kingdom's \nlargest model rocket group. He thanked me for my interest in the issue \nbecause the U.S. ships most of the model rockets used in the United \nKingdom. The supply of model rocket motors in other countries is \nlimited, and their hobby is intricately linked with ours.\n  To remedy these problems, I introduced S. 724 last week. My bill \nprovides an exemption for permit requirements for the purchase and \ntransport of rocket motors, including those with more than 62.5 grams \nof APCP.\n  In section 845 of the Federal explosives law, my bill provides an \nexemption from explosives permit requirements for the components of \nrocket motors. This exemption is similar to the exemption in the same \nsection enjoyed by antique firearms users for black powder, as black \npowder also makes the explosives list. The limit there is 50 pounds; \nquite a bit different than 62.5 grams.\n  The current language has been tightened up from the original draft to \nensure that the exemption is only provided for valid uses. The language \nspecifies that the exemption only applies to nondetonable rocket \npropellant--a very important word. There are some high-energy APCP \ncomposites that have additional chemicals in their composition that \nmake them detonate instead of burning at a moderate rate. These are not \nused in amateur or sport rocketry and are not exempt under my language.\n  The APCP my bill refers to, which is found in model rockets, burns \nbut does not explode. In addition, the language in my bill does not \nexempt rockets that carry various components of weaponry.\n  On the transportation issue, it appears that some companies are only \nshipping those articles that are specifically mentioned as exempt from \nexplosives requirements under section 845. My bill provides the \nexemption for rocket motor components under this section, giving \nshippers a clear exemption to resume shipping rocket motors.\n  I have been joined by Senators Bennett, Inhofe, Coleman, Crapo, \nBurns, Allard, and Santorum in introducing this bill.\n  Some of my other colleagues have expressed concern that this \nlegislation goes too far. They have questioned me about the possibility \nof individuals stockpiling APCP to build a bomb.\n  First, I would contend that the ATF does not appear concerned about \nthis possibility. Under their proposed 62.5-gram exemption, an \nindividual would be able to buy as many rocket motors as they wanted \nthat were under 62.5 grams.\n  A rocket motor is fairly simple. I ask unanimous consent to show a \nthree-dimensional object on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have one of those 62.5 gram rocket motors here. This is \nwhat is allowed to be bought in as much quantity as you want. But a \nquarter of an inch bigger than this and you can't have it without $100 \nand a special permit. It is very simple, the fuel with the hole through \nthe center. When you buy them, the APCP comes in this chunk that is \nremovable from the rest of the rocket motor parts.\n  If the ATF considers APCP a dangerous explosive, then their 62.5 gram \nexemption itself is dangerous. The ATF is basically saying it is OK to \nbuy as many sticks of dynamite as you want, but we won't let you have a \nwhole box. I reiterate that rocket motors compare more to flares than \nto dynamite. Hundreds of hours are spent constructing these rockets.\n  A lot of work goes into the rocket body. Nobody wants to blow theirs \napart. So they are a safe form of fuel.\n  Simply put, my legislation is designed to allow another generation to \nexperience the thrills and excitement of model rocketry. It is being \nintroduced to correct a change in the law that Congress never intended. \nWhen we voted to take action to prevent the actions of terrorists, we \nnever intended to prevent our children from pursuing projects in \nscience class, hobbyists from pursuing their hobbies, and our families \nfrom engaging in father-son or mother-daughter or any mixture of \nprojects that promote learning and the pursuit of the frontiers of \nspace. If you have never been to a rocketry event or seen a rocket \nlaunch in person, I urge you to do so if the opportunity ever presents \nitself. If you have gone to one of those events, you will remember how \nit left you looking towards the heavens, mindful of your dreams, and \nfeeling encouraged to pursue them.\n  That is not a bad gift to give our children and theirs. It is \nextensive throughout the world, I can tell, from the calls I have \ngotten about this since I got involved in it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort which will have a \ngreat impact on our lives in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TELECOMMUNICATIONS BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--As soon as possible after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     provide, wherever practicable, prepaid phone cards, or \n     an equivalent telecommunications benefit which includes \n     access to telephone service, to members of the armed \n     forces stationed outside the United States who are \n     directly supporting military operations in Iraq or \n     Afghanistan (as determined by the Secretary) to enable \n     them to make telephone calls to family and friends in the \n     United States without cost to the member.\n       (b) Monthly Amount.--The value of the benefit provided by \n     subsection (a) shall not exceed $40 per month per person.\n       (c) End of Program.--The program established by subsection \n     (a) shall terminate on the date that is 60 days after the \n     date on which the Secretary determines that Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom has ended.\n       (d) Funding.\n       (1) Use of existing resources.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall maximize the use of existing \n     Department of Defense telecommunications programs and \n     capabilities, private support organizations, private entities \n     offering free or reduced-cost services, and programs to \n     enhance morale and welfare.\n       (2) Use of appropriated funds.--In addition to resources \n     described in paragraph (1) and notwithstanding any limitation \n     on the expenditure or obligation of appropriated amounts, the \n     Secretary may use available funds appropriated to or for the \n     use of the Department of Defense that are not otherwise \n     obligated or expended to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall work with telecommunications \n     providers to facilitate the deployment of additional \n     telephones for use in calling the United States under this \n     Act as quickly as practicable, consistent with the \n     availability of resources. Consistent with the timely \n     provision of telecommunications benefits under this Act, the \n     Secretary should carry out this section and section 4 in a \n     manner that allows for competition in the provision of such \n     benefits.\n\n     SEC. 6. NO COMPROMISE OF MILITARY MISSION.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall not take any action under \n     this Act that would compromise the military objectives or \n     mission of the Department of Defense.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Just to be clear, at the expiration or yielding back of \ntime, the amendment is adopted, and the bill, as amended, will be read \na third time and passed, without intervening action or debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This legislation, introduced on behalf of Senators Allen, Chambliss, \nLindsey Graham, Craig, Miller, and others, would improve the ability of \nAmerican service personnel fighting overseas to communicate with their \nloved ones at home. It provides a monthly allotment of free telephone \ncalling time to members of the Armed Forces outside of the United \nStates who are directly supporting or involved in military operations \nin Iraq or Afghanistan for such period of time as the conflict \ncontinues in both areas.\n  I have discussed this issue with the Department of Defense and at \nthis time they have not gotten back to me. I spoke to the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense. She supports the idea. There may be some changes \nproposed by the Department of Defense, but I am confident of their \nsupport.\n  This legislation would direct the Secretary of Defense to provide \nthese troops with the financial ability to call home by providing a \nprepaid calling card or equivalent telecommunications benefit up to $40 \nevery month. The bill would also direct the Secretary to work with \ntelecommunications providers to facilitate the deployment of additional \ntelephones for use by our troops. Our military mission must remain a \npriority of the Department of Defense. Therefore, the bill makes clear \nthat the Secretary shall not take any action to implement the bill that \nwould compromise our overall military objectives. Moreover, the bill \ngives the Secretary complete discretion on how best to implement it. If \nit is simply impractical to provide the benefit to certain soldiers, \nthen the Secretary may refrain, obviously, from providing it. If the \ncost of providing the service to one branch of the military or the \nother is more costly, then the Secretary can determine the most \nequitable method of distributing the benefit.\n  The bill also directs the Secretary to maximize the use of all \nresources to fulfill the goals of the act and, thus, he may use \nexisting programs, private support programs, or offers from private \nentities to make telephone service available to our troops. For \nexample, I received a generous offer today from Joseph Wright, CEO of \nPanAmSat Corporation. In his letter he said:\n\n       [This bill] is a terrific idea and I would like to support \n     it. . . .We would be willing to provide satellite services \n     free to support your initiative.\n\n  The only intended beneficiaries of this bill are the troops serving \nthis country. It is not intended to benefit any particular provider. \nThus the bill urges the Secretary to implement the bill in a manner \nthat is consistent with the timely provision of the benefits but also \nin a manner that allows for competition in the provision of such \nbenefits.\n  All of us are aware of the importance of communicating with one's \nfamily and friends, particularly when you are in a time of crisis and \ncombat. This is a modest attempt to try and help these men and women \nwho are serving. Some of them have already been there for a very long \ntime. The USS Abraham Lincoln has been at sea in the area for more than \n300 days. Communications with their loved ones at home is obviously a \nvery important aspect of preserving family and also communicating with \nfriends as well. Modern technology enables our service personnel to \ncommunicate with their loved ones by phone, and these real-time \ndiscussions can provide significant emotional and psychological support \nto both the soldier and the family.\n  Unfortunately, for some the cost of placing these calls can be \nprohibitively expensive. On March 18, 2003, USA Today reported on the \nhigh cost of telephone calls from bases in Kuwait:\n\n       It cost one soldier $35 to make two quick phone calls home \n     to his wife.\n\n  Likewise, my office was recently told the story of a Marine corporal \nwho didn't have enough money to call his son in the States on his \nbirthday.\n  Last Friday, I asked the country's telephone companies to commit to \nensure that families of service personnel don't have their telephone \nlines disconnected due to a short-term inability to pay the costs \nincurred for calls from troops overseas. I also asked for a commitment \nto implement special reduced rates where feasible for telephone calls \nwith members of the Armed Forces overseas.\n  Madam President, the response has been overwhelming. From the \nsmallest companies serving a few hundred customers to the largest of \ncompanies, around 60 companies have agreed to make these commitments. I \nwish to quote from a few of these letters and I will have many printed \nin the Record at the appropriate time. Some of them are extremely \ntouching, believe it or not.\n  One that especially got my attention was from the Andrew Telephone \nCompany in Andrew, IA. They will not disconnect service from \nservicemen's families for the duration of the war. They write:\n\n       We don't offer long distance, but we will assist \n     subscribers to find the best rates possible. Andrew is a \n     community of 450 and we have 19 young men and women serving \n     at this time. Yours, Mil Cornelius, President.\n\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\n\n  Remarkable. Andrew, IA, a community of 450 and they have 19 young men \nand women serving at this time. That is a very wonderful commitment.\n  We have commitments from small companies from Andrew Telephone \nCompany to Quest, Southern Bell, SBC, Verizon, AT, MCI, Sprint. All \nthe major corporations in America have also made these commitments. I \nam extremely grateful to them. More importantly, I am sure the service \nmen and women and their families all over America are grateful as well.\n  Just a couple more: William P. Heaston, vice president of PrairieWave \nCommunications in Sioux Falls, SD, wrote:\n\n       I am a retired Army officer, who served in Vietnam and \n     other remote areas. I can assure you that PrairieWave fully \n     appreciates the benefit to morale and military service that \n     the ability to communicate with loved ones brings.\n\n  William E. Morrow, CEO of Grande Communications in San Marcos, TX, \nwrites:\n\n       We are proud of our troops and know their families are in \n     need of our support during these difficult times. This is the \n     least we can do in light of their great sacrifice for our \n     country.\n\n  All of them make statements along those lines.\n  OmniTel Communications:\n\n       We will also be providing cash credits as a donation on the \n     billing, which have yet to be determined, of these families \n     later this year to help defray other costs they may have \n     incurred.\n       OmniTel Communications supports our Armed Forces in its \n     critical action and wish the very best to all Americans who \n     have to make very serious decisions for the future of our \n     great country.\n       Ronald Laudner, CEO, OmniTel Communications, Nora Springs, \n     IA.\n\n  I appreciate the overwhelming response from the major corporations \nand the smallest telephone companies in America. Obviously, as I said, \nthe men and women who are serving in harm's way as we speak will also \nbe grateful.\n  I also want to state the obvious to the men and women serving in the \nmost dire and dangerous situations and cannot make a phone call now. \nThey will be rotated out and they will be in places where they will be \nable to do so, and those are the ones who I am sure their families will \nwant to hear from urgently.\n  I thank my colleagues for this bill. It will go to the other body. We \nwill have, I think, a brief period of time for the Department of \nDefense to make whatever input they would like to have in this \nlegislation. I hope we can pass it as quickly as possible and send it \nto the President. I thank my friend, Senator Allen, and I thank \nespecially Senator Chambliss, who is chairman of our Personnel \nSubcommittee, who has been very much involved in this issue as well.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nrepresentative sample of responses I received from telephone companies, \nlarge and small, throughout the country, and a list of all of the \ncompanies that have responded to my request.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Mil Cornelius [andrtel@netins.net]\n     Sent: Monday, March 24, 2003 7:06 p.m.\n     To: Bailey, Bill (Commerce)\n     Subject: McCain Request\n       Andrew Telephone Company, Andrew, IA will not disconnect \n     service from Servicemen's families for the duration of the \n     war.

We also understand how important communications are to \n     our service men and women and their families. On March 21, \n     2003, MCI reinstated its military personnel collections \n     policy that was last used during the Afghanistan deployment. \n     This policy allows MCI to negotiate very liberal deferred \n     payment arrangements designed to meet the needs of the \n     military members and their families.\n       MCI is also examining the possibility of special discounts \n     to make it easier for our service personnel to communicate \n     with their loved ones.\n       MCI is proud to support our troops.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne B. Huyard.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AT,\n\n                                   Morristown, NJ, March 24, 2003.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Like all Americans, AT strongly \n     supports the efforts our Armed Services personnel undertake \n     on our nation's behalf in times of peace and in times of war. \n     That support has evolved into a long tradition at AT of \n     close cooperation with the United States government to \n     provide the men and women who serve in our military the best \n     telecommunications services in the world. As I write this \n     letter, AT is providing service to sailors, marines, \n     soldiers, and airmen on virtually every major U.S. military \n     base worldwide and on every Navy ship at sea.\n       That tradition continues as AT now steps up to the \n     challenge of providing communications services to our \n     nation's troops deployed in the conflict with Iraq. As part \n     of that effort, earlier this week AT announced that it \n     would donate 160,000 prepaid phone cards worth $3 million to \n     the USO for use by U.S. troops fighting the war with Iraq. \n     This continues AT's tradition of donating service dating \n     back to Operation Desert Storm as well as the Balkan \n     conflict.\n       Today, from United States military bases in Kuwait, service \n     men and women can call home in a number of convenient and \n     cost-effective ways, including through the use of prepaid \n     cards, standard calling cards, commercial credit cards, and \n     collect calling. Special military prepaid card rates, for \n     instance, allow military personnel to call the United States \n     for 22 cents to 30 cents per minute with no surcharge per \n     call. In addition, our special Global Military Saver Plus \n     card, which has been heavily promoted to military \n     personnel, is available at $0.50 per minute with no per-\n     call surcharge and a monthly fee of only $1 for each month \n     in which it is used. On a promotional basis, AT has also \n     lowered the cost of calling from military bases in Kuwait \n     to the United States using standard calling cards, \n     commercial credit cards, and collect calling to 50 cents \n     per minute with a maximum per call surcharge of $1.50 and, \n     in some cases, no surcharge at all. Ship-to-shore calling \n     is also available aboard Navy ships at rates of between $1 \n     and $3 per minute, reflecting unique cost and capacity \n     issues.\n       The retail rates for the military prepaid cards and ship-\n     to-shore service are set by the Army Air Force Exchange \n     Service (AAFES) and Navy Exchange Command (NEXCOM) based on \n     rates set by AT in contracts with both AAFES and NEXCOM. \n     Absent some unforeseen and extraordinary request from AAFES \n     or NEXCOM that would materially increase our infrastructure \n     costs, AT will not increase the underlying contractual \n     rates for these services to AAFES and NEXCOM for the \n     remainder of the year and through 2004. This commitment \n     applies for calling from American military bases in the \n     region, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, and from Navy \n     ships engaged in this action. Additionally, for the duration \n     of large scale armed hostilities in Iraq and for a period of \n     3 months thereafter, AT will not increase its special \n     promotional rates for calling from military bases in Kuwait \n     using standard calling cards, commercial credit cards, and \n     collect calling.\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n       AT is also working with AAFES to determine service \n     requirements going forward as events play out in the region, \n     especially Iraq. Of course, we do not provide service to U.S. \n     military personnel in Iraq today, and do not know the full \n     circumstances under which we may be called to do so. Whatever \n     the circumstances, however, we will, working with AAFES, use \n     our best efforts to provide the men and women who serve in \n     our military in Iraq with the lowest reasonable calling rates \n     possible.\n       AT is committed to bringing calling services to our \n     troops as quickly as possible in Iraq and elsewhere around \n     the world. As the number of U.S. troops has grown in the \n     Persian Gulf region, AT teams have worked around the clock \n     to meet the communications needs of those troops. That work \n     is ahead of schedule, and likely to be expanded under the \n     direction of the U.S. military, which determines equipment \n     deployment plans. As those deployment plans are finalized, we \n     will do all we can to bring service on line with the \n     reliability and quality that consumers rightfully have come \n     to expect from AT\n       Senator, AT is honored to be able to help and support our \n     U.S. troops during the conflict in Iraq. As President of AT \n     Consumer Services, the unit of AT responsible for providing \n     personal communications services to military service \n     personnel around the world, I can assure you that, in keeping \n     with its finest traditions, AT remains dedicated to \n     connecting our troops with the people they love back home.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     John Polumbo,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Telephone Companies that Responded to McCain Letter\n\n     Alenco Communications, Inc.\n     All West Communications\n     American Discount Telecom\n     Andrew Telephone Company\n     AT\n     ATX Communications Inc.\n     BellSouth\n     Bentleyville Communications Corp.\n     Call America\n     Cbeyond\n     CC Communications\n     Choice One\n     Citizens Telephone Co.\n     Coastal Communications\n     Cox Communications\n     Covad\n     Cox Communications\n     Cunningham Telephone Company\n     Deerfield Farmers Telephone Co.\n     DFT Communications\n     EPIK Communications\n     Eschelon Telecom\n     Farmers Telephone Company\n     FairPoint Communications\n     Focal Communications\n     GCI\n     Grande Communications\n     Green Hill Telephone Companies\n     Hamilton Telecommunication\n     Home Telephone Co.\n     InterBel Telephone\n     Iowa Telecom\n     ITC DeltaCom, Inc.\n     Jefferson Telephone Co.\n     Jordan-Soldier Telephone Co.\n     KMC Telecom\n     LecStar Telecom Inc.\n     Le-Ru Telephone Company\n     MCI\n     Monroe Telephone\n     New Edge Network, Inc.\n     New Edge Networks\n     Nii Communications\n     Nortex Communications Co.\n     NW Iowa Telephone Co.\n     OmniTel Communications\n     One Eighty\n     PacWest\n     Pae Tec\n     Peace Valley Telephone Company\n     Pigeon Telephone Co.\n     Qwest\n     Prairie Wave\n     Ritter Communications Holdings, Inc.\n     Rothsay Telephone Co.\n     SBC\n     Sprint\n     Supra Telecom\n     Talk America, Inc.\n     TDS Metrocom\n     The Rainier Group\n     TXU Communications\n     USLEC Communications\n     VeriSign\n     Verizon\n     Walnut Telephone Company\n     Wilson Telephone Co.\n     Xspedius Communications.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, first, I very much commend Senator McCain \nfor his leadership in introducing this very important, thoughtful, and \nconsiderate measure, S. 718. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it with \nhim, Senator Chambliss, and others.\n  The purpose of this bill is to support the morale of the brave men \nand women of the U.S. armed services who are stationed outside the \nUnited States, directly supporting military operations in Afghanistan \nor Iraq, by giving them the ability to call their loved ones without an \nexpense to them.\n  When you look at the findings, they all make very good sense, \nespecially that\n\n     telephone contact with family and friends provides \n     significant emotional and psychological support to them and \n     helps to sustain and improve morale.\n\n  As you read the language of the bill, it all makes great sense as a \nmatter of legislation. To give you an idea how it might have an impact \non real people and real lives, and also the lives that have been lost, \nI will refer to an article today in The Washington Post, where a young \nman from Virginia lost his life. This young man's name is SGT Donald C. \nMay, Jr. His father had fought in Vietnam. Young Mr. May joined the \nMarines as soon as he graduated from high school at Meadowbrook High \nSchool in Chesterfield County, VA. He reenlisted and eventually became \na tank commander. His father received two Purple Hearts as a tank \ncommander in Vietnam. Unfortunately, his father died in a boating \naccident while fishing a few years back.\n  At any rate, SGT May moved and bounced around for several years. He \nwent to North Carolina, where he met his wife Deborah, and eventually \nthey went off to California where he was stationed. He left in January \nfor the Middle East, and it was then, in January, that his mother last \ntalked to him on the phone. As his mother recalled in this article, he \nsaid, ``Mom, this is what I have trained for all my life. This is what \nI am meant to do. I am ready.''\n  He talked a bit later with his wife and he told her that he had \ndecided not to reenlist because he wanted to be home more with his two \nchildren, Mariah, almost 7, and Jack, almost 2. His wife Deborah is \npregnant with their third child, a son, to be named William. Mrs. May, \nthe mother, said her daughter-in-law was treated twice in the last few \ndays for premature labor. The baby is due in mid-May.\n  Brenda May's last communication with her son arrived a week ago. It \nwas a letter dated March 3.\n  So when you think of this story of this brave, courageous hero, who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our country, for our safety, for our \nfreedom, for our security, and to liberate the people of Iraq, what a \ngift he has given to this country--his life, his future, to be holding \nhis baby boy William, to be with his children as they grow up. That is \nthe greatest gift he could give to this country, and I surely hope the \npeople of Iraq, when liberated, will also get down on their knees and \nthank God for people of this man's courage.\n  When you listen to the story of him last talking on the telephone to \nhis mother and wife in January, the last communication in a letter \ndated March 3, the reality is that was his last communication.\n  I know that you, Madam President, and all Americans can readily \nunderstand how this measure would have had an impact. If he could get \nto a telephone to actually have his mother, to have his wife, hear his \nvoice and have him hear their voices, to tell him that they love him, \nfor them to tell him how proud they are for what he is doing. \nObviously, they would be asking him to stay safe. But there would have \nbeen the ending on that telephone call undoubtedly where his mother, \nhis wife, and his children would have said: I love you.\n\n  While this measure looks like $40 a month and a telephone call, in \nsome cases that may be the last contact. That is why this measure is so \nimportant, and I commend Senator McCain and all of my colleagues for \nintroducing it. I urge my colleagues to pass it very shortly.\n  I am also hopeful that later this week we can take up S. 721. This is \na measure I have introduced with Senators McCain, Chambliss, Graham of \nSouth Carolina, Warner, Burns, Miller, and Stevens to expand the combat \nzone exclusions and to provide tax exclusions to personnel serving in \nCuba and the Horn of Africa in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  This legislation will help expand the combat zone tax exclusion to \ninclude the period in transit to qualified combat zones and to provide \nfull income tax exclusion to other personnel. The pay for these \npersonnel would not be, with the passage of this bill, subject to \nFederal or State taxes for any month in which they serve in one of \nthese areas. The legislation also provides tax breaks for individuals \nserving in Operation Enduring Freedom, the global\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\nwar on terrorism, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa. If \nthis measure were to pass, the pay for these personnel would not be \nsubject to Federal or State taxes for any month in which they serve in \none of these areas.\n  As a matter of past precedent, in 1995, Congress passed legislation \ndesignating Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia as comprising \nqualified hazardous duty areas. Military personnel serving there on \npeacekeeping duties are eligible for the same tax exclusion as \npersonnel serving in combat zones.\n  I also point out that officers do not receive a full income tax \nexclusion. Any income above the level of the highest enlisted rank is \nsubject to Federal and State taxes. This makes absolutely no sense to \nme whatsoever, and I know that Senator Chambliss has another measure \nthat will provide parity between officers serving in the Guard and \nReserve.\n  The other point of this matter is that the pay of personnel in \ntransit to a combat zone is subject to income taxes until they actually \ncross into the combat zone area.\n  What we are seeing is some of the ships are steaming at full speed \nwhen otherwise not necessary in an effort to give personnel as much \ntax-excluded income as possible. My view is that as soon as those \nbattleship groups leave the ports, whether it is Wilmington, Norfolk, \nor San Diego, that is when the combat zone exclusion ought to apply. I \nthink this is a commonsense, equitable matter. I think we should not be \nhaving our families back home worried about paying taxes when their \nbrave loved one--whether that may be their husband, wife, son, \ndaughter, mother or father--is leaving home. They should not be having \nto worry about paying taxes when they are serving, whether they are \nReserves, Guard, or active military, in these areas supporting this \noperation for our security and also to liberate Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass S. 718, the Troops Phone Home Free Act \nof 2003. It is the proper and compassionate thing to do. It also \nexpresses our gratitude and appreciation not just to the troops but the \nloved ones home who need to have that reassurance and the pleasure of \nhearing their loved one's voice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Troops \nPhone Home Free Act introduced by my colleague from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. This legislation would allow troops who are on the front lines \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom to place phone calls to \ntheir loved ones without cost to them or their families. It would \nprovide prepaid phone cards for the soldiers and provide more phones in \nthe Middle East and in Afghanistan so our troops can have more \nflexibility to communicate with their families.\n  This is an important measure not only for the morale of our brave men \nand women who are overseas fighting in a war but also to their families \nand loved ones who are sacrificing dearly for their country.\n  There is nobody in this great body that we serve in who has a greater \nappreciation for a soldier to have the ability to pick up the phone and \ncall his or her family than Senator McCain. I admire and respect him \nfor his service to our country, and I am very pleased to be in support \nof his bill to make sure that every member of our Armed Forces serving \nin Iraq today, in Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, has the opportunity \nto communicate with their families.\n  We think of our brave men and women and the great job they are \ndoing--which they are and I am so proud of all of them--but we have to \nalso remember they have families back home. They have friends and loved \nones here who are making just as big a sacrifice as they are making by \nserving our country. I think it is only right and fair that we give \nthem as many benefits as we possibly can, and this is simply one more \nway of saying we appreciate the great work they are doing.\n  I also rise in support of S. 721, which is Senator Allen's bill to \nextend the combat zone where our men and women are serving. Again, from \na Guard and Reserve standpoint, we are calling up these men and women \non a much more regular basis today than ever before, and it is \nextremely important that we show support for all of our men and women \nserving in combat, active duty, Guard, and Reserve. This provides some \nequity in the payment to all of those men and women who are serving in \ncombat in any part of the world to which they are called. So I do rise \nin strong support of Senator Allen's bill.\n  I also rise to introduce legislation, along with my colleagues \nSenator McCain, Senator Graham of South Carolina as well as Senator \nAllen, that I believe will be a positive step in assisting commanders \nin the Reserve and the National Guard. The men and women who serve our \ncountry in the Reserve and National Guard make up a critical component \nof an All-Volunteer Force and have chosen to put their lives on the \nline for the freedom of their families and their country, and we thank \nthem. We continue to be on our knees in prayer for their continued \nsafety and for their families as they serve around the world. The \nlegislation I bring to the floor today represents a small step in \nrecognizing the sacrifices that specifically the commanding officers in \nthe Reserve and the National Guard are making as we speak. This \ninitiative will provide a well-deserved benefit to at least 500 \nreservists and 1,500 National Guardsmen. Currently, National Guard and \nReserve commanders are not entitled to command responsibility pay, even \nthough they serve in a similar capacity to their active duty \ncounterparts. This bill will allow for an added benefit of $50 per \nmonth for junior officers, $100 a month for mid-level officers, and \n$150 a month for Guard and Reserve senior officers who serve as \ncommanders. This pay will apply whether they are full-time wing \ncommanders of a Reserve component airlift wing or whether they are \nserving as a commander in an inactive duty training capacity. The \npurpose of this bill is to create further equity between our active and \nReserve components. The amount of money involved is relatively small, \nbut this measure serves as a powerful symbol that we value the \ncontribution and sacrifice of our citizen soldiers stationed around the \nworld serving the United States of America and the cause of freedom.\n  There is one special story about which I would like to speak very \nbriefly. It is a story on the front page of virtually every major \nnewspaper in America this morning. It is a story about CPT Chris Carter \nin the United States Army, a young captain from Watkinsville, GA, of \nwhom I am so extremely proud, a story about Captain Carter who risked \nhis life on a bridge over the Euphrates River, which was under siege, a \nbridge which they were seeking to have explosives removed from so we \ncould take that bridge to make sure our troops ultimately got safely \nacross the bridge. It is a story of CPT Chris Carter who, during the \nmidst of a firefight, saw some innocent civilians, Iraqi civilians, \ncrossing that bridge, coming over to the side he and his troops were \non. He saw innocent civilians being caught in that firefight and one \nman being killed and a woman, an Iraqi woman, bleeding and pleading for \nhelp. Captain Carter got off of his vehicle, rushed to the bridge, \nbehind his vehicle so that he could have some cover, until he got \nbehind an iron post on that bridge. After he got behind the iron post \non that bridge and under fierce fire coming from the other side, he \nrisked his own life to go to that Iraqi woman and to pull her to safety \nand secure medication for her and ultimately have her transported to a \nmedical facility where she is being treated.\n\n  I am so proud of every one of our men and women who are fighting in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom today. But it is men and women like Chris \nCarter of whom I am especially proud. He is not just a great Georgian, \nhe is a great American and a great member of the United States Army.\n  I had a great conversation with his father this morning. His father \nobviously is extremely proud of him. He is one of those young men who \nwill be able to take advantage of these benefits we have been talking \nabout here today, Senator McCain, Senator Allen, and myself. He is one \nof the young men who will be able to take that phone card under Senator \nMcCain's bill and call home to his family to tell them exactly what did \nhappen and let them have an opportunity to tell him how very proud of \nhim they are.\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\n  Again, I commend Senator McCain. I appreciate very much the strong \nsupport of Senator Allen and Senator Graham as we introduce these \nmeasures to try to make life a little more pleasant for our troops as \nthey are separated from their families, and also to make sure their \nfamilies have the opportunity to communicate with them, and have the \nfinancial resources to continue to provide for their families while \nthey are serving in combat areas so that they can concentrate on doing \nthe job they are sent to do and know that their families are being well \ntaken care of, and know they are going to have the ability to \ncommunicate by telephone with their families on a regular basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona for \nhis initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be added as a cosponsor of his legislation, \nthe Troops Phone Home Free Act. I think it is a wonderful initiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I also commend the Senator from Georgia, who heads the \nPersonnel Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee, with whom I am \nvery privileged to serve. He brings great leadership to the effort. I \nam proud to be a member of his subcommittee.\n\n\n                             Death Gratuity\n\n  Later tonight I am hopeful the Senate will consider legislation, S. \n704, which I introduced last week with my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee, the chairman, Senator John Warner, and my \ncolleague, Senator John McCain. I recognize the contributions and \ncosponsorship of Senators Ben Nelson and George Allen. The legislation \nwe have introduced will send an important message to our troops who are \nengaged in combat, even as we speak, that our Nation is so grateful for \ntheir service.\n  Our bill would raise the amount paid to the families of military \npersonnel killed while on active duty. It would increase it from $6,000 \nto $12,000. This payment, which is known as the death gratuity, would \nbe paid retroactive to September 11, 2001, so that the troops who have \nbeen killed in the battle against terrorism would also be eligible for \nthis doubled benefit.\n  As are all of my colleagues, I am very saddened by the loss of \nAmerican life in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The young men and women of \nour military represent the very best our Nation has to offer. They do \nnot join the military for monetary gain nor to have a comfortable \nlifestyle. They serve our Nation out of a sense of patriotism that \nshould make each and every American proud. The mercy they are showing \neven today to Iraqi prisoners of war is testament to the strength of \ncharacter that is the core of our military values. In many cases, we \nask our own troops to take additional risks in order to avoid injuring \nor killing innocent civilians. That they do this without question or \nregret speaks well not only of our military but of our Nation.\n  When the Commander in Chief sends our troops into harm's way, we hope \nand pray each and every one of them will come back home unharmed. While \nwe know this will not be possible, that knowledge does not lessen our \nshock and our sadness when we learn of the loss of lives.\n\n  My State of Maine has experienced two such losses since the war \nbegan. Last Saturday, I attended a memorial mass in Windsor, ME, in \nhonor of the life and sacrifice of CPT Jay Aubin. CPT Jay Aubin and CPL \nBrian Kennedy, both proud members of the United States Marine Corps, \nperished in a helicopter crash in the Kuwaiti desert in the very first \nfew days of the conflict. I met with the parents of both these brave \nmarines, both of whom were present at this memorial mass last Saturday. \nHundreds of Mainers gathered to pay tribute to the sacrifice of these \nbrave marines and their families.\n  As I stand on the floor of the Senate, I once again want to assure \ntheir families we honor and recognize their service and their \nsacrifice. When we send a young man or woman into harm's way, our \nNation has in return a sacred obligation to them and to their families. \nWe must ensure they go forth with the utter and complete confidence, \nshould the worst happen, should they be called upon to make the \nultimate sacrifice, that their country will care for their families and \nhonor their service. The death gratuity is a small token, but it \nassists the grieving families with their immediate financial needs. \nThere are a variety of other programs that provide for longer term \nsupport, but in the initial hours and days after a family has endured \nsuch a terrible loss, these funds help to alleviate monetary concerns. \nThis benefit is commonly provided within 72 hours to the family of the \nservice member who is killed while on active duty.\n  The last time the death gratuity was raised was in 1991 during the \nperiod of the gulf war when it was doubled from $3,000 to $6,000. With \nmore than a decade having passed, it is time for Congress to move \nforward and increase this sum in recognition of those who are today \nfighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in the war against terrorism. \nIt is the least we can do to honor their sacrifice. I offer this \nlegislation in tribute to the families of those whose loved ones are \ntoday engaged in combat in the Persian Gulf. Too often we forget the \nsacrifices they make so that their loved one, their husband, wife, \nfather, mother, brother, or sister, can serve our Nation. They are \nasked to accept long deployments and frequent moves while at the same \ntime providing their loved one with the support they need to do their \njobs.\n\n  Truly, what these families do is heroic. Passage of this legislation \nwill send a clear and strong message to them that this Congress and \nthis Nation is grateful for their sacrifice. Again, it is my hope we \nwill pass this legislation by unanimous consent later this evening. In \nthe meantime, my thoughts are with our troops as they fight in the \nbattles in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the war against terrorism, and I \npray they will soon return home in victory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back and we move to consideration of the legislation, S. 718.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Troops Phone Home Free Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to support the morale of the \n     brave men and women of the United States armed services \n     stationed outside the United States who are directly \n     supporting military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan (as \n     determined by the Secretary of Defense) by giving them the \n     ability to place calls to their loved ones without expense to \n     them.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The armed services of the United States are the finest \n     in the world.\n       (2) The members of the armed services are bravely placing \n     their lives in danger to protect the security of the people \n     of the United States and to advance the cause of freedom in \n     Iraq.\n       (3) Their families and loved ones are making sacrifices at \n     home in support of the members of the armed services abroad.\n       (4) Telephone contact with family and friends provides \n     significant emotional and psychological support to them and \n     helps to sustain and improve morale.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TELECOMMUNICATIONS BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--As soon as possible after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     provide, wherever practicable, prepaid phone cards, or an \n     equivalent telecommunications benefit which includes access \n     to telephone service, to members of the armed forces \n     stationed outside the United States who are directly \n     supporting military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan (as \n     determined by the Secretary)\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\n     to enable them to make telephone calls to family and friends \n     in the United States without cost to the member.\n       (b) Monthly Amount.--The value of the benefit provided by \n     subsection (a) shall not exceed $40 per month per person.\n       (c) End of Program.--The program established by subsection \n     (a) shall terminate on the date that is 60 days after the \n     date on which the Secretary determines that Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom has ended.\n       (d) Funding.--\n       (1) Use of existing resources.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall maximize the use of existing \n     Department of Defense telecommunications programs and \n     capabilities, private support organizations, private entities \n     offering free or reduced-cost services, and programs to \n     enhance morale and welfare.\n       (2) Use of appropriated funds.--In addition to resources \n     described in paragraph (1) and notwithstanding any limitation \n     on the expenditure or obligation of appropriated amounts, the \n     Secretary may use available funds appropriated to or for the \n     use of the Department of Defense that are not otherwise \n     obligated or expended to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall work with telecommunications \n     providers to facilitate the deployment of additional \n     telephones for use in calling the United States under this \n     Act as quickly as practicable, consistent with the \n     availability of resources. Consistent with the timely \n     provision of telecommunications benefits under this Act, the \n     Secretary should carry out this section and section 4 in a \n     manner that allows for competition in the provision of such \n     benefits.\n\n     SEC. 6. NO COMPROMISE OF MILITARY MISSION.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall not take any action under \n     this Act that would compromise the military objectives or \n     mission of the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on and express \noutrage over the recent actions and words of journalist Peter Arnett. \nIn fact, I hesitate to even use the term ``journalist'' when referring \nto Mr. Arnett. This word implies a certain degree of objectivity and \nbalance which this man knows absolutely nothing about. ``Traitor'' is a \nbetter word to describe Mr. Arnett.\n  This past weekend Mr. Arnett appeared on state-controlled Iraqi \ntelevision. With a uniformed Iraqi anchor translating, Mr. Arnett told \nthe Iraqi people that the American war plan had failed due to their \ncontinued resistance and that coalition forces were in the process of \ndrafting new battle plans. To quote Arnett:\n\n       Clearly, the American war plans misjudged the determination \n     of the Iraqi forces.\n\n  Saddam Hussein couldn't have written his script any better.\n  Clearly, Mr. Arnett has no idea what he is talking about. This is the \nsame man who reported in 1991 during the first gulf war that the United \nStates had blown up a baby milk factory. Military sources confirmed \nthat this target was in fact hit. The fact that Mr. Arnett conveniently \nleft out was that this ``baby milk factory'' was actually a biological \nweapons plant.\n  I will never understand how and why Mr. Arnett always thinks he knows \nso much more than our military and intelligence officials. I am pretty \nsure our military leaders on the ground and civilian leaders in the \nPentagon, who are briefed around the clock, know a whole heck of a lot \nmore than Mr. Arnett. I hope Mr. Arnett is not getting his info from \nthe same source who told him that U.S. forces used the nerve agent--\nsarin gas--against villagers in Laos during the Vietnam war.\n  This story, reported in 1998 by Mr. Arnett, could hold no water and \nCNN rightly fired Arnett for his reckless words and actions. Now, 6 \nyears after that bogus claim, Peter Arnett has once again found himself \nin search of employment.\n  Both National Geographic Explorer and NBC News have fired Arnett for \nthis latest stunt by Peter Arnett on Iraqi-controlled television. I am \ntrying to figure out why these entities even hired him in the first \nplace with his pathetic track record of recent years.\n  We all firmly believe in the first amendment which protects the \nfreedom of religion, speech, press and assembly. However, no U.S. \ncitizen should be allowed to provide aid, and comfort, through false \ninformation, to the enemy during wartime.\n  Of course the media doesn't mention the word ``treason'' like many of \nus have over Mr. Arnett's comments. That would be an indictment of one \nof their own and a pock on their profession.\n  Mr. Arnett can apologize all he likes for being a ``useful idiot'' \nfor Saddam and his barbaric regime, but that's not enough for me and \nit's certainly not enough for our soldiers and many Americans. I think \nMr. Arnett should be met at the border and arrested should he come back \nto America.\n  I dare Mr. Arnett to take a good look at our soldiers in uniform and \ntell them they have failed in this mission and objective.\n  These men and women embody everything that is great about America and \nfreedom. They come from small towns and big cities. They come from \nfamilies both rich and poor. They come from all religions and races. \nThe one thing all these Americans have in common is their love for \nAmerica and freedom.\n  They love this Nation and cherish its very idea so much that they are \nwilling to sacrifice their own lives to ensure that we can live in a \ncountry free of government tyranny like that under which those in Iraq \nhave lived.\n  This war has lasted almost 13 days. Thus far we have lost about 50 \nU.S. soldiers and have 17 missing in action.\n  As I stand here today, our coalition forces are surrounding Baghdad \nand will bring about the demise of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We \nwill help liberate the Iraqi people from deceit and hopelessness and \ntyranny.\n  Mr. Arnett, you need to retire or think about a second career as a \nfiction writer. I understand you are looking for work and that the \nsocialist, anti-American Daily Mirror in the United Kingdom has already \npicked you up.\n  To those news organizations that have already picked up Mr. Arnett, \nand others that may hire him, I have two things to say: One, you have \nevery right to hire him. Two, we have every right to call your news \norganization a joke and a sympathizer to traitors.\n  I believe it is about time we made an example of Mr. Arnett's lies \nand deceit and let the media know we are watching.\n  While we are giving the media top access and protection in this war, \nwe must demand that they not hang out to dry our soldiers and \nAmericans. If they do so, there should be consequences.\n  Some believe freedom of speech is an absolute right and that \njournalists have the right to say and report anything they want. I, and \nmany others, do not believe this. I do not believe journalists should \nbe allowed to lie and opine and aid our enemies in the time of a war.\n  There is a line journalists are not meant to cross, and Mr. Arnett \ncrossed this line many years ago, and he continues to do so. It is time \nwe held this man accountable for his actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4621-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4621-S4623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE SMALL BUSINESS DROUGHT RELIEF ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for voting \nlast night in favor of the Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003. \nTime is of the essence for disaster victims; small businesses across \nthe country have been waiting 8 months for Congress to take action and \nforce the Small Business Administration to comply with the law and open \nits disaster loan program to them. They are frustrated, and \nunderstandably so.\n  You see, the SBA doesn't treat all drought victims the same. The \nagency only helps those small businesses whose income is tied to \nfarming and\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nagriculture. However, farmers and ranchers are not the only small \nbusiness owners whose livelihoods are at risk when drought hits their \ncommunities. The impact can be just as devastating to the owners of \nrafting businesses, marinas, and bait and tackle shops. Sadly, these \nsmall businesses cannot get help through the SBA's disaster loan \nprogram because of something taxpayers hate about government \nbureaucracy.\n  The SBA denies these businesses access to disaster loans because its \nlawyers say drought is not a sudden event and therefore it is not a \ndisaster by definition. However, contrary to the agency's position that \ndrought is not a disaster, as of July 16, 2002, the day this \nlegislation was introduced last year, the SBA had in effect drought \ndisaster declarations in 36 States. That number has grown to 48, \ndemonstrating that problem has gotten worse and even more small \nbusinesses are in need.\n  As I have said time and again, the SBA has the authority to help all \nsmall businesses hurt by drought in declared disaster areas, but the \nagency won't do it. For years the agency has been applying the law \nunfairly, helping some and not others, and it is out of compliance with \nthe law. The Small Business Drought Relief Act of 2003 would force SBA \nto comply with existing law, restoring fairness to an unfair system, \nand get help to small business drought victims that need it.\n  I thank the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, Senator Snowe, for all her work to ensure passage of \nthis bill, as well as our many colleagues who are cosponsors--Senators \nBond, Landrieu, Edwards, Johnson, Bingaman, Levin, Baucus, Daschle, \nHollings, Lieberman, Warner, Crapo, Harkin, Reid, Allen, Bennett, and \nEnzi.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nGovernors who advocated prompt passage of this legislation last year be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 19, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We are deeply concerned that small \n     businesses in states experiencing drought are being \n     devastated by drought conditions that are expected to \n     continue through the end of the summer. We urge you to \n     support legislation that would allow small businesses to \n     protect themselves against the detrimental effects of \n     drought.\n       Much like other natural disasters, the effects of drought \n     on local economies can be crippling. Farmers and farm-related \n     businesses can turn in times of drought to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture. However, non-farm small businesses \n     have nowhere to go, not even the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA), because their disaster loans are not \n     made available for damage due to drought.\n       To remedy this omission, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) \n     introduced the Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) on \n     July 16, 2002, to make SBA disaster loans available to those \n     small businesses debilitated by prolonged drought conditions. \n     This bill was passed by the Senate Small Business Committee \n     just eight days later. Also, the companion legislation (H.R. \n     5197) was introduced by Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) on July 24, \n     2002. Both bills are gaining bipartisan support, and we hope \n     you will cosponsor this important legislation and push for \n     its rapid enactment in the 107th Congress.\n       As 11 southern states are presently experiencing moderate \n     to exceptional drought conditions this summer, we cannot \n     afford to wait to act. We urge you to cosponsor the Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act and push for its consideration as \n     soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama; Gov. Mike Huckabee of \n           Arkansas; Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia; Gov. Paul E. \n           Patton of Kentucky; Gov. M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. of \n           Louisiana; Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland; Gov. \n           Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi; Gov. Bob Holden of \n           Missouri; Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina; \n           Gov.

John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Russell Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business, Russell \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Bond: Much of Nevada and the Nation \n     have been experiencing extreme drought over the past several \n     years. In Nevada we have seen the effects of this situation \n     through catastrophic range and forest fires, insect \n     infestations and loss of crops and livestock.\n       Prolonged drought causes a drastic reduction in stream and \n     river flow levels. This can cause the level of lakes to drop \n     so significantly that existing docks and boat ramps cannot \n     provided access to boats. In the case of range and forest \n     fires we have seen small innkeepers and hunting and fishing \n     related businesses that have their entire season wiped out in \n     a matter of a few hours.\n       Unfortunately for some small businesses, drought assistance \n     is available only for agriculture related small businesses, \n     such as feed and seed stores. For businesses that are based \n     on tourism around lakes and rivers, there is currently no \n     drought assistance available.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) is not currently \n     authorized to help these businesses because a drought is not \n     a sudden occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing \n     natural disaster that causes great damage to these small \n     businesses.\n       I would like to lend my support to S. 2734. The Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act. This bill would amend the \n     guidelines and authorize the SBA to offer assistance to small \n     businesses affected by prolonged drought. With passage of \n     this bill, Governors would be allowed to ask SBA for an \n     administrative declarations of economic injury because of \n     drought. The low interest loans SBA can offer these \n     businesses would allow many of them to weather the drought \n     and remain economically viable for future operation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kenny C. Guinn,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of North Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Raleigh, NC, July 18, 2002.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support for legislation introduced in the Senate to add \n     drought as a condition for which small businesses may apply \n     for Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster \n     Loans.\n       The Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) will \n     correct the current situation facing our small businesses in \n     North Carolina. SBA disaster assistance is not available \n     despite a historic drought that is impacting not just our \n     agriculture sector, but causing real business and revenue \n     losses, which threaten some firms with job layoffs or even \n     bankruptcy.\n       These businesses need help, and access to low-interest SBA \n     loans can offer a lifeline to allow paying bills and making \n     payrolls until business returns to normal.\n       I urge you to push for rapid action on this important \n     enhancement to SBA's ability to help our people through this \n     time of trouble.\n       With kindest regards, I remain\n           Very truly yours,\n     Michael F. Easley.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, July 9, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The State of South Carolina is in its \n     fifth year of drought status, the worst in over fifty years. \n     Some parts of the state are in extreme drought status and the \n     rest is in severe drought status.\n       Ninty-nine percent of our streams are flowing at less than \n     10% of their average flow for this time of year. 60% of those \n     same streams are running at lowest flow on record for this \n     date. The levels of South Carolina's lakes have dropped \n     anywhere from five feet to twenty feet. Some lakes have \n     experienced a drop in water level so significant that tourist \n     and recreational use has diminished.\n       State and national climatologists are not hopeful that we \n     will receive any significant rainfall in the near future. To \n     end our current drought, we would need an extended period of \n     average to above average rainfall.\n       Droughts, particularly prolonged ones such as we are \n     experiencing now, have extensive economic effects. For \n     farmers who experience the economic effects of such a \n     drought, assistance is available through the USDA. For small \n     businesses, assistance is available only for agriculture \n     related small businesses, i.e. feed and seed stores. For \n     businesses that are based on tourism around Lakes and Rivers, \n     there is currently no assistance available.\n       We have reports of lake and river tourism dependent \n     businesses experiencing 17% to 80% declines in revenue. The \n     average decline in revenue is probably near 50% across the \n     board.\n       My staff has contacted Small Business Administration and \n     they are not authorized to offer assistance to these \n     businesses because a drought is not defined as a sudden \n     occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing natural \n     disaster that is causing great economic damage to these small \n     business owners.\n       I am requesting that you assist us in this situation by \n     proposing that the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     Committee take action to at least temporarily amend the SBA \n     authorizing language and allow them to offer assistance to \n     small businesses affected by prolonged drought. This would \n     allow Governors to ask SBA for an administrative declaration \n     of economic injury because of\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\n     drought. The low interest loans SBA can offer these \n     businesses would allow many of them to weather the drought \n     and remain in business for the long run.\n       My staff has also been in contact with Senator Hollings' \n     legislative staff. I hope together, we can find an expedient \n     solution to the plight of these small business owners. Short \n     of finding a way to control the weather, this may be our only \n     option to help their dire situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Hodges.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4623-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 19, \n2001, in Fairhaven, MA. An Arab-American family was harassed and \nassaulted by its neighbors. After being followed and harassed with \nracial slurs, the Arab-American father was attacked with a baseball \nbat. He was treated at a local emergency room. The tires on his son's \ncar were slashed, as well.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4623-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the passing of Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan is a loss for all of us. Pat Moynihan committed his remarkable \nlife to his country: serving four Presidents, representing our Nation \nas Ambassador to India and the United Nations, and representing the \nState of New York as a Senator. His deep intellect and unyielding \ncandor will be missed.\n  As a junior colleague, I was struck by Senator Moynihan's generosity \nwith his time and graciousness of spirit. I had the privilege of \nsitting next to Senator Moynihan on the trip to Rhode Island for the \nfuneral of our colleague the late Senator John Chafee. As we traveled, \nI was out of my depth listening to him discuss different styles of \narchitecture in between offering endearing stories about our departed \ncolleague.\n  Of all his gifts, Pat Moynihan's ability to recognize great issues \nbefore they were commonly observed was his greatest. In public policy, \nhe had an ability to appreciate and make sense of the larger picture \nrarely found in a politician. From the plight of broken families and \ninner cities, to the collapse of the Soviet Union, to the danger of \nethnic conflict in the Balkans, to Social Security reform, Moynihan was \nprophetic. In one of his last public speeches, at last year's Harvard \nCommencement, Moynihan again offered words that carry far more weight \ntoday than when he delivered them less than a year ago:\n\n       Certainly we must not let ourselves be seen as rushing \n     about the world looking for arguments. There are now American \n     armed forces in some 40 countries overseas. Some would say \n     too many. Nor should we let ourselves be seen as ignoring \n     allies, disillusioning friends, thinking only of ourselves in \n     the most narrow terms. That is not how we survived the 20th \n     century. Nor will it serve in the 21st.\n\n  Senator Moynihan's wit and wisdom will be greatly missed. My thoughts \nand prayers go to Liz Moynihan and the Moynihan family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4623-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NORWICH CADETS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recognition and congratulations are in \norder for a school and a group of young men known throughout Vermont \nfor their honor, integrity and prowess on the hockey rink.\n  Norwich University, the nation's oldest private military college, \nsits in the picturesque town of Northfield, VT. It is a quaint college \ntown, and it is a unique college, hosting a mix of military cadets and \nmore traditional college students.\n  The cadets, as their hockey team is known, have a reputation for \nbeing an NCAA Division III hockey powerhouse. It is cold in Northfield \nthis time of year, but a few weeks ago, Norwich University's Kreitzberg \nArena was warmed by a sellout crowd gathered to watch the Cadets \ncapture their second NCAA Division III hockey title in just four years.\n  The Cadets staged a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Oswego State on \nMarch 22 to capture the title. After trailing 1-0 going into the third \nperiod, Norwich was looking at the possibility of being shut out, \nsomething that has not happened to the program in 278 consecutive \ngames, a streak dating back to the 1993-94 season. Junior defensemen \nLou DiMasi, a Vermont native, was quoted by the Burlington Free Press \non the team's third period comeback, saying: ``There was no way we were \ngoing to let it get away.'' Junior defensemen Aaron Lee scored his \nthirteenth goal of the season in the third period to tie the game, and \nsenior team captain Toza Crnilovic notched the game-winning goal for \nthe championship.\n  Norwich coach Mike McShane has built a remarkable record over the \npast 8 years, winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference East \ncrown five times and reaching five ``Frozen Fours.'' Since Mike McShane \nbegan coaching the Cadets, the team has had five 20-win seasons \naccompanied by a long list of individual accomplishments for members of \nCadet teams, including national players of the year and a long list of \nAll-Americans.\n  Following the game, Coach McShane attributed part of the team's \nsuccess to the great support the Cadets have from Norwich and \nNorthfield. ``We've got great support here and that helps a lot. You \nsaw the president and the chairman of the board of trustees out there \nat center ice in the celebration. You don't see that at many schools.''\n  Norwich finished the season with an impressive record of 27-3, and \nmany of the Cadets' stars will be returning next year. And, as surely \nas the sugar rises each year in the maples, Vermonters next year will \nbe closely following the Cadets through another great season. Until \nnext winter, the Cadets have earned the right to bask in the glow of \nknowing they have accomplished another successful season, bought with \nhard work, skill and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4623-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4623-S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       OREGON HEALTH CARE HEROES\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Chance and \nDr. Lisa Steffey as Oregon Health Care Heroes for their willingness to \nsave a deeply needed community health clinic in Oregon's beautiful, \nrural community of La Pine.\n  A hero is someone who sets aside personal interest to act for another \nperson's welfare. That is exactly what Dr. Steffey and her husband did \nwhen they purchased the La Pine Community Clinic in Oregon. Because of \ntheir courage and willingness to take a risk, an Oregon community with \nextremely limited health care resources will continue to have a local \nplace to access health services.\n  Despite warnings that purchasing the community health clinic was a \nsignificant financial risk, the couple forged ahead. Without their \nintervention, the clinic would have closed, leaving many residents \nwithout access to local care. Many of the clinic's clients are Medicaid \nand Medicare patients who would have been forced to travel significant \ndistances to find care had the Steffeys not seen an opportunity.\n  La Pine has been named a Health Professional Shortage Area where many \nresidents do not have access to care. Low Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursements make it difficult for doctors to serve the area, which \nis home to many who rely on these programs for health coverage. But \nwith the Steffeys' dedication, and the temporary help of Central Oregon \nIndependent Health Services, the clinic is now financially stable and \nserving the families of La Pine.\n  Many rural Oregon residents face incredible hurdles accessing health \nservices. The shortage of providers willing to serve in rural areas, \ncombined with the particularly low federal reimbursement levels offered \nto rural providers, has caused an exodus of health services\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nfrom the country. Add this to the large number of uninsured families \nwho live in these communities, and the crisis facing rural health care \ndelivery is clear.\n  Despite numerous efforts to increase reimbursement rates for rural \nhealth services and our ongoing quest to cover the millions of \nuninsured across America, rural people are still hurting. It takes \npeople like the Steffeys, who are willing to make a sacrifice to meet \nthe needs of rural communities today, while we continue to work towards \nsolutions for tomorrow.\n  On March 1, 2003, Dr. and Mr. Steffey took ownership of the La Pine \nCommunity Clinic. I hope that their vision is rewarded with great \nsuccess. I join the many grateful residents of La Pine in naming them \nas Oregon Health Care Heroes and thank them for bringing hope and \nhealing to La Pine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4624-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GEORGETOWN FIRE COMPANY'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to give congratulations \nto one of the great local fire departments in Delaware, the Georgetown \nFire Company, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this month. \nThis anniversary is a tribute to those who had the vision to found the \nfire department and to those volunteers who have carried on this \ntradition all the way through today.\n  We are very lucky in Delaware to have such a rich history of \nvolunteer community fire departments. With the addition of the \nGeorgetown Company, we have had 15 fire companies in our state \ncelebrate 100 years of service. In fact, we have even had 3 companies--\nLewes, Carlisle of Milford, and Good Will of New Castle--celebrate 200 \nyears of service.\n  With such successes though, it is easy to forget the humble \nbeginnings of many of these departments. On April 11, 1903, the town \ncommissioners of Georgetown announced in a town meeting that it would \nbe forming a fire company to bring down the cost of fire insurance. \nBefore the establishment of a fire company, the community had relied on \nso-called bucket brigades and a hand-drawn ladder wagon.\n  When it was founded, there were fourteen charter members of the \nGeorgetown Fire Company and only one piece of fire equipment. Today, \nthere are almost one hundred members of the company and an entire fleet \nof state of the art fire equipment.\n  And as a testament to the unceasing dedication of the volunteers who \nserve in this company and to the respect and veneration it has in the \ncommunity, almost half of the members of the Georgetown Fire Company \nare life members or honorary members. Many members of the company who \nhave served their town as volunteer firefighters for decades never stop \nserving.\n  The Georgetown Fire Company has become an integral part of the \ncommunity it has served. It has saved the lives and the property of \nmany. In the town of Georgetown, everyone knows who the real heros are.\n  It is my privilege to share the company's great history with my \ncolleagues and with our fellow citizens today. We honor the company's \n100th anniversary and the extraordinary commitment that it has never \nstopped showing to its community. Congratulations to all of the \nofficers, members, and friends of the Georgetown Fire Company. It is \nvery well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4624-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMENDING JOHN KOERNER ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE U.S. FISH AND \n                            WILDLIFE SERVICE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Mr. John \nKoerner's long, distinguished career with the United States Fish & \nWildlife Service. John began his career in 1972 in Valentine, NE at \nFort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge. Before he arrived at his \n``dream location'' of Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, he was \nstationed in the South Dakota communities of Madison, Pierre and \nWaubay. John has now managed the Sand Lake NWR for 15 years. This \nrefuge has a wonderful reputation within the refuge system, and that \nreputation reaches far beyond its borders. In 1988, because of its \nimportance to migratory birds, Sand Lake was designated as the 16th \nWetland of International Importance in the United States. This \ndesignation was proposed under John's guidance, and supported by myself \nand U.S. Senator Tom Daschle.\n  During his time in South Dakota, John has been instrumental in \nreaching out to the public he serves through effective outreach and \nenvironmental programs. The annual Eagle Day event held at Sand Lake \nRefuge has grown from one carload of visitors attending the first Eagle \nDay event to well over 1,200 visitors attending in 2002. John has also \nenhanced the youth, education and outreach programs during his time at \nthe refuge.\n  John has been an articulate and outspoken voice on water and \nconservation issues concerning the James River. His coordination \nefforts with local, State and Federal agencies, during major flooding \nevents and day-to-day operations have been an asset to Sand Lake Refuge \nand to the communities and landowners up and down the James River. His \nknowledge of the James River has been very helpful to South Dakota's \ncongressional delegation.\n  John's coordination efforts with all of South Dakota's congressional \noffices have been beneficial to both the FWS and the citizens of South \nDakota.

Mr. President, today I honor and pay tribute to \nUniversity of Kentucky Basketball coach and friend Orlando ``Tubby'' \nSmith. Coach Smith was selected today as the 2003 Naismith College \nBasketball Coach of the Year.\n  Earlier this year, Tubby was also named the Nation's top coach by the \nSporting News, ESPN, and the Basketball Times. Coach Smith led the \nUniversity of Kentucky Wildcats to an outstanding 32-4 record this \nseason, including a NCAA season-high 26 game winning streak. The \nWildcats' winning streak this season was the Nation's longest in seven \nyears.\n  Coach Smith is more than just a basketball coach to his players at \nthe University of Kentucky. He is a skilled teacher of the game of \nbasketball, but he also teaches his players important lessons about \nlife and instills a sense of character in them that allows them to \nexcel both on and off the court.\n  Tubby and his wife Donna are also very active in many communities \nacross Kentucky. Over the past 5 years, they have raised over $1.5 \nmillion for the Tubby Smith Foundation. Through annual auctions, golf \ntournaments and other events, Tubby and Donna have devoted much of \ntheir time and energy to assisting underprivileged children in Kentucky \nthrough their foundation.\n  I am proud to have Coach Smith represent the great Commonwealth of \nKentucky. He is a fantastic basketball coach and a prominent community \nleader. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating \nhim on receiving the 2003 Naismith College Basketball Coach of the Year \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4624-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4624-S4625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY LADY JACKRABBITS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The \nJackrabbits, under head coach Aaron Johnston and assistant coach Laurie \nMelum, won the National Division II Basketball Tournament against \nNorthern Kentucky March 29 in St. Joseph, MO.\n  Coach Johnston's squad went through the 2002-2003 season with a \nschool-record 32 wins against just three losses. The Jackrabbits \nentered the tournament with an impressive 32-3 mark and defeated Cal \nState-Bakersfield and Bentley before rallying to overtake Northern \nKentucky, 65-50, for the first ever women's basketball national title.\n  The team was guided this season by the leadership provided by seniors \nMelissa Pater and Karly Hegge. Joining\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\nthem were Jackrabbit juniors Stacie Cizek and Brenda Davis. All-\ntournament team member and NCAA Division II Elite Eight Most \nOutstanding Player Pater was joined on the all-tournament team by \nfreshman Heather Sieler.\n  As Hegge told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader following the title \nvictory, ``After A.J. [Coach Aaron Johnston] first started coaching, he \nused the phrase, `Don't stop believing.' That's what we tried to do, \nnot stop believing and just keep on going.'' This title reflects that \ndevotion and conviction South Dakota residents pride themselves on.\n  I want to acknowledge Dean Dr. Laurie Nichols, Athletic Director Dr. \nFred Oien, Head Coach Aaron Johnston, Assistant Coach Laurie Melum, and \nGraduate Assistant Sheila Roux for their guidance and support to help \nmake this year's team so successful. I also want to congratulate all of \nthis year's team members: seniors Melissa Pater and Karly Hegge; \njuniors Stacie Cizek and Brenda Davis; sophomores Stephanie Bolden, \nMegan Otte, Brooke Dickmeyer, Dianna Pavek, Shannon Schlager, and \nChristine Gilbert; and freshmen Heather Sieler and Christine Gilbert, \nfor their hard work, dedication and commitment this season.

Mr. President, today I share with my colleagues \nthe story of a 3rd Infantry soldier, and a fellow Georgian, who risked \nhis own life to save a civilian caught in the crossfire in Iraq. The \nfollowing article was printed in the April 1 edition of the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution.\n  Michael Carter wanted to talk about his son, CPT Chris Carter, 31, \nwhose heroic rescue of an Iraqi woman flashed across the newswires \nMonday, but the batteries on his cordless phone were running down.\n  ``I didn't know about it until the phone rang this morning,'' he said \nMonday afternoon, adding that it hadn't stopped ringing since.\n  Constant phone calls kept him from logging on to the Internet and \nreading about Chris, commander of A Company, part of the 3rd Battalion, \n7th Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized).\n  ``I've been so busy with phone calls, I have not had time to download \nit,'' said Carter, 63.\n  He and his wife Shirley, 60, live in Watkinsville, where Chris grew \nup and attended Oconee County High School. On Monday pretty much \neveryone in Watkinsville wanted to call and congratulate the family.\n  Chris was an ROTC student at the University of Georgia and a member \nof the Georgia Army National Guard. He was commissioned as an officer, \ntrained with the 82nd Airborne Division and took the mountain section \nof his wilderness training with the 5th Ranger Training Battalion's \nCamp Merrill, near Dahlonega.\n  Of medium height and a stocky build, Carter loves to hunt, fish, and \nsing Hank Williams, Jr. songs, said his girlfriend, Amanda Cofer, 24, \nan assistant to State Senators Mitch Seabaugh and Dan Moody.\n  Carter distinguished himself Monday when he left his Bradley fighting \nvehicle and dashed out on a bridge during a firefight outside of \nHindiyah, to try to bring an Iraqi woman to safety.\n  An Associated Press account of the rescue began with Carter saying, \n``We've got to get her off that bridge'' and then determining to save \nher.\n  The woman had apparently tried to race across the bridge when the \nAmericans arrived, but was caught in the crossfire.\n  Soldiers who had spotted her through the smoke at first thought she \nwas dead, as was a man sprawled in the dust nearby. But the woman sat \nup and waved for help during breaks in the gunfire.\n  According to AP reporter Chris Tomlinson's account, Carter ``ordered \nhis Bradley armored vehicle to pull forward while he and two men ran \nbehind it. They took cover behind the bridge's iron beams.\n  ``Carter tossed a smoke grenade for more cover and approached the \nwoman, who was crying and pointing toward a wound on her hip. She wore \nthe black chador, common among older women in the countryside. The \nblood soaked through the fabric, streaking the pavement around her.\n  ``Medics placed the woman on a stretcher and into an ambulance; \nCarter stood by, providing cover with his M16A4 rifle. Then she was \ngone, and Monday's battle for this town of 80,000, 50 miles south of \nBaghdad, raged on.''\n  When Carter's girlfriend, Cofer, heard about the rescue, her first \nthought was, ``Get back in the vehicle!'' she said.\n  Cofer and Carter met last October during a victory celebration in \nBuckhead after the Georgia Bulldogs beat the University of Kentucky in \nfootball. ``I knew immediately he was a special person,'' she said. \nCarter was deployed to Kuwait the next month.\n  ``He is the kind of man every parent in America would be glad to have \nas a son,'' said Carter's father, who is retired from the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Though the Carters haven't heard from their son for 3 weeks, they \nkeep up with him through the news.\n  ``We have more current information on him than any other parent in \nthe United States,'' said the father, adding that Carter's vehicle has \nbeen host to an embedded reporter during much of the campaign. ``Every \nday since he's been over there he's been in some newspaper. The next \nbest thing to being able to talk to him personally has been to read the \npapers.''\n  Carter then excused himself to answer the door. Television cameramen \nwere ringing the bell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4625-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4625-S4626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE KIWANIS CLUB OF DEARBORN ON THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR 75TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to \ncongratulate the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn, MI for 75 years of \ndistinguished service addressing the needs of children, seniors, and \nthe disadvantaged throughout the Dearborn community and my home State \nof Michigan.\n  As a member of Kiwanis International, the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn is \npart of a larger organization that holds community service at its core. \nSince its founding in 1915, Kiwanis International has united \nindividuals to respond to the changing needs of their communities. \nKiwanis groups promote awareness of vital issues such as child health \nand development, literacy, substance abuse, and senior care. Kiwanis \nClubs nationwide take practical steps to respond to these concerns \nthrough volunteer service projects and fundraising. Today, the Kiwanis \nfamily includes 500,000 members in over 80 countries.\n  Since 1928, the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn has taken an active role in \nperforming community service. Through their annual ``Peanut Sale'' \nfundraiser, the Kiwanis Club of Dearborn has generated thousands of \ndollars each year for charity organizations. Recipients of the money \nraised at this benefit include Children's Hospital, the Salvation Army, \nthe DeSales School for the Deaf, the Hemophilia Foundation, and the \nSpecial Olympics. This year, the club raised a record $54,000, a sum \nwhich has earned them recognition as a leader in fundraising \ninitiatives. Furthermore, the club can be commended for donating all \nmoneys raised to charity, due to the absence of administrative costs. \nThe Kiwanis Club of Dearborn also produces ``Kiwani Talk,'' a \ntelevision show that informs viewers of services available to the \npublic. In the past 10 years, this program has aired 500 episodes \nrelaying pertinent information to the community. The emergence of two \nadditional clubs, the Outer Drive Kiwanis Club and the East Dearborn \nKiwanis Club, is testament to the commitment of the Kiwanis Club of \nDearborn to continued community service and the appeal of their \nmessage.\n  I am confident that my Senate colleagues will join me in thanking the \nKiwanis Club of Dearborn for their 75 years of service dedicated to \nimproving the lives of many in the Dearborn community. The dedication \nto community\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nservice is an inspiring example of human kindness and selflessness. We \nwish them continued success as they work to make our communities better \nplaces to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4626-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1166.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Votes for \nWomen's History Trail Act today in honor of Women's History Month. I \nrecognize that this is a very difficult time in the history of our \ncountry. Our brave soldiers are putting their lives on the line in a \nwar halfway around the world. At times like this it is important to \nremember our pioneers, the people who fought for equality and liberty \nfor all Americans. Their courage should serve as an inspiration at \ntroubling times like these.\n  The Votes for Women's History Trail Act would create a moving \nmemorial to the women's suffrage movement in upstate New York, home to \nmany of the most notable figures and events in the fight for women's \nsuffrage. The Women's Rights movement began in 1848 when the first \nWomen's Rights Convention occurred in Seneca Falls, NY. Although this \nconvention was planned on very short notice, more than 300 people \ndescended on Seneca Falls to challenge the subordination of women to \nmen and call for equal rights.\n  After the Seneca Falls convention, the women's movement, lead in \nlarge part by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, continued \ntheir efforts to break down barriers for women. At times, they suffered \nmajor setbacks. Susan B. Anthony was arrested when she tried to vote by \nclaiming that the 14th amendment entitled her to as a ``citizen.'' In \n1875, the United States Supreme Court upheld the decision, forcing the \nwomen's movement to pursue a different strategy. They were undeterred \nand launched statewide campaigns for voting rights for women. Their \nefforts eventually paved the way for the passage of the 19th amendment \nin 1920--72 years after the first Women's Rights Convention.\n  These pioneers believed that women ought to be full and equal \npartners in the social, cultural, religious, economic, educational, and \npolitical life. To a large degree, their vision has been realized. But \nthe journey is not complete. Women still earn only $.73 for every \ndollar earned by men. They are still underrepresented in the highest \nlevels of virtually every occupation and field, including the United \nStates Congress.\n  The Votes for Women's History Trail Act would create a fitting \ntribute to this critical period in our history and to the people whose \nstrength and clarity of vision led us through the journey. For young \nchildren and older Americans alike, it would serve as an important \nreminder of how very far we have come.\n  The National Park Service has already conducted a feasibility study \nabout this trail. Their study concluded that the Votes for Women's \nHistory Trail is of historical value, national significance, and \npossesses significant potential for public use and enjoyment. The study \nexamined over 300 properties and narrowed the list to the 20 of the \nmost significant and easily accessible to the public.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill on behalf of Senators Schumer, \nFeinstein, Landrieu, Cantwell, and Murray, and Stabenow. I look forward \nto working with them and so many of my other colleagues to make the \nVotes for Women's History Trail a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Allen, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Mr. Smith, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 750. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the level of earnings under which no individual who is blind \nis determined to have demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial \ngainful activity for purposes of determining disability; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation, which will have a tremendous impact on the lives \nof blind people throughout the country. In 1996, with the passage of \nthe Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, Congress broke the historic \n20-year link between blind people and senior citizens in regards to the \nSocial Security earnings. Previously, that linkage to earnings limits \nhelped many blind people become self-sufficient and productive members \nof society.\n  The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act raised the earnings limit for \nseniors, without giving blind people the same opportunity. My intent \nwhen I sponsored that legislation was not to break the link between \nblind people and the senior population. Since then, I have worked with \na bipartisan group of senators, in the spirit of fairness, to ensure \nthat the blind population receives a raise in earnings limits, similar \nto that afforded to seniors under the 1996 Act. We must not continue \npolicies which discourage blind individuals from working and \ncontributing to our nation. I believe we should provide blind people \nwith the opportunity to be productive and ``make it'' on their own.\n  Today I am joined by my good friend Senator Dodd, and a bipartisan \ngroup of senators, in introducing the Blind Empowerment Act of 2003. \nThis bill is\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nsimilar in purpose to the Blind Person's Earnings Equity Act, which I \nsponsored in previous Congresses. Over a five year period of time, the \nBlind Empowerment Act raises the earnings exemption for blind persons \nto afford them with greater flexibility to achieve their professional \nand personal goals, without sacrificing Social Security benefits.\n  The earnings test treatment of our blind and senior populations \nhistorically has been identical. From 1977, blind persons and senior \ncitizens shared the identical earnings exemption threshold under Title \nII of the Social Security Act. The earnings limit for the blind is \ncurrently $1,330 a month for fiscal year (FY) 2003, had the link not \nbeen broken in the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, it would be \n$2,560 today. Senior citizens are now given unlimited opportunity to \nincrease their earnings without losing a portion of their Social \nSecurity benefits. The blind, however, have been left behind.\n  The Social Security earnings test imposes as great a work \ndisincentive for blind people as it once did for senior citizens. In \nfact, the earnings test probably provides a greater aggregate \ndisincentive for blind individuals because many blind beneficiaries are \nof working age and are capable of valuable and productive work.\n  Blindness is often associated with adverse social and economic \nconsequences. Many blind individuals who desperately want to work \nencounter enormous obstacles to achieve sustained employment or any \nemployment at all. They take great pride in being able to work and \ncontribute to society. By linking the blind with seniors in 1977, \nCongress provided a great deal of hope and an incentive for blind \npeople to enter the work force. By not allowing blind individuals the \nopportunity to increase their earnings, as we have for senior citizens, \nwe are now taking that hope away from them.\n  Blind people are likely to respond favorably to an increase in the \nearnings test by working more, which will increase their tax payments \nand purchasing power allowing the blind to make a greater contribution \nto the general economy. In addition, encouraging blind individuals to \nwork and allowing them to work more without being penalized would bring \nadditional revenue into the Social Security trust funds as well as the \nfederal Treasury.\n  I hope that this Congress will finally address issues regarding the \noverall structure of the Social Security system and work towards \nsolutions that will strengthen the system for seniors of today and \ntomorrow without placing an unfair burden on working Americans. It is \nabsolutely crucial that we include raising the earnings test for blind \nindividuals as a part of any Social Security bill we enact this year.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring the Blind \nEmpowerment Act of 2003, to restore fair and equitable treatment for \nour blind citizens and to give the blind community increased financial \nindependence. Our Nation would be better served if we restore hope for \nthe blind and provide them with the freedom, opportunities and fairness \nafforded to our Nation's seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Blind Empowerment Act of \n2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The Act may be cited as the ``Blind Empowerment Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN AMOUNT DEMONSTRATING SUBSTANTIAL GAINFUL \n                   ACTIVITY IN THE CASE OF BLIND INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       Section 223(d)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     423(d)(4)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the second sentence of subparagraph (A); \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C)(i) No individual who is blind shall be regarded as \n     having demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial \n     gainful activity on the basis of monthly earnings in any \n     taxable year that do not exceed an amount equal to--\n       ``(I) in the case of earnings in the taxable year beginning \n     after December 31, 2002, and before January 1, 2004, $1,330 \n     per month;\n       ``(II) in the case of earnings in the taxable year \n     beginning after December 31, 2003, and before January 1, \n     2005, $1,720 per month;\n       ``(III) in the case of earnings in the taxable year \n     beginning after December 31, 2004, and before January 1, \n     2006, $2,110 per month;\n       ``(IV) in the case of earnings in the taxable year \n     beginning after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, \n     2007, $2,500 per month; and\n       ``(V) in the case of earnings in taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2006, the dollar amount determined for \n     purposes of this clause under clause (ii).\n       ``(ii) The Commissioner of Social Security shall, on or \n     before November 1 of 2006 and of every year thereafter, \n     determine and publish in the Federal Register the monthly \n     dollar amount for purposes of clause (i) in the case of \n     taxable years beginning with or during the succeeding \n     calendar year.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator John McCain, to reintroduce legislation that we've sponsored in \nthe past, the ``Blind Empowerment Act of 2003.'' This legislation would \nrestore the 20-year link between blind people and senior citizens with \nrespect to the Social Security earnings limit. It will have a \ntremendous impact on the lives of many blind people, helping them \nbecome more self-sufficient and productive members of society.\n  Today there are nearly 1.1 million Americans who are blind, with \n75,000 more becoming blind each year. With today's technology, blind \nand visually-impaired individuals can do just about anything. Blind \npeople today are employed as farmers, lawyers, secretaries, nurses, \nmanagers, childcare workers, social workers, teachers, librarians, \nstockbrokers, accountants, and journalists, among many other things. \nThe Federal Government should do all within its power to facilitate and \nencourage the blind and visually-impaired to enter the workforce. Many \npublic and private initiatives provide the technical advancement \nnecessary to educate and employ the blind at the same level as their \nsighted peers. For example, the National Federation of the Blind, NFB, \nhas created an institute to utilize technological advancements for the \nblind in an effort to promote employment of the blind throughout the \nnation. The NFB helps employers provide adaptive technology, \nconsultation, and training so that they can better accommodate the \nneeds of blind and visually-impaired employees.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, \nwhich broke the longstanding linkage between the treatment of blind \npeople and seniors under Social Security. This allowed the earnings \nlimit to be raised for seniors, but not for the blind. As a result, \nblind people do not have the opportunity to increase their earnings \nwithout jeopardizing their Social Security benefits. In 2002, that \nlimit was at $14,800. If a blind individual earns more than that, his \nor her Social Security benefits are not protected.\n  The purpose of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act was to allow \nseniors to continue contributing to society as productive workers while \nstill receiving social security benefits. Historically, the earnings \ntest treatment of seniors and blind people has been identical under \nTitle II of the Social Security Act. With this legislation, we must do \nthe same for the blind population of America as we have done for the \nseniors. We must provide blind people the same opportunity to be \nproductive and contribute to their own stability. We must not \ndiscourage these individuals from working.\n  The current earnings test provides a disincentive for the blind \npopulation, many of whom are working age and capable of productive \nwork. Work provides one of the fundamental ways individuals express \ntheir talents and allow them to make a contribution to society and to \ntheir loved ones. Blind individuals face constant hurdles when it comes \nto employment. Parents,\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nteachers, or counselors may tell them they can't do it. Employers \nsometimes don't even give them the opportunity to try. But blind people \nand others with severe visual impairments take great pride in being \nable to work, just like the rest of us. They are likely to respond \nfavorably to an increase in the earnings test because they want to \nwork. We don't want to create yet another hurdle to employment for \nblind individuals with the Social Security earnings test. By allowing \nthose with visual impairments to work more without penalty, we would \nincrease both their tax contribution and their purchasing power. By \ndoing so we would also bring additional funds into the Social Security \ntrust fund and the Federal Treasury.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation to restore the fair and equal treatment for the blind \ncitizens of America. The ``Blind Empowerment Act of 2003'' will provide \nthe blind population with the same freedom and opportunities as our \nNation's seniors and the rest of the citizens of this nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 751. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto reauthorize and improve the operation of temporary assistance to \nneedy families programs operated by Indian tribes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am re-introducing the American \nIndian Welfare Reform Act, an important step in improving the lives of \nthis country's Native Americans. I originally introduced this bill last \nyear and worked to include important elements of it in the welfare \nreform reauthorization bill approved by the Finance Committee. \nUnfortunately, we did not finish work on welfare reform \nreauthorization. So I am again offering this bill, with some \nimprovements based on advice from tribes and other experts. I am glad \nto be joined by Senators Daschle, Johnson, Campbell, Bingaman, Inouye, \nand Akaka.\n  In 1996 we enacted a sweeping welfare reform law. It was a long past-\ndue fundamental change and ended a failed system for helping low-income \nfamilies in America. I was a strong supporter of that law. This year, \nwe continue to work to reauthorize it. As we in the Finance Committee \nhave reviewed the evidence I have been struck by how successful it has \nbeen. The ranks of those dependent on welfare in this country has been \nreduced by half in just five years. There is more to be done, of \ncourse. Child poverty has declined but not by as much as the fall in \nthe welfare caseload, for example. I plan to work with my Finance \nCommittee colleague Senator Grassley on comprehensive legislation to \nrenew and improve the 1996 law.\n  One often overlooked important aspect of the 1996 law is that it \ndidn't just devolve authority to States--it also permitted Indian \ntribes to operate their own welfare programs for the first time. The \nnew welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, is \nvery flexible. Tribes can take advantage of that flexibility to design \nculturally-appropriate programs to move people from welfare to work. \nThis is smart policy and is consistent with the important value of \ntribal sovereignty. I support it.\n  My own State of Montana is home to several tribes and I have given \nmuch thought to how we can build upon the provisions of the 1996 \nwelfare law to help them and their members. Too often in Montana--and \nelsewhere--poverty has an Indian face. The numbers are cold and hard. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, 25.9 percent of American Indians live \nin poverty, more than twice the national poverty rate. The average \nhousehold income for Indians in 2000 was only 75 percent of that of the \nrest of Americans. This is simply not right. We must do better. Welfare \nreform needs to work for everyone.\n  Luckily, the provisions of the 1996 law provide a good start. Now we \nmust build upon them. The legislation I introduce today, the product of \nextensive dialogue and consultation, does that in several important \nways.\n  First, more than 30 tribes--including the Confederated Salish-\nKootenai and Fort Belknap tribes of Montana--have taken advantage of \nthe opportunity to operate their own TANF programs. This bill contains \nprovisions to help those tribes improve their programs. For example, \nunder current law, tribes operating TANF are not eligible for the TANF \nhigh performance bonus or the TANF contingency fund while state TANF \nprograms are. This oversight is rectified by this bill.\n  Second, there are many tribes interested in operating TANF programs \nwho do not believe the current set-up allows them to do so. They want \nto exercise their sovereignty and adapt their program to better fit the \nneeds of their people. We should help them do so. To that end, I \npropose creating a new grant fund to improve tribal governmental \ncapacity. We have funded State administrative capacity for decades, \nhelping States buy computer systems and train workers. We should do the \nsame for tribal human services administration. Under this bill, a tribe \nwhich wants to operate TANF but needs to upgrade its computers to do it \ncould receive the funding it needs--which will enable it to take over \nTANF.\n  Third, there are some tribes not interested in running a TANF program \nor a long time from being able to do it. Their low-income families will \ncontinue to receive assistance from State programs. I have included \nprovisions to facilitate State-tribe dialogue in these cases so that \nthe state can better understand the unique circumstances of each Indian \nreservation. There is also an important provision to allow States the \nsame flexibility in designing welfare-to-work programs on high \nunemployment reservations that tribes gain when they operate TANF \nprograms. We must ensure all Indian families are able to get help when \nthey need it.\n  Finally, there is the all-important issue of economic development. A \nGeneral Accounting Office review of Census Bureau data found that 25 of \nthe 26 counties in the U.S. with a majority of American Indians had \npoverty rates ``significantly'' higher than average. Welfare reform is \nabout moving people to work. On most of our Indian reservations there \nis simply far too little work to be had. Like everyone else, Indians \nwant to work. We need to do better in giving them the opportunity.\n  This legislation provides tribes with an expanded authority to issue \nbonds, which will encourage additional economic activity on \nreservations, such as housing construction. This means more jobs, as \nwell as a better quality of life. It also includes grants to help \ntribes improve their own economic development strategies. Tribes with \nuniform commercial codes and effective micro-enterprise programs can \nsee more business activity on their lands. This bill helps tribes helps \nthemselves. We need to let Indians find their own way to prosperity, \nnot impose top-down strategies. But we must make sure they have the \ntools to get there.\n  This is an important bill. It includes other key provisions. One is a \nfine bill originally introduced by Senators Daschle and McCain to allow \ntribes to receive direct Federal reimbursement for operating foster \ncare programs. Another provision funds research on tribal welfare \nreform programs so we can learn what works as well as providing funds \nfor ``peer-learning'' so that tribes can learn from one another. I am a \nstrong supporter of welfare reform. We need to make sure it works for \neveryone. This bill does that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary of the American Indian Welfare Reform Act\n\n\n                              1. Findings\n\n       The Federal Government bears a unique trust responsibility \n     for American Indians. Despite this responsibility, Indians \n     remain remarkably impoverished. According to the Census \n     Bureau, 25.9 percent of American Indians live in poverty, \n     more than twice the national poverty rate. The average \n     household income for Indians in 2000 was only 75 percent of \n     that of the rest of Americans. In some states with \n     substantial Indian populations the welfare caseload has \n     become increasingly Indian because some Indians face \n     substantial barriers in moving from welfare to work. A \n     General Accounting Office review of Census Bureau data found \n     that 25 of the 26 counties in the U.S. with a majority of \n     American Indians had poverty rates ``significantly'' higher \n     than average. Further, many Indian tribes are located in \n     isolated rural areas, far from economic opportunity. Tribal\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, programs have \n     demonstrated remarkable success in moving Indians from \n     welfare to work. Tribal governments have not been afforded \n     equal opportunity to administer foster care and adoption \n     assistance programs. Welfare reform has not brought enough \n     change to Indian Country.\n\n\n                  2. The Tribal TANF Improvement Fund\n\n       The 1996 welfare reform law permits tribes to opt to \n     operate their own Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, \n     TANF, programs. A new Tribal TANF Improvement Fund of $500 \n     million, to be available for 5 years, would be created to \n     build upon these programs and allow more tribes to start \n     them. It would have four parts:\n       Tribal Capacity Grants. State governments have benefitted \n     from decades of federal investment in their administrative \n     capacity, particularly in their information management \n     systems. $185 million of the Fund would be reserved for \n     grants to improve tribal human services program \n     infrastructure, with a priority for management information \n     systems and training. Tribes applying to operate TANF would \n     be given priority. Tribes already operating TANF, applying to \n     operate IV-E foster care programs with direct federal \n     funding, and operating the new consolidated tribal job \n     training program would also be eligible for grants. HHS would \n     be required to assure that tribes of all sizes received \n     funding and to maximize the number of tribes which receive \n     funding. Tribes would be eligible for one grant per year.\n       Adjusted Tribal TANF Grants. Tribes which take over \n     operation of TANF often experience significant increases in \n     caseload as poor families apply for help for the first time \n     because they are more comfortable asking assistance from the \n     tribe or simply because they are more able to access \n     services. Yet tribal TANF allocations are based on estimates \n     of Indians served by state programs in 1994, which can \n     leave the tribe facing funding levels which are too low. \n     To better support families in tribal TANF programs, $140 \n     million of the fund would be reserved for grants to tribal \n     TANF programs where the tribe can demonstrate it has a \n     significantly higher true caseload than originally \n     estimated. Tribes with cash assistance caseloads two years \n     after beginning operation of a TANF program which are 20 \n     percent higher than originally estimated would be eligible \n     for additional funding. The funds would be allocated \n     proportionate to a tribe's size and service population as \n     well as the caseload increase, on the basis of a formula \n     to be determined by HHS in consultation, by region, with \n     tribes. The funding level would be $35 million per year, \n     from FY 2004-2007.\n       Tribal TANF MOE Incentive. A key factor in tribes being \n     able to operate TANF programs has been the willingness and \n     ability of states to contribute funding as part of the \n     broader state maintenance of effort, MOE, requirement. To \n     encourage states to do this, up to an additional $160 million \n     would be available for ``rebates'' of TANF funds to states \n     which provide MOE support to tribal TANF programs. For each \n     $1 in MOE funds provided, the federal government would \n     provide an additional 50 cents in TANF funding to the state. \n     If funding is insufficient, HHS would provide pro-rata \n     funding to ensure each state contributing MOE receives a \n     share of the incentive funds.\n       Technical Assistance. HHS would receive $15 million to \n     provide technical assistance to tribes. At least $5 million \n     of these funds would be reserved to support peer-learning \n     programs among tribal administrators and at least $5 million \n     would be reserved for grants to tribes to conduct feasibility \n     studies of their capacity to operate TANF.\n\n\n  III. Tribal TANF High Performance Bonus and Contingency Fund Access\n\n       There are separate sources of funding within TANF that \n     tribes do not have the ability to access. To better support \n     tribal TANF programs, 3 percent of the current TANF ``high \n     performance'' bonus--or $6 million/year--would be reserved \n     for distribution to tribal TANF programs. The criteria would \n     be determined by HHS through consultation with tribes, but \n     should involve effectiveness in moving TANF recipients into \n     employment and self-sufficiency. In addition, $50 million of \n     the $2 billion TANF Contingency fund would be reserved for \n     tribal TANF programs operating in situations of increased \n     economic hardship. The criteria for tribal access to the \n     Contingency Fund would also be determined by HHS through \n     consultation with the tribes, but would include a worsening \n     economic condition, loss of reservation employers, or a loss \n     of state match funding. In addition, current restrictions on \n     the use of ``carryover'' TANF funds would be eliminated, \n     permitting tribes to spend prior year TANF funds with just as \n     much flexibility as current year TANF funds.\n\n\n                        IV. Economic Development\n\n       There are four elements in the bill to stimulate more \n     economic activity on economically-depressed reservations.\n       Expanded tribal authority to issue tax-exempt private \n     activity bonds. Currently, tribes have a limited authority to \n     issue private activity bonds for ``essential'' governmental \n     functions and for certain manufacturing-related purposes. \n     This provision would allow bonds to be used for residential \n     rental properties and qualified mortgage bonds, spurring \n     construction. In addition, tribes could allocate authority \n     for financing businesses that would qualify as enterprise \n     zone businesses if the reservation were a zone. All property \n     financed would have to be on the reservation of the issuing \n     tribal government and qualified tribal governments would have \n     to have an unemployment rate of at least 20 percent. Casinos \n     and certain other forms of businesses could not be financed \n     by the bonds. The authority would be for calendar years 2004-\n     2008, and up to $10 million total would be available for each \n     qualifying tribe.\n       Tribal Development Grants. A key part of tribal economic \n     development is the investment climate on the reservation. \n     Tribes with clear legal codes and which encourage micro-\n     enterprise activities are more likely to generate economic \n     growth. To facilitate this, the Administration for Native \n     Americans within HHS would receive $50 million to distribute \n     in grants to tribes, tribal organizations and non-profit \n     organizations to provide technical assistance to tribes in \n     the areas of: Development and improvement of uniform \n     commercial codes; creating or expanding small business or \n     micro-enterprise programs; development and improvement of \n     tort liability codes; creating or expanding tribal marketing \n     efforts; for-profit collaborative business networks; and \n     telecommunications.\n       Job Access and Reverse Commute Grants. A lack of \n     transportation often hinders tribal economic development. To \n     help address this need, tribes would be made directly \n     eligible to receive Job Access and Reverse Commute grants \n     from the federal Department of Transportation, which would \n     permit tribes to pursue innovative TANF strategies around \n     transportation. A tribal set-aside of 3 percent would be \n     established in the program. Matching funds could be provided \n     by tribes on an in-kind basis or with other federal funds, \n     such as TANF.\n       Transportation Grants. A lack of transportation also often \n     hinders individual Indians from moving from welfare-to-work. \n     This need is particularly acute given the remote nature of \n     many reservations. To assist Indians in acquiring reliable \n     automobiles, a $10 million per year grant program would be \n     created, beginning in FY 2004. Tribes would be given priority \n     in receiving grants to create car ownership assistance \n     programs. This program is based on a proposal originally put \n     forward by Senator Jeffords.\n\n\n                    V. Tribal Job Training Programs\n\n       There are currently two tribal job training programs, the \n     NEW program and Welfare-to-Work grantees. To simplify and \n     better co-ordinate programs, a new Tribal Employment Services \n     Program, TESP, would be created in the Department of Labor by \n     combining the two programs. It would be funded at $37 million \n     annually and distributed to current Tribal NEW and Welfare-\n     to-Work grantees as well as new applicants. TESP funds could \n     be used for employment training efforts for those on, or at-\n     risk of being on, public assistance. Tribes could also use \n     the funds to assist non-custodial parents of children on, or \n     at risk of being on, public assistance. To encourage state-\n     tribal partnerships, TANF funds transferred to tribal TESP \n     programs would be governed by TESP rules, not TANF rules. The \n     bill also clarifies that the single plan, single budget, and \n     single reporting requirements of PL 102-477 should be \n     respected.\n\n\n                         VI. Tribal Child Care\n\n       The availability and quality of child care is basic to the \n     success of welfare reform. Tribal welfare reform efforts are \n     no exception. The tribal set-aside within the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant, CCDBG, would be increased to 5 \n     percent to better support tribal welfare reform programs. HHS \n     would be required to go through a negotiated rulemaking \n     process, in consultation with tribal representatives, to \n     determine an equitable allocation of the base funding among \n     tribes. In addition, each tribe receiving CCDBG funding would \n     develop their own health and safety standards, subject to \n     approval of HHS. Tribal child care programs would have \n     additional authority to use funds for construction and \n     renovation.\n\n\n                       VII. ``Equitable Access''\n\n       Many American Indians are--and will continue to be--served \n     by state TANF programs. States will be required to consult \n     with tribes within their borders on TANF state plans. Under \n     current law, states are required to provide ``equitable \n     access'' to services for Indians. State and tribal TANF plans \n     would be required to describe how ``equitable access'' is \n     provided to encourage better State-tribal co-operation. HHS \n     would also be required to include in the annual TANF report \n     to Congress state-specific information on the demographics \n     and caseload characteristics of Indians served by state TANF \n     programs.\n       In addition, HHS would be required to convene a new \n     advisory committee on the status of non-reservation Indians. \n     Too little is known about how these Indians are faring. The \n     committee is to make recommendations for ensuring these \n     Indians receive appropriate assistance. The committee would \n     include federal, state, and tribal representatives as well as \n     representatives of Indians not residing on reservations. A \n     majority of those on the committee would be representatives \n     of Indians not residing on reservations. GAO would also be \n     required to conduct a study of the demographics of Indians \n     not residing on reservations, including economic and health \n     information, as well as reviewing their access to public \n     benefits.\n\n\n                         VIII. ``Joblessness''\n\n       As acknowledged by the 1996 welfare law, the federal time \n     limit on assistance is not an appropriate policy on Indian \n     reservations with severe unemployment. This provision\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\n     would be adjusted so that the time limit will not apply \n     during months where the joblessness is above 20 percent, \n     provided that TANF recipients are not in sanction status. In \n     addition, in these areas of high joblessness, states would \n     have flexibility to define work activities required for TANF \n     participants, provided the recipient is participating in \n     activities in accordance with an Individual Responsibility \n     Plan and the state has included information in its state plan \n     describing its policies in Indian Country areas of high \n     joblessness, Tribal TANF programs already have flexibility in \n     work activity definition.\n\n\n                         IX. Alaska provisions\n\n       The 1996 limits the ability of tribes in Alaska to design \n     and operate programs. These provisions involving differential \n     treatment for Alaskan Natives, such as those requiring tribal \n     TANF programs to be ``comparable'' to the state program, \n     would be removed.\n\n\n                     X. Tribal Foster Care Programs\n\n       Due to a long-standing oversight, tribes are not allowed to \n     receive direct federal reimbursement when they operate foster \n     care programs to take care of abused and neglected children. \n     The provisions of S. 331, the Daschle-McCain legislation to \n     rectify this oversight and allow tribes to receive direct \n     federal funding to operate foster care programs, are \n     included.\n\n\n                  XI. Food Stamps, Medicaid, and SCHIP\n\n       Up to 10 tribes operating TANF programs could receive \n     waivers to perform eligibility determinations and/or operate \n     Food Stamps, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program, SCHIP, as well. Matching requirements \n     could be waived but not program integrity requirements. In \n     addition, the programs would remain consistent with state \n     rules. However, tribes would be able to demonstrate their \n     ability to operate these programs and to serve low-income \n     Indian families better.\n\n\n                     XII. Child Support Enforcement\n\n       HHS would be required to promulgate final regulations \n     concerning tribal child support programs within one year of \n     enactment. In addition, HHS would be required to submit a \n     report to Congress on the most appropriate ways of including \n     tribal programs in the methodology of determining child \n     support incentive payments.\n\n\n            XIII. ``Break the Cycle'' Demonstration Program\n\n       Inter-generational poverty is a frequent occurrence on \n     Indian reservations. In an effort to reach the children of \n     TANF recipients, a ``Break the Cycle'' demonstration program \n     would be created. Up to 10 tribes would receive grants to \n     develop programs aimed at ensuring children of TANF \n     recipients complete high school or receive G.E.D.s. The \n     tribes would submit proposals involving mentoring, tutoring, \n     altering TANF rules, or teen pregnancy prevention towards \n     this goal, and could collaborate with States. It would be \n     authorized at $20 million per year for FY 2005-2008.\n\n\n                XIV. Social Services Block Grant (SSBG)\n\n       SSBG is an important source of flexible funding to address \n     the needs of the elderly, disabled, and low-income families. \n     But tribes do not currently receive SSBG funds. Under this \n     bill, when funding for SSBG exceeds $2.4 billion in a year, \n     $10 million plus 2 percent of all funds beyond $2.4 billion \n     is reserved for tribes. All tribes operating social service \n     programs would be eligible for a share. HHS is required to \n     develop a distribution formula through a consultation process \n     with the tribes.\n\n\n                              XV. Research\n\n       While there have been a handful of important initial \n     studies of welfare reform in Indian Country, much remains \n     unknown about how it has impacted Native Americans. \n     Therefore, $2 million would be provided to HHS for research \n     on tribal welfare programs and efforts to reduce poverty \n     among American Indians in general. These funds could also be \n     used to assist tribes in collecting data. To expend the \n     funds, HHS would first have to issue a planned course of \n     research and consultation with the tribes. Research funding \n     applicants which propose to include tribal governments and \n     tribal colleges in their work would have priority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 752. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ndistributions from publicly traded partnerships as qualifying income of \nregulated investment companies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison to introduce legislation that will allow \npublicly traded partnerships to sell their stock to mutual funds so \nthey can raise sufficient capital for new investments in pipelines and \ninfrastructure. Because of current restrictions, publicly traded \npartnerships are hindered in their ability to sell their equity to \nmutual funds even though their equity is sold on public exchanges. The \noverwhelming majority of these partnerships are energy-related \ncompanies that need the ability to raise capital from mutual funds to \nbuild pipelines and other facilities. This legislation would be a \nstrong shot in the arm for the economy as it encourages companies to \nbegin new projects that are currently on hold for lack of capital. It \nalso provides us with the ability to expand our pipeline network to \nmeet our current demands for natural gas. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to advance this important legislation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill with \nSenator Bingaman that takes an important step toward modernizing the \nInternal Revenue Code.\n  Decades ago, investment companies which manage mutual funds were \nlimited in the amount of income they could receive from investments in \npartnerships.\n  At the time, this restriction was established to address legitimate \nconcerns and protect the interests of investors. Ownership interests in \npartnerships can be illiquid, so it is difficult to get one's money out \nof the investment. Partnerships are also not required to be transparent \nin their financial statements, so it could be difficult for investors \nto accurately assess a business\n  However, the world has changed. Some partnerships have been able to \ngo public and offer shares on the stock markets, so the problem of \nliquidity is solved. By going public, they must meet much higher \nstandards of financial transparency, including regularly publishing \naudited financial statements for investors. Currently, 50 publicly \ntraded partnerships trade on major U.S. stock exchanges; 14 of these \ncompanies are headquartered in my home State, Texas.\n  Unfortunately, tax laws have not reflected this change in the \nbusiness and financial worlds. Mutual funds are still restricted in how \nmuch they can invest in any partnership, including those that are \npublicly traded. This significantly impedes the ability of these \ncompanies to raise capital. It limits their ability to grow and create \njobs.\n  Publicly traded partnerships play an important role in the economy. \nAbout half are in the energy sector, actively involved in building and \noperating infrastructure to gather, process and transport oil and \nnatural gas. These partnerships also include timber and real estate \ncompanies. It is clear we need a healthy energy sector to ensure the \navailability of oil and gas at reasonable prices.\n  The bill Senator Bingaman and I introduce today will lead to a \ndramatic increase in the flow of capital to these companies. Mutual \nfunds, which often purchase a majority of equity offerings, will be \nable to participate in stock offerings from publicly traded \npartnerships. This will expand the investor base and lower the cost of \ncapital, ultimately helping to lower energy prices.\n  Our bill will also provide millions of investors an opportunity, \nthrough their mutual funds, to participate in another investment \nopportunity if their professional mutual fund managers believe it is an \nattractive investment.\n  It is wrong for the Federal Government to use the tax code to make \ndecisions for investors. The bill we are introducing will modernize our \ntax laws so families can make their own financial planning decisions. \nThis legislation will also provide an important source of capital for \nkey areas of the economy. I hope my colleagues will support this long \noverdue improvement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Grassley):\n  S. 753. A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the modernization of the United States Tax Court, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tax Court \nModernization Act. I am joined in this legislation by my colleague \nSenator Breaux, and by the Chairman and Ranking Democrat of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus.\n  The United States Tax Court plays an important role in our tax \nsystem. However, it has been years since Congress has taken a good hard \nlook at the Tax Court. This bipartisan piece of legislation will \nimprove this Court in a number of ways, and I would like to take a \nmoment to summarize some of its provisions.\n  First, the TCMA would make minor changes in the Tax Court's \njurisdiction. These are small changes that will\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nhave a big impact on the Court's efficiency. For example, the bill \nwould allow the Tax Court to hire employees on its own, just as other \ncourts do. Currently, the Tax Court is forced to hire through the \nExecutive Branch's Office of Personnel Management, entangling the \nexecutive power with the judicial power. Restoring the constitutional \nseparation of powers in the hiring process will increase the \nindependence of the Tax Court.\n  Second, the TCMA would improve the way that Tax Court judges receive \nretirement benefits and other non-salary benefits. I believe that Tax \nCourt judges should be treated the same way that bankruptcy, Court of \nFederal Claims, and Article III judges are treated when it comes to \nfringe benefits.\n  Tax Court judges are often not provided with the same benefits as \nsimilarly appointed Article I and Article III judges. For example, \nCongress allows Article III, bankruptcy, and Court of Federal Claims \njudges to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan in addition to the \nCivil Service Retirement System, while Tax Court judges are ineligible \nto participate in this program. These disparities in the treatment of \nour Tax Court judges affect the Court's ability to attract and retain \nseasoned judges, as well as talented employees.\n  I have spent many years observing the Federal judiciary. I have spent \nmany years trying to improve the Judicial Branch of our government and \nto make it the very finest court system the world has ever known. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues, \nboth on the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole, to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Tax Court \nModernization Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  In 1969, Congress elevated the U.S. Tax Court as a Federal court of \nrecord under Article I of the Constitution of the United States.\n  Congress created the Tax Court to provide a judicial forum in which \naffected persons could dispute tax deficiencies determined by the \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service prior to payment of the \ndisputed amounts. That means that the Tax Court's jurisdictional \nrequirements are, in part, a recognition that lower and middle income \ntaxpayers cannot necessarily pay the tax deficiency before taking their \ndispute to court.\n  Congress also closely linked the legislation governing the Tax Court \nwith the laws governing the Article III District Courts. Unfortunately, \nthe Congress did not include the Tax Court in the changes made for \nArticle III courts.\n  This legislation is designed to restore parity between the Tax Court \nand Article III courts, and to modernize their personnel and pension \nsystems.\n  I also want to thank Senators Breaux and Hatch for their efforts in \nmoving this legislation forward. The Finance Committee intends to \nmarkup the Tax Court Modernization Act tomorrow. It is my hope that the \nCommittee favorably reports the legislation. I also hope that, soon \nafter Committee action, Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader \nDaschle bring the Tax Court Modernization Act to the floor for swift \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Rockfeller):\n  S. 755. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na uniform definition of child, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I are taking a \nsignificant step forward in our efforts to simplify the tax code. \nToday, we are introducing an important simplification legislation--the \nUniform Definition of Child Act.\n  This legislation is based on the support of many for simplification \nin this area of the tax law. The President's FY 2004 budget, which was \nreleased on April 15, 2002, includes a simplification proposal to \nprovide a uniform definition of a qualifying child. This is the first \nin a series of Department of Treasury ``white papers'' on \nsimplification.\n  The concept of a uniform definition of qualifying child also enjoys \nsupport from the American Bar Association, the American Institute of \nCPAs, the Tax Executives Institute, the Internal Revenue Service's \nTaxpayer Advocate, and staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Under current law, the complexity in this area is daunting. There are \nfive commonly used provisions that provide benefits to taxpayers with \nchildren: the dependency exemption, the child credit, the earned income \ncredit, the dependent care credit, and head of household filing status.\n  Each of the five provisions uses variations of four principal \ncriteria to determine whether a taxpayer qualifies for applicable tax \nbenefits with respect to a particular child: age of the child, \nrelationship of the child to the taxpayer, residency of the child with \nthe taxpayer, and the amount of financial support provided the child by \nthe taxpayer.\n  Thus, a taxpayer is required to apply different definitions with \nrespect to the same child when determining eligibility for these \nprovisions. A taxpayer who qualifies with respect to a child for one \nprovision does not necessarily qualify for another. As a result, \npublications, forms, instructions and schedules that are applicable to \nchild related provisions number about 200 pages for the preparation of \nan individual income tax return.\n  A tremendous number of families are impacted by these Code \nprovisions. For example, 44 million taxpayers claimed the dependency \nexemption in the 2001 tax year. The IRS also indicates that a \nsignificant portion of the issued math error notices are attributable \nto these five provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In 1999, for \nexample, 44 percent of the 7.6 million math error notices were \nattributable to these provisions--40 percent of the total math error \nnotices were attributable the dependency exemption, the child tax \ncredit and the earned income tax credit alone.\n  The legislation reduces complexity through reconciliation of the \nvarying child definitions into a single definition for a ``qualifying \nchild.'' The uniform child definition generally establishes eligibility \nfor all five tax benefits if the child meets the age requirements \ndescribed below, a relationship requirement, and a residency \nrequirement--i.e., the child has the same principal place of abode as \nthe taxpayer for more than one-half the taxable year.\n  The residency requirement is an important departure from current law \nin which the child tax benefits frequently rely upon financial support \ntests which impose significantly higher administrative burdens in the \nform of additional record-keeping not otherwise required under the tax \nlaw. The legislation also preserves the tax rights of children who \nprovide more than half of their own support by excluding those children \nfrom the uniform definition of a qualifying child.\n  The underlying policy objectives of the present law provisions are \nretained. For example, the legislation retains underlying policy by not \nadjusting the ages of qualification--i.e., under age for the dependent \ncare credit, under age 17 for the child tax credit, and under age 19--\nor age 24 if a full-time student for the dependency exemption, the \nearned income tax credit, and head of household filing status.\n  The legislation applies a single relationship test to the varying \nCode sections. Significantly, the proposal retains current law as an \nalternative to the extent that a person does not meet the revised \nuniform child definition--e.g., an elderly parent can still be claimed \nfor purposes of the dependency exemption.\n  Under the Uniform Definition of Child Act, there will be instances in \nwhich multiple taxpayers qualify with respect to a given child. To \naddress this issue, the proposal extends the present law earned income \ncredit tie-breaker rule to the other benefits for multiple eligible \nclaimants. That rule awards the tax benefit (i) to a parent over a non-\nparent, (ii) to the parent with longer residency or the highest AGI if \nresidency is not determinative between parents, and (iii) to the \ntaxpayer with the highest AGI if all claimants are non-parents. \nFinally, the legislation continues to allow divorced or separated \nspouses to assign the dependency exemption and the child tax credit to \nnon-custodial parents provided that certain support and residency tests \nare met.\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\n  Simplification of the tax code should be more than just rhetoric. It \nis time for us to put legislation behind our words. We intend to \ncontinue to look at other areas of the tax code in need of \nsimplification.\n  Senator Grassley and I also want to thank our Finance Committee \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch, Thomas and Lincoln, for their support of \nthe Uniform Definition of Child Act of 2003. Simplification of the tax \nlaws for the families of our nation is not partisan, it is not \npolitical, it is simply common sense.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Uniform Definition of \nChild Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Uniform Definition of Child \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNIFORM DEFINITION OF CHILD, ETC.\n\n       Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 152. DEPENDENT DEFINED.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--For purposes of this subtitle, the term \n     `dependent' means--\n       ``(1) a qualifying child, or\n       ``(2) a qualifying relative.\n

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe qualified small issue bond provisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS: Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to introduce \nlegislation with my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg. Specifically, the bill we offer today would amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to modify the qualified small issue bond \nprovisions. Current restrictions built into the law decades ago prevent \nsmall manufacturers from realizing the full financial benefit from \nthese bonds.\n  The manufacturing sector is a key component of the U.S. economy. It \nwas particularly hard-hit in the most recent recession and continues to \nstruggle. More than two million high-wage, quality jobs have been lost. \nThese losses occurred in both large and small manufacturing facilities. \nReversing the decline is critical for our Nation's economic well-being.\n  This bill targets a problem faced by many small manufacturers: the \nlack of investment capital. These manufacturers need access to \nfinancial resources to build, to grow, to employ new workers and to \nsurvive. One of the lowest-cost capital investment options currently \navailable is tax-exempt Industrial Development Bonds or IDBs. These \nbonds are issued by state governments throughout the country and \nprovide an excellent financial resource for companies looking to build \nor expand their manufacturing facilities.\n  The maximum IDB available for qualified projects was set in 1978 at \n$10 million. The purchasing power of that amount has declined by more \nthan fifty percent over time, severely reducing the effectiveness of \nthis financial tool. In addition, the ten million dollar ceiling is \nsubject to a dollar reduction for other funding used in the project. \nThese limits create a significant and unnecessary barrier. To help \nsmall manufacturers and acknowledge the technological advances made in \nthe past 25 years, it is time to change the law.\n  This bill makes the necessary changes to ensure that the law reflects \neconomic realities. It increases the bond cap and capital expenditure \namounts from ten to twenty million dollars. An inflation adjuster is \nadded to avoid a similar reduction in purchasing power in the future. \nFinally, we would expand the definition of manufacturing facilities to \ncapture new technologies, namely biotech and software production.\n  Many factors are responsible for the current decline in the \nmanufacturing sector. Our bill will not solve all the problems, but it \ndoes break down the capital investment barrier facing many small \nmanufacturers. These businesses, and the communities in which they are \nlocated, need our help. This proposal will go a long way in achieving \nthat objective and I urge all my colleagues to become a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for certain energy-efficient property; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  (At the request of Mr. DODD, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbill, with Senator Olympia Snowe, to encourage the use of fuel cells, a \nclean and cutting-edge energy technology. Specifically, the bill would \ngive consumers a tax credit for purchasing residential and commercial \nfuel cell systems to power their electricity. The tax credit would \napply to stationary and portable fuel cell systems, and would be \napplicable for 5 years.\n  First used for space missions in the 1960s, fuel cells use an \nelectrochemical reaction to convert energy from hydrogen-rich fuel \nsources into electricity. Because no combustion is involved, fuel cells \nproduce virtually no air pollution and significantly reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions. Fuel cell units in operation today are capable of \nrunning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with only routine maintenance. \nThey are installed around the world in power plants, hospitals, \nschools, banks, military installations, and manufacturing facilities. \nSmaller units for homeowners and small businesses will enter the \ncommercial market shortly.\n  Fuel cell technology offers a clean, secure, and dependable source of \nenergy that should be part of our national energy strategy. With oil \nand gas prices now reaching record highs, fuel cells are one excellent \nanswer to our heightened energy demand and dependence on foreign oil. \nThis legislation will power fuel cell technology by speeding its market \nintroduction and by increasing its uses in our everyday lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 758\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, to introduce a bill that will promote \nthe expanded use of an environmentally sound and efficient energy \ntechnology--fuel cell power.\n  The United States has had a long, inseparable relationship with \nenergy. The Americans of the 19th century would not have populated the \nWest as they did without the railroad and its steam engines. New York's \nPearl Street Station, designed by Thomas Edison in 1882, demonstrated \nthe immense possibilities of large-scale electricity generation that \nwould revolutionize our Nation and the world. And, of course, the 20th \ncentury is posted with landmark American innovations an inventions in \noil use and production, nuclear power, and solar energy.\n  As we begin our journey into the 21st century, we must begin a new \nchapter for energy use through fuel cell power. Fuel cells are not a \nfuturistic dream, as every manned U.S. space mission has relied upon \nfuel cells for electricity and drinking water. From a New York City \npolice station to a postal facility in Alaska to hospitals, schools, \nbanks, military installations and manufacturing facilities around the \nworld, fuel cell units are efficiently generating dependable power 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week for upwards of 2 years with only routine \nmaintenance.\n  Fuel cell technology offers a clean, secure, efficient, and \ndependable source of energy that should be part of our national energy \nstrategy. Not only do fuel cells deliver the high quality, reliable \npower that is considered an absolute necessity for many portions of our \nsociety, they reduce grid demand while improving grid flexibility. Fuel \ncells are an ideal energy source to address the Nation's pressing \nenergy needs.\n  Using electro-chemical reaction to convert energy from hydrogen-rich \nfuel cell sources into electricity, fuel cells reduce the need for \nfossil fuel consumption. And, since no combustion is involved, fuel \ncells produce virtually no air pollution and significantly reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions, the major greenhouse gas thought to be \nresponsible for climate change variability. In fact, a 200 kilowatt \nfuel power plant produces less than one ounce of pollutants for every \n1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity it yields. In comparison, the \naverage fossil fuel plans produces nearly 25 pounds of pollutants to \ngenerate the same 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. That is 400 \ntimes the amount of a fuel cell power plant.\n  The current problem is that it is difficult for the consumer to take \nadvantage of fuel cells because, as with any new technology, the \nintroductory price is high. To create the market incentives necessary \nto speed the commercialization of this technology, the Lieberman-Snow \nlegislation provides a property owner a five year, $1,000 per kilowatt \nstationary fuel cell tax credit, including labor and installation \ncosts, for business and non business power plants--stationary and \nportable--that have an electrical generation efficiency greater than 30 \npercent and generate at least 0.5 kilowatts of electricity using an \nelectrochemical process. To put this electrical generation in \nperspective, a home uses approximately 1 to 2 kilowatts of power, on \naverage.\n  By lowering the initial price for consumers, market introduction and \nproduction volume of fuel cells will be accelerated with the end result \nbeing a significant reduction in manufacturing costs. The decrease in \nprice would enable even more consumers to use one of the cleanest, most \nreliable and most efficient means to generate electricity. This \ntailored fuel cell tax credit for a stationary and portable fuel cells \nis designed to benefit the widest range of potential fuel cell \ncustomers and manufacturers with a meaningful incentive for the \npurchase of fuel cells for residential and commercial use.\n  As summer approaches, power shortages and interruptions can be \nexpected throughout the country. We must increase our investment and \ncommitment to non-traditional energy sources such as fuel cells. This \nreliable, combustion-free power provided by fuel cells in a sensible \nalternative that is available today. I urge my colleagues to support us \nfor a sensible fuel cell power tax credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 759. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for individuals and businesses for the installation of \ncertain wind energy property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Residential, \nFarm, Ranch and Small Business Energy Systems Act of 2003, also known \nas the Small Wind Energy Systems Act. I am honored to be joined by \nSenators Allard, Conrad, Harkin, Johnson, Leahy and Dorgan in \nintroducing this legislation.\n  In order to foster a forward-looking energy policy, the United States \nneeds to broaden its energy portfolio beyond fossil fuels, which are a \nfinite energy source. Any serious attempt to create a\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nnational energy policy must include innovative proposals for exploring \nand developing the use of alternative and renewable energy sources. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would help spur the production of \nelectricity from a limitless source--wind.\n  This bill, similar to legislation I introduced last year, offers a \ntax credit to help defray the cost of installing a small wind energy \nsystem to generate electricity for individual homes, farms, ranches and \nbusinesses. The credit can be applied only to systems up to 75 kW, and \nis equal to 30 percent of the cost of installation, up to $1,000 per \nkilowatt. I am offering this legislation in the hope that this tax \ncredit will help make it economical for people to invest in small wind \nsystems, thereby reducing pressures on the national power grid and \nincreasing America's energy independence one family and business at a \ntime.\n  Small wind systems are the most cost-competitive home-sized renewable \nenergy technology, but the high up-front cost has been a barrier. A \ntypical small, rural wind system rated at 10 kW costs $30,000-$35,000 \nto install. A 30 percent business investment credit would make wind \nenergy more viable for rural America. In addition, farmers and ranchers \ncan utilize a small wind energy system while simultaneously continuing \nto use their land for crop growing or grazing. Facilitating the \nproduction of renewable energy on land that is already being worked for \nother purposes would be a boon to our economy, environment, and \nnational security. Finally, the tax credit would help us promote a \nhealthier environment. A typical small system can offset seven tons of \ncarbon dioxide per year; carbon dioxide is the most significant \ncontributor to climate change.\n\n  I am pleased to see that others in the Senate are working to promote \nrenewable energy. In the context of our deliberations on energy policy, \nI hope to work with Senators Grassley and Baucus, and others, in order \nto build on these efforts. In particular, I hope we can expand the \nresidential credit provided for wind energy systems in the Energy Tax \nIncentives Act of 2003, S. 597, so that the cap is raised to $1,000 per \nkilowatt. In addition, I hope to add wind to the business investment \ncredit section of the tax code. Although there is currently in law a \nbusiness investment credit for solar and geothermal power, there is \ncurrently no Federal program to support small wind systems being \ninstalled by farmers and ranchers. The Energy Tax Incentives Act of \n2003 would add fuel cells to this section of the code. I hope I can \nwork with my colleagues to also add wind to this section, because we \nneed to encourage investments in this source of energy.\n  Last year, a portion of this legislation was included in the Senate \nenergy bill by unanimous consent. I hope to build on this success this \nyear, by securing passage of the full measure.\n  For the good of our rural economy, homeowners and business owners, \nthe environment and energy security, I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to implement effective measures to stop trade in \nconflict diamonds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nDiamond Trade Act. Technically, this act will implement a certification \nprocess for imports of rough diamonds. But, as many of you know, this \nbill goes far beyond technicalities. This bill will help put an end to \ntrade in conflict diamonds. As many of you know, conflict diamonds are \ndiamonds mined and used by rebel movements in many African nations as a \nsource of revenue to fuel armed conflict and the activities of rebel \nmovements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate governments \nin African countries. Millions of people have been driven from their \nhomes by wars that have been fought for control of these diamonds. \nFamilies and entire countries have been torn apart.\n  That is why it is vitally important that we pass this legislation. \nPassage of this legislation would be a true bipartisan success and a \nsignificant step forward in stopping trade in conflict diamonds. And I \nwould like to thank my colleagues for helping to develop the compromise \nlegislation in this Act. I would especially like to recognize the hard \nwork of Senators Gregg, DeWine, Durbin, Bingaman, and Feingold, whose \ndevotion and dedication to stopping trade in conflict diamonds is \nunsurpassed.\n  Prior attempts to move similar bills have stalled in both the House \nand the Senate. As Chairman of the Finance Committee, I took great care \nto try and achieve the right balance so that we might implement a \ncertification process that meets our international responsibilities, \nthat can pass the House and the Senate, and most importantly, that \nworks.\n  The Clean Diamond Trade Act will implement the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme. This is an international agreement establishing \nminimal acceptable international standards\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nfor national certification schemes relating to cross-border trade in \nrough diamonds. It represents over two years of negotiations among more \nthan 50 countries, human rights advocacy groups, the diamond industry \nand non-government organizations.\n  The next plenary session of the Kimberley Process is scheduled to \nconvene in Johannesburg, South Africa, from April 28 to the 30, 2003. \nThe U.S. played a leadership role in crafting the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme, and it is critical that we implement the \ncertification process before April 28 if we are to retain this \nleadership. We also need to do this to ensure that the flow of \nlegitimate diamonds into and out of the United States will continue \nwithout interruption. Most important, we need to do everything we can \nto stop trade in conflict diamonds as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, we plan to mark-up this legislation in the Finance \nCommittee tomorrow morning. I am confident the bill will receive strong \nbipartisan support in committee and am hopeful we can pass this bill by \nunanimous consent in the full Senate before we adjourn for the April \nrecess. The people and countries in Africa affected by the damage of \nconflict diamonds deserve our support. Passing this bill is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Today, Mr. President, violent conflicts and other global \nthreats and humanitarian concerns extend across many parts of our \nworld. We are at war with Iraq. North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. \nHIV/AIDS is pandemic. And, terrorism threatens our daily lives.\n  Our world is, indeed, a very dangerous and unstable place. We know \nthis. And, while we are well aware of the many global ``hotspots''--the \nconflicts and the violence and the human suffering--there are parts of \nthe world, which I believe, we have neglected. There are parts of the \nworld, where human tragedy is the order of the day--where children are \nkilled, where women are raped and beaten, and where people are \nroutinely tortured--their bodies maimed and mutilated.\n  One area of the world where such atrocities are occurring on a daily \nbasis is in Sierra Leone, Africa. For at least a decade, Sierra Leone, \none of the world's poorest nations, has been embroiled in civil war. \nRebel groups--most notably, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)--have \nbeen fighting for years to overthrow the recognized government. In the \nprocess, violence has erupted as the rebels have fought to seize \ncontrol of the country's profitable diamond fields, which in turn, \nhelps finance their terrorist regime.\n  Once in control of a diamond field, the rebels confiscate the \ndiamonds and then launder them onto the legitimate market through other \nnearby nations, like Liberia. Known as ``conflict'' or ``blood'' \ndiamonds, these gems are a very lucrative business for the rebel \ngroups. In fact, over the past decade, the rebels have smuggled out of \nAfrica approximately $10 billion dollars in these diamonds.\n  It is nearly impossible to distinguish the illegally gathered \ndiamonds from legitimate or ``clean'' stones. And so, regrettably and \nunwittingly, the United States--as the world's biggest buyer of \ndiamonds--has contributed to the violence. Our nation accounted for \nmore than half of the $57.5 billion in global retail diamond trade last \nyear, and some estimates suggest that illegal diamonds from Africa \naccount for as much as 15 percent of the overall diamond trade.\n  Since the start of the rebel's quest for control of Sierra Leone's \ndiamond supply, half of the nation's population of 4.5 million have \nleft their homes, and at least a half-million have left the country. \nBut, it is the children of Sierra Leone who are bearing the biggest \nbrunt of the rebel insurgency. For over eight years, the RUF has \nconscripted children--children often as young as 7 or 8 years old--to \nbe soldiers in their make-shift army. They have ripped at least 12,000 \nchildren from their families.\n  As a result of deliberate and systematic brutalization, child \nsoldiers have become some of the most vicious--and effective--fighters \nwithin the rebel factions. The rebel army--child-soldiers included--has \nterrorized Sierra Leone's population, killing, abducting, raping, and \nhacking off the limbs of victims with their machetes. This chopping off \nof limbs is the RUF's trademark strategy. In Freetown, the surgeons are \nfrantic. Scores of men, women, and children--their hands partly chopped \noff--have flooded the main hospital. Amputating as quickly as they can, \ndoctors toss severed hands into a communal bucket.\n  The RUF frequently and forcibly injects the children with cocaine in \npreparation for battle. In many cases, the rebels force the child-\nsoldiers at gunpoint to kill their own family members or neighbors and \nfriends. Not only are these children traumatized by what they are \nforced to do, they also are afraid to be reunited with their families \nbecause of the possibility of retribution.\n  Mr. President, I cannot understate nor can I fully describe the \nhorrific abuses these children are suffering. The most vivid accounts \ncome from the child-soldiers themselves. I'd like to read a few of \ntheir stories, taken from Amnesty International's 1998 report, ``Sierra \nLeone--A Year of Atrocities against Civilians.'' According to one \nchild's recollection:\n\n       Civilians were rounded up, in groups or in lines, and then \n     taken individually to a pounding block in the village where \n     their hands, arms, or legs were cut with a machete. In some \n     villages, after the civilians were rounded up, they were \n     stripped naked. Men were then ordered to rape members of \n     their own family. If they refused, their arms were cut off \n     and the women were raped by rebel forces, often in front of \n     their husbands . . . victims of these atrocities also \n     reported women and children being rounded up and locked into \n     houses which were then set [on fire].\n\n  A young man from Lunsar, describing a rebel attack, said this:\n\n       Ten people were captured by the rebels and they asked us to \n     form a [line]. My brother was removed from the [line], and \n     they killed him with a rifle, and they cut his head with a \n     knife. After this, they killed his pregnant wife. There was \n     an argument among the rebels about the sex of the baby she \n     was carrying, so they decided to open her stomach to see the \n     baby.\n\n  According to Komba, a teenager:\n\n       My legs were cut with blades and cocaine was rubbed in the \n     wounds. Afterwards, I felt like a big person. I saw the other \n     people like chickens and rats. I wanted to kill them.\n\n  Rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual abuse of girls and \nwomen have been systematic, organized, and widespread. Many of those \nabducted have been forced to become the ``wives'' of combatants.\n  According to Isatu, an abducted teenage girl:\n\n       I did not want to go; I was forced to go. They killed a lot \n     of women who refused to go with them.\n\n  She was forced to become the sexual partner of the combatant who \ncaptured her and is now the mother of their three-month-old baby:\n\n       When they capture young girls, you belong to the soldier \n     who captured you. I was `married' to him.\n\n  We are losing these children--an entire generation of children. If \nthe situation does not improve, these kids have no future. But, as long \nas the rebel's diamond trade remains unchallenged, nothing will change.\n  That is why I have been working with Senators Durbin, Feingold, and \nGregg for over two years to pass legislation that would help stem this \nillegal trade in conflict diamonds. Together, we have worked \nextensively with our House colleagues, including my good friend and \nformer colleague from Ohio, Tony Hall, and Frank Wolf from Virginia, to \ndevelop much needed legislation to help remove the rebel's market \nincentive.\n  And, while we have not yet been successful in getting this \nlegislation signed into law, I credit my colleagues' continued \ncommitment to this often forgotten issue. I know our countless \ncongressional hearings, meetings, letters and legislative initiatives \nhave encouraged the Administration and the international community to \nkeep this issue alive. We have kept the pressure on, and we are \nbeginning to see some positive results.\n  Mr. President, just this past January 1st, an international agreement \ncalled the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was launched. \nSpecifically, this is a voluntary, international diamond certification \nsystem among over 50 participant countries, including all of the major \ndiamond producing and trading countries. This is a positive step in the \nright direction, and I commend the tireless work of human rights\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\nadvocates and the diamond industry for making this certification system \na reality.\n  Because of their success, Mr. President, today we are faced with the \nurgent need of providing legislative measures to enable effective U.S. \nimplementation of the certification scheme. We need to provide the \nAdministration with the authorization necessary to ensure U.S. \ncompliance with this global, regulatory framework. That is why I am \nhere today to introduce legislation that commits the United States to \nmandatory implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\n  I join my distinguished colleagues, Senators Grassley, Durbin, \nFeingold, Bingaman, Talent, and Snowe, to introduce the ``Clean Diamond \nTrade Act.'' This legislation is very similar to a measure introduced \nin the House last week, H.R. 1415. Our bill is very simple. The whole \nidea behind it is to commit the United States to a system of controls \non the export and import of diamonds, so that buyers can be certain \nthat their purchases are not fueling the rebel campaign.\n  Specifically, our legislation would prohibit the import of any rough \ndiamond that has not been controlled through the Kimberley Process \nCertification Scheme. Put simply, this means that every diamond brought \ninto the United States would require a certificate of origin and \nauthenticity, indicating that a rebel or terrorist group has not \nlaundered it onto the legitimate market.\n  Additionally, the bill calls on the President to report annually to \nCongress on the control system's effectiveness and also requires the \nGeneral Accounting Office to report on the law's effectiveness within \ntwo years of enactment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, our bill emphasizes that the Kimberley \nProcess Certification Scheme is an ongoing process and that our \ngovernment should continue to work with the international community to \nstrengthen the effectiveness of this global regulatory framework. As \nthe world's biggest diamond customer--purchasing well over half of the \nworld's diamonds--our nation has a moral responsibility to show \ncontinued leadership on this issue.\n  Quite candidly, there are a lot of things in this world--a lot of \nterrible, tragic things--that we don't have the power to change or to \nfix. But today, we can change something. We can make a difference. We \nhave the power to help put an end to the indescribable suffering and \nviolence caused by diamond-related conflicts. We have that power, and \nwe must use it. And so, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis much-needed legislation.\n  We have an obligation--a moral responsibility--to help stop the \nviolence, the brutality, the needless killing and maiming. No other \nchild should kill or be killed in diamond-related conflicts. I believe \nthat it is absolutely imperative that we pass the bill we have \nintroduced quickly and help end these atrocities once and for all.\n  It is the humane thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the \nonly thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4645-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 102--RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SINKING \n                     OF THE USS THRESHER (SSN 593)\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Collins) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the following calendar items \nen bloc: Calendar No. 54 and Calendar No. 55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bills by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 711) to amend title 37, United States Code, to \n     alleviate delay in the payment of the Selected Reserve \n     reenlistment bonus to members of Selected Reserve who are \n     mobilized.\n       A bill (S. 712) to amend title 10, United States Code, to \n     provide Survivor Benefit Plan annuities for surviving spouses \n     of Reserves not eligible for retirement who die from a cause \n     incurred or aggravated while on inactive-duty training.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about two bills--S. 711 and \nS. 712. I am honored to cosponsor these bills with Senators Lindsey \nGraham, Chambliss, and Allen. There may be others that also wish to \ncosponsor these bills to support our service men and women.\n  S. 711 simply authorizes a Selective Re-enlistment Bonus, SRB, for \nNational Guard and Reserve service members who would be eligible for \nSRB if they were in a nonmobilized or drilling status. However, when \nthey are mobilized under a Presidential select Reserve callup and they \nre-enlist during that period, National guardsmen and reservists are \nprohibited from receiving SRB payments until after they get off active \nduty or mobilization status sometimes 1 to 2 years later.\n  S. 712 authorizes Survivor Benefit Plan, SBP, benefits to survivors \nof National Guard and Reserve service members who die while performing \ninactive duty training or weekend drills.\n  This legislation provides equity with active duty service members and \nis consistent with Defense Department regulations when National \nguardsmen and reservists are mobilized under a Presidential select \nReserve callup.\n  However, since January there have been 13 Reserve Component deaths \nduring weekend military training while their units were preparing for \nOperations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom where families of \nNational guardsmen and reservists did not receive the survivor benefit \npayments.\n  Furthermore, this legislation would cover those Reserve Component \npersonnel who were serving in a drill status in the Pentagon during the \nattacks on the United States on 9/11.\n  This bill has the support of the Military Coalition, a consortium of \nnationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations \nrepresenting more than 5.5 million members, the National Guard, and the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  The roles and missions of the Reserve components has changed over the \npast several years, as the active duty force has evolved from the \ndownsizing of our military forces during the last decade. I suspect \nthat more changes will come as our national military strategy continues \nto evolve.\n  Instead, we have a military force that continues to rely more on the \nReserve Components--men and women in the National Guard and Reserves--\nto go to war and to perform other critical military tasks abroad and at \nhome. Many combat, combat support and other support missions are being \ncarried on the backs of our active and Reserve Component forces--\nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\n  For example, in March 2001, the Army National Guard 29th Infantry \nDivision took command of the American peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. \nThe significance of this deployment was enormous, considering that more \nthan 75 percent of the 4,000 U.S. Army soldiers on the ground were Army \nReserve and Guard soldiers from 17 states--not just headquarters' \nstaff, but operational units as well.\n  More recently, in October 2002, Fighter/Attack Squadron 201's \ncommanding officer received the call to mobilize that many Reserve \nComponent commanding officers have recently received. With few \nexceptions over 100 Navy reservists mobilized with their 12 F/A-18 \nHornet A-plus jets, and began work-ups with Carrier Air Wing 8 in \nNevada and full day and night carrier qualifications at sea. The impact \nof this accomplishment cannot be overstated. It was the first time \nsince the Korean War that an entire Naval Air Reserve Squadron has \ndeployed aboard an aircraft carrier, and this time VFA-201's base was \nnot Fort Worth, Texas but the flight deck of the USS Theodore \nRoosevelt, CVN-71.\n  The reports from the field are outstanding. VFA-201, like hundreds of \nother aviators during the first night of ``shock and awe,'' flew their \nHornets downtown to Baghdad. The pilots and their maintenance crews \nhailed from Texas, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Georgia, Florida, \nNevada, Utah and Colorado. They are citizen soldiers. Thirteen of \neighteen VFA-201 pilots are airline pilots who took a temporary leave \nof absence from their airline jobs.\n  They were similar to active duty sailors, yet they were different. \nBecause they were reservists, every aviator has cruise experience, over \n1,000 flight hours, and many have over 1,000 or 2,000 hours in the F/A-\n18. VFA-201's squadron aviators provided leadership to the air wing in \nstrike planning, flight execution and carrier operations. Their day and \nnight time boarding rates and landing grades have exceeded all other \nCarrier Air Wing 8's squadrons.\n  While these are only two of the deployments that have taken place in \nrecent years, they highlight the ever-increasing role of reservists in \ndefending America's security interests around the world, and mark a \nradical departure from the past.\n  The figures are quite staggering when considered in total.\n  Today, nearly 60,000 reservists and National Guardsmen, including \nvolunteers, are deployed under three Presidential callup orders for \nBosnia, Kosovo, and Southwest Asia. For Operations Noble Eagle, \nEnduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom over 275,000 men and women from the \nNational Guard and the Reserves have been mobilized.\n  During each of the past 5 years, Reserve and National Guard service \nmembers have performed between 12 and 13.5 million duty days in support \nof the active force. These numbers are a direct contrast to 1990, when \n1 million duty days were performed at a time when there were 25 percent \nmore reservists.\n  Reservists also currently make up more than half of the airlift crews \nand 85 percent of the sealift personnel that are needed to move troops \nand equipment in either wartime or peacetime operations. In addition, \nreserve medical and construction battalions and other specialists are \ncritical to a wide range of operations.\n  National Guard and Reserve service members are performing many vital \ntasks: from direct involvement in military operations to liberate Iraq \nin the air, on the ground, and on the sea; to guarding nuclear power \nplants in the United States; to providing support to the War on \nTerrorism through guarding, interrogating, and providing medical \nservice to al-Qaida detainees; to rebuilding schools in hurricane-\nstricken Honduras and fighting fires in our western states; from \noverseeing civil affairs in Bosnia, to augmenting aircraft carriers \nshort on active duty sailors with critical skilled enlisted ratings \nduring at-sea exercises as well as periods of deployment.\n  I believe that the civilian and uniformed leadership of our Armed \nForces and the Congress must recognize this involvement, and at a \nminimum provide equality in benefits for Reserve Component service \nmembers when they put on the uniform and perform their weekend drills \nor other critical training evolutions. Reservists, on duty, who \nresemble their active duty counterparts during training evolutions and \nare deployed at times around the world, should be treated equally when \nthe administration and Congress provide for quality of life benefits.\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\n  I hope that all my colleagues will support these bills as a small \nexpression of support and willingness to provide not just equality in \nquality of life benefits for our National guardsmen and reservists but \nsupport to all our men and women--our treasure--who are sacrificing so \nmuch for our nation, our freedoms and the freedom of the Iraqi people.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bills be \nread a third time and passed, en bloc; that the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, en bloc; and that any statements relating to \nthe bills be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 102, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Sununu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 102) recognizing the 40th anniversary \n     of the sinking of the USS Thresher.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this legislation pays tribute to the 129 \nofficers, sailors, and civilians who lost their lives aboard the USS \nThresher 40 years ago next week.\n  The loss of these brave individuals was a tragedy for the U.S. \nsubmarine service, for the Navy, and the Nation. Yet out of this \ntragedy, the Navy was able to learn important lessons about submarine \nsafety and acted to correct design and construction concerns that \nexisted on other subs, and prevent engineering and design flaws on \nfuture submarines. These measures have served to benefit our Navy ever \nsince.\n  Built at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and commissioned in August of \n1961, the USS Thresher was the lead ship in a new class of nuclear-\npowered attack submarines.\n  In the fall of 1961 and throughout 1962, the Thresher was put through \nits paces along the eastern seaboard to test its new technological and \nweapons advancements. Once these tests were completed, the Thresher \nreturned to New England for an overhaul where she remained until the \nspring of 1963.\n  On April 9, 1963, the Thresher departed the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nto conduct deep sea diving exercises some 200 miles off the coast of \nNew England. In the morning hours of April 10, 1963, after reaching her \nassigned depth, the USS Thresher, signaled her companion surface ship, \nthe USS Skylark, that it was experiencing difficulties. Shortly \nthereafter, the crew of the Skylark realized that something had gone \nvery wrong as they heard the sound of the Thresher breaking apart.\n  In the investigation that followed this terrible accident, the \nconclusion was reached that the Thresher in all likelihood had sunk due \nto a failure in its piping, a subsequent loss of power, and an \ninability to blow the ballast tanks which would have allowed the sub to \nrise. To this day, the remains of the Thresher rest some 8,500 feet \nbelow the ocean's surface.\n  As a result of the Thresher incident, the Navy initiated two \nsignificant changes to enhance submarine safety. The first of these was \nthe SUBSAFE program, which ensured that every submarine in the fleet \nand every future submarine built had to pass a rigorous testing program \non hull integrity systems as well as pressure-related parts. No sub \nwould go into service without a 100-percent certification.\n  Second, this tragedy inspired the Navy to encourage a new ocean \nengineering discipline within a handful of prestigious educational \ninstitutions. Today, engineers in this discipline are trained to design \nand implement systems that can withstand the rigors of a lifetime's use \nin ocean waters.\n  Today, I join with Senators Gregg, Snowe and Collins to submit this \nresolution to honor the naval and civilian crew of the USS Thresher.\n  This resolution will provide Senate recognition of the 40th \nanniversary of the Thresher incident--April 10--and pay tribute to her \nvaliant crew. The resolution also calls on the Senate to express its \ndeep gratitude to all American submariners who are on ``eternal \npatrol.''\n  Next week, on the 40th anniversary of the Thresher accident, Senators \nGregg, Snowe, Collins and I will submit another resolution that will \ncall on the Secretary of the Army to erect a modest memorial at \nArlington National\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nCemetery to honor the men and women who were lost on the Thresher as \nwell as other nuclear submariners lost at sea.\n  The memorial would be designed not to detract in any way from the \nsolemn nature of Arlington. In fact, I believe it would provide \nvisitors a place of reflection where they can pay their respects to all \nof these brave individuals.\n  Our Nation's submarine force is often referred to as the ``silent \nservice.'' They are the original stealth fighters, and, as such, \nsubmarines and their crews have proven to be a critical component of \nour Nation's defense. It is only fitting that we pay tribute to those \nwho risk their lives for us as well as those who have paid the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senators Gregg, Snowe, Collins and \nme in honoring these individuals by supporting both of these measures. \nAnd I ask for their speedy consideration by the Senate.\n  The 129 men of the USS Thresher who lost their lives deserve our \nrecognition and our gratitude. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe names of these men--the 16 officers, 96 crew and 17 civilian \ntechnicians aboard the Thresher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               United States Ship ``Thresher'' (SSN 593)\n\n                      In Memoriam, April 10, 1963\n\n\n

Shipyard\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the brave Americans \nwho served on the USS Thresher. The nuclear submarine USS Thresher, \nnamed after a shark, was built with extreme pride by yankee craftsmen \nworking at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, NH. After \noperations in the Atlantic and Caribbean, she returned to the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard for overhaul, and then on April 10, 1963 she \nwent back to sea for post-overhaul trials. Sadly, during those deep-\ndiving trials, the Thresher was lost off the coast of New England, \nalong with all 96 sailors, 16 officers, and 17 civilians on board, \nfalling more than 8,000 feet below the sea.\n  The sailors, officers and civilians aboard the USS Thresher made the \nultimate sacrifice in support of our Nation. They are remembered daily \nthroughout New Hampshire, and Maine, and certainly within the U.S. \nNavy. This measure we introduced recognizes the courage and bravery \nthese men demonstrated in risking their lives in the development of the \nUnited States Navy's submarine program, a program which has proven \ninvaluable to the American military. The tragedy of the USS Thresher \ndemonstrates the inherent danger of submarine service.\n  On this the 40th anniversary of the tragedy, it is fitting that the \nSenate remembers with profound sorrow the loss of the USS Thresher and \nher gallant crew of sailors and civilians; and expresses its deepest \ngratitude to all submariners on eternal patrol, who are forever bound \ntogether by their dedicated and honorable service to the United States \nof America. May our country never forget those who gave their last full \nmeasure on the USS Thresher.\n  Mr. TALENT. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 102) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 102\n\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at \n     Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard for her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew \n     of 16 officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;\n       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of the \n     naval submarine service, military and civilian, in the \n     protection of the Nation;\n       Whereas at approximately 7:47 a.m. on April 10, 1963, while \n     in communication with the surface ship U.S.S. Skylark, and \n     approximately 300 miles off the coast of New England, the \n     U.S.S. Thresher began her final descent;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all \n     hands on April 10, 1963;\n       Whereas from the loss of the U.S.S. Thresher, there arose \n     the SUBSAFE program, which has kept United States' \n     submariners safe at sea ever since as the strongest, safest \n     submarine force in history;\n       Whereas from the loss of the U.S.S. Thresher, there arose \n     in our Nation's universities the ocean engineering curricula \n     that enables the United States' preeminence in submarine \n     warfare; and\n       Whereas the crew of the U.S.S. Thresher demonstrated the \n     ``last full measure of devotion'' in service to this Nation, \n     and this devotion characterizes the sacrifices of all \n     submariners, past and present: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th Anniversary of the sinking of the \n     U.S.S. Thresher;\n       (2) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of the U.S.S. \n     Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on \n     April 10, 1963; and\n       (3) expresses its deepest gratitude to all submariners on \n     ``eternal patrol'', who are forever bound together by their \n     dedicated and honorable service to the United States of \n     America.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMISSION OF RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to the Chief of Naval Operations and to the \n     Commanding Officer of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to be \n     accepted on behalf of the families and shipmates of the crew \n     of the U.S.S. Thresher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4650-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2003\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 \na.m., Wednesday, April 2. I further ask that following the prayer and \npledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings \nbe approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period for morning \nbusiness until 11 a.m., with the time equally divided between Senator \nHutchison and the minority leader or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, before the unanimous consent \nrequest is completed, I will state that we had a very successful \nappropriations meeting today. It was completed in less than 2 hours. \nThere were a number of amendments that the chairman and ranking member, \nSenator Byrd, agreed to, and the committee accepted their \nrecommendations. We were able to resolve what we thought would be the \nmore contentious matter relating to the airline industry. We are well \ndown the road to complete this legislation in the time set forth by \nSenator Byrd and Senator Stevens, which will be sometime on Thursday.\n  Senator Daschle has asked the Democratic Senators to do what they \ncould to expedite this matter. We have a limited number of amendments, \nmost of which deal with homeland security. Senator Stevens is aware of \nthe general nature of our amendments and we will be ready to offer \nthose starting tomorrow morning, as soon as they complete their opening \nstatements.\n  As I indicated, the Democratic leader has indicated he wants us to \nwork as quickly, as expeditiously, and as completely as possible, \nmaking sure we have the number of amendments we feel strongly about but \nnot overload this bill with extraneous amendments. We look forward to \nhaving this matter completed sometime Thursday.\n  I have no objection to the initial request.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that at 11 \na.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of the supplemental \nappropriations bill as reported by the Appropriations Committee. I \nfurther ask consent that at 1:30 p.m., the Senate then proceed to \nexecutive session and there then be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to the cloture vote on the nomination \nof Miguel Estrada to be a circuit judge for the DC Circuit; provided \nfurther that if cloture is not invoked, the Senate then return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4650-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will be in a period for morning business tomorrow morning until \n11 a.m. to allow Members to continue to make statements in support of \nour troops. This is, of course, according to the majority leader. At 11 \na.m., the Senate will begin consideration of the supplemental \nappropriations bill. Amendments are anticipated on that measure. The \nmajority leader would encourage Members to notify the managers if they \nintend to offer any amendments. At 2, the Senate will conduct the \nfourth cloture vote in relation to the Estrada nomination. Following \nthat cloture vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The Senate will complete action on \nthe supplemental this week so we can get the necessary funds flowing to \nour brave men and women who are serving in Iraq. Therefore, the leader \nwould inform all Senators to expect a busy day tomorrow with rollcall \nvotes throughout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/01/senate-section/article/S4650-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
