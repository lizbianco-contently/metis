Mr. President, we have come back from the break. Most \nMembers, I imagine, have had the same kind of experience I have had in \nmeeting with my constituents. We have discovered the question of what \nwe should be doing in Iraq is foremost on our constituents' minds. \nSecond, we have discovered--at least I have--that there is great \nconcern about the size of the deficit. Those two issues were joined in \ndebate in the Senate before we left for the break. I think it \nappropriate we talk about them together now that the break is over.\n  Let me first turn to the question of the deficit and the debate that \ntook place in this Chamber with respect to the $87 billion that has \nbeen requested by the President to pay for the war activities and the \nreconstruction of Iraq. We were told in this Chamber we had to raise \ntaxes by $87 billion to pay for this, and that if we did not, we would \nsee the deficit go up by $87 billion. We defeated that amendment, but \nthere were those with whom I met during the break who still had that \nview.\n  The interesting thing we discovered during the break was that the \nprojections for the size of the deficit changed. This is no surprise to \nanyone who has spent time paying attention to the deficit. As I have \nsaid in this Chamber over and over and as I will repeat over and over, \nthe one thing I know with respect to the deficit projections, or \nsurplus projections when those were the order of the day, is that they \nare wrong. I do not know if they are wrong on the high side or wrong on \nthe low side but I do know they are wrong.\n  The other thing I know is that the further out they go, the more \nlikely they are to be wrong. That is, a 10-year projection is \nabsolutely certain to be wrong; a 5-year projection has a 99.94 percent \nchance of being wrong; a 3-year projection might be a little bit \ncloser; and so on with a 2-year projection. The only ones that come \nreally close to being accurate are the very near term projections.\n  The interesting thing that happened during the break was that the \nnear-term projections of the size of this year's deficit changed. They \nwent down. In other words, we found out during the last week that those \nwho spend their time looking at the size of the deficit have now looked \nat the numbers, now looked at the revenues coming into the Federal \nGovernment, and now project the current deficit will be roughly $85 \nbillion less than was projected when we had the debate.\n  If we had had those numbers during the debate, obviously I would have \nreferred to them to point out that it is not necessarily the size of \nthe tax rate that determines the amount of tax revenue. That is a \ntruth, again, that we repeat over and over but that gets forgotten over \nand over. What determines the amount of tax revenue is the amount of \neconomic activity that takes place in the economy as a whole tied to \nthe tax rate, not the tax rate itself. If you set the tax rate too \nhigh, you guarantee the economic activity will slow and the tax take \nwill go down.\n  We cut the tax rate at the beginning of this administration, we cut \nit again last year, and we are now seeing economic activity pick up to \nthe point that tax revenues have gone up. As I say, according to those \nwho are now projecting this year's deficit, the tax revenues have \nsurprised us to the point that we are now going to have roughly $85 \nbillion more in revenue than was projected just a month ago.\n  That is a coincidental number because it comes very close to the $87 \nbillion we are asking for. I will not suggest in any sense that we \nshould tie those two together. The closeness is purely coincidental. \nNonetheless, it demonstrates that those who want to use the deficit as \nthe reason for support of their opposition to what we are doing in Iraq \nare going to have to find another excuse because the economy is \nresponding to the tax treatment that came out of this Congress. In that \nresponse we are getting more tax revenue, and it is going to be less of \na financial burden on this country than we thought it would be even as \nrecently as a month ago.\n  All right. Let me turn now to the other argument we hear, over and \nover and over, in a constant drumbeat, with respect to Iraq; that is, \nthe argument that this administration somehow misled the American \npeople, misled the world by claiming Saddam Hussein was a threat. Then \nyou get into the details of that claim, and they say he had no weapons \nof mass destruction, his economy was in ruins, he did not have the \nability to threaten his neighbors, he was no threat or, if we can go \nback to a phrase I have seen some columnists use: Saddam Hussein was no \nHitler.\n  I want to address that this morning. I would hope in this Chamber, of \nall places, we would have a sense of history, we would understand what \nreally went on in times past, and what really is going on in a \nhistorical framework in our present time.\n  Let me take that phrase, ``Saddam Hussein was no Hitler,'' and use it \nas the framework for this kind of examination. If we go back in history \nto the time of Hitler, we can discover a time when I think it could be \nsaid accurately that Hitler was no Hitler. Let me explain what I mean \nby that.\n  The Hitler we think of when we look back in history now is the Hitler \nwho stood at the head of a major army of a major nation state waging \nworld war upon all of the other nations around him. Hitler did not \nstart out as that kind of a Hitler. He started out as a politician with \na relatively small following and a bitter message in a world of \nturmoil.\n  When he became the chancellor of all of Germany, he was a minority \npolitician leading just one party of a series of parties. The primary \nindividuals in Germany at the time thought by making him chancellor \nthey could buy him off and use him and his party in a way that would \nallow them to continue their power. They misjudged him. When he became \nchancellor, he, of course, moved to consolidate his power rather than \nto cooperate with anyone.\n  He then led Germany into a very risky military operation. He moved to \nreclaim land that had been taken from Germany in the First World War \nand ceded to France. If the French Army--arguably the largest on the \ncontinent at the time--had confronted him in that move, it would have \nmeant the end of his political career; it would have made sure that \nnazism, the Nazi party would have disappeared, and Hitler would have \nbeen gone. But the French were afraid of a little bit of combat, they \nwere afraid of a little bit of confrontation, and they allowed Hitler \nto take over that territory.\n\n  Well, without going into a complete history of the time, let's go \nforward to the pivotal event that preceded the Second World War, the \nConference at Munich.\n  Here are the circumstances that led to that event: Hitler had designs \non Czechoslovakia. Hitler insisted that Czechoslovakia belonged to \nGermany and announced he was going to take it, and take it by force. \nThe British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, contacted Hitler and \nsaid: Can we meet one more time before you act to take Czechoslovakia \nby force? Hitler agreed, and they met in Munich, Germany.\n  Chamberlain was terrified that war might break out. Chamberlain was \nafraid Great Britain was not ready for war. Chamberlain was anxious to \ngive Hitler whatever he could, and, ultimately, Chamberlain gave Hitler \nCzechoslovakia. Without the British honoring the implied guarantee they \nwould prevent any invasion of Czechoslovakia, Hitler was free to take \nover that country.\n  Now, again, if we look at it through the lens of Hitler at the top of \nhis power, we would say, well, he proposed to swallow Czechoslovakia by \nhis tremendous army. In fact, however, Hitler did not have a tremendous \narmy prior to Munich. He had one on paper, but he did not have one in \nactuality. His generals were terrified as to what would happen to that \narmy if, indeed, it was\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\nordered into the field against the combined forces of the British and \nthe Czechs.\n  Indeed, there is evidence that Hitler's generals were prepared to \ndepose him, to overthrow him, and to take Germany out from under him \nif, in fact, the British stood firm in Czechoslovakia. But instead of \nstanding firm, the British Prime Minister said: Why do we care about \npeople who live so far away from us, with whom we have nothing to do? \nAnd he gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler.\n  Now, it was not just that he swallowed a small country. If we look \nback on the history of the time, Czechoslovakia had some of the finest \nfactories capable of producing war materiel of any country in Europe. \nIt had some of the finest machine shops and other skills. By taking \nCzechoslovakia, Hitler obtained an absolutely vital strategic asset \nthat made it possible for Hitler to become Hitler.\n  May I draw some historic parallels. When Saddam Hussein took Kuwait, \nhe was taking a small, defenseless country that had enormous revenues \nand that was strategically located. If he had been allowed to keep them \nSaddam Hussein might very well have been on his road toward becoming \nHitler. However, the President of the United States at the time, the \nfirst President Bush, was not Neville Chamberlain. The first President \nBush stood in the House of Representatives and told a joint session of \nthis Congress: This shall not stand.\n  There were those in this Chamber who opposed the first President Bush \nin his decision to confront Saddam Hussein. Indeed, there were those \nwho, in their own words, said much the same as Chamberlain: What do we \nhave to do with these people so far away? Why should we be concerned \nwith something so far from our shores?\n  Fortunately, the majority of the Members of this Chamber at the time \nsupported the first President Bush in that decision and, if I may, \ndenied Saddam Hussein Kuwait in a way that Neville Chamberlain failed \nto deny Hitler Czechoslovakia.\n  In the aftermath of that first denial of Saddam Hussein's ambitions, \ninspectors went into Iraq and discovered Saddam Hussein had a serious \nprogram of producing weapons of mass destruction. About that there can \nbe no doubt. Let us understand that. Let me underscore it one more \ntime. Saddam Hussein was engaged in a serious program of producing \nweapons of mass destruction, and about that there can be no doubt. \nPresident Clinton affirmed that to the Congress. Madeleine Albright \naffirmed that to the Congress. The United Nations affirmed that to the \nSecurity Council in the form of not one but a dozen resolutions.\n  Saddam Hussein, left unchecked in his first invasion of Kuwait, was \non his way to becoming Hitler. It was the first President Bush who made \nthe decision to stop it.\n  There is some uncertainty as to what happened to Saddam Hussein's \nweapons of mass destruction program after those inspectors were removed \nfrom Iraq in 1998. President Clinton believed the program was ongoing; \nSecretary Albright believed the program was ongoing; Prime Minister \nBlair of Great Britain believed the program was ongoing; and Inspector \nKay, who has been there, confirmed that the program was ongoing. \nHowever, we have been unable to find caches of the weapons.\n  There are those who say: Well, since we can't find huge caches of \nweapons of mass destruction, the fact that the program was ongoing is \nimmaterial; and, once again, when we went into Iraq the second time \nwith the second President Bush, he did not represent a threat to us--he \nwas not Hitler.\n  Again, history says if previous leaders had had the resolve of the \ntwo Presidents Bush, Hitler would never have become Hitler himself.\n  One of the things we have discovered in Iraq that says Saddam Hussein \nwas, indeed, very much like Hitler is the mass graves. Estimates of \nthose numbers of Iraqis who have ended up in mass graves have run as \nhigh as 500,000. Maybe there are still some to be discovered. There \nwere efforts to hide those graves, just as Hitler made efforts to hide \nhis concentration camps that became the instrument through which he \nsought the final solution to the Jewish problem.\n  His final solution, of course, was to eradicate them all, to send \nthem to gas chambers, and then to bulldoze over the graves and pretend \nthey had never been there. Saddam Hussein was doing the same thing in \nhis own country to his own people, and we stopped it. By virtue of the \nresolve of the second President Bush, we stopped it. We stopped Saddam \nHussein from reaching the kind of statistical plateau of horror that \nAdolf Hitler made famous in the world.\n  Am I sorry we stopped it? Do I now have to hang my head in shame when \nI meet my constituents who say the inspectors didn't find what you \nthought they would find and, therefore, you made a mistake in voting \nfor this war?\n  Quite the contrary. As I examine the history of this situation, I am \nfilled with gratitude for the first President Bush who prevented Saddam \nHussein from taking over Kuwait and perhaps invading Saudi Arabia and \nthus becoming Hitler. And I am grateful and proud of the fact that I \nstood with the second President Bush, who moved into Iraq to make sure \nthe weapons program we all know was going on did not reach the point \nwhere it could produce huge caches of weapons and that the slaughter, \nthe systematic destruction of the Iraqi people who disagreed with \nSaddam Hussein, has been stopped. Are those consequences of which \nAmericans should be ashamed? Are those consequences from which we \nshould back away?\n  I believe, with Tony Blair, that history will look upon this action \nand say we did the right thing. We all were in the Chamber when he made \nthe point that if we were wrong in assuming that the weapons of mass \ndestruction were there in great numbers, the consequences of our \nactions, at being wrong, were the elimination of a brutal tyrant and \nthe freeing of 20 million people and the possibility of stability in \nthat region. He said history will forgive that error.\n  But, he said, if our critics were wrong, and the program, which we \nknow was in place and which has been confirmed to have been in place by \nInspector Kay, had gone forward and produced those weapons, Saddam \nHussein would have become Hitler and history would never forgive that \nmistake.\n\n  I go back to Munich. At the time when Neville Chamberlain came back \nto Great Britain, polls were overwhelmingly in his favor. He was \ngreeted with cheers everywhere he went. The one man in the House of \nCommons who stood up and said ``we have suffered a defeat of the first \nmagnitude,'' whose name was Winston Churchill, got only a handful of \nvotes in his opposition to Chamberlain. But, as Tony Blair said in our \njoint session, history has a harsh judgment of the mistake that Neville \nChamberlain made. Neville Chamberlain's mistake allowed Hitler to \nbecome Hitler. George W. Bush made sure he would not make that same \nmistake in Iraq and allow Saddam Hussein to become Hitler.\n  Over the break, during the weekend, the Washington Post addressed \nthis issue in some depth. The Washington Post, as we all know, is a \npaper that did not endorse George W. Bush for the Presidency and has \noften, in its editorial pages, been fairly harsh in its criticism. But \nthe Washington Post is also a paper with editorial writers who were in \nfavor of moving ahead in Iraq. Perhaps they had the same historic \nperspective I have tried to offer this morning, that we had to do \nsomething to stop, prior to the time when Saddam Hussein became Hitler, \nthe possibility that he might. That is a doctrine that has now been \ncalled ``preemptive war,'' about which everybody complains around the \nworld and says: That is just terrible. We should never establish the \nprecedent of attacking or using military force before the threat is \nimminent.\n  Well, Neville Chamberlain would have been well served to have adopted \nthe doctrine back in the 1930s, and the world would have saved millions \nof deaths if he had.\n  The Washington Post addressed this in an editorial that ran on \nSunday. It went from the top to the bottom of the page in two columns \ncalled ``Iraq in Review.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. It begins:\n\n       A reader asks: ``When are you going to admit you were \n     wrong?'' We've received a\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\n     number of such inquiries (not all quite so polite) about our \n     position on the war in Iraq, particularly from readers who \n     were disappointed in our prewar stance.\n\n  They then go through all of the issues. There are certainly times \nwhere they are critical of the administration, critical of the \nadministration in ways with which I might disagree. But they do make \nthe essential points about the issues that are in contention, the \nessential point about the weapons of mass destruction.\n  They make the point that I have made here this morning, that \nInspector Kay has demonstrated that Saddam Hussein had a program of \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction. Even if the caches of weapons \nhave not been found, if the program had been allowed to go forward, the \nweapons would have come.\n  They talk about Saddam and al-Qaida. They make the point that while \nthere is no direct link between Saddam and al-Qaida--and they claim the \nadministration exaggerated, by implication, the links--that nonetheless \nthere was a threat from terrorism in Iraq, and they summarize it with \nthis sentence:\n\n       When combined with [Saddam Hussein's] continuing pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction, that seemed to pose exactly the \n     sort of threat that the Bush administration rightly focused \n     on as part of the war on terrorism.\n\n  Then they talk about continuing costs. I have already addressed that \nthis morning in my comment about the revision of the budget figures \nthat says that the resurging economy we now have is going to give us a \ndeficit that is going to be roughly $85 billion less than we were \ntalking about as recently as the time before the break.\n  In addition to their editorial in which the Washington Post says we \nstill stand by our support of the decision to move ahead in Iraq even \nthough things are not going as we had all hoped, they have five \nmilitary men talking about the war in op-ed pieces. I will not put \nthose in the Record or read them. My reading of the five is that three \nof them say we have to stay there and go forward and get it done in \nroughly the way the administration is asking us to. Two are saying, no, \nthis is a quagmire; we should pull out now and walk away.\n  How do I summarize my history lesson this morning? History comes in \nchunks bigger than 2-week periods. History comes in chunks bigger than \na news site. The history of the last century and this one tells me the \ntwo Presidents Bush, in confronting Saddam Hussein in the way they \ndid--the first in reversing Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and the second \none moving in to preserve the lives of Iraqi citizens being slaughtered \nby a man with Hitlerian impulses, if not full Hitlerian power--acted \nproperly.\n  I am proud to have supported the second President Bush in his \ndecision to do that. I say this to many who are saying now that it \ndidn't go the way you said it would, so therefore we have to walk away \nfrom it: Take a little time to read history and understand that things \nnever go as people propose they will, but ultimately those who make the \nright decisions, for the right reasons, even if they have to make \nadjustments--sometimes serious changes in the way they pursue those \ndecisions--are those to whom history gives the banner of having done \nthe right thing.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 12, 2003]\n\n                             Iraq in Review\n\n       A reader asks: ``When are you going to admit you were \n     wrong?'' We've received a number of such inquiries (not all \n     quite so polite) about our position on the war in Iraq, \n     particularly from readers who were disappointed in our prewar \n     stance. Now they cite several postwar surprises, or \n     ostensible surprises: the absence of weapons of mass \n     destruction, the absence of a proven connection between \n     Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and the continuing violence in \n     Iraq. In light of these developments, it's important for \n     supporters of military intervention to look back and, where \n     necessary, reevaluate--something the Bush administration so \n     far has resisted.\n       We believe that there has been more progress in Iraq than \n     critics acknowledge, but also that the administration has \n     made serious mistakes. Before the war, we repeatedly urged \n     President Bush to plan postwar reconstruction more thoroughly \n     and to level with Congress and the American people about the \n     likely costs. We urged him to take the time to draw more \n     allies to the cause. Shortcomings in both cases have proved \n     highly damaging, as has the Pentagon's insistence on \n     monopolizing political control over Iraq.\n       Yet simply to blame the administration is not a full answer \n     to our readers. Taking the measure of the administration, of \n     Congress and of their likely ability to see this through was \n     a pre-war obligation, one of the factors in calculating risks \n     and benefits. Moreover, postwar troubles and surprises were \n     to be expected, even if they could not be precisely foretold. \n     It's fair to ask now whether those troubles and surprises are \n     so great as to prove the intervention unwise.\n       No matter how one answers that question, the critical \n     judgments now involve future policy. It is essential that the \n     United States do as much as possible to stabilize Iraq under \n     a peaceable, representative government. It seems to us that \n     opponents of the war ought to recognize, as some have, that \n     this mission could be critical to the fight against terrorism \n     and to the future of the Middle East. But insisting on doing \n     the right thing now does not excuse supporters of the war \n     from reexaming the judgments that led to this point.\n       Weapons of mass destruction. David Kay's 1,200-member \n     survey team has reported that Saddam Hussein's nuclear \n     program was ``rudimentary'' and that no large-scale \n     production of chemical weapons occurred in recent years. We \n     believed otherwise before the war, especially as regards \n     chemical weapons, as did most governments with intelligence \n     services. We have called on the Bush administration to \n     account for what increasingly look like failures in the \n     intelligence agencies' assessment of the Iraqi threat, as \n     well as misstatements in the public case made for the war. \n     The importance of this is hard to overstate: At issue is \n     whether Americans, and the world, can believe U.S. \n     intelligence on the activities of hostile, dangerous, but \n     hard-to-penetrate states like Iraq; and whether this \n     president can be trusted not to distort that intelligence in \n     pursuit of his own agenda.\n       But at issue also is whether the war should have been \n     fought. Don't we no know that Iraq posed no imminent threat \n     to the United States and that there was thus no need or legal \n     justification for an invasion? This question turns on the \n     phrase ``imminent threat,'' which was invoked before the war \n     by leading opponents of intervention, such as Sen. Carl M. \n     Levin (D-Mich). The Bush administration conveyed its own \n     sense of dramatic urgency, and that too is something it \n     should account for in light of what is now known. But we \n     argued that the threat from Saddam Hussein was not imminent \n     but cumulative: He had invaded his neighbors, used chemical \n     weapons and pursued biological and nuclear arms. He \n     threatened U.S. interests and security in a vital region and \n     would continue to do so as long as he was in power. A decade \n     of diplomacy, U.N. sanctions and no-fly-zone enforcement had \n     failed to end that threat. Instead the credibility of the \n     Security Council, along with constraints on the regime, had \n     steadily eroded.\n       The debate over intervention was fraught precisely because \n     many people understood that Saddam Hussein was not an \n     imminent danger. We argued nonetheless that the real risk lay \n     in allowing him to defy repeated U.N. disarmament orders, \n     including Resolution 1441, the ``final opportunity'' approved \n     by unanimous Security Council vote.\n       Though it pokes holes in U.S. intelligence and our \n     assumptions, Mr. Kay's report contains much to substantiate \n     this reasoning. Saddam Hussein, the report claims, never \n     abandoned his intention to produce biological, chemical and \n     nuclear arms--and he was aggressively defying Resolution \n     1441. He also was successfully deceiving U.N. inspectors. \n     They failed to discover multiple programs for developing \n     illegal long-range missiles as well as a clandestine network \n     of biological laboratories, among other things. From a legal \n     standpoint, the report shows that Iraq should have been \n     subject to the ``serious consequences'' specified by \n     Resolution 1441 in the event of noncompliance. More \n     important, it strongly suggests that in the absence of \n     intervention Iraq eventually would have shaken off the U.N. \n     inspectors and sanctions, allowing Saddam Hussein to \n     follow through on his intentions. He would have been able \n     to renew his attempt to dominate the region and its oil \n     supplies, while deterring the United States with the \n     threat of missiles topped with biological warheads. In \n     acting to enforce the U.N. resolution, the United States \n     eliminated a real, if not ``imminent,'' threat, while \n     ensuring that future Security Council ultimatums carry \n     some weight.\n       Saddam and al Qaeda. Mr. Bush and other administration \n     officials, particularly Vice President Cheney, exaggerated \n     the connections between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and \n     implied without foundation that Saddam Hussein may have had \n     something to do with the attacks of 9/11. Critics add that \n     since the invasion, terrorists seem to have flocked to Iraq, \n     where the occupation has had to cope with a series of car and \n     suicide bombings. The terrorism is worrisome, though the \n     principal group behind it appears to be Ansar al-Islam, which \n     was based in northern Iraq before the war and whose leader \n     spent time in Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.\n       For our part, we never saw a connection between Iraq and 9/\n     11 or major collaboration between Saddam and al Qaeda. But we \n     did perceive a broader threat, in the sense that Saddam \n     Hussein had frequently collaborated with other terrorist \n     organizations and could be reasonably expected to continue \n     doing so.\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\n     When combined with his continuing pursuit of weapons of mass \n     destruction, that seemed to pose exactly the sort of threat \n     that the Bush administration rightly focused on as part of \n     the war on terrorism.\n       Continuing costs. The difficulty of rebuilding Iraq is \n     huge. The steady stream of U.S. dead and wounded is \n     agonizing. The strain on the U.S. military, its reserves and \n     the families at home is growing. But these developments, \n     while troubling, are not altogether surprising--except maybe \n     to those who believed the Bush administration's shallow \n     prewar rhetoric. The calculation on intervention required a \n     weighing of risks: the risk of allowing Saddam Hussein to \n     remain in power, defying U.N. demands, versus all the well-\n     articulated risks of intervention. Before the war, these were \n     frequently said to include starvation, an outpouring of \n     refugees, a fracturing of Iraq, a descent into ethnic \n     conflict or simple chaos. We believed that reconstruction \n     would be long, costly and risky, and we judged nonetheless \n     that intervention would be less risky than allowing Saddam \n     Hussein to remain in power.\n       Were we wrong? The honest answer is: We don't yet know. But \n     at this stage we continue to believe that the war was \n     justified and necessary, and that the gains so far have \n     outweighed the costs. Each of the 326 American servicemen and \n     women who have died in Iraq represents an irretrievable loss \n     for family and friends. But the nation already has reaped \n     great benefit from their sacrifice. One of the most \n     aggressive and brutal dictators in the history of the Middle \n     East has been eliminated, along with his proven programs to \n     acquire deadly weapons. Millions of Iraqis have been freed \n     from fear, and an opportunity has opened to bring much-needed \n     political change to a region that is the source of the \n     greatest security threats to the United States. Polls show a \n     sometimes grateful, sometimes grudging willingness by most \n     Iraqis to go along with U.S. plans for reconstruction.\n       Many Americans understandably have been surprised by the \n     continuing casualties months after the president's appearance \n     on an aircraft carrier under the banner ``Mission \n     Accomplished.'' Mr. Bush's abrupt submission last month of a \n     large and poorly explained spending request to Congress also \n     has strengthened public support for the idea that the Iraq \n     mission must be failing. Yet the president's missteps have \n     merely obscured the facts that these costs were inevitable, \n     and that outside of the Sunni towns where support for Saddam \n     Hussein was strongest, there is no quagmire--only a slow, \n     slogging progress forward.\n       Continued progress is far from guaranteed. In our view, the \n     administration could improve the odds of success by forging a \n     broader international coalition. For that to happen, the \n     administration must drop its insistence on monopolizing power \n     over Iraq's political transition, as well as the contracts \n     for reconstruction. It must compromise with those well-\n     meaning allies who want Iraq to succeed but disagree with \n     U.S. tactics.\n       Success or failure in the effort to stabilize Iraq under a \n     reasonably representative government that poses no threat to \n     the world will provide the ultimate answer to the question of \n     whether the war should have been undertaken. Because we \n     continue to believe that U.S. security is at stake, we also \n     believe that the United States must be prepared to dedicate \n     troops and financial resources to that goal until it is \n     achieved, even if it takes years. In our judgment success is \n     possible, but much will depend on whether the administration \n     and Congress face the magnitude of the challenge and summon \n     the political courage and diplomatic skills necessary to meet \n     it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I rise this morning to pay special \ntribute to a special man whose life ended exactly as he lived it--in \nservice to others. LTC Dominic Rocco Baragona--``Rocky'' to his family \nand friends--passed away at the age of 42 on May 19, 2003, near Safwan, \nIraq. He had been deployed to Iraq and Operation Iraqi Freedom on March \n16, 2003.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Baragona, originally from Niles, OH, was commander \nof the 19th Maintenance Battalion based in Fort Sill, OK. As commander, \nhe was in charge of nearly 900 soldiers. At the time of his death, he \nwas the highest ranking U.S. service member killed in Iraq.\n  Rocky Baragona dedicated his life to his country. After graduating \nfrom West Point Military Academy in 1982, he spent the next 21 years \nserving our Nation. He served with distinction, upholding what GEN \nDouglas MacArthur called the soldier's code--a code of duty, honor, and \ncountry. During his military career, he was stationed in Germany and \ntwice in Korea, where he was the Terrorist Force Protection commander. \nHe also served as an officer in the 101st Airborne and with the Green \nBerets.\n  Rocky was brilliant in regard to logistics. He received many honors \nwhile in the Army, including the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint \nCommendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Joint Achievement \nMedal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Parachutist Badge, and the \nBronze Star.\n  His superiors relied on Rocky. As BG Richard Formica, a commanding \ngeneral of the Third Corps Artillery at Fort Sill, said:\n\n       I could count on him to tell me what I needed to hear, not \n     what I wanted to hear.\n\n  Not only did they rely on him, they respected and admired him. \nAccording to BG Brian Gehan, who commands the Army's First Corps at \nFort Bragg:\n\n       Rocky was a man of tremendous passion and of tremendous \n     integrity. It was those qualities that set him apart.\n\n  I didn't know Rocky Baragona, but I wish I had. I say that because I \nlearned a great deal about this man from listening to his family and \nhis friends describe this man's remarkable life. On June 18 of this \nyear, I had the honor of attending two memorial services for him--a \nprivate service, and then his burial on the hallowed ground of \nArlington National Cemetery. What I learned is that Rocky Baragona \nlived life well. He lived it with purpose and he lived it with love of \nfamily and of country.\n  At his memorial services, someone said when Rocky was around, \neveryone else just seemed happier; there was always more laughing. \nOthers said he had a positive energy, was never judgmental, and never \nmade fun of people.\n  He listened. He was a good friend. He looked out for his mom and his \ndad and he helped others achieve their dreams. He was selfless.\n  Without question, Rocky Baragona was a good man. He was a nice, \ndecent, generous, hard-working man who loved his family \nunconditionally. He was always there for them, willing to help anyone, \nany time, any place. His family called him ``the rock.'' He was the \ncement that bonded that family. As his father said, ``When everybody \nwent their own way, Rocky made sure the family stayed together.'' \nWhenever they needed anything, Rocky was there, whether it was at \nChristmastime to bring the family together and shower them with gifts, \nor just to watch the Cleveland Indian games with his dad.\n  Rocky will continue to be there for his family; he will continue to \nbe there in spirit, forever loved and forever remembered.\n  LTC Dominic Baragona was a brave man who loved his country. He was a \nbrave man who served as a true example of what defines patriotism and \nservice to others. He was a brave man who dedicated his career and his \nlife to helping his fellow man, fighting for a better future for us and \nfor our children and our grandchildren.\n  Left to cherish his memory are his parents, Dominic and Vilma; his \nbrothers and sisters, Tony, John, David, Pamela, and Susan; and several \nnieces and nephews. You all remain in my thoughts and in my prayers.\n  Madam President, I will conclude with something Rocky's brother John \nwrote when he described Rocky:\n\n       Rocky was the smartest of the seven kids. He was the most \n     generous of the seven kids. He was the kindest of the seven \n     kids. He was always there for all his brothers and sisters. \n     He was my dad's best friend and my mom's pride and joy. He \n     was always looking out for everyone else.\n\n  That is who Rocky Baragona was, and that is how he will be \nremembered.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, can the Chair inform us as to the \ncurrent circumstances involving morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The \nremaining 30 minutes are under Democratic control.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair for the information. I will use my \nleader time rather than using morning business time to talk about three \nmatters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12485-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12485-S12486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are back, as all of our colleagues \nknow, on the supplemental appropriations request offered by the \nadministration. There are a number of amendments\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\npending--as I understand it, five--and there will be other amendments \noffered today. I urge colleagues to come to the floor to offer their \namendments and to ensure we have adequate time by the end of the week \nto dispose of those amendments that have yet to be offered.\n  There is a good deal left to be done on the bill. Our focus will be \non four areas. The first will be the need for the President to clarify \nmore effectively what our plan is with regard to the use of the $87 \nbillion, the $22 billion in particular for reconstruction aid. Today we \nsaw yet another indication of the murkiness with regard to the plan. \nThe administration has made a decision to reverse itself with regard to \nsome of the demands it was making upon the United Nations, and, as a \nresult, we are perhaps more hopeful now that the U.N. could be \ninvolved. But without a plan, it makes it very difficult for us to \ncommit the resources. Simply asking for a plan is no substitute for the \nplan that is required.\n  Secondly, we want more transparency. Billions and billions of dollars \nare being spent. Corporations, such as Halliburton and Bechtel and \nothers, have benefited, but we have no way of knowing how much, what \nwill be the profit. When we passed the Marshall plan 50 years ago, we \nhad an explicit prohibition on profiteering. There is no explicit \nprohibition today. As a result, there is no transparency as well. I \nthink it is critical for us to have a better understanding for the \ntaxpayers and the Congress to know precisely how this money is going to \nbe spent and who is going to benefit and how, if we can, avoid the \nwasteful expenditures that some have already reported.\n\n  The third area we want to concentrate on is the need for a \nrecognition that it ought to be paid for. Whether it is paid for in a \nway of collateralizing the money requested, if it is asking those at \nthe very top of the income scale to help pay--there has been no request \nfor sacrifice on their part--whether we simply make this a loan, \nrecognizing that somebody is going to have to pay for this, somebody is \ngoing to have to be willing to borrow it and give it to Iraq or, the \nquestion is, Does it merit at least consideration that we ask Iraq to \nborrow the money rather than the United States? But somebody will \nborrow the money. That is the bottom line, and I think we need to \nrecognize that point.\n  Finally, we also need to recognize important domestic priorities. \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Bond, as I understand it, will be offering \nan amendment to provide the resources necessary to fully fund the \nVeterans' Administration budget for this year. We are over $1 billion \nshort. Their message is simply that if we are going to support the \ntroops, we ought to support the veterans--the veterans who are coming \nhome needing health care, veterans who are now being asked to wait up \nto 6 months for health care, in some cases. But there are important \ndomestic priorities that ought to be addressed as well.\n  It is our hope that through this amendment, and other amendments like \nit, we will be in a better position to say, yes, we want to be \nsupportive of the need to reconstruct, to provide the resources to \nIraq, but we also need to recognize the importance of providing those \nresources as well for important needs here at home, especially those \ninvolving veterans.\n  That will be the debate for the week. I am hopeful that many of these \namendments will be adopted; that we can improve the legislation as it \nwas offered and proposed, and, at the end of the day, we have the \nassurance we know where the money is going; that at least in part it \nwill be paid for; that it recognizes domestic priorities; and that \nthere is a plan, a recognition that we are not going to be there \ninterminably; that we need a clear and much more precise way of \nanalyzing our success or our shortcomings as we commit these resources \nfor the course of the next several months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12486-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CURRENCY MANIPULATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, there is another issue I wish to \nmention. It has to do with a requirement by law that the administration \nissue a report on currency manipulation by October 15. That is the law. \nThere is a requirement passed by the Congress, signed by the President, \nthat the administration needs to provide a clear understanding of the \ncircumstances, especially involving China and Japan.\n  We have good reason to believe there is dramatic currency \nmanipulation underway in those two countries; perhaps as much as 40 \npercent of the current strength of the Chinese yuan can be directly \nattributed to currency manipulation.\n  When we passed the law, we said the Congress needed, first, to \nreceive the report from the administration and, second, that the \nadministration needed to lay out its specific plan for dealing, \nconfronting, and effecting ultimately this manipulation so that the \nextraordinary impact it is having on our trade balances and, therefore, \non our economy could be dealt with.\n  We currently have a $103 billion trade deficit with China and a $70 \nbillion trade deficit with Japan. We have lost over 2.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs just in 3 years. A lot of those jobs are going \ndirectly to China and Japan, to places in Asia.\n  The hardest hit industries in the last 2\\1/2\\ years include 67,000 \njobs lost in the plastics industry, 15,000 jobs lost in machine tool \nmanufacturing, 21,000 jobs lost in tool and die manufacturing, 100,000 \njobs lost in furniture manufacturing, and 139,000 jobs lost in the \ntextile manufacturing industries.\n  What we are suggesting is that, first, the administration do what the \nlaw requires. I come to the floor this morning very concerned with the \nreports I have heard that the administration has no intention of \nreleasing its report on time; that there will not be the report \nrequired by law that they will provide us with as clear an \nunderstanding of the circumstances involving currency manipulation as \nthey can.\n  We also ask, not only do they offer the report, do they present the \nreport to the Congress, but that they do what the law also requires, \nwhich is to enter into formal negotiations with all of those countries \nfor which we are concerned as it relates to currency manipulation.\n  Finally, we also propose that they pursue a section 301 trade law \ninvestigation to set the stage for WTO and further action by the WTO in \nthese cases, unless first we report and, secondly, provide specific and \ndirect bilateral action and then pursue the laws as they are affected \nin this 301 matter.\n  There is no way we can begin addressing the very serious problems we \nhave with regard to the manufacturing and service industry job loss we \nhave experienced now in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. October 15 is upon us. \nThe report needs to be provided, and I hope the administration will \nfollow the law and do what the law requires and give us the report and \nallow us to work with them to enter into formal investigations at the \nearliest possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12486-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12486-S12488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Finally, I will talk about our grave concern with regard \nto the ongoing investigation in the Department of Justice with regard \nto the leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame. In a letter to the \nadministration, we have noted they need to address five specific \nmissteps we think directly hinder and perhaps may adversely affect the \noutcome of this investigation.\n  First, the Department of Justice commenced this investigation on \nFriday, September 26, but did not ask the White House to preserve all \nrelevant evidence until September 29. No one knows why. For those 4 \ndays, the investigation went on without any formal request of the White \nHouse or anybody else to preserve all relevant documents.\n  Second, after the request, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales asked \nfor yet another delay, until the following day, before any of the \nrelevant evidence would have to be provided. This is a significant \ndeparture from standard practice and, again, mysteriously inexplicable.\n  Third, no request was made of State and Defense Department agencies \nuntil October 1, almost a week following the request made of the White \nHouse. Again, that is completely inexplicable. What is even more \ntroubling is that the Wall Street Journal reported that a request would \nbe made to the Department of Defense and the State Department the very \nday it was done, again\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\ntipping off all of those who may have had some reason to destroy \nevidence.\n  Fourth, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan stated he has \nalready determined that three White House officials--Karl Rove, Lewis \nLibby, and Elliott Abrams--had not disclosed any information. Now, he \nis not a member of the investigation. He has no legal expertise. He is \nthe current White House spokesperson, but he said he personally made \nthat determination and could announce with confidence they were not \ninvolved.\n\n  That perhaps is the most troubling of all. How can someone with no \nlegal expertise say with official acclamation that these individuals \nare not involved? First, he does not have the expertise. Second, if \nindeed that turns out to be wrong, someone in the Justice Department is \ngoing to have to confront the White House and reverse that \npronouncement, making it all the more difficult for the investigation \nto go forward.\n  Finally, the investigation continues to be overseen by Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, someone who has very close personal and political \nties with many of those who are at least subject to an investigation. \nThat, too, is extraordinarily troubling.\n  I was concerned last week when the President said it was unlikely \nthat any guilt could be found; that it was unlikely this investigation \nwould prove to be productive. That, too, sent a chilling message to all \nof those who are investigating.\n  So these are very serious missteps that call into question whether \nthis investigation is going to be carried out in the deliberate, \nthoughtful, and thorough way it demands.\n  I think we ought to ask, Who is in control here? Why has somebody not \nbeen appointed to provide the answers to these questions and to deal \nwith these serious missteps? They get worse. The cloud of doubt hangs \nover the investigation.\n  Some have suggested there may be a coverup, but I think it is \nimportant for us to determine the facts, get the information, deal with \nthe eroding confidence people have in the quality of this \ninvestigation, and ultimately bring it to a successful conclusion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. From the statement the Senator has made, it is my \nunderstanding that out of the $87 billion the President has requested, \nthe Senator from South Dakota has said that some $21 billion will be \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq, not dealing with the military but for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq, and that someone is going to have to borrow \nthat money. It is a question, as I understood the Senator from South \nDakota, whether the taxpayers of America will borrow that money or \nwhether the people of Iraq, with their large oil reserves, will in \neffect borrow the money. Is that in fact what the Senator said?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada heard me exactly right. I was \ninterested in comments made earlier today that we really do not have to \nworry that much about the exploding deficit; that it is not that \nserious. Well, that is not what the CBO said.\n  About a month ago, the Congressional Budget Office noted that at \ncurrent rates the debt is not sustainable; that we are not going to be \nin a position to provide the kind of debt service ultimately, within \nthe course of the next 10 years, if nothing changes.\n  The debt we have already authorized is going to expire once again. We \nare going to have to increase the debt limit within the next several \nmonths. We are told by some groups outside the CBO that we could see a \ntotal Federal debt within 10 years of anywhere from 8 to 10,000 billion \ndollars.\n  That is right, 8 to 10,000 billion dollars. That is $8 trillion. That \namounts to somewhere in the vicinity of $70,000 to $75,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in the country. That is what we are facing right \nnow.\n  For us to say we are going to exacerbate that by borrowing even more \nto provide reconstruction assistance to Iraq is deeply troubling. They \nsit on perhaps the largest oil reserves in the world. It seems to me \nthose oil reserves ought to at least be considered. Even though they \nare not available today, at some point that oil can be tapped. If it \ncan be tapped, it seems to me it would make a lot more sense for us to \ncollateralize that oil than to borrow even more money, adding even \ngreater debt to every man, woman, and child in this country.\n  I appreciate very much the question of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I have a couple of questions for the minority \nleader. On the question of the debt, it is estimated that in the fiscal \nyear that just began, October 1, we are going to end up sending more \nthan we have coming in, in tax revenue this year to the tune of $600 \nbillion. That is over half a trillion dollars.\n  My question to the minority leader is this. I have gotten feedback \nfrom innumerable townhall meetings over this past week in my State of \nFlorida from people who are so concerned that by our not having the \nrevenue and therefore having to borrow that, they are not going to be \nable to get the expenditures of the Federal Government in areas such as \neducation, transportation, and health care. Would the minority leader \ncomment on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Florida is absolutely right. We are \nbeing told we cannot fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, which \nwould require about $6.5 billion, most of which goes to those who are \nspecial needs children. Over $6 billion of it goes to special needs \nchildren. We cannot afford that, we are told, because the money just is \nnot there. We are told we cannot afford the close to $1.9 billion our \nveterans need to fully fund the Veterans' Administration, for the \nhealth needs of the veterans, the very people returning from Iraq \ntoday. We are told the money is not available. We are told the money is \nnot available to fully fund a highway bill this year. I am told we \nwould need somewhere in the vicinity of $30 to $40 billion to fully \nfund the highway fund. We may not be able to do that because I am told \nthe money isn't there, so I am very troubled. We are told we don't have \nthe resources for funding of highways and housing and health care in \nAmerica, but we have the money to fund housing and highways and health \ncare in Iraq. That is something we have to confront a lot more \neffectively as we consider this legislation.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will further yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask the minority leader if \nhe would comment further after his clear statement of having five times \nrequested information about discrepancies in the White House with \nregard to the outing of a CIA agent. If I recall, when this fiasco \nbroke several weeks ago, there was an attempt to minimize it by stating \nthat the CIA employee was merely an analyst, not an operative. It is my \nsubsequent understanding that, to the contrary of that minimization, \nthe CIA agent whose identity was made public by someone in the \nadministration clearly was a very important operative, as reported, I \nbelieve, in the Washington Post.\n  Would the minority leader comment on the seriousness of this kind of \nouting, on the seriousness of it with regard to the security interests \nof the United States?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I answer the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida that, indeed, he is correct. So as not to further compound the \nproblem, I have made it a practice not to reference the agency with \nwhich she was associated. I think we have to be very sensitive about \nthat.\n  But not only was an agent outed but an agency within the CIA was \nouted as well, something that was not well known. So the depth of \ndamage, not only in exposing an individual but in exposing, as well, a \nkind of operation underway within the CIA is extraordinary in the \nmagnitude of concern that it ought to cause all of us.\n  It is all the more reason this investigation is so critical and why \nwe should do all that is possible to find out who may be responsible. \nFor the President to say it is unlikely we will ever come up with who \nit may have been, I think is deeply troubling because I think it is \ncritical that the laws be upheld and those responsible be prosecuted.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will further yield, it is also \nthis\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nSenator's understanding that this revealing of the identity of a \nspecial agent has so enraged the CIA and its employees that even though \nthere may be an attempted coverup of this in the White House, that it \nis likely this issue will continue to bubble to the surface; is that \nthe understanding of the minority leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have not had any specific report to that regard. But \nthe Senator from Florida has read many of the same news reports I have \nread, which indicate that CIA personnel take this very seriously, and \nthat to make light of it, to minimize it, to ignore it, to do whatever \nmay be now underway with regard to a questionable investigative effort, \nis a huge mistake and sets a dangerous and very troubling precedent as \nwe consider situations similar to this in the future.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Florida for his comments, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Madam President, I was under the understanding \nthat was leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Leader time had expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I see. Then, in deference to my colleague, I \nwill just make a couple of comments, and then I will certainly want to \nhear from my colleague who is one of the greatest orators in this \nChamber, the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have had a wonderful time \nthis past week in my State of Florida, over the course of 4 days, \nhaving about 25 townhall meetings, many of those townhall meetings in \nthe smaller communities and in some cases rural communities of our \nState. We have a State that has a wonderful blend of urban and rural. \nIndeed, the State of Florida, as we so well know in politics, is often \na deciding factor in a Presidential race because Florida has become a \nmicrocosm of the country as a whole, with many people moving to Florida \nfrom other parts of the country. Indeed, people are moving to Florida \nfrom other parts of the world, particularly the Western Hemisphere.\n  There have been very clear messages that have come to this Senator \nfrom Florida from the people of that State as expressed in these \ntownhall meetings in the past week. One of the clear concerns is that \npeople are uneasy with the fact that $87 billion is going to be spent \non the occupation in Iraq when there are so many needs here at home. As \nI would break down that $87 billion for the people in these townhall \nmeetings I would point out that $67 billion will be relatively \nnoncontroversial because that is money that goes to the support of our \nU.S. troops. What is at controversy is the $20 billion requested for \nreconstruction in Iraq. The World Bank says $70 billion will be needed. \nSo this is the first downpayment on $70 billion, and the administration \nis proposing that $20 billion come from the United States right now.\n  What is it for? It is for building of roads and bridges, it is \nbuilding schools, it is providing teachers, it is providing training of \nteachers, it is providing $800 million for the restoration of wetlands. \nIt is providing for all of the infrastructure such as water systems and \nroad systems and electrical systems.\n  As I would explain this, I would see people get very restive in these \ntownhall meetings, for they would say: Well, what about our needs for \nrestoring wetlands in Florida? What about our needs for building roads \nand bridges and repairing roads? What about our needs for money going \ninto education, just as the majority leader has talked about in the \n$6.5 billion that is needed to fully fund the No Child Left Behind \nAct--the disadvantaged kids.\n  What about the superintendents of the school systems who came to \nevery one of those townhall meetings and said not only did they need \nthat kind of assistance in their schools, but need resources to take \ncare of disabled kids, too?\n  What about the IDEA legislation, of fully funding it?\n  The clear message that came to me regarding the legislation we will \nbe considering here today on the infrastructure needs in Iraq and the \ninfrastructure needs of our people at home here in America.\n  We will be considering a number of amendments that do not have to be \nan either/or question because clearly it is in the interest of the \nUnited States to stabilize Iraq, and that we stabilize it politically \nand economically. But it doesn't have to be an either/or question. Iraq \nis sitting on the second largest deposit of oil reserves in the world. \nThere is going to be a revenue stream once that oil is up and producing \nat maximum capacity. There is going to be a huge revenue stream coming \nfrom that oil. One of the amendments we are going to consider is the \namendment to pledge future Iraqi oil revenue to pay back the $20 \nbillion the United States of America is going to provide for building \nup the infrastructure, including the $800 million for wetlands \nrestoration.\n  That is a clear message given to me from the folks who came to these \ntownhall meetings.\n  I will close with this, because I want to hear from the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  There was another bombing just a few minutes ago in Iraq. It was the \nbombing of the Turkish Embassy in Baghdad. It is clearly at first blush \nmy impression that this is an attempt at intimidation of the Turks \nbecause they have indicated they were considering in their Parliament \nthe sending of troops to assist United States troops in Iraq.\n  There was another bombing yesterday. We are having, on average, one \nbombing a day, and/or the killing of U.S. and Iraqi civilian personnel. \nIraq has become a magnet for terrorists.\n  It is clearly in America's interests to stabilize Iraq. Yet, where is \nthe attempt of the White House and this administration to reach out to \nthe international community at the behest of bipartisan voices in this \nChamber? Many of those bipartisan voices come from the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee saying you don't want just an American face as an \noccupier in Iraq; that what you want is an international face; that \nthis is an international problem and not just America's problem; and we \nhave to turn Iraq around from being a magnet for terrorists.\n  It is my hope the administration will finally start listening to \nRepublicans and Democrats in this Chamber who have not only argued but \nwho have pled for an international approach to stabilize Iraq.\n  Look at the experience in Bosnia. We are finally getting Bosnia \nstabilized. But it has taken 8 years. The United States had to go into \nBosnia first. But then we were able to bring in the world community, \nincluding the United Nations. That can be a good model for us, but it \nis also a realistic model to realize that it is going to take a lot of \ntroops and it is going to take a lot of time.\n  With that somber note, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Madam President. I thank the Senator \nfrom Florida for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12488-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12488-S12490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOB LOSS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as Senator Nelson did, I went back to my \nState of Illinois during the past week and really went from one end of \nthe State to the other. I visited with the chambers of commerce, labor \nunions, community leaders, hospital administrators, and average people, \nand talked about things that are on their minds. What struck me was the \nagenda of America is not the agenda of Congress. I can't get over it. \nWe return here to Washington to discuss important matters but, frankly, \nignore the essentials\n\n[[Page S12489]]\n\nas far as families and businesses across America.\n  The number one issue, of course, is jobs. My State has been hit so \nhard by this recession. We have lost 3 million jobs nationwide under \nPresident Bush's administration. It is the largest loss of private \nsector jobs under any President since the Great Depression--the largest \nloss of jobs under the Bush administration since Herbert Hoover during \nthe Great Depression. Clearly, there has been a lack of economic \nleadership by this President. Clearly, his plan for the economy of \nAmerica has failed. Giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America \ncertainly wins applause at the country club, but it doesn't create jobs \non Main Street--not in Illinois, not in Florida, not in Maine, and not \nacross America. We have seen such a dramatic loss of jobs in important \nsectors. Although the manufacturing sector in America only represents \nabout 14 percent of the jobs in our country, 75 percent of the jobs \nlost under the Bush administration have been in this manufacturing \nsector--14 percent of the total manufacturing and 75 percent of the \nBush job loss has been in manufacturing. It has hit my State \nparticularly hard. Illinois has lost over 123,600 manufacturing jobs \nsince President Bush was sworn into office, including 23,000 this year. \nFrankly, those are good-paying jobs--jobs people need to raise their \nfamilies. They are not minimum wage jobs. These are jobs you count on \nto buy a home or to send a child to college. They are gone. They have \ngone overseas, primarily to China.\n  I have heard over and over as I traveled across my State that it is \njust the tip of the iceberg. A lot of people say, Senator, you talk \nabout manufacturing jobs. As bad as that is, we are losing service \nsector jobs, too.\n  I came across an illustration in downstate Illinois in a medium-sized \ncity, which I will not name for the sake of the hospital administrator \nwho told me the following. If you come into my hospital in the middle \nof the night and need an x ray, we will take your x ray in the middle \nof the night in a downstate Illinois hospital. Then we will transmit it \nelectronically to Australia for it to be read because there is no \nradiologist on duty. The x ray is read in Australia for people showing \nup at the emergency room in downstate Illinois. He said, When the \ndoctors dictate the notes for the patients' records every day, those \ndictation tapes are sent electronically to India where they are \ntranscribed. This is a downstate hospital.\n  Go to Florida, go to Maine, or go to Nevada, and ask the question, \nask your people if they received a phone call last night about changing \ntheir long distance telephone services. Ask them to stop and ask the \nperson where they are calling from. Do not be surprised if that person \nis calling from India.\n\n  We are seeing an outmigration of jobs from the United States--\nmanufacturing jobs and service jobs. This administration is oblivious. \nWhat they have suggested is to create one job in the Department of \nCommerce to try to figure out why America is losing jobs. I can tell \nyou why we are losing jobs. It is because we have an economic policy \nthat has failed--tax cuts for the wealthy. All it has done is give us a \nhistoric, massive deficit by taking money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund--money that could be spent on education and health care \nwhich is just not there.\n  The second reason is this administration refuses to confront trade \nrealities. I have voted to expand trade. I believe in trade but only if \nthere are rules and the rules are followed. The rules aren't being \nfollowed in China. China today has a currency valuation that gives it a \n15-40 percent advantage over any American manufacturer. Go around your \nState and ask these small manufacturers. They cannot compete because \nthis administration will not confront China because of political \nrealities: We need China; We need them to sit down with North Korea and \navoid a nuclear war. So we are afraid to confront them when it comes to \ntrade reality. We lose businesses and jobs permanently because of the \nlack of leadership of this administration. That is a fact.\n  The second issue which I have found to be overwhelmingly and \ncompletely ignored by this Congress and this administration is the cost \nof health insurance. I invite any of my colleagues to meet with any \nbusiness leader in any State in America and ask them what their number-\none problem is. It is not going to be the so-called ``death tax.'' It \nis not going to be government regulation. It isn't going to be \nenvironmental regulation protection. It is going to be the cost of \nhealth insurance. It is killing these businesses. They cannot afford it \nany longer. They tell me over and over. You know what is happening? \nMore and more Americans have been shoved off the rolls with no \nprotection. Those who stay on are expected to pay more out of pocket \nand get less protection. What has this administration said about the \ncost of health insurance in America? Zero; nothing; nada. This \nadministration has no response when it comes to the cost of health \ninsurance.\n  There is one area, though, where they have been pretty vocal. They \nhave stood up for the pharmaceutical industry, which is one of the main \ndrivers in the cost of health insurance, to make sure they can continue \nto charge the highest prices in the world for the most vulnerable \nAmericans here at home. That is their philosophy. Let the marketplace \nwork this out.\n\n  I have news for them. The marketplace is working this out. Health \ninsurance companies exist to make a profit. They make a profit by \ncutting costs and increasing profits. That is what is happening. They \nhave cut their costs by taking sick people and pushing them off the \nrolls and reducing the coverage of those already on the rolls and \ncharging higher premiums. Businesses in America are getting nailed with \nhealth insurance premiums. But back to the trade issue: Every extra \ndollar in health insurance is embedded in the cost of the product that \nis sold. If it is a car or a computer, included in that cost is the \ncost of health insurance in America. And this administration, the Bush \nadministration, and this Congress, dominated by the Republican \nleadership, refuse to even address this issue.\n  The third issue we will debate this week is the war in Iraq. Now, I \nwill repeat--although it is now a cliche, it is true--we will stand \nbehind our troops and give them what they need, but when we look at \nwhat this administration is proposing for the reconstruction of Iraq, \nit really does betray a lack of preparation and a lack of thoughtful \nreflection on what we are dealing with.\n  What is the nation of Iraq? Iraq is a nation, if we can use that term \nloosely, that was conceived in the mind of a British colonial empire. \nThey drew a line on the map and said, We will call this spot Iraq. We \nwill put within those borders two warring Muslim factions; and just for \ngood measure, let's include hundreds of thousands of Kurds who do not \nwant to be there. And we will call this Iraq. Because this situation, \nwhich they called a nation, was almost unruly and unmanageable, first \nthey had a king, followed by a ruthless dictator. It took that kind of \niron will to maintain this country.\n  Now this President says, with the $87 billion, we are going to \nestablish an economy, a civil society, and a democracy in Iraq.\n  Excuse me, this is a long-term undertaking. To take a group of people \nwith no history of nation state, with no history of self-governance, \nand say to them, America can send enough money to make you a nation, \nperhaps we can, but it will be a great expense to the people of this \ncountry, a great expense to Americans who need help in their schools.\n  I heard the same thing the Senator from Florida heard--no child left \nbehind, President Bush's great idea. I voted for it. Perhaps the \nSenator did, too. The money is not there. It is not there because the \nPresident says we cannot afford it. We have to send money to Iraq. We \nhave to build schools in Iraq.\n  I am sorry, I am one who supports foreign aid. I voted for it. I \nbelieve in it. But I didn't support this war. I didn't give the \nPresident the authority he asked for on the use-of-force resolution. I \nsaid, and others did as well--23 Senators voted as I did--it is easier \nto get in a war than it is to get out of it. This President is learning \nthis bitter lesson. He comes to us for $87 billion, $20 billion for the \nrebuilding of Iraq. And that is not even half of what we expect will be \nneeded.\n  We are in for the long haul, to get up every single morning, to turn \non NPR\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\nand hear the news being led off by the story: Another American soldier \nkilled and more wounded.\n  Just so people understand the gravity of this, a wounded soldier is \nnot a flesh wound in all cases. Some of these soldiers, our best and \nbrightest in America, have lost limbs. Their lives have been damaged \nand changed forever. They are just listed as ``wounded.'' But those \nwounds go deep and those families and those soldiers will bear them for \nmany years to come.\n  That is where we are in this war in Iraq: This President ignoring the \neconomic realities of America with the loss of jobs, ignoring what has \nhappened because of the economic policy that has failed, refusing to \nacknowledge the cost of health insurance and these astronomical profits \nof the pharmaceutical companies, caving in to the special interests on \nCapitol Hill, ignoring the real people, the small businesses, the \nfamilies across America who ask us to stand up for them. Instead, we \nare going to send $87 billion to Iraq to try to build an economy there.\n  Sadly, we should start here. Let's build America's economy. Let's try \nto make sure we focus on what we need as a nation. This administration \nhas not done that. The American people will awaken to that. Congress \nshould as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. There are a number of strikes going on as we speak. The \nlatest started in Los Angeles with all the transit drivers. That is a \nresult of problems with health care. The problem with automobile \nmanufacturers, the other strikes going on in America involve one issue: \nhealth care. So the Senator's statement regarding health care and this \nadministration's total neglect is one of the most important domestic \nissues facing America today.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator's statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, through the Chair, this \nis a pervasive issue. It used to be you could separate on trade and \nhealth care, business on one side and labor on the other. If I took you \ninto a room and did not tell you the origin of a group in a room and \nyou listened to a business group on these issues of trade and health \ncare, you would think you were in the labor group. If you went to a \nlabor group, you would expect to hear some concerns about what trade \npolicy in this country has done and what health care does.\n  I find over and over again that these people are despairing. They are \ndespairing because they have been told by this administration, let the \nmarketplace solve the problem. The marketplace has not solved the \nproblem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12490-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am sure Senator Stevens \nwould have no objection to the Senator from New Mexico offering an \namendment. I yield the floor for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1830\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Madam President, so there is no question about the opportunity for \nothers to speak, I was asked if I would describe my amendment first and \nthen at the end of my description I will ask to set aside the pending \namendment and send my amendment to the desk. That is how I will \nproceed.\n  I intend to offer in a few minutes an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Lugar, Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Landrieu, Senator Lincoln, Senator Smith, and \nSenator Reid. This is an amendment to honor our service men and women \nin Iraq who are serving far from home, far from family, far from \nfriends.\n  Let me indicate from the title of the amendment that I intend to send \nto the desk what it would do: to authorize the award of the Iraqi \nLiberation Medal as a campaign medal for members of the Armed Forces \nwho serve in Southwest Asia in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  These service men and women, as we all know, have left the security \nof this country and their home behind to provide freedom and security \nfor those who have not known it for many years. The human cost has been \nsubstantial, over 300 American fighting men and women will never come \nhome. There are over 1,200 who will return wounded, far higher than \nprevious conflicts.\n  I have a chart that demonstrates the grim statistics, showing the \ncasualties our military has incurred in recent conflicts. In Operation \nDesert Storm, with which we are all familiar, the casualties, total \ndeaths were 382, killed in action, 143, and the wounded were 467. In \nthe Kosovo campaign, there were 16 deaths. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nas of last week, there were 196 killed in action, 309 total deaths, and \n1,268 wounds.\n  So the casualties have been significant. This is not a minor military \nactivity. We have over 130,000 troops in the region. They remain to \nensure that those who died and those who were wounded did not suffer \nand die in vain. They are also there to build a new Iraqi nation and to \nprovide stability and freedom in that nation.\n\n  The liberation of Iraq is turning out to be the most significant \nmilitary occupation and reconstruction effort, clearly, since the end \nof the Vietnam war and perhaps even before that. Despite their \nsacrifice and courage, these brave men and women will not, under \ncurrent policy, be specifically recognized for their service in Iraq. \nInstead, the Department of Defense has decided to award them a Global \nWar on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\n  This issue was drawn to my attention by an article that appeared in \nthe Army Times and the Navy Times and the Air Force Times called ``One \nSize Fits All?'' ``The Pentagon plans to award one medal for the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, and for any future campaigns related to the \nwar on terrorism.''\n  I believe this is a mistake in policy, that our military personnel \ndeserve better. Accordingly, my colleagues and I are offering this \namendment to correct the mistake by ensuring there is authorized an \nIraqi Liberation Medal in lieu of this Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal.\n  As all who have paid attention in the Senate know, some of us did not \nagree with the administration's decision to proceed in Iraq when it \ndid, but clearly we have all been united in our support of the troops. \nYoung men and women, both active-duty personnel and National Guard and \nReserve, have come forward and done their duty. That is clearly the \nessence of patriotism, and we all respect that.\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\n  They continue to serve even though they do not know when they will be \nreturning to their families and to their communities. They continue to \nserve despite the tremendous hardships they face and despite the \nconstant threat to their lives.\n  The President, of course, has agreed entirely with this view of the \nexemplary service our men and women have provided. He has made many \nstatements to that effect, and there is no partisan disagreement on any \nof that.\n  Let me put up another chart in the Chamber.\n  During Operation Desert Storm, service members received three \nseparate military decorations for their service: the Armed Forces \nExpeditionary Medal; the Liberation of Kuwait Medal, given by the \nGovernment of Saudi Arabia; and the Liberation of Kuwait Medal, given \nby the Government of Kuwait. Those are all three depicted on this \nchart.\n  In the case of Kosovo, our service men and women received the NATO \nService Medal and the Kosovo Campaign Medal. And those two medals are \ndepicted on this part of the chart.\n  In the case of this current conflict in Iraq, the proposal by the \nadministration is to give them the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, and that would apply to Operation Enduring Freedom \nor Operation Iraqi Freedom or any operation in the Philippines or any \nfuture global war on terrorism operation.\n  The policy as it now exists would say that if you are in the military \nand you are directed to duty in one or more of these operations, you \nget this generic medal which indicates you are part of the global war \non terrorism, which we know is of indefinite duration and which we know \nis not limited by any geographic limitation.\n  There is a difference--a substantial difference--between an \nexpeditionary medal on the one hand and a campaign medal. We only need \nto look at an excerpt from the U.S. Army Qualifications for the Armed \nForces Expeditionary Medal and the Kosovo Campaign Medal. In order to \nreceive the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, you do not need to go to \nwar, you only need to be ``placed in such a position that, in the \nopinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hostile action by a foreign armed \nforce was imminent even though it does not materialize.'' So that is an \nexpeditionary medal.\n\n  To earn the Kosovo Campaign Medal, there was a higher standard. A \nmilitary member had to either ``[b]e engaged in actual combat, or duty \nthat is equally hazardous as combat duty, during the Operation with \narmed opposition, regardless of time [spent] in the Area of \nEngagement.''\n  Many within the military agree there is a significant difference \nbetween an expeditionary medal and a campaign medal.\n  According to the Army Times:\n\n       Campaign medals help establish an immediate rapport with \n     individuals checking into a unit.\n\n  An expeditionary medal does not necessarily denote any combat or any \nreal connection to that particular area of potential combat. A campaign \nmedal is designed to recognize military personnel who have risked their \nlives or are risking their lives in combat.\n  Obviously, all of us want to see proper recognition given to our \nyoung men and women who are in Iraq, including Army SP Joseph Hudson \nfrom my home State of New Mexico, from Alamogordo, NM. He was held as a \nprisoner of war. The Nation was captivated, and particularly people of \nmy State were captivated, as we watched Specialist Hudson being \ninterrogated by the enemy on videotape. Asked to divulge his military \noccupation, Specialist Hudson stared defiantly into the camera and \nsaid: ``I follow orders.'' Those of us with sons and daughters were \nunited in worry with Specialist Hudson's family. The entire Nation \nrejoiced when he was liberated. He is just one of many who deserve this \nspecial recognition I am arguing for today.\n  We have also asked much of our Reserve and National Guard personnel. \nThe reconstruction of Iraq clearly would not be possible without the \ncommitment and sacrifice of the 170,000 Guard and reservists who are \ncurrently on active duty. As recently as this last week, an additional \n10,000 troops from Washington State and North Carolina were activated \nfor service in Iraq.\n  I think this is a straightforward amendment, one for which I hope we \ncan have very strong support. I am very pleased that it is being \nproposed as a bipartisan amendment. My colleagues and I are committed \nto appropriately honoring the 200,000 or so heroes who have served to \ndate or are serving in connection with the effort in Iraq. We believe \ncurrent administration policy does not properly honor those personnel, \nand therefore we propose that in lieu of this Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal, a new decoration that characterizes the real \nmission in Iraq--one that is distinctive and honors their sacrifice, \nsomething in the nature of an Iraqi Liberation Medal--be provided.\n  Some will argue that Congress has no business legislating in this \narea. But I point out there is ample precedent for what we are \nproposing. Congress has been responsible for recognizing the sacrifice \nand courage of our military forces throughout history. Congress has had \na significant and historically central role in authorizing \nmilitary decorations. Our Nation's highest decorations were authorized \nby Congress. Those include the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Air \nForce Cross, the Navy Cross, the Army's Distinctive Service Cross, the \nSilver Star, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. All of those were \nauthorized by Congress.\n\n  We have also authorized campaign and liberation medals similar to \nwhat is being proposed here in many cases. A partial list includes the \nSpanish War Service Medal, the Army Occupation of Germany Medal, the \nWorld War II Victory Medal, the Berlin Airlift Medal, the Korean \nService Medal, and the Prisoner of War Medal, in addition to the medals \nI have referred to already.\n  The men and women of our military are doing their jobs every day in \nIraq. We should do our job by honoring them appropriately with a medal \nthat is specific to their sacrifice and to this campaign in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nimmediately considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, \n     Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Reid, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1830.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the award of the Iraqi Liberation Medal as a \n campaign medal for members of the Armed Forces who serve in Southwest \n            Asia in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) According to President George W. Bush, Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom was ``fought for the cause of liberty, and for the \n     peace of the world . . .'' and ``to free a nation by breaking \n     a dangerous and aggressive regime''.\n       (2) The military victory in Iraq has been characterized by \n     President George W. Bush as one of the ``swiftest advances in \n     heavy arms in history''.\n       (3) There are more than 130,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, \n     and Marines of the United States serving in the Iraqi Theater \n     of Operations, far from family and friends, and for an \n     unknown duration.\n       (4) Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, almost \n     300 members of the Armed Forces of the United States have \n     died in Iraq and nearly 1,500 have been wounded in action.\n       (5) Congress has authorized and Presidents have issued \n     specific decorations recognizing the sacrifice and service of \n     the members of the Armed Forces of the United States in the \n     Korean War, the Vietnam conflict, and the liberation of \n     Kuwait.\n       (6) Current Department of Defense guidance authorizes the \n     award of only one expeditionary medal for overseas duty in \n     Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Iraq.\n       (7) The conflict in Iraq is significant enough in scope and \n     sacrifice to warrant a specific military decoration for the \n     liberation of Iraq.\n       (b) Authorization of Award of Campaign Medal.--The \n     Secretary concerned may award a campaign medal of appropriate \n     design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to any person who \n     serves in any capacity with the Armed Forces in the Southwest \n     Asia region in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (c) Name of Medal.--The campaign medal authorized by \n     subsection (b) shall be known as the ``Iraqi Liberation \n     Medal''.\n       (d) Prohibition on Concurrent Award of Global War on \n     Terrorism Expeditionary\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\n     Medal.--A person who is awarded the campaign medal authorized \n     by subsection (b) for service described in that subsection \n     may not also be awarded the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal for that service.\n       (e) Other Limitations.--The award of the campaign medal \n     authorized by subsection (b) shall be subject to such \n     limitations as the President may prescribe.\n       (f) Regulations.--(1) Each Secretary concerned shall \n     prescribe regulations on the award of the campaign medal \n     authorized by subsection (b).\n       (2) The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     not go into effect until approved by the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the \n     regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) are uniform, so \n     far as practicable.\n       (g) Secretary Concerned Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Secretary concerned'' means the following:\n       (1) The Secretary of the Army with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Army.\n       (2) The Secretary of the Navy with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard \n     when it is operating as a service in the Navy.\n       (3) The Secretary of the Air Force with respect to matters \n     concerning members of the Air Force.\n       (4) The Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to \n     matters concerning members of the Coast Guard when it is not \n     operating as a service in the Navy.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will not ask for the yeas and nays at \nthis point. At an appropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and nays. \nIt is important that the Senate go on record in support of the awarding \nof a medal of this type. I hope we can have a very strong vote on its \nbehalf.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been informed that the Department \nof Defense does not support the Bingaman amendment, the pending \namendment No. 1830. It has bipartisan support.\n  Let me explain to the Senate why there is opposition from the \nDepartment. At the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Presidential \nExecutive Order 132-89, dated March 12, 2003, authorized global war on \nterrorism, Expeditionary and Service Medals for members of the United \nStates Armed Forces who have served in military expeditions to combat \nterrorism around the world as defined by Department regulations on or \nafter September 11, 2001.\n  This was created and tailored to recognize both combat and noncombat \noperations not just in a single campaign or country but worldwide. To \nbe eligible for the Expeditionary Medal, service members must have \nserved within the area of eligibility. However, initially approved \noperations for Expeditionary Medals are Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Battle stars for the Expeditionary Medal are \nprovided for service members who engaged in combat against the enemy in \nthe area of eligibility. Because antiterrorism operations are global in \nnature, the area of eligibility for an approved operation may be deemed \nto be noncontiguous. The combatant commander has authority to award \nmedals for personnel deployed within his or her theater. There is a \nseparate medal called the Service Medal that provides commanders the \nflexibility of recognizing supporting personnel and will not be \nrestricted by geographical boundaries. Unlike the Expeditionary Medal, \nthe Service Medal includes not only support for Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom but also Operation Noble Eagle and \nairport security operations from September 27, 2001, to May 1, 2002.\n  The Department urges against the establishment of an Iraqi Freedom \nMedal for two reasons. First, it is redundant with the global war on \nterrorism medal in its purpose. Second, it is divisive in that it \nvalues participation in Operation Iraqi Freedom as being more worthy of \nindividual recognition than Operation Enduring Freedom. In other words, \nthere are people who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are \npeople who have served in Afghanistan and not Iraq, and Iraq and not \nAfghanistan.\n  The whole concept of this global war against terrorism is that there \nare also combatants in the Philippines and in Indonesia and other \nplaces throughout the world. I don't know how many there are, but I \nhave been told some of the global war on terrorism medals have been \nawarded.\n  The problem about the Bingaman amendment is, what happens to those \npeople who received those medals? Do they give them back? Do they also \nget an Iraqi medal of freedom? What happens to the people from \nAfghanistan? As I understand it, I could be wrong, but it covers only \nthe Iraqi liberation medal.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But not Afghanistan.\n  So the best advice I can give the Senate is this: If the Senator from \nNew Mexico wishes a vote, I certainly will not oppose that and will \njoin in requesting a vote. However, I will say no matter what happens \nhere, whether the Senate approves or disapproves, the subject matter \nwill have to be dealt with in conference because it is a matter that \nhas been raised, and it is of great significance.\n  I talk too much about my own service in World War II, which was sort \nof insignificant, but I got a CBI medal--China, Burma, India--but I \nspent only a day or two in India and an hour or two in Burma. We all \nthought we should have had a China medal, but the powers that be gave \nus a China-Burma-India medal. The powers that be right now are the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. This is not a political issue is what I am \ntrying to tell the Senate. This is an issue that arose out of an \ninitiative from the Joint Chiefs of Staff themselves, is what I \nunderstand.\n  They decided this current situation is so global in nature that \npeople are moved from one area to the other in terms of expertise and \nneed, that there ought to be a medal for the period we are in right now \nwhich is really a global war on terrorism, and as such I am inclined to \nsupport that concept. I will vote against the Bingaman amendment. But I \nhave a feeling it will pass because I think everyone would like to be \non record now of recognizing the need for medals.\n\n  That would be my last comment to the Senate. The Senator from Hawaii \nis not here, but I do remember on two occasions when I have been with \nhim when he has raised the question with the members of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff: Where are the medals?\n  People, as they come home from a combat such as we are involved in \nnow, may or may not be eligible for the Purple Heart. The concept of \nthese other medals, however, has not settled down yet. I think as our \nmen and women in the Armed Services start coming home, they should be \nrecognized for their service with something of distinction, such as the \nmedal of the type we are talking about, either the Global War on \nTerrorism Medal or the Expeditionary Medal, or the Service Medal, \nwhatever it is. As a matter of fact, if they have been there, I would \ngive them all three. Redundancy is not a crime in terms of medals for \nservice in uniform in combat, as far as I am concerned. But I do think \nit has to be sorted out. The people who already have the Global War on \nTerrorism Medal, who fought in Iraq, may want the Iraqi medal. On the \nother hand, people who fought in Afghanistan may very much want the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Medal. It is something I think really requires \npretty cautious thought in the Department of Defense and the Senate. I \nintend to join in asking for a vote on the amendment at the proper time \nand hope we can vote on it right after the vote that is set at 2:30 \ntoday, and then move on with further business of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the hour of 12:30 is fast approaching. I am \nwondering if we could enter into an agreement now that that vote occur \nimmediately following the vote on genetic nondiscrimination?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would so move and ask unanimous consent \nit be in order at this time to order the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. And that Senator Bingaman have 2 minutes prior to the vote \nto speak on his amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like 2 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. REID. Of course. With no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No other motions in order, and up or down on the \namendment. But I would like 2 minutes for\n\n[[Page S12493]]\n\nthe Senator from New Mexico and for myself, and the vote to occur after \nthe already scheduled vote. I ask that it be in order to ask for the \nyeas and nays now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order to request the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequest is agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I understand the \nSenate will stand in recess at 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation pending before the Senate \nis the emergency supplemental bill dealing with Iraq; and that has to \ndo with security: security for our troops, security in Iraq. But there \nare other issues of security that affect us in our country: issues of \nsecurity that deal with protecting our homeland. We provide critically \nneeded funds to try to prevent another terrorist attack on our soil.\n  So I was surprised, as I was traveling the other day, to hear the \nPresident talk about using Homeland Security assets to track down \nAmericans who are traveling in Cuba illegally and punishing those \nAmericans.\n  As you know, it is currently illegal for Americans to travel in Cuba, \nexcept by a license given by the U.S. Treasury Department. The fact is, \nthough, that there are many Americans who do go to Cuba. Many go \nbecause they think it is their right as Americans to travel freely, and \nin many cases, they go because they are not aware that they are \nbreaking any rules.\n  I believe the travel ban unfairly punishes American citizens. In an \nattempt to take a slap at Fidel Castro, it ends up restricting the \nright of American people to travel. Many of us here think that makes no \nsense at all.\n  When I heard the President describe his interest in having Homeland \nSecurity people track down American tourists traveling in Cuba, I \nthought I would come to the floor of the Senate, and talk about a \ngrandmother named Joan Slote. As you can see from this picture, Joan is \nin her mid 70s. She is a Senior Olympian. She is a bicyclist. She \nbicycles all over the world. She is in her mid 70s. And she joined a \nbicycle tour of Cuba, with a cycling club from Canada. They bicycled in \nthe country of Cuba for, I believe, 8 or 9 days.\n  Joan Slote came back to this country from Cuba, and later on she was \noff to Europe where she was on a bicycle tour. While she was in Europe, \nshe learned her son had brain cancer, and she rushed back to the United \nStates, and just stopped at her home for a minute, and then rushed down \nto be with her son and attended to her son, who later died of brain \ncancer.\n  When she finally came back to her home, apparently there was a letter \nwaiting for some long while from the U.S. Treasury Department that \nsaid: Oh, by the way, you traveled to Cuba with a bicycle club from \nCanada, and that was illegal, and so we are administering a $7,630 \nfine.\n  So Joan Slote, this mid 70s grandmother--no threat to this country \nfor sure--is one of those Americans who is now being punished by the \nU.S. Government for travel in Cuba.\n  Now, we have folks down at the Department of the Treasury in an \norganization called the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC for \nshort--and that is the organization that is charged with tracking money \nto terrorist groups to protect our country. But instead of focusing on \nthat critically important mission, OFAC officials are tracking retired \ngrandmothers who are riding a bicycle in Cuba and try to slap them with \na big fine.\n  And now the President says: Oh, by the way, I would like to get more \ninvolved here. I want the Homeland Security Department tracking these \npeople who are traveling to Cuba.\n  I thought our interest here in the Senate was to fund a Homeland \nSecurity agency to protect our country against the threats of \nterrorists, not to chase little old grandmothers who take a bicycle \ntrip to Cuba.\n  Incidentally, OFAC finally negotiated with a $2,000 fine for Joan \nSlote. After I intervened, they said: All right, the $7,600 fine we \nwill reduce to $2,000. So she sent them the money. But do you know what \nthey did then? They sent a collection agency after her and told her \nthey were going to begin to garnish her Social Security payments. Why? \nI do not have the foggiest idea. I guess it is just a bureaucratic \nmess.\n  But I was just thinking as I was driving down the road the other day, \nhearing President Bush say we have to get tough on Cuba, we are going \nto take Homeland Security people to go chase American tourists in Cuba.\n  The interesting thing is, Americans can travel virtually everywhere. \nYou can travel to Communist China. Yes, that is a communist country. \nYou can travel to Vietnam. Yes, that is a communist country. But you \ncannot travel to Cuba. And we are going to use Homeland Security \nassets--people, time, money--to go track down little old ladies who are \nbicycling in Cuba?\n\n  Are we really threatened by the poor guy who took the ashes of his \ndead father to Cuba, which was his father's last wish, to be sprinkled \non the lawn by the church where he ministered in Cuba many years \nbefore?\n  Yes, they tracked that fellow down for taking his dad's ashes to \nCuba. They fined him $7500.\n  It is story after story after story like this.\n  And now the President wants people in Homeland Security tracking \nAmericans to punish Americans for traveling in Cuba.\n  What about homeland security? How about tracking terrorists? Let's \ntrack terrorists, not retired grandmothers who are riding bicycles.\n  Marshall McLuhan once said: I don't always believe everything I say. \nI thought to myself, that must surely have been the case in the White \nHouse when the President announced we are going to take Homeland \nSecurity Agency resources and start tracking American citizens so we \ncan slap big fines on them for traveling into Cuba. This is \npreposterous. What on Earth can the President be thinking?\n  I have talked to Joan Slote. She is just one of many examples of \nordinary U.S. citizens who meant absolutely no harm. I have talked to \nanother retired grandmother from Wisconsin. She traveled to Cuba \ninnocently and rode a bicycle as well. I have talked to many such \nfolks. I held a hearing on this. I had people show up who described \ntheir travel to Cuba. They did not know it was illegal but--guess \nwhat--they have the Federal Government after them.\n  In an attempt to slap Fidel Castro, we are punishing American people. \nWe are restricting the right of the American people to travel. And now \nthe President gets into the act, which, I assume is about Florida \npolitics, and says, oh, by the way, I want to divert Homeland Security \nassets to see if we can't get tougher on people like Joan Slote.\n  This issue involves wasted resources, that could and should be spent \non real threats to our homeland security. Homeland security is about \nprotecting this country from the threat of terrorists, not chasing \nsenior citizens riding around on bicycles.\n  That is where the homeland security assets ought to be employed. That \nis where the Department of the Treasury assets ought to be employed, \nprotecting our country from the threat of terrorist attacks, not \nchasing Joan Slote. My hope is that perhaps they will have another \nmeeting at the White House and rethink this and finally do the right \nthing, at least meet some basic test of common sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12493-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided, followed by a vote on passage of the \nbill. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is important legislation. It has been 6 years in gestation. It \nis legislation which is not only important to our research community \nbut, more importantly, it is a major piece of civil rights legislation \nin that it protects people in their employment and in getting health \ncare.\n  Essentially, we are in a new world in the community of health care \nwhere you will actually be able to go to your doctor someday not too \nlong from now, and probably in some instances even today, and he will \nbe able to tell you some of the most severe illnesses projected for \nyour lifetime. That is called genetic information. It is great medical \nnews that we have moved this far, and there is a lot that will occur \nthat is positive as a result.\n  The other side of the coin is this information could be used \narbitrarily, unsuspectingly, or even intentionally to harm your \nemployment or your capacity to get health insurance. This legislation \ncorrects that concern. It makes it possible to continue genetics \nresearch without people having to be concerned about the way their \npersonal genetics information may be used. That is why it is important.\n  A lot of folks have worked very hard on this bill. Senator Kennedy \nhas worked tirelessly to pass it. Senator Daschle has worked \naggressively to pass it. Senator Jeffords, when he was chairman of the \ncommittee, worked very hard.\n  On our side of the aisle, Senator Enzi has made a major contribution \nin the area of employment, and Senator Snowe was one of the originators \nof the initiative.\n  At this point, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see one of the primary sponsors, the \nSenator from Maine. I will withhold and make comments when she \nfinishes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, chairman of the \ncommittee, whose guidance throughout this process ultimately culminated \nin this most significant piece of legislation. I express my \nappreciation to him and to the Senate majority leader, without whose \nleadership this legislation would not be possible, and to the \nDemocratic leader as well, and to Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and, \nof course, Senator Jeffords, who sponsored this effort with me some 7 \nto 8 years ago. I also acknowledge the presence of Representative \nSlaughter from New York who has led the effort in the House for \napproximately 8 years at this point.\n  This is the culmination of bipartisan efforts over the last 8 years \nand over the last 2 years of bipartisan negotiations where we were able \nto merge the differences between the legislation that I introduced and \nthat was introduced by Senators Daschle and Kennedy.\n  The fact is, since April of 1996, when I first introduced the Genetic \nNondiscrimination Health Insurance Act, science has continued to hurdle \nforward, further opening the door to early detection and medical \nintervention through the discovery and identification of specific genes \nlinked to diseases such as breast cancer, colon cancer, cystic \nfibrosis, and Huntington's disease. That 1996 legislation recognized \nthat with the progress in the field of genetics accelerating at a \nbreathtaking pace, we needed to ensure that with the scientific \nadvances to come, we would advance the treatment and prevention of \ndisease without advancing a new basis for discrimination.\n  Certainly everything changed with the unveiling of the first working \ndraft of our entire genetic code. It became all the more imperative \nthat we respond with legislation that would at once allow the \ntremendous promise of this breakthrough while at the same time protect \nthe American people from the dark side of discrimination.\n  Because there has been so many other scientific advancements this \ncarried with it, not only the prospect of scientific and medical \ndiscoveries, such as improved detection and earlier intervention, but \nalso the potential for harm and abuse, every day since--absent \nenactment of this type of legislation--has been a day we have left the \nfull potential of the human genome untapped.\n  This is no solution in search of a problem. To the contrary, the very \nreal fear of repercussions from one's genetic makeup was specifically \nbrought home to me through the real-life experience of one of my \nconstituents, Bonnie Lee Tucker. Bonnie wrote to me about the fear of \nhaving the BRCA test for breast cancer. She was in a family who had \nnine members with breast cancer. She herself is a survivor. She feared \nhaving the BRCA test because she worried it would ruin her daughter's \nability to obtain health insurance in the future.\n  I ask that everybody support this legislation because, clearly, this \nis one of the most significant groundbreaking pieces of legislation we \ncould have in the area of medical health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  First, I thank my colleague and friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Gregg, for prioritizing this issue. It is a matter \nof enormous importance. I thank him and I thank Senator Snowe, who has \nbeen a leader on this issue for a number of years. This has truly been \na bipartisan effort. I also thank our majority leader, Senator Frist, \nalso a doctor, who understands this issue and has been very \ncooperative; Senator Enzi, who chairs a subcommittee in this area of \npolicy, has helped to advance this program. We are grateful for the \nstrong bipartisanship. I wish to recognize Congresswoman Slaughter, who \ninitiated the original legislation, and today we pay tribute to her.\n  Also, I thank our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, who, in 1997, was \nthe first person to introduce the comprehensive genetic discrimination \nprogram. Our friend, Senator Jeffords, has been an advocate for the \nelimination of genetic discrimination; Tom Harkin and Chris Dodd have \nbeen tireless advocates to make sure we got to this particular day.\n  I am going to yield time to Senator Harkin in a minute.\n  In 1964, this Nation passed the important civil rights legislation to \nban discrimination in our society in employment and public \naccommodations, among other things. Then in 1965 we banned \ndiscrimination in voting. Then, in 1968, we passed legislation to ban \ndiscrimination in housing. Then, under the leadership of my friend from \nIowa, in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act passed to ban \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. We have also done much to \neliminate discrimination on ethnicity, on national origin, and we have \nmade enormous progress in discrimination on gender. We still have not \nmade enough progress on discrimination regarding gay and lesbian \nissues. Today, we are continuing the march toward equality in the \nUnited States, understanding the importance of eliminating \ndiscrimination based upon an individual's genetic makeup, in terms of \ninsurance and in terms of employment. We are doing it in a way that is \ngoing to guarantee real remedies. This is not just legislation that \nwill be out there and say we are against this form of discrimination; \nwe are providing real remedies. From now on, individuals will know that \nno matter what their genetic makeup or susceptibility to genetic \ndisease, they may not be discriminated against in the job place or in \nthe provision of health insurance.\n  This is a major continuing step toward greater equality and the \nelimination of bigotry and discrimination in our society. It is an \nimportant day in the Senate. I commend all of those and the staff for \nall they have done so well to make it possible.\n  I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nthe time. I join with him and others in thanking our leaders for \nbringing this\n\n[[Page S12495]]\n\nbill forward. I congratulate Senator Gregg, chairman of our committee, \nSenator Kennedy, ranking member on our side, Senator Snowe, and all the \nother Senators they have mentioned, who have worked so hard to get us \nto this point. Again, I thank the leadership for the vote today.\n  I was present sort of at the gestation period and finally the birth \nof the mapping and sequencing of the human genome. What a magnificent \nstep forward this was in terms of our understanding of the underlying \nbasis for many of our diseases and illnesses. This feat of sequencing \nand mapping of the 3.1 billion base pairs of the human genome, \nsometimes called ``the book of life,'' opens up a world of \npossibilities for preventing and curing disease. New genetic tests take \nthe concept of early detection and treatment of disease to levels that \nwere previously only imagined but are now scientifically possible. \nDiscoveries have been made about the genetic basis of many diseases, \nsuch as heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and asthma. Tests \nare already available for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, \nand several other diseases.\n  But while the potential medical and health benefits of this new \ntechnology seem limitless, they cannot be pursued without caution and \nsafeguards against abuse, such as discrimination by health insurers or \nemployers. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, before us \nnow, addresses these possible abuses. It establishes protections \nagainst discrimination based upon genetic information both in health \ninsurance and employment. It is a gigantic step forward, as Senator \nKennedy said, in making sure people are not discriminated against \nsimply because of what their genes are.\n  While this bill doesn't include everything I believe it should have \nincluded, it is a significant step forward for the American people and \nfor our health care system. Under this bill, individuals will finally \nbe protected from discrimination by health insurers or employers based \non genetic makeup. Everybody will have the peace of mind to seek \nanswers to questions about themselves without fear of losing their \nhealth insurance or their job.\n  I commend those leaders who have brought this forward and yield back \nwhatever time I may have remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, 50 years ago James Watson and Francis Crick \ndiscovered the structure of the DNA molecule--the blueprint of life. \nTheir discovery laid the foundation for predicting and treating the \nhereditary diseases that threaten us.\n  The completion of the Human Genome Project in April 2003 was a \nsignificant step towards this goal. Because of the work of these \nscientists, we now are able to decipher the exact sequence of the \ngenetic code. This knowledge will allow earlier detection and more \neffective treatment of genetic illnesses.\n  However, genetic information brings challenges along with promise. \nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will ensure that the \npromise of genetic information is not hindered by fears about its \nmisuse. This legislation will protect individuals from discrimination \nin health insurance and employment on the basis of genetic information.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for crafting a bill \nthat fairly and effectively protects people against genetic \ndiscrimination. In doing so, we have been mindful of existing \ndiscrimination and privacy laws and regulations. While the issue is \ncomplex, our objective is clear: to encourage people to seek genetic \nservices by reducing fears about the misuse or unwarranted disclosure \nof genetic information.\n  Today, we mark the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick's historic \ndiscovery with the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination \nAct. With each new advance in genetic science, the significance of this \nlegislation grows. By allaying fears about genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance and in the workplace, this legislation will save lives \nnow and in generations yet to come.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is high time we have a strong \ngenetic information protection law on the books. The Senate bill I am \nvoicing support for today is a step in the right direction. However, \nwhile I am pleased to join a bipartisan effort to pass S. 1053, the \nGenetics Information Nondiscrimination Act, I hold out hope that the \nenforcement provisions in the bill can be strengthened prior to final \npassage. The House of Representatives will soon be conducting hearings \non the unanimously-passed Senate legislation and will be working to \ncraft their own version of the law. I sincerely hope that the House \nworks to strengthen--not weaken the bill. One area where the bill can \nbe strengthened is to give some real teeth to the enforcement \nprotections. If our goal of limiting discrimination based on genetic \ninformation is to be realized, we must work to ensure that those whom \nwe seek to protect can truly use this law to guard against \ndiscriminatory actions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, over the past decade, the science of \ngenetics has developed at an astonishing pace. The mapping of the human \ngenome is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific achievements of my \nlifetime. We have not even completely grasped the wide array of \npotential benefits that may come from our newfound genetic knowledge. \nCertainly, the impact on our health will be profound. Doctors will be \nable to read our unique genetic blueprints and predict the likelihood \nof developing diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's. \nThey will also be able to use an individual's genetic information to \ndevelop treatments for these same diseases and target individuals with \nthe treatment that will work best for them. This is not science \nfiction--it is already beginning to happen.\n  For all the promise of the genetic age, there is also an inherent \nthreat. Science has outpaced the law and Americans are worried, and \nrightly so, that their genetic information will be used, not to improve \ntheir health, but to deny them health insurance or employment. There is \nno information more personal and private than genetic information and \nno information more worthy of special protection. Our genetic code is \nthe very blueprint of ourselves. It is with us from birth, and to some \nextent it determines who we will become. What an incredibly powerful \ntool, with its vast potential to help us live healthier lives. But the \nnature of genetic information also makes it dangerous to the individual \nif used incorrectly.\n  This is why so many of us, on both sides of the aisle, saw the need \nseveral years ago for legally enforceable rules to maximize the \npotential benefits of genetic information and minimize its potential \ndangers. The legislation before use represents a culmination of the \nefforts of many of us to establish such rules. It represents an \nenormous step forward, and I wish to acknowledge the hard work of \neveryone who was involved in crafting this legislation.\n  This bill provides significant new protections against the misuse of \ngenetic information. It ensures that Americans who are genetically \npredisposed to health conditions will not lose or be denied health \ninsurance, jobs, or promotions based on their genetic makeup. Reaching \nan agreement on this legislation means that our laws dealing with \ngenetic information can begin to catch up to the reality of our \ntechnological capability in the field.\n  With these protections in place, individuals need not feel reluctant \nto get the tests that may save or improve their lives. Although the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, took important steps towards \npreventing genetic discrimination, this legislation is more \nspecifically tailored to prohibiting its misuse. Health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers will not be allowed to underwrite, determine \npremiums, or decide on eligibility for enrollment based on genetic \ninformation. Employers will not be allowed to alter hiring practices \nbased on genetic information. The American public can feel secure in \nthe knowledge that their genetic blueprint will not be used to harm \nthem, that a genetic marker indicating a possible illness later in life \nwill not cause them to lose a job or health insurance.\n  This is by no means a perfect or complete bill. In particular, while \nit poses some important limitations on the collection of personal \ngenetic information\n\n[[Page S12496]]\n\nby insurance companies, it would allow them to collect this \ninformation, without consent, once an individual is enrolled in a \nhealth plan. While insurers are expressly prohibited from using this \ninformation for the purposes of underwriting, I am concerned that once \nthey have this information, it may be difficult to control how it is \nused and who has access to it. We all know from experience that the \ndifficulty of protecting information increases exponentially with each \nadditional person who has access to that information.\n  Let me add that, during negotiations, good faith attempts were made \non both sides to address these concerns. Unfortunately, we could not \nreach an agreement on this issue that made all parties comfortable. As \na result, the bill falls short of offering comprehensive privacy \nprotection. Personal genetic information is already widely available, \nand the risk of abuse is high. Health plans and employers will have \nlegitimate reasons for collecting genetic information. But individuals \nshould be given the power to regulate how such information is \ndistributed, and with whom it is shared. As this bill becomes law, and \nI sincerely hope it will, I will monitor closely how it is implemented, \nand the extent to which privacy is protected. We may need to revisit \nthis issue in the future.\n  Despite this shortcoming, I support this bill, as it represents a \nvast improvement over current law in many ways. I hope that it will \nbecome law in the very near future. We all should feel free to make our \nhealth care decisions based on our health care needs, not based on \nfear. Today, we are close to making that goal a reality.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, S. 1053 has the laudatory goal of \nprohibiting genetic discrimination. Genetic discrimination has many \nvictims, and their stories are wrenching. There are those who cannot \nget coverage, as well those who lost job opportunities. But I want to \nmake sure we don't forget another category of victims--those who forego \nimportant tests out of fear that they will be victimized. According to \na recent JAMA article, 57 percent of patients at risk for breast and \novarian cancer declined a needed genetic test that could have guided \nprevention and treatment interventions. That is why our goal should \nhave been jot just to pass a bill, but to pass a credible bill so that \npeople have enough confidence in our work to go our and get the health \nservices they need.\n  Unfortunately, I am concerned that the enforcement provisions of S. \n1053, particularly in health insurance, are not strong enough to \naccomplish the legislation's goal.\n  Our Nation has made significant investments in genetic research. This \nresearch could one day lead to cures or preventions for diseases such \nas cancer. This investment in genetic research will prove futile if the \nresult is not better health care. Individuals must participate in \ngenetic research if this Nation is to reap the rewards of our \ninvestment and individuals must have confidence in the results of \ngenetic research in order to address their personal health issues. \nHowever, as genetic information is increasingly revealed, great harm \ncan occur. As President Bush acknowledged in his June 23, 2001 radio \naddress:\n\n       This knowledge of the code of life has the potential to be \n     abused. Employers could be tempted to deny a job based on a \n     person's genetic profile. Insurance companies might use that \n     information to deny an application for coverage, or charge \n     excessive premiums.\n\n  Americans have already shown that they will not fully participate in \ngenetic research or take advantage of genetic technologies until they \nbelieve that they are protected against genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance and employment. Without protection, patients fear \ndisclosing their family history, yet this hesitancy may impact the care \nthat they and their families receive.\n  As you recognize, genetic information is uniquely personal \ninformation. It is fundamentally different from other medical \ninformation. Because genetic information can be used against an \nindividual and an entire family, it enables a new form of \ndiscrimination. It deserves strong enforcement and should not be \ntreated the same as other information in a medical record.\n  In order for S. 1053 to achieve its purpose, individuals must have \nconfidence in its enforceability. That confidence will be difficult to \ninstill without mechanisms such as access to a court or comparable \nforum to seek redress for violations of the statute. In addition, it is \nimportant that the public feel confident that violations are unlikely. \nThis reassurance can only come from legislating strong enforcement and \ndeterrence mechanisms. I would have liked to see the enforcement \nmechanisms and remedies in S. 1053 strengthened to provide for \ncompensation for economic and non-economic damages and strong punitive \nprovisions. If there is no redress for individual harm and if nominal \nfees are the only accountability mechanism in place, there is little to \ndeter health insurers and employers from using genetic information in \nviolation of the law.\n  However, I believe that this bill does make a start in the direction \nof supporting the principle that advances in science should help move \ncivilization forward, not to reverse our progress. Discrimination based \non genetic information would be a step backward for civil rights and \nhuman dignity. That is why I support action today to begin addressing \nthis issue, and hope that in the future we will reinforce today's \naction with improvements to secure justice and civil rights for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today's consideration of S. 1053, the \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, is the result of almost 6 \nyears of effort, so I am especially pleased that we are here today to \nconsider and pass this bipartisan legislation. For the first time, S. \n1053 will prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their \ngenetic make-up in both health insurance and employment. This \nlegislation represents a major contribution to civil rights law. It is \na victory for consumers, health insurers and health care providers; and \nit is a victory for employees and employers.\n  The issue of genetic nondiscrimination has concerned me for many \nyears, and I have been pleased to work with many members of the Senate \nto craft this legislation. The measure we are considering today is the \nresult of many years of effort and the contributions of many \nindividuals. It is an example of the progress that can be made when the \nSenate seeks to negotiate and compromise on a bipartisan basis.\n  Together with the much deserved excitement over the potential of \ngenetic research there have also been long standing concerns that \ngenetic information, in the wrong hands, could be misused. Many people \nhave argued that an individual's genetic information--that might \nindicate a predisposition to a particular disease--could be used to \ndeny that individual health insurance or employment opportunities. The \npromise of better health would instead become a potential for greater \ndiscrimination and disadvantage. The Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2003 is designed to address those concerns.\n  Existing antidiscrimination law has been enacted over the years as a \nmeans of correcting long-standing abuses in voter rights, employment, \nhousing and education. But under current law a person who has suffered \nemployment or health insurance discrimination because of their genetic \nmakeup has very little, if any, recourse to legal remedies. This \nlegislation addresses this problem by creating new enforceable rights \nfor individuals similar to those available under existing civil rights, \neducation and fair employment law.\n  It is important to note that to date, there has not been a pattern or \nclear prevalence of genetic discrimination. But there is anecdotal \nevidence that people have refused to take genetic tests because of \ntheir fear that the predictive information would lead to \ndiscrimination. We know the science is rapidly moving forward and we \nare learning more every day about the ``predictive'' correlation \nbetween genetic markers and certain diseases. It is not difficult to \nimagine such discrimination occurring in the near future. So in a \nsense, we can take that rare opportunity to be ahead of the curve and \nenact legislation to preempt discriminatory practices and prevent them \nfrom ever happening.\n  I believe the compromise legislation we consider today will be \nsuccessful in preventing abuses in the insuring of health services and \nemployment. However, we must remain vigilant against this type of \ndiscrimination from ever\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\ngetting a foothold in our society and if this measure proves \ninsufficient and needs to be strengthened then we will be back and that \neffort will have my support.\n  There are many Members who have played a significant role in bringing \ntogether two different, though similar bills. My friend, Senator Snowe, \nled one effort in which I was proud to join together with Senators \nFrist, Enzi, Collins, and Hagel. In another effort, Senator Daschle was \njoined by Senators Kennedy, Dodd, and Harkin. That measure focused \nattention on the need for employment provisions and contributed to a \nbetter understanding of the many critical and complex definitions. \nFinally, I want to salute Senator Gregg, who as chairman of the HELP \nCommittee devoted his energies to finding a middle ground that has made \nthis legislation possible.\n  I am pleased at the willingness both sides have shown to work through \nthe many difficult aspects of this key issue. Through many meetings and \ndiscussions we have been able to reach agreements on many important \nissues, and improve the legislation. I look forward to continuing this \ncooperative approach as we move to enact this important and landmark \ninitiative and I urge our colleagues in the House to pass it as well. \nThis legislation is supported by the President and it is my hope that \nwe can enact it into law before the end of this Congress. I urge all of \nour colleagues to vote in its favor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering legislation designed to prohibit discrimination in health \ninsurance and employment based on genetic information.\n  In the last decade, biomedical researchers have made great strides in \ngenetic research. While these discoveries are critical to researching \ntreatments and, ultimately, discovering cures for many diseases, this \ninformation also has the potential to be used to deny health care \ninsurance or employment to an individual who has a genetic \npredisposition to an illness. That is why we must make it illegal for \nemployers and health insurers to discriminate against individuals on \nthe basis of their genetic information.\n  S. 1053 is an important step, but it is only a first step. Any \nlegislation addressing this issue must include strong enforcement and \ndeterrence mechanisms. As this legislation moves forward, I hope its \nenforcement provisions will be strengthened. Without strong \naccountability provisions, there is little to deter employers and \nhealth insurers from using genetic information inappropriately.\n  In addition, I hope that when this legislation is conferenced, the \nconferees will find ways to strengthen the privacy provisions. It is \nessential that our laws keep pace with technological advances and that \nwe continue to protect the privacy of our citizens. Advances in \ntechnology cannot place fundamental American rights at risk.\n  Despite my concerns about the enforcement and privacy provisions, I \nbelieve this legislation is a critical first step and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to continue addressing the important issue \nof genetic discrimination.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, the Senate came together to pass \nS. 1053, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I cast my vote \nin favor of this bill because I think it takes an important first step \nin the right direction. It is my view, however, that the bill does not \ngo far enough. I commend my colleagues for their efforts to craft a \nbipartisan compromise, but I have serious concerns that the final bill \ndoes not include adequate enforcement provisions.\n  The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prevents employers and \ninsurance companies from treating individuals differently because of \ntheir genetic predispositions. It stops a health insurance company, for \nexample, from charging an individual a higher premium because her \nmother had breast cancer.\n  S. 1053 does not, however, have adequate enforcement provisions. \nThere is no recourse for individuals who feel that their rights under \nthe law have been violated. There is no opportunity for a person to \nhold his employer accountable for genetic discrimination in a court of \nlaw. The current accountability provisions, which consist of nominal \nfees, are not sufficient in order to protect individuals who have been \ntreated unfairly because of a genetic predisposition.\n  Therefore, I voted for this bill with some reluctance. I was very \npleased to see this issue addressed in the Senate, but concerned that \nthe language of the bill does not adequately protect the people for \nwhom it was written. I hope that there will be opportunities in the \nfuture to strengthen this bill and ensure the rights of victims of \ngenetic discrimination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act of 2003, a bill that will prohibit \ndiscrimination based on genetic information with respect to employment \nand health insurance. This bill represents much cooperation on the part \nof my colleagues, and I want to recognize Senators Snowe, Frist, \nJeffords, Daschle, Kennedy, and also HELP Committee Chairman Gregg, for \nall the hard work done on this important issue.\n  I am extremely pleased with today's passage of the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act, as it marks a great milestone for \nthose of us involved in the Human Genome Project. It seems only a short \ntime ago that the Human Genome Project was created as a joint effort \nbetween the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. \nWhat progress we have made.\n  In the last two years, there have been many events celebrating the \ncompletion of maps of the human genome. The genome map has brought a \npromise of improved health through revolutionary new treatments for \nillness and disease. The ultimate result of mapping the human genome is \na complete genetic blueprint, a blueprint containing the most personal \nand most private information that any human being can have. We will now \nhave a wealth of knowledge of how our countless individual traits are \ndetermined. And perhaps more important, we will have fundamental \nknowledge about the genes that can cause sickness and sometimes even \ndeath.\n  Our personal and unique genetic information is the essence of our \nindividuality. Our genetic blueprint is unique in each of us. However, \nas genetic testing becomes a more frequently used tool, we now must \nbegin to address the ethical and legal issues regarding discrimination \non the basis of genetic information. Questions regarding privacy and \nconfidentiality, ownership and control, and consent for disclosure and \nuse of genetic information need to be carefully considered.\n  An unintended consequence of this new scientific revolution is the \nabuses that have arisen as a result of our gathering genetic \ninformation. Healthy people are being denied employment or health \ninsurance because of their genetic information. By addressing the issue \nof nondiscrimination, we are affirming the right of an individual to \nhave a measure of control over his or her personal genetic information.\n  Genetic information only indicates a potential susceptibility to \nfuture illness. In fact, many individuals identified as having a \nhereditary condition are, indeed, healthy. Some people who test \npositive for genetic mutations associated with certain conditions may \nnever develop those conditions at all. Genetic information does not \nnecessarily diagnose disease; yet, many people in our society have been \ndiscriminated against because other people had access to information \nabout their genes, and made determinations based on this information \nthat the individual was too risky to insure or unsafe to employ.\n  While the issue is complex, our objective is clear; people should be \nencouraged to seek genetic services and they should not fear its \ndiscriminatory use or disclosure. The Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act is an important first step towards protecting \naccess for all Americans to employment and health services regardless \nof their genetic inheritance. There is simply no place in the health \ninsurance or employment sector for discrimination based solely upon \ngenetic information.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the remaining time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of the administration's \npolicy be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12498]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration is committed to enactment of legislation \n     to prohibit genetic discrimination in health insurance and \n     employment. The Administration supports S. 1053, which would \n     bar health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy \n     individual or charging the person higher premiums based \n     solely on a genetic predisposition to developing a disease in \n     the future. The bill also would prohibit employers from using \n     individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, \n     job placement, or promotion decisions.\n       The Administration wants to work with the Congress to \n     ensure that individuals can be certain that they are \n     protected against the improper use of genetic information. \n     Unwarranted use of genetic information, and the fear of \n     potential discrimination, threatens both society's ability to \n     use new genetic technologies to improve human health and the \n     ability to conduct the very research needed to understand, \n     treat, and prevent diseases. Enactment of Federal legislation \n     will help guarantee that the Nation fully realizes the \n     potential of ongoing advances in genetic sciences.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is important to know that President \nBush, in 1997, while the governor of Texas, signed a law prohibiting \ngenetic discrimination. He also went to the Nation in a radio address \non June 23, 2001 and supported the elements included in this law. We \nhave a very strong Statement of Administration Policy in support of \nthis program.\n  We thank the President for his strong support and we will work with \nour Republicans friends to try to make sure this message goes to the \nHouse of Representatives and that they respond in a similar way.\n  I hope we will have an overwhelming vote in the Senate today. It is \none of the most important bills we will consider this Congress.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis aggressive and effective leadership on this issue. I also thank the \nDemocratic leader, who played a major role in this, Senator Harkin, who \nhas been working on this issue for many years, and, of course, Senator \nFrist, also, because he has made this a priority and that is why we are \non the floor. This is an issue in which he obviously has a personal \ninterest, with his medical background.\n  We should also thank one of the groups that really energized this \ninitiative of making lives better through developing the human genome \nand that is the folks at NIH, led by Dr. Francis Collins. They are the \nones who are going to take this knowledge and disseminate it in a way \nthat makes it available to the health community generally and, as a \nresult, improve the lives of literally millions of Americans and \npotentially tens of millions of people around the world.\n  This is truly an extraordinary breakthrough in science, but it is \nimportant that it be used right and it is important that it not be used \nin a way that may harm individuals' economic well-being or their \ncapacity to get health insurance. That is why this legislation, at the \nbeginning, is so important. By having it in place, we will be able to \nenergize even more research and more use of the genetic information \nthat is available through science today.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready to vote. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has time remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also thank Judy Lichtman, who is president of the \nCoalition for Genetic Fairness. I wanted to mention her name on the \nfloor. She did a great deal of work, as well as the coalition. We are \nprepared to vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a half-century ago, Drs. Francis Crick \nand James Watson discovered the structure of DNA--a revolutionary \nbreakthrough that enabled scientists to begin unraveling the mysteries \nof human life and diseases.\n  Earlier this year, scientists at the National Human Genome Research \nInstitute celebrated the completion of a massive undertaking begun 10 \nyears earlier to map the entire human genetic code.\n  Our new knowledge about our genetic blueprint has the potential to \ndramatically improve our health and the quality of our lives. It also \nhas the potential to destroy lives. Which of those two potentials \nbecomes reality depends on whether and how well our laws keep pace with \nchanges in technology.\n  We know from hearings we held in the Senate that current laws are \ninadequate to protect Americans from genetic discrimination. We also \nknow that today Americans are not being tested, not taking advantage of \nmedical advances, and not participating in genetic research because of \ntheir fear of discrimination. Their fears, unfortunately, are not \nunfounded.\n  Almost 2 years ago, I met a man named Dave Escher. Mr. Escher had \nworked for the same company for more than 25 years and was a good \nemployee. One day, Mr. Escher was told by his employer that he needed \nto see a company doctor; if he refused, he was told he could lose his \njob. So Dave Escher saw the doctor.\n  However, it wasn't until after the doctor's appointment--and only by \naccident--that Mr. Escher learned that the company's doctors had used \nhis blood to conduct genetic tests for more than 20 medical conditions.\n  Stories like Mr. Escher's may be relatively rare today, but experts \ntell us that is largely because genetic testing itself is still \nrelatively rare, and because many people are choosing not to take \ngenetic tests. As testing becomes more affordable and more common, \nexperts say, the incidence of discrimination is likely to increase \ndramatically unless we act to prevent such discrimination.\n  Almost two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson, one of this country's \nforemost scientists and original thinkers, wrote that ``laws and \ninstitutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. \nAs . . . new discoveries are made [and] new truths disclosed . . . \ninstitutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.''\n  In this age of genetic breakthroughs, it is essential that our laws \ncatch up with the science. We can't afford to take one step forward in \nscience but two steps backward in civil rights. Our laws must specify, \nclearly and unambiguously, how genetic information may be used and how \nit may not be used.\n  Today, after years of discussion and negotiation, the Senate is \nfinally poised to pass bipartisan legislation to protect all Americans \nagainst the misuse and abuse of genetic information.\n  Our bill does three things:\n  No. 1, it forbids health insurers from discriminating against \nindividuals--denying them coverage, for instance, based on genetic text \nresults.\n  No. 2, it forbids employers from using genetic information to \ndiscriminate in hiring, or in the terms and conditions of employment.\n  No. 3, it sets privacy standards for access and disclosure of genetic \ninformation.\n  Genetic information should be a private matter--period. It should not \nbe shared with employers or insurance companies without an individual's \nconsent.\n  For years, experts have urged Congress to pass comprehensive national \nstandards to protect all Americans from genetic discrimination. If we \nfail to do so, the experts warn, we will almost certainly squander many \nof the enormous potential benefits of the genetic revolution.\n  We have been trying to heed that warning for years. I first \nintroduced legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination 6 years ago. \nSenator Snowe and many other Senators on both sides of the aisle have \nbeen working on this important issue for just as long. After countless \nhours of tough negotiations, we have finally arrived at a fair \nresolution that provides important protections for individuals in both \nemployment and health insurance.\n  Passage of this bill represents a victory for bipartisanship. But \nmore importantly, it is a victory for the American people. \nDiscrimination based on genetic information is just as arbitrary, just \nas unacceptable, and just as un-American as discrimination based on \ngender, race, religion, or disability. Like those other forms of \ndiscrimination, it should not be allowed in this country.\n  Again, I thank our colleagues who have enabled us to reach this \ncompromise and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S12499]]\n\n  There are a few people who deserve special recognition. I \nparticularly want to thank those Senators who have been working on this \nissue from the beginning and whose contributions were invaluable in \nreaching this compromise, especially Senators Snowe, Kennedy, Harkin, \nDodd, Jeffords, Frist, Gregg, and Enzi.\n  I also want to thank Dr. Francis Collins and the staff at NIH, as \nwell as Kathy Hudson, who heads up the Genetics and Public Policy \nCenter at Johns Hopkins University. Without their technical expertise \nand their determinations to help our laws keep pace with science, we \nwould not be here today.\n  One other person who must be recognized is our good friend in the \nother body, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. Her determined leadership \nhelped move us forward at every step of the way, and her tenacity and \nexpertise will be essential to passage of this legislation in the \nHouse.\n  Nearly 2\\1/2\\ years ago, in one of his weekly radio addresses, \nPresident Bush joined in the call for comprehensive protection of \ngenetic information. I urge all of our colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this well-crafted, bipartisan solution. I also hope that our \nfriends in the House will heed the President's words, follow this \nSenate's actions, and pass this bill quickly so we can get it to the \nPresident for his signature this year.\n  We cannot allow the gap between science and the law to continue to \nwiden. We all have genetic markers. We are all potentially at risk of \ngenetic discrimination. This is not a partisan issue. This is an urgent \ncivil rights issue. There is no reason to wait any longer. We have a \nsolution. We ought to pass it this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to vote on legislation that \nwill provide important new protections against employment and health \ninsurance discrimination based on genetic profiling. The bill protects \nAmericans from both disease and discrimination.\n  We have been working on this legislation for many years, and I am \npleased today that the Senate is about to act. I expect that today the \nSenate will overwhelmingly pass the genetic information \nnondiscrimination bill.\n  I especially, commend my colleagues Senators Snowe, Gregg, Jeffords, \nDaschle, Kennedy, Enzi, Hagel, Collins and DeWine for their hard work \nand dedication over many years.\n  Since we began looking at the issue of genetic discrimination, \ngenetic scholarship has advanced by leaps and bounds. This year, \nscientists, working in collaboration with the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute at the National Institutes of Health, published a \nfinal draft of the sequence of the entire human genetic code.\n  It's a dazzling accomplishment that makes possible unprecedented \nunderstanding of human development, health and disease. It has the \npotential to change the way we practice medicine.\n  Scientists will be able to design drugs to treat specific genes. \nTissues and organs may be specifically engineered for use in \ntransplantation. Preventive care may potentially be based in large part \non genetic testing. But this new knowledge is also fraught with risk.\n  When I first joined Senator Snowe to address the issue of genetic \ndiscrimination, almost one-third of women offered a test for breast \ncancer risk at the National Institutes of Health declined, citing \nconcerns that health insurance companies would discriminate against \nthem.\n  They were afraid that genetic information gathered to protect them \nfrom disease might end up hurting their chances to get insurance.\n  Their fears were understandable. Genetic screening is a powerful \ntool, and can impart highly sensitive and very personal information. \nThe fear of genetic discrimination has the potential to prevent \nindividuals from participating in research studies, from taking \nadvantage of new genetic technologies, or even from discovering that \nthey are not at high risk for genetically related illnesses.\n  As a doctor and a Senator, I believe protecting our fellow citizens \nfrom genetic discrimination is a moral and practical responsibility.\n  In the past, Congress has taken on the battle against discrimination, \nmost notably through the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1990 \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act.\n  This legislation stands squarely on our time-tested civil rights \nlaws, establishing comprehensive, consistent, and fair protections.\n  Genetic research will make thrilling advances possible in the not too \ndistant future, including possible cures to our most vexing illnesses.\n  But as we greet the future with new technology and scientific \ndiscoveries, we must take care to protect our body politic from \nunintended and unanticipated consequences. I am pleased by the progress \nwe have made thus far, and I congratulate each of my colleagues on \ntheir dedication to this issue.\n  I strongly support the passage of this bill. It will help protect \nAmericans from both discrimination and disease.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill we have worked on for the last 7 years. \nIt has allowed us to address an issue, the human genome and the \ndefinition of the code, in advance. Everything we thought back then I \nbelieve was right on target. It has taken a long time to get to where \nwe are today. It has taken a lot of bipartisan work among Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who really came down to wanting to pass a bill \nthat did two things; that is, protect the health and the future health \nof individuals in this country and, at the same time, protect from \ndiscrimination. This bill accomplishes that.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues for their leadership and \npersistence in passing this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the bill having been read the third time, \nthe question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other \n     advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical \n     progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness \n     will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before \n     symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to \n     take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a \n     particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow \n     for the development of better therapies that are more \n     effective against disease or have fewer side effects than \n     current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential \n     misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health \n     insurance and employment.\n       (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State \n     laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having \n     presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, \n     mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among \n     other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in \n     the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States \n     adopted sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic \n     traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since \n     been repealed, and many have been modified to include \n     essential constitutional requirements of due process and \n     equal protection. However, the current explosion in the \n     science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by \n     the States based on early genetic science, compels \n     Congressional action in this area.\n       (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many \n     genetic conditions and disorders are associated with \n     particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some \n     genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, \n     members of a particular group may be stigmatized or \n     discriminated against as a result of that genetic \n     information. This form of discrimination was evident in the \n     1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and \n     identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which \n     afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures \n     began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the \n     early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African \n     Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination \n     and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, \n     Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia \n     Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States \n     unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.\n       (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic \n     discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of \n     pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the \n     employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley \n     Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress \n     clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the \n     fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice \n     in employment and health insurance.\n       (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health \n     insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and \n     depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have \n     enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these \n     laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, \n     and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial \n     evidence that the American public and the medical community \n     find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be \n     confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. \n     Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and \n     uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the \n     public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the \n     potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to \n     take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, \n     and new therapies.\n\n         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

There are 4 minutes equally divided on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is a very serious amendment.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. There are 2 minutes on each side on the \nBingaman amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish to speak first?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will defer to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will yield our time to Senator Warner, chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in previous military campaigns such as \nthe first gulf war and Kosovo, and many before that, the Pentagon has \nissued campaign medals to service men and women who served in those \nconflicts. We need to do the very same in the case of our service men \nand women who are serving in Iraq.\n  The amendment I am proposing says the Secretaries of the respective \nservices may issue an appropriate medal or campaign designation to any \nperson who serves in any capacity in the armed services in connection \nwith Operation Iraqi Freedom. In my view, this is much preferable to \nthe Pentagon's current policy, which is that everyone should get a \nGlobal War on Terrorism Medal instead of a medal that relates to their \nservice in Iraq.\n  The service men and women who are risking their lives in Iraq deserve \nto be recognized for their service in that country. This is a major \nmilitary engagement we have gotten into here and there will be a lot of \nservice men and women involved. We definitely should make this a \nseparate medal.\n  That is the thrust of the amendment. Senator Lugar is a cosponsor, \nalong with many others. I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Byrd, \nLeahy, and Jeffords to those who are already listed as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I would like to \nthink of myself as the last person to ever take the floor of the Senate \nand say a man or a woman proudly wearing the uniform of the United \nStates should not receive everything that is offered. But in this \ninstance--I do not oppose this--I simply ask you to examine it in the \nsense of fairness. What do you say to the widow of someone who lost his \nlife in Afghanistan? What do you say to those who have injured soldiers \nin the Horn of Africa, Liberia, Philippines, Colombia, and other \nplaces, all engaged in the war on terrorism?\n  I do not understand this. I have read it. I have reread it. It says, \nfor example, to those serving in Iraq, prohibition of concurrent award \nof Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. They cannot receive it. \nFor what reason, I do not know.\n  I say to my dear friend, a former member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, this is a matter that requires\n\n[[Page S12509]]\n\nclose examination. This issue of awarding men and women of the Armed \nForces is properly reposed in the chairman and the members of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. They acted in March of this year to create the Medal \nfor the Global War on Terrorism. Our distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, while serving in the Army, got a star for the European \ntheater for engagements; those who crossed the Anzio Beach, those in \nAfrica, a star. There was one theater medal with stars given for the \nvarious engagements. That is not this situation. That says the one who \nserved in Iraq should get something special the others do not receive. \nThat is not fair, I say to my good friend.\n  Accordingly, at the appropriate time, I will move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised a motion to table is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is not intended to prevent the \nPentagon from issuing any other awards they wish with regard to \nAfghanistan or other locations, but it is clear to me that issuing a \nGlobal War on Terrorism Medal is not adequate for the service we are \ncalling on our men and women to perform in Iraq. We should give them a \nmedal for that campaign. That is all the amendment does.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is substantial interest in this \namendment. I don't know if the Senator wishes to have any more time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have had plenty of time. I suggest we \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Arizona be \nallowed to speak for 3 minutes and the opposing side be allowed to \nspeak for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we are working very hard \nbefore the White House meeting to get in another vote. Could we limit \nthis? I know everyone wants to hear these speeches, but could we try a \nminute or so on each side. Otherwise, we will waste the entire \nafternoon with White House meetings.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I renew my request to 2 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, none of us understands a prohibition on a \nconcurrent award of any other medal. This is unprecedented. Never in \nthe history of our military has the Senate or Congress mandated the \nawarding of one medal or the prohibiting of an awarding of another \nmedal.\n  We all want to honor the men and women who have served in the \nmilitary and have sacrificed. Where is it that the Senator from New \nMexico gets the expertise or the knowledge to deny any medal that is \njudged by the leaders of the military and the President of the United \nStates? It is very laudable to award a medal to people who served and \nsacrificed. Instead, the Senator from New Mexico has to complicate it \nto the point where the Senator from Virginia and I have to stand and \nsay: What is this all about?\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. So the point is, the Senator from New Mexico complicated \nan otherwise straightforward issue by deciding who is in what theater \nof war and what the war on terrorism is about. And the Senator from New \nMexico should have left it alone.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad this is a bicameral legislature we have because \nI do not think the House of Representatives would ever agree to such a \nthing, nor would the leaders of our military.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from Arizona--\n  Mr. WARNER. What do you say to the widow of someone who has lost \ntheir life in Afghanistan?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong. It is my understanding the \nDepartment of Defense opposes this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the reasons stated by the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, we should be able \nto work this out to everyone's satisfaction, but if you insist on \nmicromanaging to the degree of where people serve and what they are \neligible for, then we will never be able to honor those men and women \nwho serve.\n  Why didn't the Senator from New Mexico leave this alone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona raises a valid \npoint about the prohibition section, which is subsection (d). And I ask \nunanimous consent that be deleted from the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I will object because--I \ndo object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the only argument I have heard against \nthe amendment that, to me, made good sense was a concern about the \nprohibition provision, subsection (d) of the amendment. I have asked \npermission to delete that and it has been denied.\n  So I would just simply suggest to my colleagues that it is more \nappropriate and more consistent with the policy of this country to give \nawards for major military conflicts such as what we have been engaged \nin in Iraq than it is to give a Global War on Terrorism award to \neverything that happens from 9/11 forward. The reality is, the people \nwho are serving in Iraq deserve to be recognized for that. That is all \nwe are trying to do with this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. How can you elevate a death or a loss in Iraq over one in \nAfghanistan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say in response to my colleague \nfrom Virginia, if he would like to offer an amendment to give an award \nto those who served in Afghanistan, I will cosponsor and support that.\n  I have proposed something for the men and women who have served in \nthe conflict in Iraq. And I think it is an appropriate thing for the \nCongress to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, are we going to have more debate on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the majority side has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Time has expired.\n  Mr. President, I call for a vote.\n  I opposed this before. The Department opposes it. I call for a vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may state his inquiry.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is this motion divisible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is divisible.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move the item be divided. I ask for a division. I ask \nthat the division be on subsection (d).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has to give specifics on the \ndivision.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would ask that--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. GREGG. All items after subsection (d)--page 3, line 8--be \ndeleted, the question be divided on that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate the specifics of the \ndivision?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. My point is, on page 3, line 8, section (d), I ask \nthat the motion be divided and that the motion be a separate motion on \nthat section and everything that follows it within section (d).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is divided.\n\n\n                 Vote On Amendment No. 1830, Division I\n\n  The question is on the first division. The yeas and nays have already \nbeen ordered.\n\n[[Page S12510]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: What are we voting on now, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote now occurs on agreeing to division I, \nwhich is pages 1 and 2 and 3 through line 7 of the original amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have previously been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 378 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Dayton\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Miller\n  The amendment (No. 1830--Division I) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nprocedure now?\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 1830, Division II\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on division II of \namendment No. 1830.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated on this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to division II of \namendment No. 1830.\n  The amendment (No. 1830--Division II) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I simply say that I am sorry about this \nrecent dispute. In the period of time before lunch, I made a statement, \nbased upon a memo we got from the Department of Defense, that pointed \nout that the medals in question were authorized by the President at the \nrequest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  They had two reasons to oppose this Iraqi freedom medal. First, it is \nredundant to the general war on terrorism medal; second, it is devisive \nin that it inherently values participation in the Iraqi operation as \nopposed to Afghanistan and all others. In particular, the Department \npointed out that, under the Global War on Terrorism Medals, there is an \nExpeditionary Medal that goes to those who serve in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nor in those places where there has been combat in the war against \nterrorism. The other medal is a Service Medal to recognize those people \nwho are supporting personnel. It is not restricted by geographical \nboundaries. It is not only for the support of Operation Iraqi Freedom; \nit also applies to Operation Noble Eagle and airport security \noperations from September 27, 2001, to May 1, 2002.\n  The Senate has defeated a proposal to go on record to issue an Iraqi \nmedal only to those who served in Iraq, and the Department has taken \nthe position--that is what really caused consternation because they \nwant medals to recognize specific and general sacrifices and \ncontributions made by all Armed Forces in the efforts to combat \nterrorism in all forms throughout the world, both in current and future \noperations.\n  The Expeditionary Medal will continue to be issued to those who \nparticipate in the global war against terrorism and are involved in \ncombat operations. I think what the Department has done at the request \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff is inherently fair and proper. I want to \nreassure those who supported the position I enunciated and are opposed \nto this amendment, I believe you have done the right thing by those \npeople who are in uniform and are sacrificing themselves and really \nexposing themselves in harm's way throughout the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been discussing how we might \nproceed between now and 6:30. As I understand it, we have a unanimous \nconsent request ready to propound. There is no objection to the request \non this side. I see that the distinguished manager has the unanimous \nconsent request, and I yield the floor so he can offer that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 30 minutes for debate in \nrelation to the Stabenow amendment, with 20 minutes under the control \nof Senator Stabenow and 10 minutes under my control; provided that \nfollowing the debate time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote; that following that vote, the time until 6:30 this evening be \nequally divided in the usual form in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 1846; and that the vote occur in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nat 6:30 p.m., with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1823\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and I call up amendment No. 1823.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is already pending.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment I am calling \n``A Month for America.'' This amendment will delay approximately $5 \nbillion in Iraq reconstruction funds and put them into funding our high \npriorities at home, such as job creation, veterans health, health care \nfor the uninsured, and education.\n  I thank the cosponsors of this amendment--Senators Durbin, Boxer, \nJohnson, and Schumer--for their leadership and support.\n  Two weeks ago, I was meeting with a group of constituents in \nMichigan, and we started to talk about the President's request for $87 \nbillion for Iraq and Afghanistan. I shared with my constituents that we \nwere spending about $5 billion a month now, in addition to the slightly \nover $20 billion in reconstruction funds contained in the bill in front \nof us.\n  My constituents in Michigan were startled at the enormity of this \nfigure, as I believe our constituents are across the country, so much \nso that one gentleman who is on a local school board, sitting in the \nback, exclaimed: How about a month for America? This rang very true to \nme, and when I returned here, I decided to take this idea and draft an \namendment focused on our needs at home called ``A Month for America.''\n  Before I fully explain the details of my amendment, I wish to go \nthrough\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\nwhat this amendment does not do. This is very important.\n\n  First, it does not cut 1 penny of funding for our troops.\n  Second, it does not cut any funds for security in Iraq. It \nspecifically exempts the approximately $5 billion in police and \nsecurity funds for Iraq. I believe this is very important. The sooner \nthey are able to have their own police force, their own security force, \nthe sooner we will be able to bring our troops home, and I support that \neffort.\n  Third, it does not cut any funds for reconstruction. It only delays \nthem. Therefore, this money is fully offset.\n  We are asking for $5.03 billion for America in this amendment and ask \nthat we simply take a portion--the equivalent of 1 month's spending, \n$5.03 billion--and delay it until next year.\n  Even the administration admits that it does not need much of the $20 \nbillion in reconstruction until next year. So it is not an emergency. \nWe do not need the full $20 billion right now, and yet we have real \nemergencies at home.\n  There will be plenty of opportunities to provide this $5 billion for \nIraq in the next appropriations cycle. In fact, last Thursday's New \nYork Times reported that a team of World Bank economists has concluded \nthat, as a practical matter, Iraq can absorb only about $6 billion in \naid next year for its infrastructure needs. We are being asked to \nallocate more than $20 billion on reconstruction, and yet we are told, \nas a practical matter, they will not be able to use or spend over $6 \nbillion in the next year. One administration official was even quoted \nas saying:\n\n       Where the Iraq aid numbers are not so reasonable is the \n     timeframe for how much can be spent. This money cannot be \n     spent overnight.\n\n  They are admitting the fact this timeframe is not reasonable, and yet \nwe know in ongoing debates in this Chamber with colleagues on every \nappropriations bill coming before us that we have critical needs for \njobs and education, veterans health care, and those who are losing \ntheir insurance because of losing their job. We have many needs that \nare critical at home.\n  Specifically, the ``A Month for America'' amendment would take this \n$5.03 billion and allocate it in the following ways: First, $1 billion \nfor school construction; $1.8 billion for veterans health care; $103 \nmillion for full funding of community health centers; and finally, $2.1 \nbillion for transportation projects and job creation, saving 90,000 \njobs.\n  The United States is spending a little over $1 billion a week right \nnow in Iraq, not counting the $87 billion. However, when an amendment \nwas recently offered to the 2004 Labor-HHS appropriations bill to \nincrease funding for school construction at home by $1 billion, it was \ndefeated on a party-line vote with only one of our Republican \ncolleagues supporting the increased funding. This is very unfortunate \nbecause investing in our schools and in education should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  The ``A Month for America'' amendment will increase funding for \nschool construction for the next year by $1 billion so that we can \nplace more dollars into investing in our children walking into a \nquality school building with the technology and the infrastructure they \nneed. Shame on us if we have even one classroom in America where there \nis a bucket in the corner to catch the water coming in. We have too \nmany of those right now.\n  This amendment will help eliminate those buckets of water and create \nthe modern school buildings our children need now in America.\n  Our schools are definitely in a state of emergency. According to a \nGAO report entitled ``School Facilities: America's School Report, \nDiffering Conditions,'' at least one-third of schools are in need of \nextensive repair or replacement. This is not in Afghanistan or Iraq. \nThis is in the United States of America. One-third of the schools are \nin need of extensive repair or replacement and at least two-thirds have \nunhealthy environmental conditions. So two out of three schools in the \nUnited States of America have unsafe environmental conditions. I argue \nthis is an emergency equal to anything that is in front of us that \nrelates to Iraq.\n  An estimated 14 million American children attend deteriorating \nschools. According to the National Education Association's 2000 survey, \nMichigan schools need at least $9.9 billion in building improvements. \nThat is just in my State, given all of the needs we have from one end \nof Michigan to the other. Many Michigan educators believe that estimate \nin fact is too low, considering the Detroit public schools alone need \nan estimated $5 billion to fix leaky roofs, replace boilers, wire \ncomputers, and other repairs. This is truly an emergency.\n  How do we tell our children to stay in school, do not go on drugs, do \nnot drop out of school and move to a life of crime, stay with it \nbecause education is so important, and then they walk into a building \nthat is falling down, they walk into a building that does not have the \ncomputers they need in this day and age to be successful? What message \nare we sending to our children? This is an emergency.\n  These poor conditions also affect how well our children learn. A \nrecent study showed students learning in substandard classrooms have \ntest scores that are anywhere from 5 to 17 percent lower than their \npeers who are in good buildings. So when we are talking about leave no \nchild behind and raising test scores and standards, the quality of the \nbuilding, the science labs, the math labs, the technology that is \navailable, makes a difference in a child's ability to learn. In \naddition, without this additional $1 billion in funding and with the \nsignificant State cuts in education funding, Americans will have to pay \nmore in property taxes just to maintain the current level of services. \nSchools will not have the resources to make the necessary repairs. I \nargue this is an emergency for America.\n  Now on to veterans health care, which is of deep concern to me as \nwell. The administration's budget for veterans health care falls far \nshort of needs. We all know this. Despite the current crisis in \nveterans health care, some 130,000 are waiting 6 months or more for \nappointments at VA hospitals or clinics. President Bush submitted a \nbudget for next year that is $1.8 billion below what is needed, \naccording to the independent budget produced by AMVETS, Disabled \nAmericans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars of the United States.\n  In this legislation, we are funding efforts to support the men and \nwomen who are fighting overseas on our behalf, who are on active duty. \nThey come home, they become veterans, and they have to wait 6 months to \nsee a doctor. What sense does this make? If we cannot keep basic \npromises to our veterans to make sure they have the health care they \nneed, deserve, and we said they would receive, how in the world are we \ngoing to be credible in meeting other commitments?\n  Unfortunately, the House bill included the same shortfall, which is \n$1.8 billion lower than the budget resolution promise of a $3.4 billion \nincrease over last year's level. The VA health care system is strained. \nIts budget has consistently been underfunded and does not address the \nhealth needs of our service men and women.\n\n  I am pleased to support Senator Johnson's bill to make health care \nspending for our veterans mandatory. This needs to happen, instead of \nbeing slighted by the administration and the Congress year after year. \nRight now, over 130,000 veterans wait 6 months or more for their \nprimary care appointments. The system is so underfunded that category 8 \nveterans, nonservice-connected veterans who make above a certain income \nthreshold, are prohibited from enrolling for benefits.\n  In my State, veterans officials are talking about losing another \nhospital, Saginaw VA facility, which means that some veterans in \nnorthern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan will have to \ndrive over 200 miles to Ann Arbor or Detroit for inpatient care. I am \nextremely hopeful they will not proceed with this proposal.\n  This amendment commits Congress to keeping our promises to our \nveterans who have earned the right to access to health care that was \ncreated to serve their needs. Our veterans deserve better than a \nchronically underfunded system, long waits for care, and a Nation that \nhas asked them to pay the price for our freedom, only to be \nshortchanged at home.\n  Item 3 in Month for America, according to the recently released U.S. \nCensus Report, the number of Americans\n\n[[Page S12512]]\n\nwithout health care has jumped 5.7 percent to 43.6 million Americans. \nThis is the largest single increase in the number of the uninsured in \nthe last decade. According to Families USA, a health care consumer \norganization, there were 2.3 million people in my own State of Michigan \nunder the age of 65 who went without health insurance some time in the \npast year. That means one in four people in Michigan under the age of \n65 was uninsured. Think about that. In the greatest country in the \nworld, those without insurance often delay or avoid needed services, \nwhich results in a direct increase in more costly emergency room care.\n  Who are these people? Seventy-five percent of them are working. They \nare working in small businesses that would provide health insurance but \nfor the explosion in prices. These are people who work in every part of \nour economy. In recent studies, the sagging economy suggests these \nnumbers are only going to increase if relief is not in sight. I tell \nfolks we are going to be funding a Government-funded universal system \nin Iraq for every Iraqi to have health care and yet in my home State, \nand I would venture it is comparable across the country, one out of \nfour people does not have health care. Last year, community health \ncenters across the country served nearly 5 million uninsured Americans. \nCommunity health centers have a 30-year track record of success, and \nthat is where these dollars would go. Study after study has shown that \nhealth centers effectively and efficiently improve our Nation's health.\n  In the last 3 years, they have served nearly 800,000 American \ncitizens. We need to fully fund community health centers at the level \nnecessary for them to do their work and serve working families who are \nnot lucky enough to have health insurance from their employers.\n  The Month for America amendment would provide $103 million for full \nfunding of federally qualified community health centers to help deal \nwith the number of Americans who lack health insurance. This is such a \nsmall investment that obviously yields great rewards. For every $100 \nthe Federal Government has been able to allocate to community health \ncenters, these centers have been able to serve one additional new \npatient. Think about that. For $100, another child can be served, \nanother mom, or another dad who has lost his job or lost his insurance.\n  The Month for America amendment would allow an additional 1.03 \nmillion Americans to receive access to primary care services; 1.03 \nmillion people could have access to a doctor and the health care they \nneed.\n  We know this is not a complete solution to the issue of health care. \nI certainly have been very involved in a number of ways to bring down \ncosts and to address the concerns of small and large businesses and \nthose who do not have insurance, but it surely would help to be able to \nfully fund our health centers.\n  As my colleagues know, in the final item in the Month for America, \nthe TEA-21 transportation bill expired at the end of September, but \nCongress has not passed a new 6-year bill which is critical to the \nneeds of communities, to jobs, and to the economy. A new 6-year bill \nwould provide hundreds of thousands of jobs to help the economy and \nimprove the safety of our Nation's roads and bridges. Instead, Congress \npassed a short-term, 5-month extension of TEA-21. According to the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a \nshort-term extension rather than passage of the 6-year bill will \ncompound State budget problems and result in delayed projects, added \nproject costs, and lost jobs. They indicate that a delay in passing a \nnew 6-year bill would mean the loss of more than 90,000 jobs and $2.1 \nbillion in project delays.\n  This is about jobs. We need those jobs for American citizens. A 6-\nyear bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. We know that \npassing a 6-year $311 billion highway bill would create more than \n650,000 jobs in America and almost 23,000 jobs in Michigan alone.\n  Our Nation's transportation infrastructure needs our help now. This \nreally is an emergency.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute's 2003 Urban Mobility \nStudy, the cost of congestion continues to skyrocket, and in 2001 \ntraffic congestion cost the Nation $69.5 billion--$4.1 billion more \nthan in the year 2000--5.7 billion gallons of wasted fuel, and 3.5 \nbillion hours of lost productivity sitting in our cars on those roads. \nWe each understand that. Traffic congestion cost southeastern Michigan \nover $2.1 billion in 2001 and cost the average Detroiter $523 per \nperson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I yield the Senator 5 minutes of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the chairman very much for his graciousness.\n  The Month for America amendment will provide $2.1 billion in highway \nand transit funds to high-priority projects that can begin within 90 \ndays. This will create immediate jobs. Not only will this prevent the \nproject delays resulting from the lack of a 6-year transportation bill, \nbut it will, again, create over 90,000 jobs. We all know we need more \njobs in America, and we need them now. This is an emergency for every \nsingle individual and every family who finds themselves in a situation \nnow where there has been a job loss in the family.\n  Some people will say that modernizing our schools, providing health \ncare to veterans and those without insurance, and creating jobs is not \nan emergency. I completely disagree. These are crises in America that \nneed immediate attention.\n  At the same time, when I looked through Ambassador Bremer's report \nentitled ``The Coalition Provisional Authority Request to Rehabilitate \nand Reconstruct Iraq,'' I found billions of dollars for projects which \nneither I nor the American people believe are emergencies. They may be \nworthy, but they are not as much of an emergency as these needs here at \nhome. I want to point out just a few to my colleagues.\n\n  The first item I found was $161 million for wireless networks, \ncomputer training, and equipment. We would love to have this in \nMichigan. I have many businesses that would love to have wireless \nnetworks. There is no question that this is a laudable goal. But is it \nan emergency? I don't think so. Couldn't this wait until next year \nwhile we try to establish security and basic services in Iraq?\n  The second item is $20 million for business training for Iraqis. This \nmoney will provide 4 weeks of business courses to Iraqis for a whopping \n$10,000 a person. If I might plug my alma mater, this is more than it \nwould cost for a full year at the Michigan State University Business \nSchool. We welcome people coming to Michigan State.\n  The third item is $43 million for job training and 22 new Iraqi job \nemployment centers. Iraq may have a problem with unemployment, but we \nalso have a problem with unemployment here at home. Since 2001, we have \nlost 2.5 million manufacturing jobs in this country, many of them in my \nhome State--162,300 of them, in fact, in Michigan. This is a loss of 18 \npercent of Michigan's manufacturing employment--one out of six of our \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Other items include $9 million to establish ZIP Codes in Iraq--a nice \nthing to do, but I think it could wait--and $50 million for marshes. I \nam anxious to go see them since I thought this was a desert.\n  These do not seem to be emergencies. We are saying, can these please \nwait until next year so that health care for our families and jobs for \nour families will not have to wait and veterans will not have to wait a \nmonth to see a doctor.\n  School construction and jobs are certainly a high priority. Why \nshould these Iraqi projects get special treatment in an emergency \nsupplemental bill while funds for our infrastructure and our needs have \nto wait and compete with other priorities next year? It seems to me the \nmoney for our roads and schools should get special budgetary treatment \nand Iraq projects can wait.\n  We are not asking for all of them to wait. The administration has \nindicated they can use about $6 billion in the coming year. I am \nsuggesting they get the $15 billion. We are just asking for $5 \nbillion--1 month for America. I\n\n[[Page S12513]]\n\nthink these so-called emergency items for Iraq can wait and we can \ninvolve ourselves in the normal budget process to determine whether \nthey are needed.\n  We need to act now here at home. We need jobs now. We need health \ncare now. We need to rebuild our schools now and we need to support our \ntroops when they come home and put on their veterans hats when they \nwill need health care.\n  Some people say we can't do both. I believe we can. Let us send a \nmessage today that while we support our troops unanimously, we want to \nhave 1 month of funding for America here at home. If we agree to this \namendment, we can do both. I ask my colleagues before they vote on this \namendment to think about those who would be impacted by this.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am proud to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Michigan to provide funding for important \ndomestic priorities. This amendment is called ``A Month for America.''\n  Each month, the U.S. is spending roughly $5 billion for operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan at a time when important priorities here at home \ngo unmet. This amendment would take $5 billion of the reconstruction \nmoney earmarked for Iraq and allocates it in the following way: $1 \nbillion for school construction, $1.8 billion for health programs for \nour veterans, $103 million for community health centers, and $2.1 \nbillion for highways and public transit.\n  These domestic priorities are an emergency now. Surely we can delay \n$5 billion in Iraqi reconstruction funds until the fiscal year 2005 \nwhen even the World Bank says that only $5.8 billion can be absorbed by \nIraq next year to rebuild its infrastructure.\n  I want to talk about the need for new Federal spending to help \nrebuild and rehabilitate schools in California. These are the current \nconditions: 87 percent of schools report a need to upgrade or repair \nbuilding to good overall condition; 71 percent of schools report at \nleast one inadequate building feature, such as the roof, plumbing, \nelectrical systems, windows, or heating and air conditioning; and 87 \npercent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental \nfactor, such as air quality, ventilation, heating, or lighting.\n  This is an emergency. Yet when an amendment was offered by Senators \nClinton and Harkin to the fiscal year 2004 Labor-HHS bill to increase \nfunding for school reconstruction by $1 billion for the entire year, it \nwas defeated on a party-line vote with only one Republican supporting \nthe increased funding.\n  It is a shame that this supplemental bill will spend in excess of \n$100 million for education in Iraq but not one penny for education in \nCalifornia.\n  The Bush administration wants to spend $10,000 per month for business \nschool in Iraq--more than double the monthly cost of Harvard Business \nSchool--but there is no funding for the children in California.\n  This amendment also provides $1.8 billion for health care to our \nveterans so that we can fulfill the commitment made to them for their \nsacrifices.\n  President Bush submitted a fiscal year 2004 budget request for VA \nhealth that is $1.8 billion below the Independent Budget produced by \nAMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. It would be a great \ncomfort for those fighting now to know that the U.S. Congress is \nserious about meeting the needs of those who fought before them.\n  On healthcare, the supplemental provides $850 million for Iraq to \nconstruct a new hospital and replace medical equipment. And while we \nshould help those in need throughout the world, we should also provide \nfor those at home. That is why the Stabenow amendment provides $103 \nmillion for federally qualified community health centers that have been \nshown to reduce inpatient admission rates for their patients by \nanywhere from 22 percent to 67 percent, and have reduced the number of \npatients admitted per year and the length of stay among those who were \nadmitted.\n  Finally, this amendment would provide $2.1 billion for highway and \npublic transit programs. Transit is so important for my State. We have \nso much congestion that we must improve our highways and roads and \nbuild public transportation.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute, Los Angeles and the \nSan Francisco-Oakland region are ranking No. 1 and 2 for the worst \nroadway congestion in this country. California has two more cities in \nthe top 5 with San Jose ranked 4 and San Diego ranked 5.\n  The Inland Empire of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties is ranked \n12 and Sacramento is ranked 13.\n  What does this congestion translate to? Delays. In the Los Angeles \narea: 136 hours per year, on average per driver, in peak hours. San \nFrancisco-Oakland drivers put up with 92 hours of delays, and San Jose \ndrivers endure 74 hours of delays. Inland Empire drivers are delayed by \n64 hours, and San Diego drivers are delayed by 51 hours a year.\n  Californians are trying to reduce congestion. More Californians are \nusing alternative forms of transportation. Public transit carries over \n1.2 billion passengers a year in California.\n  Transit ridership is up in California. The number of miles traveled \nannually by transit passengers grew by 20 percent between 1997 and \n2001. The number of annual passenger trips was up 14 percent. In the \nSan Francisco Bay Bridge corridor, 38 percent of all trips are on \ntransit. And, 30 percent of all trips into central Los Angeles are on \ntransit.\n  Like the other domestic priorities outlined in the Stabenow \namendment, we need to fund transit so we can improve our infrastructure \nin this country. I thank the Senator from Michigan for her amendment \nand urge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, do I have 10 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator from Michigan has been \ntalking about veterans health care and school construction. We are \ntalking about Iraq and how to get our people home. We get them back by \nassisting the Iraqis in taking over the management of their own \ncountry. We do that by providing an infusion of capital to help restore \nthat government to operation so it can take over and provide the \nsecurity services, provide for the economic management services, and \nprovide the army. It takes money to do that.\n  As I pointed out before we went on recess, the President has chosen a \nunique approach. We could have gone in with the military and occupied \nthat country for 4 to 5 years, as we did in Germany and as we just did \nin Kosovo. We are still bringing people out of Bosnia and Kosovo \nbecause we did not do that. This time we are going in to try to help \nthem get in the position to take care of themselves and bring our \npeople back.\n  This is at the request of the other side of the aisle. The President \nhas sent us a unique supplemental. The Democratic Party commanded that \nthe President give us a budget for 2004 for Iraq. This is it.\n  No President has done this in history. President Clinton did not do \nit. In fact, President Roosevelt did not do it. President Eisenhower \ndid not do it. President Johnson did not do it.\n  This President budgeted ahead of time for war, for a concept of \nfinishing what we started. Part of what we started was to put in place \na government in Iraq that would not be the despotic regime of Saddam \nHussein.\n  Argue all you want about the need for money. I agree, there is \ncertainly a need for more money for veterans health care. I disagree \nabout the statement concerning the need for new public school \nfacilities. I am informed that in 2002 alone, school districts \ncompleted $11.7 billion of new construction.\n  The recent study of the General Accounting Office and the National \nCenter for Education Statistics indicates that schools are in better \ncondition than they have been in the past; 81 percent of the schools \nreported their buildings were in adequate or better condition, 84 \npercent reported them to be in adequate or better condition. It is a \nminority of schools that are not in adequate shape.\n  One place where there are no schools without our assistance is Iraq. \nHow will our men and women come home unless the schools are \nfunctioning, unless the police are functioning, unless the army is \nfunctioning, unless the economy is functioning? That is the way to get \nthem home.\n  If we do not provide this $20.3 billion, we can increase the money \nfor the occupation and occupy that enormous\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\ncountry for 4 to 5 years. We know what it is costing. Look at the \nbudget we have: $66 billion for defense, $20.3 billion for assisting \nIraq to become a nation. The $66 billion will go on and on and on, a \ndemand for more and more money for the military in Iraq unless we take \nthe action the President has requested and provide the $20.3 billion \nnecessary. The amendment of the Senator will take over $5 billion out \nof that. It will cripple that program.\n  We will have to send more and more people in uniform to do for Iraqis \nwhat they could do for themselves if they had the money to start their \neconomy, start their security systems, start their military systems, \nstart their whole governmental systems and make them work. That is what \nwe should do. Some people call it nation building; I call it nation \nreconstructing. But in any event, it is an absolute necessity at this \ntime to put the Iraqis back in control of their own affairs. It will \nnot happen if the Stabenow amendment is adopted.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I move to table the amendment \nof the Senator, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 379 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Dayton\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lieberman\n     Miller\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1826\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 6:30 is equally \ndivided with respect to amendment No. 1826.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we understand that is the order that has \nbeen entered. Senator Dorgan squeezed his time previously from 3 hours \nto 2 hours, and now it is 45 minutes. That is because this vote took so \nlong. I hope the majority will push the votes more quickly. That vote \ntook 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, is my amendment now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. We also have \nother speakers on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken about this amendment on previous \noccasions. The amendment directs the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nin cooperation with the Governing Council of Iraq, to create an Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority. The purpose of the Iraq \nReconstruction Finance Authority shall be to securitize future \nproduction of Iraqi oil, in order to finance the reconstruction of \nIraq.\n  In short, this amendment says that the reconstruction of Iraq should \ninvolve the Iraqi people, using Iraqi oil to reconstruct their country \nand that it should not be the American taxpayers reconstructing Iraq.\n  This morning's Washington Post says that the Secretary of State is at \nthe United Nations, attempting to get a resolution passed that would \nconfer on the Iraqi Governing Council and its Ministers the sovereignty \nover the state of Iraq. Surely, if this administration is ready to \nrecognize the Iraqi Governing Council as the sovereign of the state of \nIraq, that body should have the ability to use future revenues from the \nsale of Iraqi oil, to reconstruct their own country.\n  The fact is that, for months, this administration told us that Iraq's \noil would allow the Iraqi people to finance their own reconstruction.\n  Mr. Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said this in \nFebruary:\n\n       Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. They \n     have tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people and \n     so therefore a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to \n     shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction.\n\n  Mr. Fleischer was followed by Mr. Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of \nState. He said that the oil revenues of that country could bring \nbetween $50 billion and $100 billion over the course of the next 2 or 3 \nyears and that we are dealing with a country that can really finance \nits own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  The Defense Secretary himself, Donald Rumsfeld, in March, said:\n\n       I don't believe the U.S. has the responsibility for \n     reconstruction, in a sense . . . and the funds can come from \n     those various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil \n     revenues, and a variety of other things.\n\n  Well, that is at odds with the current request by the President to \nthe Congress, saying we need to have $20-plus-billion for the \nreconstruction. The Deputy Secretary of State said oil revenue could do \nthat. The Secretary of Defense said that oil revenue would be available \nfor that.\n  And then Vice President Cheney, on March 16, said:\n\n       In Iraq, you've got a nation that has the second largest \n     reserves of oil in the world--second only to Saudi Arabia. It \n     will generate billions of dollars a year in cash flow in the \n     relatively near future. And that flow resources, which \n     obviously belongs to the Iraqi people, needs to be put to use \n     by the Iraqi people for the Iraqi people, and that will be \n     one of the major objectives.\n\n  Then, the person at the State Department who is responsible for \nreconstruction, Mr. Natsios, had the following exchange on \n``Nightline'' with Ted Koppel.\n  Koppel said:\n\n       I understand that more money is expected to be spent on \n     that than was spent on the entire Marshall plan for the \n     rebuilding of Europe after the World War II.\n\n  Natsios said:\n\n       No, no, that doesn't even compare remotely with the size of \n     the Marshall plan.\n\n  Koppel:\n\n       The Marshall plan was $97 billion.\n\n  Natsios:\n\n       This is $1.7 billion.\n\n  Talking about the reconstruction plan for Iraq.\n  The program continued.\n  Koppel said:\n\n       When you talk about 1.7, you are not suggesting that the \n     rebuilding of Iraq is going to be done for $1.7 billion.\n\n  Natsios:\n\n       Well, in terms of the American taxpayers' contribution, I \n     do. This is it for the U.S. The rest of the rebuilding will \n     be done by other countries who have already made the pledges, \n     and by Iraqi oil revenues.\n\n  Will you excuse a few of us for believing the Vice President, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and others, who \nrepeatedly said this year that the American taxpayers won't be on the \nhook for the reconstruction of Iraq? Will you excuse us\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\nfor believing we could use Iraq oil for this purpose? That is what they \nsaid would happen. Now the administration says that is not the case at \nall and they want to use the American taxpayers' dollars to shoulder \nthe burden for reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make this one point. I asked Ambassador Bremer to \nexplain whether it would be possible to securitize Iraq's future oil \nrevenues to pay for Iraq's reconstruction. Ambassador Bremer's answer: \nYou can't use Iraq oil because Iraq owes foreign debt.\n  I said: Who to?\n  He said: Russia, France, and Germany.\n  Following that hearing, I checked. In fact, Russia, France, and \nGermany are indeed owed money by Saddam Hussein's regime. But the \nbiggest creditors of Saddam Hussein's regime are Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait.\n  Wouldn't it be a perversity if, in fact, the American taxpayers are \ntold that they have to pay taxes to ship $20 billion to Iraq to \nreconstruct Iraq--so Iraq can pump oil and send cash to Saudi Arabia \nand Kuwait in satisfaction of Saddam Hussein's debts?\n  You talk about a perversity of public policy. That is it.\n  My amendment is painfully simple. It says that the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil shall have a mechanism that would allow it to use Iraqi oil to \nreconstruct Iraq.\n  One final point. During the recent military campaign in Iraq, we did \nnot target Iraq's infrastructure. We didn't bomb its roads, bridges, \ndams, or electric grid. Now, Iraq does need reconstruction, no question \nabout that, but the reconstruction is necessary because of decades of \nneglect. It is not because of any action by our military. And the fact \nis that the Iraqi people have a tremendous resource to finance that \nreconstruction, which they could and should use.\n  So the President ought not be so quick to ask for $20 billion from \nthe American taxpayers for reconstruction, when his Vice President, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and all the rest \nof them said this year that the reconstruction of Iraq would be \nfinanced with Iraqi oil. Now we are told it cannot be done and won't be \ndone. I say with this amendment that it can be done and should be done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to make sure the point the \nSenator has just made is driven home for those following this debate.\n  This administration told us we needed to invade Iraq because there \nwere nuclear weapons there, which we cannot find.\n  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because there was uranium, \nfissile material coming in from Africa to Iraq, which now they say did \nnot exist.\n  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because of weapons of mass \ndestruction, which we cannot find.\n  They told us we needed to invade Iraq because of their linkage with \n9/11 terrorists, which now the President has said is not a fact.\n  They told us we didn't have to worry about rebuilding Iraq because of \nall the oil revenues.\n  Is the Senator from North Dakota finding the same difficulty I am in \nfollowing their logic? All the reasons to invade Iraq have disappeared. \nAs I understand it, the oil is still there. The oil was supposed to be \nthe source to rebuild Iraq. Is the administration suggesting there is \nno oil in Iraq?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. In fact, quite the contrary. Ambassador Bremer \ntestified that by July of next year, they will be pulling 3 million \nbarrels a day out of the sands of Iraq. There is liquid gold under \nthose sands. Three million barrels a day by next July will net them $16 \nbillion a year in net export revenue from oil--$16 billion a year. That \nis $160 billion in 10 years. They can easily securitize a small \nfraction of that to fund all of the reconstruction that is necessary in \nIraq. It can easily be done if there is a will to do it. But they will \nnot do it if the President says: Let's have the American taxpayers do \nit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, if I \nunderstand this, the President and the Bush administration are asking \nus to borrow money from the Social Security trust fund to increase the \ndeficit of the United States, to cut back on spending on education and \nhealth care so that we can provide reconstruction funds for Iraq which \ncan then pump the oil and sell it and with the revenues pay off their \ndebt to Saudi Arabia; is that the logic behind the administration's \nposition?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the two largest creditors of Iraq are \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely \ncorrect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator, so \nthe administration is prepared to disappoint Social Security recipients \nin America rather than disappoint the Saudis who loaned money to Saddam \nHussein and now want to be repaid?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, Saddam Hussein has vanished. His \ngovernment doesn't exist. The Iraqi people ought not be saddled with \nmassive debts to countries like Saudi Arabia, some of the wealthiest \ncountries in the world. The American taxpayer should not be told to pay \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq, while Iraqi oil revenues are hauled off \nto Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n  I yield 8 minutes to my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, it is a pleasure to return to this great institution \nat a time when we are debating a truly significant issue for the future \nof our Nation.\n  The fundamental question to me is what should be our standard in \nresolving the myriad of questions which surround the President's \nrequest for $87 billion in occupation and reconstruction expense in \nIraq.\n  My answer to that question is that we should test each of these \nproposals against the standards of: Will this give us an honorable and \nan expeditious exit from Iraq? Will this contribute to our ability to \nleave Iraq, to take American troops out of the quagmire and the killing \nfield which Iraq has become, but to do so with honor?\n  We basically have two options that are presently available to us as \nto how to reach that objective. One is the go-it-alone approach; that \nwe will conduct the occupation and the reconstruction essentially \nalone, without significant allies. Second is that we should \ninternationalize the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. We should \ndo this by increasing the control of Iraqis who have the confidence of \ntheir country men and women by involving other countries in the shared \nburden and responsibility of the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, \nand we should be sensitive to the international presence that we are \nsetting by our action.\n  Why do I believe providing these reconstruction dollars through a \nloan rather than through a direct grant would more likely achieve the \ngoal of internationalization and, therefore, the goal of an honorable \nand expeditious exit from Iraq?\n  First, it will maintain American domestic support, or at least it \nwill serve as a brake on what I sense is the increasing loss of \nAmerican domestic support for the occupation and reconstruction of \nIraq. We all can read the polls and see what the American people feel \nabout this $87 billion request. They dislike it in overwhelming \nnumbers, but there is even more than what you can state statistically. \nThere is what you can feel intuitively.\n  I sense all across the country an increasing question of what are we \ndoing in Iraq? Why are we in a situation where one American is killed \nand 10 Americans are maimed every day, where we are spending $1 billion \nevery week? What is our exit strategy?\n  I believe this approach of providing that at least a part of these \nexpenditures will be repaid to the American taxpayers will help to \nbuild some foundation under what now appears to be a straight tunnel \ntoward the loss of public support.\n  Second, this would not further add to the national debt. We have \nbasically three choices as to who is going to pay for this war. The \nfirst choice is our generation. We are in the war for what we consider \nto be important national security reasons. If that is the case, we \nought to be prepared to pay for it, not ask future generations to pay \nfor it. But last week the Senate rejected the Biden amendment which \nwould have\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\ncaused our generation to pay for our occupation and reconstruction of \nIraq. So that is off the table.\n  The second is, we are going to ask our grandchildren to pay for this \noccupation and reconstruction. If we do this, we are engaged in a sharp \nbreak with tradition and precedent.\n  Let me just state these numbers. The Marshall plan started in 1948. \nThe public debt of the U.S. Government in 1948 was $216 billion. Four \nyears later, as the Marshall plan was coming to a close, but the United \nStates was at war in Korea, in 1952, the public debt of the United \nStates was $214 billion. So we actually reduced the public debt of the \nUnited States during the period of the Marshall plan and the early \nphases of the Korean war. We are not following that precedent today. We \nare saying we are going to put all of these additional expenses into \nthe most enormous annual deficits the United States has ever seen.\n  Finally, we should do this because it will require Iraqis pay for the \nreconstruction and have a substantial amount of control over the \nreconstruction. One of the characteristics that made the Marshall plan \nso successful was that while we provided funds--and incidentally, on a \n$1-to-$1 matching basis, not a 100-percent to 0-percent basis, as is \nbeing proposed here--we provided funds on that basis and then let the \nleadership of the individual countries, whether it was our allies, such \nas France, or enemies, such as Germany, make the judgments as to what \nthey believed the priorities should be for the use of those funds. Here \nwe are unilaterally deciding by action of our administration and our \nCongress what the priorities should be.\n  Finally, in another domain, I think this sets a dangerous precedent \nfor our relations with other countries. In this same legislation, we \nare providing a relatively small grant to Afghanistan, both for \nsecurity and for reconstruction. I think that is defensible. \nAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. Afghanistan \nis a country which is key to a victory on terrorism. But now we apply \nexactly the same standards to the country which sits on the second \nlargest oil reserve on this planet and a country which, in my judgment, \nwas not a legitimate part of the war on terror until we made it a part \nof the war on terror by the war itself.\n  We also have Mexico. In the 1990s, Mexico was in very difficult \nfinancial status. There were some who speculated it might even go into \nbankruptcy. We came to Mexico's financial support. How did we do it? We \ndid it by collateralizing the future oil revenue of Mexico to pay what \nwe had advanced to give them greater fiscal solidity during a time of \ngreat instability. How do we tell the Mexicans that when we were \nlending money to them, a country which in natural resources is \nconsiderably less endowed than Iraq, we are going to give it to Iraq as \na straight grant but for Mexico it was a loan with their oil revenue as \nthe collateral for repayment?\n  The question that is asked all over this country is, Why can we \nrebuild the roads, the bridges, the schools, the electric grid of Iraq, \nbut we cannot do it in the United States? Why can we do it as a grant \nto one of the richest countries in terms of petroleum in the world, \nwhich will never be repaid to help us rebuild our own bridges, roads, \nand schools? This represents a key turning point, in my judgment, for \nthe beginning of the 21st century. Will Iraq be the Germany of the \n1950s or will it be the Vietnam of the 1970s in terms of the United \nStates?\n  I believe voting for reasonable burden sharing between Iraq and the \nUnited States, and other proposals that will share the burden on a more \ninternational basis, will be a key to answering that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nyielding and I rise in support of the amendment he has offered.\n  Also, I say welcome back to Senator Bob Graham of Florida. We are \nglad to have him off the trail and back in the Senate where we need \nhim.\n  This is an interesting issue to bring to the American people because \nit is an issue where we ask this administration to stand by its own \npromises, to stand by its own words, and they cannot. They cannot \nbecause as recently as 6 months ago, the leaders of this administration \nsaid we would not be on the Senate floor today debating an $87 billion \nbill. They told not only the Senate and the House and the American \npeople, they told the world that Iraq had the resources to take care of \nitself. It was part of the buildup to the war, a war which was built on \nfalse premises of nuclear weapons that did not exist, fissile material \nfrom Africa that did not exist, biological and chemical weapons which \nhave not been discovered, and a link with al-Qaida which cannot be \nsubstantiated.\n  All of these were part of the rationale for invading Iraq with the \ncoalition of the willing, which contained Great Britain and precious \nfew other countries with major resources or troops. So we invaded Iraq \nand then said to the American people: Do not worry about after the war. \nThe Iraqis are really rife with all sorts of oil resources and \nrevenues. They can take care of themselves.\n  I am not making this up because if we followed the statements made by \nPaul Wolfowitz, the architect of the Iraq strategy, this is what Mr. \nWolfowitz said in March:\n\n       . . . the oil revenues of that country--\n\n  Iraq--\n\n     could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of \n     the next two or three years. . . . We're dealing with a \n     country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and \n     relatively soon.\n\n  Hello. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, how can you rationalize coming to \nCongress 6 months later and asking for $20 billion after you told us \nthat Iraq could finance its own reconstruction?\n  He was not alone in these pronouncements. This is Secretary of \nDefense Don Rumsfeld saying at about the same time:\n\n       I don't believe the United States has the responsibility \n     for reconstruction in a sense . . . And the funds can come \n     from those various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil \n     revenues and a variety of other things.\n\n  What they were trying to do was paint a picture to the American \npeople that there was no pain, all gain: We will remove Saddam Hussein \nand, frankly, the world will greet us as heroes, as will the Iraqi \npeople, and then they will use their revenues to rebuild the country \nand prove you can have a much better government in Iraq.\n  I certainly hope for the Iraqi people they do have a better \ngovernment, but should it not be at their expense rather than our \nexpense?\n\n  The point that was made by the Senator from North Dakota is a telling \npoint. We are borrowing money in the United States from Social \nSecurity, from American taxpayers, and from our children; we are \nincreasing the deficit of this country to come up with $87 billion, $20 \nbillion of which is going to rebuild Iraq.\n  We are going to have that debt when it is over, according to \nPresident Bush and his supporters on the Senate floor. Yet the reason \nwe cannot ask Iraq to shoulder this burden itself, despite all of these \npronouncements from Secretary Rumsfeld and Assistant Secretary \nWolfowitz, is that Iraq has its own obligations to countries such as \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n  Look at the debt of Iraq that we are protecting by borrowing money \nfrom Social Security. Their biggest creditors include Saudi Arabia, the \ngulf states, Kuwait, Russia, Japan, France, and Germany. Frankly, I \ncare less about the royal family in Saudi Arabia than I do about \nAmerican families counting on Social Security.\n  Why doesn't the President? Why doesn't the President of the United \nStates believe that Saudi Arabia, which trusted Saddam Hussein to lend \nhim millions of dollars, should frankly be the ones to lose in any \nbargain about Iraq's future? No. From the Bush administration \nviewpoint, the losers should be the American taxpayers, our children, \nand people counting on Social Security.\n  So the Senator from North Dakota asked an obvious question: If they \nhave all of this oil revenue, why can't they pledge that revenue to \nraise the money to rebuild their own country? It is just that simple. \nSomeone has to borrow the money to rebuild Iraq. It will either be the \nAmerican taxpayers or the\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\npeople of Iraq. I think the answer to that particular challenge is very \nobvious, and the Senator from North Dakota has hit the nail on the head \nwith his amendment.\n  Let me add something else. This administration has really been \nfloundering when it comes to the plans after the invasion of Iraq. I \ngive credit to the military. In 3 weeks they did an extraordinary job. \nSince then, things have been just fumbled around. We went from General \nGarner to Ambassador Bremer, and while we were out last week and the \nSenate was back home, Condoleezza Rice was given the authority for \nrebuilding Iraq. This is getting hard to follow. It frankly betrays the \nfact that this administration does not know which way to head.\n  Here is the fundamental problem: We want Iraq to be a stable and \nsecure nation. We would like to see them move toward self-government \nand toward a market economy, but all of this will take an enormous \namount of money and time, and an enormous departure from a country \nwhich has no history of any of the things I just mentioned.\n  Iraq was created by the British colonial empire. They drew a line on \na map and said: We will call this Iraq. Up until that point in time, \nthere was little to trace the history of anything called Iraq. Now we \nare trying to make this into a nation state. First we have to establish \nnot only a national identity that is not from the command and control \nof a dictator, but also we have to establish an economy that can build \na middle class that can participate in democracy as we know it. This is \na long, expensive process.\n  Who should pay for it? American taxpayers or the people of Iraq? I \nthink the answer to that question is very obvious. I hope my \ncolleagues, who feel duty bound to stand by the Bush administration no \nmatter what, will only stand by the statements made by the Bush \nadministration to the American people 6 months ago. If the people in \nthis Chamber will stand by the promises of Secretary Wolfowitz, Vice \nPresident Cheney, and Secretary Rumsfeld, then Senator Dorgan is going \nto be successful. However, if this turns out to be a partisan rollcall, \ntake it or leave it, you are with the President or not, then the losers \nare going to be families across America. Families are going to see \nSocial Security trust funds used to build Iraq while oil revenues in \nIraq are used to pay off the Saudis who loaned money to Saddam \nHussein. That I think is an outrageous outcome.\n\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota has it right. We have done a \ngreat deal for Iraq to date. We are spending $1 billion a week. We have \nlost over 300 brave American soldiers. Walter Reed Hospital, not far \nfrom Capitol Hill, has rooms filled with soldiers, men and women, who \nwent to Iraq who came back wounded with grievous injuries. We have \ngiven a lot. We should not ask the American taxpayers to give up more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me inquire of the Senator from Mississippi. We have \nused--might I ask how much time we on this side have used? We have had \nseveral speakers. Might I inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I don't know whether the Senator from Mississippi intends \nto speak or has speakers at this point. If he does not intend to speak, \nI will make some additional comments. If he does, I certainly will \nyield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was inquiring; I will yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom Mississippi if he is intending to speak.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have a certain amount of time under \nthe agreement. We will use that time when we choose. I do not intend to \nuse any at this time. If you want to continue to debate your amendment, \nit is your amendment. I am for the committee bill. I think the \ncommittee made the right decision. I am going to say that and cite the \nprovisions of the report underlining the rationale for the bill and the \nsupport we are trying to provide the President. So you have the \nlaboring oar, in my view.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I am \nwell aware it is my amendment, of course. Normally in the debate on \namendments, we try to go back and forth to be fair. I was simply \ninquiring whether he intended to speak. He apparently will speak at \nanother time.\n  I will make a couple of additional comments. We have some other \nSenators who are coming to the floor to comment as well.\n  Let me describe in more detail the comments by the Vice President \nbecause my colleague indicates the administration is very much opposed \nto this.\n  The administration has not been opposed to it in the past. In fact, \nthey represented to the American people that Iraq oil shall be used to \nreconstruct Iraq, so apparently it is a changed position. Let me \ndescribe in more detail the comments of the Vice President on ``Meet \nThe Press.'' This occurred in March of this year. Quoting Tim Russert, \nhe says:\n\n       Every analysis said this war itself would cost about $80 \n     billion, recovery of Baghdad, perhaps of Iraq, about $10 \n     billion per year. We should expect as American citizens that \n     this would cost at least $100 billion for a two-year \n     involvement.\n       Vice President Cheney: I can't say that, Tim. There are \n     estimates out there. It's important, though, to recognize \n     that we've got a different set of circumstances than we've \n     had in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan you've got a nation \n     without significant resources. In Iraq you've got a nation \n     that's got the second-largest oil reserves in the world, \n     second only to Saudi Arabia. It will generate billions of \n     dollars a year in cash flow if they get back to their \n     production of roughly three million barrels of oil a day, in \n     the relatively near future. And that flow of resources, \n     obviously, belongs to the Iraqi people, needs to be put to \n     use by the Iraqi people for the Iraqi people and that will be \n     one of our major objectives.\n\n  That is the Vice President.\n  Ambassador Bremer said in the last 2 weeks they will be producing 3 \nbillion barrels a day in July. That is what he testified before the \nAppropriations Committee. If that in fact is the case, apparently there \nhas been a change of mind here in the administration about whether Iraq \noil should be used for Iraq reconstruction. It was alleged by Secretary \nWolfowitz it should be, it was alleged by Secretary Rumsfeld it should \nbe, by the Vice President it should be and would be. Now, apparently, \nthey have changed their mind.\n\n  Second Rumsfeld also said to me in testimony:\n\n       What that country is suffering from [speaking of Iraq] is \n     30 years of a Stalinist-type economy and starvation of the \n     infrastructure of the needed investments. That is not the \n     obligation of the United States of America to repair.\n\n  So the 20-plus-billion-dollars request we have for reconstruction of \nIraq includes the replacement and the rehabilitation of power \ndistribution networks that were in a highly deteriorated condition \nbefore the war, $50 million to restore marshland water projects, $125 \nmillion to restore railroad tracks that suffered from severe neglect. \nLocomotives and railcars were in a deplorable state; backup generators \nwere inoperative due to lack of maintenance and spare parts.\n  But more Members of the House of Representatives of the majority \nparty saw fit to eliminate some of them--$9 million to study a ZIP Code \nfor the Iraq Government or for the country of Iraq; $50,000 apiece for \ngarbage trucks, $150 million for a children's hospital, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n  Clearly, some of it is not urgent. Some of it is not an emergency. In \nmy judgment, it ought to be paid for with Iraqi oil. That was what was \npromised and alleged by the Vice President, by the Secretary of \nDefense, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n  We are told by the President and others as well--the Secretary of \nState and Secretary of Defense--the question is, What will strengthen \nthe Iraq economy? That is an important question. I believe \nreconstruction will strengthen the Iraq economy. I believe that ought \nto be done and paid for with Iraq oil.\n  But a more important question is, What will strengthen the U.S. \neconomy? We are borrowing $20 billion. Will borrowing $20 billion and \nsending it to Iraq so Iraq can pump oil and send cash to the Saudis and \nKuwaitis strengthen the United States economy? Absolutely not. That is \nwhy I offer this amendment. This amendment failed in the Appropriations \nCommittee by a vote of 15 to 14.\n  I don't diminish the arguments of those who oppose it, but, frankly, \nI think they are wrong. I believe this was represented by the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S12518]]\n\nto be the right course. I now offer it as an amendment and will hope \nwhen we have a vote at 6:30 it will prevail.\n  I yield the floor and I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am waiting for a couple of speakers \nwhose offices have told me they are on the way. It is my understanding \nfrom the Senator from Mississippi that he or others will be speaking as \nwell. I will put us in quorum call. I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is the Senator from North Dakota suggesting a quorum call?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate in support of the \nDorgan amendment to this supplemental appropriations. I come also \nhaving been the beneficiary of the week-long recess, traveling \nthroughout my State talking to many people, hearing what is on their \nminds, trying to answer their questions and drawing some conclusions \nabout where we stand in our country on the important issue concerning \nthe mission in Iraq and the President's request for $87 billion. I \ntalked with New Yorkers from Syracuse to Staten Island. At every stop, \nI had questions and concerns expressed about this request for $87 \nbillion.\n  New Yorkers are concerned that this money is being asked for and will \nbe spent with no real plan for how we move toward the goal in Iraq to \ncreate an independent, functioning government that is able to stabilize \nthe situation there with adequate security, begin providing services to \nthe Iraqi people, and move toward self-sufficiency.\n  I also was faced with many questions about how we intend to pay for \nour commitment to Iraq and to our military forces since we are faced \nwith record deficits and increasing debt. Time and time again, I heard \nmy constituents echo the concerns of the senior Senator from Florida, \nMr. Graham, who pointed out eloquently in the Senate a short while ago \nhow in effect we are asking our children and their generation to pay \nfor the decisions we make today because we refuse to take \nresponsibility for them.\n  This is a difficult situation to describe and explain to my \nconstituents. I am asked how we can ask our taxpayers to contribute \nover $20 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq when that was never \npresented to the American public or even to the Congress. Time and time \nagain the Congress was told by administration officials that it would \nnot cost very much money, it would not take very long, and besides, we \ncould expect Iraqi oil revenues to pay for Iraqi reconstruction, and \nother nations would join us in shouldering the burden.\n  Now, of course, we are told by the administration not to expect very \nmuch from anyone else, and we cannot even look to the Iraqi oil \nrevenues at some point in the future. We should not be asking anything \nof the Iraqi people and their soon-to-be new government with respect to \nthe American taxpayers and to the sacrifice that our American men and \nwomen in uniform have made for Iraq's freedom.\n  The administration argues that this $20 billion must be given in \ngrants and not loans. The logic escapes me. Part of this money will go \nto rebuild the oil industry of Iraq. There are estimates ranging from \nhundreds of billions of barrels of recoverable oil to a trillion. There \nis no doubt that if we get this oil industry up and going, Iraq stands \nto be one of the richest nations in the world. The per capita income \ncan be expected to shoot past most of the rest of the inhabitants of \nthis globe. And I am all for it. That is wonderful. But not at the \nexpense of the American taxpayer and not at the expense of an \nincreasing deficit and debt burden on our children.\n  I am wondering how we can justify putting money in a grant to rebuild \nan oil industry that will start producing revenues that will then be \nused in part to pay back nations in the gulf and in Europe and \nelsewhere who have lent tens of billions of dollars to the former \nregime to do things like build palaces. Those who worked with, \ncollaborated with, and supported the Saddam Hussein regime could \nconceivably be paid back from the fruits of the labor of American \ntaxpayers who have gotten the oil flowing again. I, for one, cannot \nexplain that in any audience I find myself.\n  Some in the administration have argued our aid to Iraq is analogous \nto the Marshall plan. But, of course, we know it is not.\n\n  That is a good rhetorical point to make, but it is not historically \naccurate. The U.S. did provide funds to both allies and enemies after \nWorld War II based on a matching program of contributions from those \nnations. We did not offer reconstruction funds without qualification. \nWe required a commitment for some contribution from the receiving \nnation.\n  I saw a list of talking points distributed by the administration, \napparently out of the Pentagon, that listed all the reasons why loans \nwere a bad idea: We would not want any other entity, such as the new \nIraqi Government or the Coalition Provisional Authority, to be deciding \nwhere any of the money went; we would not want any, other than \nAmerican, contractors to get any of the contracts; we would not want \nanybody to think we were in it just for the oil, which they might \nsomehow believe if we had some responsible, mature relationship that \nexpected some repayment.\n  I read those talking points. I looked at those arguments, and, \nfrankly, they are not very convincing. I am still having trouble trying \nto figure out how we went from a position in the spring where \nadministration official after administration official would not tell us \nhow much it was going to cost, would not tell us how long it was going \nto take, would not tell us how long we were going to be there, and \nalways reassured us that it was going to be paid for with the revenues \nfrom Iraqi oil once it began flowing, to where we cannot even ask for \nany kind of repayment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed the 8 minutes yielded \nto her.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I strongly support the Dorgan amendment. I think it is \nthe right thing for Iraq. I think it is the right thing for our \ncountry. It sets the right tone about how we are going to be dealing \nwith this situation going forward. It lays down a marker that we are \nwilling to shoulder this burden, but we expect at some point in the \nfuture for the American taxpayers of this or the next generation to be \ngiven some repayment opportunity from a new nation that we helped to \ncreate that, hopefully, will have the kind of future we are counting on \nand that many of us support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota no longer has \nadequate time to suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n\n[[Page S12519]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. It is unwise and uncharacteristic of the greatness and \nstrength of America and in many ways could increase the risk that we \nmay cause to young Americans who are fighting in defense of freedom in \nIraq and trying to help that country begin the process of democracy and \na free society. It is an extremely difficult task and one which will \nrequire a long period of time.\n  I don't share the view of some that the situation in Iraq is bright \nand wonderful. I don't agree with the opinion of some others who think \nthat things are in a very bad state. I think progress is being made. In \nthe northern part of Iraq there is real stability. In the southern part \nof Iraq there is significant progress.\n  All you have to do is pick up a newspaper or turn on the television \nor radio and hear that things are not so good in some parts of the \ncountry, particularly in the area we refer to as the Sunni Triangle. \nEvery day there is some kind of attack mounted against American troops, \nagainst installations, car bombs. Our military leaders have stated that \nthe attacks, primarily aimed at American soldiers and installations, \nare becoming more and more sophisticated.\n  In my view--and my view is shared by many others who are more expert \nand more knowledgeable than I--the battle for the hearts and minds--\ndare I use that phrase--in Iraq is still going on. We are winning that \nbattle in some parts of Iraq. In other parts, it is still up for grabs.\n  Those who are the former Baathists, the terrorists, the extremists, \nthis rather unusual combination of opponents of the United States and \nopponents of the democratization of Iraq, are echoing a similar theme: \nThe United States is not in Iraq to free the Iraqi people. The United \nStates is in Iraq for the oil.\n  That theme is being echoed and re-echoed throughout the Middle East, \nnot just in Iraq but in every extremist Muslim madras in the Middle \nEast, every dictatorship, in every oppressive regime that recognizes if \ndemocracy and freedom comes to Iraq, then their days are numbered, they \nare through, they are finished because we can prove in Iraq that \ndemocracy and a free and open society can grow and prosper anywhere in \nthe world, including the Middle East.\n  Here is what they are saying. They are saying: Here is the history of \nthe United States involvement with Iraq. All during the 1980s, the \nUnited States Government propped up Saddam Hussein and did a lot of \nbusiness with him. He had a war with Iran. We took his side in the war \nwith Iran. In 1991, in the gulf war, we defeated Saddam Hussein soundly \nand we told the Iraqi people that he would be gone. He wasn't gone. In \nfact, he went into these very same areas and slaughtered thousands of \npeople as he reasserted his grip on power. I have seen one of the mass \ngraves. No, Saddam Hussein, they are saying, was left in power by the \nUnited States of America and allowed to freely oppress the people of \nIraq and brutally repress and murder and commit unspeakable atrocities \non the Iraqi people, when the United States told the Iraqi people that \nhe would be gone.\n  They are also saying: Do you know why the economic conditions in Iraq \nwere so terrible all during the 1990s? Do you know why you have an \nairport out here at Basra that is in mint condition but has never been \nused? Because of American economic sanctions imposed through the United \nNations on Iraq.\n  Now the United States finally overthrew Saddam Hussein and they are \ngoing to demand our oil. In return for money, they are going to take \nour oil, the oil which we need, we, the Iraqi people, in order to \nrebuild the infrastructure of our country.\n  Mr. President, that argument is going to gain traction in some parts \nof Iraq--that the United States came for the oil and now we are asking \nfor them to pay up. If we are concerned--and I know we all are--about \nthe lives and safety of the young men and women serving in Iraq in the \nmilitary, I can tell you this will put them in greater danger. If the \nopponents--this unusual combination of extremists and Baathists and \nterrorists, and this unusual but lethal cocktail of opponents of Iraqi \nfreedom--are given additional propaganda, then I think it is going to \nbe obviously very harmful to our effort to democratize and free Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the fact there is no possibility that \nthe Iraqi people and government--when it comes into being--could pay \nback any debt in the short term. It is not possible. If we want to \ncondition future aid at a future time on a loan, or some kind of \nrepayment, then I think it should be discussed and debated given the \nclimate of the times at that time. But to at this moment in time, when \nwe still have not gained the support of the Iraqi people that we need \nnot only to ensure further democratization and freedom of Iraq--to \nprotect the lives of the young men and women who are serving so nobly \nin Iraq, let's not do it at this time. Let's reject this amendment.\n  I don't impugn the motives or the patriotism of the sponsors of this \namendment. I think it is hard to answer to our constituents why we are \nspending so much money there and not getting it back. I understand that \nand sympathize with that argument. One of my colleagues recently talked \nwith great emotion about the loss of jobs in his State. These are all \ncompelling problems. But I don't see how anyone could argue coherently \nthat, at this moment, to send the wrong signal would be the right thing \nto do to achieve any of those goals.\n  I repeat that the battle is still on for the hearts and minds of the \nIraqi people. We are a great and generous nation. We have proven that \ntime after time after time. I think it is time for this body to express \nthat generosity, that commitment--which only the United States has ever \nreally displayed--to freedom and democracy in Iraq and tell these \npeople we are going to do everything we can to help rebuild their \ncountry, we will help them on the road to freedom and democracy, and at \nthe end of the day, years from now, that gratitude on the part of the \nIraqi people will be displayed to us in many ways, that will far exceed \nany benefits that might be accrued from this being some kind of a loan \nthat would be paid back.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand the seriousness of this issue. \nIt won't stop us from going about the work of securing the peace in \nIraq, but it will set it back and it will send the wrong signal at the \nwrong time about the United States, true commitment in this country.\n  Mr. President, too many young Americans have already made the supreme \nsacrifice for us to go back on that commitment now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  To refresh the memory of the Senate, it is good to look at the exact \nwording of this amendment that was offered by the Senator from North \nDakota and others. The amendment provides that:\n\n       The President shall direct the head of the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority in Iraq, in coordination with the \n     Governing Council of Iraq or a successor governing authority \n     in Iraq, to establish an Iraq Reconstruction Finance \n     Authority. The purpose of the Authority shall be to obtain \n     financing for the reconstruction of the infrastructure in \n     Iraq by collateralizing the revenue from future sales of oil \n     extracted in Iraq. The Authority shall obtain financing for \n     the reconstruction of the infrastructure in Iraq through\n       (1)(A) issuing securities or other financial instruments; \n     or\n       (B) obtaining loans on the open market from private banks \n     or international financial institutions; and\n       (2) to the maximum extent possible, securitizing or \n     collateralizing such securities, instruments, or loans with \n     the revenue from the future sales of oil extracted in Iraq.\n\n  My personal impression from the reading of this amendment is that the \n$21 billion that is struck from the bill by this provision--because the \namendment begins by striking that $21 billion and substituting this \nprovision that I just read. My impression is that this is smoke and \nmirrors, pure and simple. What the amendment would really do would be \nto prevent making available to the Coalition Provisional Authority, \ntrying to guarantee the reconstruction of Iraq and the possibility for \nthe Iraqi people to live in peace and security and in an environment \nwhere democracy would be possible, self-government probable--that you \ncould do it for nothing. That is what the assumption\n\n[[Page S12520]]\n\nis that underlies this amendment. The assumption is that you can do it \nfor nothing. No private bank is going to make a loan in the environment \nthat exists today in Iraq, with the threats to the security of the \npeople who are cooperating in the reconstruction of Iraq, the threats \nto the Iraqi people who are cooperating with the coalition to \nreconstruct Iraq--as they are. People are being shot at in the streets. \nThere is an atmosphere where there is a great deal of fear and \nsuspicion.\n  We have to, if we are to succeed in helping create this new Iraq--\nwhich I applaud the President for trying to do; it will be a \ncontribution to the peace and stability of not only that region but the \nworld, in my opinion. If we want to support the President's efforts, we \nwill vote against this amendment and permit the funds that were \napproved by the Appropriations Committee when it rejected this \namendment in the committee after hearing testimony from an array of \nwitnesses who are familiar with the situation in Iraq. The committee \nrecommended the approval of these funds--the total appropriation asked \nfor by the President--for the military operations, the increase in the \nequipment, ammunition, other resources that our troops need to protect \nthemselves and to carry out their mission and to bring it to a \nsuccessful conclusion. Those funds are included in this bill, but also \nadditional funds that are the target of this amendment, which will help \nin the reconstruction and make it possible to reconstruct the country \nso that the people of Iraq can take care of themselves in a military \nsense, with officers involved in police activity, patrolling the \nstreets to help guarantee that those who are engaged in positive, \nconstructive work there in Iraq can do so with security and without \nfear of their lives.\n  That is what the bill is for. That is the goal of the mission of our \ntroops, working with the other nations. Some 30 other nations are \nactively involved with people there, risking their lives trying to help \nthis country rebuild itself from the ravages of the Saddam Hussein \nregime.\n  So if we vote for this amendment and if we reject the decision the \nAppropriations Committee made, we are putting in jeopardy all of the \neffort and all of the investment that has gone on, all of the risks \ntaken by so many to make this a successful operation to help establish \nan atmosphere for freedom, democracy, self-government, for an economy \nthat can be successful in Iraq so that we can see our direct support of \nthis new Coalition Provisional Authority and the government that will \nbe formed as a result of its efforts.\n  I am hopeful we will recognize the fact that we had solid convincing \ntestimony before our committee at the hearings. Ambassador Bremer \ntestified, the Secretaries of State and Defense testified, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Abizaid, in charge of \nthe military operation there, all in support not just of the military \naspect, the $80 billion plus for military activity in direct support of \nour military forces, but the additional funds which are the target of \nthis amendment.\n  Schools have started throughout Iraq. Hospitals have been reopened \nthroughout Iraq. That will all come to an end. The continuation of the \nrecovery effort and the progress being made will be put in jeopardy if \nthese funds are not approved.\n  Not only are banks unwilling to make direct loans to this new \ngovernment under the security situation that now exists, but nobody \nwill securitize or collateralize future revenues from any source, oil \nor anything else. To assume this oil has a great monetary value right \nnow to anybody is just a false assumption. It is in the ground, right, \nbut it is not being produced. It is not being transported or marketed \nin sufficient quantities that anyone would be willing to take the risk \nof making a loan to a provisional authority created at this time in \nIraq. It is just not possible to expect that.\n  Nobody testified before our committee that I can remember saying that \nwould be a good idea. I don't recall a single financial expert coming \nin to dispute this administration's recommendation that funds be made \navailable to help reconstruct the capacity to produce oil and to get \nIraq's economy moving. Nobody suggested an alternative, certainly not \nthis one. I don't recall hearing a witness. Maybe in the time remaining \nto the Senator from North Dakota he can cite that effort, he can cite \nthat testimony.\n  We heard political arguments preying on the suspicions of others, \npreying on the political aspirations of others who may challenge the \nadministration's policies, and we can have that debate, but this is not \na good substitute for the provisions that we have in the bill today \nbefore the Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We have looked through the administration's request very \ncarefully, and there were some disagreements about specific items. The \nother body has completed action in its committee on this appropriations \nrequest, and there are some differences. We will have an opportunity in \nconference to look at some of the specific suggestions the House has \nmade, and I think they have made some good ones. We will work together \nwith our House colleagues and counterparts to prepare a conference \nreport that we hope will meet the approval of the Senate, as well as \nthe House, and that the President can sign, and we can move forward.\n  This is a smoke-and-mirrors amendment, Mr. President, purely and \nsimply. You cannot have it both ways. As I remember, one of my good \nfriends on the other side, after looking at a proposal that we had \nbefore us one time, said: This is like smoke and mirrors. In fact, \nthere is so much smoke; you can't even find the mirrors; you can't see \nthe mirrors.\n  I am not trying to be too cute. I don't want to try to create that \nimpression, but I am very serious in my suggestion that it would be a \nbig mistake if we adopted this amendment. I hope the Senate will reject \nthe amendment. The committee looked very carefully at the amendment \nwhen it was offered in our markup session and rejected the amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am hopeful, as we proceed to a final discussion, that \nthe Senate will look at the testimony we had before our committee, \nconsider carefully the implications of denying these funds to the \nadministration and the fact that it would contribute to a greater \ndegree of instability in that country with a greater degree of risk for \nour troops who are now there, the civilians who are there from some 30-\nodd countries trying to be helpful in the reconstruction of this \ncountry. It would create a much more dangerous situation, and I don't \nthink we want to be a party to that. That would be a result, unintended \nof course, that would flow from the adoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. Landrieu addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I believe we have 1\\1/2\\ minutes. I wanted to ask the \nSenator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Who yields to the Senator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 minute 37 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My hope had been the normal courtesy of the Senate to \nhave the offeror of the amendment close debate. That may not be \npossible because of the strategy of the quorum call here, so I don't \nknow what the intention of the Senator from Mississippi is. In most \ncases, those who offer the amendment are allowed to close debate. I \nhoped to do that for 5 minutes. If I am prevented from doing that, we \nwill deal with that at a later time.\n  But in the remaining time, I wish to make one point. The Senator from \nMississippi says he didn't hear any witnesses describe this approach to \nreconstruction. You know why they didn't hear any witnesses? Because \nSenator Byrd asked again and again to bring\n\n[[Page S12521]]\n\nwitnesses before the committee and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle decided they would not allow it to happen. They would not \nallow other witnesses to come before the committee. So it is curious \nnow to hear people complain about not hearing other witnesses when \nthey, in fact, prevented them from testifying before the committee.\n  I yield the floor, and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as we continue to debate this \nsupplemental, we continue to find ourselves dancing around a very \nimportant question that we've been asked--the one that Senator Dorgan \nraises today: how is reconstruction in Iraq to be paid for?\n  First, let me say that it is clear that we unequivocally support our \ntroops and nearly all of us support their mission. I voted to support \nthe President in this effort a year ago this month and continue to \nsupport our efforts to liberate Iraq from the terror that continues to \ngrip its citizens.\n  But, the answer to the question of cost is much less clear.\n  Last week I came to the Floor in support of Senator Biden's amendment \nto rollback a small portion of the President's May 2003 tax cut. \nSenator Biden's amendment would have paid for this supplemental while \nprotecting every American from undue hardship.\n  That amendment failed to gain the necessary support that would have \nmade it part of this supplemental. And, those who voted against that \namendment have yet to tell the rest of us how it is that we can afford \nto spend $20 billion on Iraqi reconstruction and pass that cost onto \nour children.\n  So, as of today, we still have not figured out how to pay for our \nefforts in Iraq.\n  For a moment, let us set aside the portion of the supplemental that I \nbelieve has nearly universal support here in the Senate--that being the \nportion to pay for ongoing military operations.\n  Let us focus instead on that portion of the supplemental that deals \nexclusively with reconstruction in Iraq.\n  The administration would like us to approve more than $20 billion for \nprojects we all consider necessary for any fledgling nation, but should \nthe American public or the Iraqi people pay for these types of \nimprovements? Should the American people be paying for pickup trucks, \nradios and computer training? Remember, these are improvements that \nwere, in large part, needed prior to our arrival in Iraq.\n  Let me be clear, I am not questioning the need for these \nimprovements, but rather who ultimately pays for them.\n  In February 2003, and on at least three other occasions, we were told \nby the White House that ``Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy \ncountry. Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. \nAnd so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to \nshoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction.''\n  The White House knows, as we do, that Iraq is in control of the \nsecond largest proven oil reserve on the planet and modern financing \ntechniques will allow Iraq to leverage these natural resources to \nrebuild its nation.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment encapsulates an idea that is proven and at \nwork all over the globe. The worldwide securitization market is in \nexcess of $2 trillion.\n  We have heard from several experts, including the Export-Import Bank, \nthat securitization is workable and, in this case, desirable.\n  Securitization is the most legitimate way to provide reconstruction \ndollars and to foster a sense of Iraqi ownership in the outcome of this \nprocess of liberation, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Time will run equally against \nboth sides if no side yields time.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All remaining \ntime is controlled by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:30 having arrived, the Senate \nwill move to a vote in relation to the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1826. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kohl), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent.) Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 380 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lieberman\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of \nSenators Daschle and Graham of South Carolina to close an unfortunate \nand unacceptable gap in health insurance coverage for families of \nReserve and Guard members called up for active duty. The amendment is \nespecially important now, when so many Reserve and Guard members are \nbeing called up for duty in Iraq.\n  We all know that our Armed Forces are stretched thin. They are paying \na heavy price for the Bush administration's gross miscalculation about \nIraq. The burden is now falling heavily on the Reserve and National \nGuard as well. Over 215,000 Guard and Reserve men and women have not \nbeen mobilized to ease the burden on our regular forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and in homeland security as well.\n  One challenge they should not have to face is maintaining health \ninsurance for their families. The immediate problem is that, too few \nprivate employers are willing to continue coverage for Guard and \nReserve employees and family members when the employees are activated.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, nearly 80 percent of all \nreservists have health coverage through their jobs in the private \nsector. They far prefer to continue that coverage when they are \nactivated. The military's TRICARE coverage works well for the \nreservists themselves when they are activated. But it is often not \npractical for their family members, since their homes are often too far \nfrom the military bases where the TRICARE doctors have their medical \npractices and doctors in the area near their homes often do not accept \nTRICARE coverage.\n\n  Even when TRICARE coverage makes sense, it is often difficult to \ntransfer to TRICARE for a year and then transfer back to their \nemployer-sponsored plan after their deactivation, especially if they \nhave a so-called preexisting condition that could make them \nuninsurable.\n\n[[Page S12522]]\n\n  I recently met with an Air Force family in Boston who had lost their \nhealth care as a result of the mobilization for Iraq. The family joined \nTRICARE, but few physicians and even fewer specialists were willing to \ntake their insurance.\n  Clearly, we need to do more to guarantee that good health insurance \ncoverage is available. All our military families, including members of \nthe Reserve and Guard deserve good coverage. We need to do everything \nwe can to avoid unnecessary upheaval in the lives of these families who \nare sacrificing so much for our country.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this proposal to make \nTRICARE available to Reserve and Guard personnel and their families. It \nis a problem we should have corrected long before now and we could have \navoided this sudden crisis for so many of these families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the Senator from \nNevada for purposes of offering some amendments, and then I would like \nto get a time agreement, if we can, on the amendments that we are going \nto lay down and debate tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to my friend, the manager \nof the bill, I am going to send a couple amendments to the desk. \nThereafter, Senator Corzine is going to offer an amendment, and he \nwishes 12 minutes tonight. The Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, is \ngoing to offer an amendment. He is going to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are preparing a unanimous consent \nrequest. May we----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am advised Senator Durbin wants to lay \ndown an amendment following Senator Reed and wants to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to start the process of \nhaving amendments offered from this side, too. So we are going to have \ntwo from that side. Can we reserve a time for people to offer \namendments over here and decide about--I do not have any problem with \nSenator Durbin offering an amendment, but the order of presenting them \nwe will decide tomorrow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me yield to the Senator to offer amendments.\n  And may I ask Senator Corzine to hold off until we get an agreement \nconcerning these two amendments we are going to consider?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1835\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Reid and Senator Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mrs. \n     Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered 1835.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They know what is in those. I do not think we \nare in a position at this time to make an agreement on the amendment by \nthe Senator from Illinois because they have not seen his amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have no problem with Senator Corzine, \nSenator Reed, and Senator Durbin offering their amendments, but in the \nline here of being pending, of amendments being set aside temporarily, \nI would like the right tomorrow to suggest the order in which these \nwill be presented following the votes on Senator Corzine's and Senator \nReed's amendments.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the age for \n receipt of military retired pay for nonregular service from 60 to 55)\n\n       On page 22, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 316. (a) Section 12731(a)(1) of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``at least 60 years of \n     age'' and inserting ``at least 55 years of age''.\n       (b) With respect to any provision of law, or of any policy, \n     regulation, or directive of the executive branch, that refers \n     to a member or former member of the uniformed services as \n     being eligible for, or entitled to, retired pay under chapter \n     1223 of title 10, United States Code, but for the fact that \n     the member or former member is under 60 years of age, such \n     provision shall be carried out with respect to that member or \n     former member by substituting for the reference to being 60 \n     years of age a reference to the age in effect for \n     qualification for such retired pay under section 12731(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a).\n       (c) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect \n     on the first day of the first month beginning on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to retired \n     pay payable for that month and subsequent months.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin, \nand hopefully others, this amendment is designed to reduce the \nretirement age for members of the National Guard and Reserves from 60 \nto 55. This change would allow for an estimated 92,000 reservists, \ncurrently age 55 to 59, to retire with full benefits and would restore \nparity between the retirement systems for Federal civilian employees \nand reservists.\n  Just to refresh my colleagues' memory, regular military personnel can \nretire after 20 years of service regardless of their age--38, 48, 55, \nor 60--and receive their retirement benefits at the time of retirement. \nAs we reflect on the demands placed on our soldiers in Iraq, \nparticularly our Reserve and Guard forces--of which there are roughly \n20,000 in theater--there is no more appropriate time to consider this \nimportant proposal to support these brave men and women.\n  As a matter of basic fairness, it is only right to restore parity \nbetween the retirement age for civilian employees and their Reserve \ncounterparts.\n  When the Reserve retirement system was created in 1947, the \nretirement age for reservists was identical to the age for civilian \nemployees. At age 60, reservists and Government employees could hang up \ntheir uniforms and retire with full benefits. However, since 1947, the \nretirement age for civilian retirees has been lowered by 5 years while \nthe retirement age has not changed for reservists and guards.\n  The disparate treatment of Federal employees and reservists would \nhave been serious enough had the nature of the work performed by the \nreservists been steady over the past five decades, but today this \ncountry places an increasingly heavy demand on its Ready Reserve, more \nof a demand than has ever been the case in our Nation's history. Today \nmore than 200,000 reservists have been called up to serve their country \nin the war on terrorism, and 170,000 of these reservists and Guard \ntroops are now on active duty, here at home and abroad. America's \ndependence on our Ready Reserve has never been more transparent to the \nAmerican people. Reservists are now providing security at our Nation's \nairports, and they patrol the air over our major cities. They provide \ncaps, protection.\n  With call-ups that last several months and take reservists far from \nhome in serving our Nation, it is increasingly clear that reservists \nare performing the same role as those on active duty and any other \nservice. Before the war on terrorism, reservists were performing 13 \nmillion man-days each year--get the idea of how big that is--more than \na tenfold increase over the 1 million man-days the Reserves averaged \njust 10 years ago. It has moved dramatically, even before the war on \nterrorism began.\n  In fiscal year 2002, reservists contributed 41 million man-days. And \nthis year, in fiscal year 2003, that number will be up again. So we are \nusing our Reserve Forces dramatically more than was ever the case in \nthe history of the Reserve and Guard units. These people are on active \nduty for an increasing amount of time, particularly as we justify and \nmove forward with the war on terrorism. These are staggering increases. \nThose defenders of the American people should have that recognized by \nshortening their time before they are eligible for retirement. In my \nview, with additional responsibility should come additional benefits.\n  I know this proposal is not without cost. But not improving the \nreservists' benefits also will have a cost, potentially a severe cost. \nAfter all, in recent years we have seen our military struggling to meet \nrecruitment and retention goals. It has been even more severe sometimes \nwith our Guard and Reserve. That has improved somewhat after 9/11. But \nunless the overall package of incentives is enhanced, there is little \nreason to believe we will be able to attract and retain highly trained \nReserve personnel over the long run, particularly as their deployments \nand the number of man-hours has increased.\n\n  Active-duty military personnel have often looked to the Reserves as a \nway to continue to serve their country while being closer to their \nfamilies. We have been drawing people out of the active military into \nthe Reserve. With thousands of dollars invested in training active-duty \nofficers and enlisted soldiers, the United States benefits tremendously \nwhen personnel decide to continue with the Reserves. But with Reserve \ndeployments increasing in frequency and duration, pulling reservists \naway from their families and civilian life, imposing real hardships on \nthose families, the advantage in joining the\n\n[[Page S12524]]\n\nReserves has been dramatically reduced. There is no question about \nthat.\n  The more we depend on the Reserves, the greater chance we have of \nlosing highly trained former active-duty service men and women and a \nnumber of people who have just joined the Active Reserve because they \nthought it was a way they could supplement income and be involved in \nsupporting our Nation.\n  In my view, the added incentive of full retirement at 55 might \nprovide just the inducement some of them need to stay on despite the \nsurge in deployments. By the way, to illustrate, in the period 1953 to \n1990, there were 11 deployments of reservists and guards. Between 1991 \nand 2001, there have been 50 deployments of reservists and guards. Now \nthose numbers are accelerating as we take on this war on terrorism.\n  It is an enormous change in how we are utilizing our Reserve Forces. \nI hear from the guards and reservists in New Jersey to whom I spoke \ndirectly that one of those things they are most interested in is seeing \na shortening of the period before they have access to retirement \nbenefits. It will make a big difference in their lives. They consider \nit important.\n  Enacting this legislation will send a clear message that our Nation \nvalues the increased sacrifice of our reservists during this trying \ntime. This proposal has been endorsed by key members of a broad \nmilitary coalition, including the Reserve Officers Association, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Air \nForce Association, and Retired Enlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, the Naval Reserve Association, and the National Guard \nAssociation. All of the groups that represent these individuals in our \nsystem are strongly supporting this initiative. It would restore parity \nbetween the Reserves retirement system of our Guard and Reserve and the \ncivilian retirement system, acknowledge the increased workload of \nreservists, and provide essential personnel with the inducement to join \nand stay in the Reserves until retirement.\n  I do hope my colleagues will support this amendment. This is the \nappropriate time given what kind of challenge we are laying down for \nour National Guard and Reserve across this country. We have increased \ntheir responsibilities. We have put severe challenges in front of them \nand their families, and it is our responsibility, in my view, to \nrecognize that and to address it. I think one of the best ways to do \nthat is to reduce the retirement age for the Reserve and the Guard.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for 5 minutes and lay down an amendment out of line before giving \nthe floor to Senator Reed, who will do the same with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague, who is a Boston Red \nSox fan, for allowing me an opportunity to present this amendment so I \ncan watch the Cubs in a few minutes. I owe him big for this one.\n  This amendment takes into consideration that we have 1.2 million \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve. Of that number, some 120,000 \nare also Federal employees--10 percent of the National Guard and \nReserve--and 14,000 of the Federal employees are currently mobilized \nand serve on active duty.\n  All across the United States, States, local governments, and private \ncorporations have said to the men and women in the Reserve and Guard: \nIf you are activated and mobilized, we will hold you harmless in terms \nof your salary. We will make up the difference between your military \npay and what you would have made at home so that your family won't \nsuffer a hardship and have to make a sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S12525]]\n\n  Sadly, we do not make the same concession for Federal employees. My \nReservist Pay Security Act of 2003 is legislation that will help \nalleviate the problems faced by many Federal employees who serve in the \nReserves and must take time off from their jobs when our Nation calls. \nIt allows these citizen-soldiers to maintain their normal salary when \ncalled to active service by requiring Federal agencies to make up the \ndifference.\n  This amendment is affordable. A recent Department of Defense survey \nof 35,000 reservists found that 41 percent lost income during \nmobilization and deployment, while 59 percent either broke even or \nincreased their income on active duty. Of those who reported losing \nincome, most--70 percent--said their income was reduced by $3,750 or \nless while serving on active duty.\n  Based on CBO estimates, this measure to protect the income of Federal \nemployees who are activated and mobilized in Guard and Reserve units \nwould cost us approximately $75 million for the next fiscal year. That \nseems like a very small amount in an $87 billion supplemental.\n  I think we need to provide these Reserve employees financial support \nso they can leave their civilian lives and serve our country without \nthe added burden on their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) In addition to the strengths authorized by \n     law for personnel of the Army as of September 30, 2004, \n     pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 115(a) of title \n     10, United States Code, the Army is hereby authorized an \n     additional strength of 10,000 personnel as of such date, \n     which the Secretary of the Army may allocate as the Secretary \n     determines appropriate among the personnel strengths required \n     by such section to be authorized annually under subparagraphs \n     (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of such section and paragraph \n     (2) of such section.\n       (b) The additional personnel authorized under subsection \n     (a) shall be trained, incorporated into an appropriate force \n     structure, and used to perform constabulary duty in such \n     specialties as military police, light infantry, civil \n     affairs, and special forces, and in any other military \n     occupational specialty that is appropriate for constabulary \n     duty.\n       (c) Of the amount appropriated under chapter 1 of this \n     title for the Iraq Freedom Fund, $409,000,000 shall be \n     available for necessary expenses for the additional personnel \n     authorized under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with Senator Hagel of \nNebraska. It would increase the end strength of our Army so we can deal \nwith the increasing turbulence throughout the world that we have been \nconfronting since 9/11--indeed before then.\n  Our military forces are without equal. They combine superb technology \nwith bravery and devotion to the Nation. They are well led, \nparticularly by extraordinary noncommissioned officers and junior \nofficers. These qualities extend to both Active and Reserve components. \nHistory has never seen such a formidable force. However, history is \nreplete with examples of superb military forces worn down because they \nwere overextended.\n  Today, that danger is approaching our Army as it copes with worldwide \ncommitments and the difficult challenge of a violent insurgency in Iraq \nand a resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n  This chart depicts the deployment of soldiers. There are 325,000 \nsoldiers in 120 countries. In Iraq, there are about 120,000; in Kuwait, \nabout 22,000; in Afghanistan, approximately 11,000. They are all across \nthe globe performing missions that are important to us and our national \nsecurity and our safety. This situation of an extended Army has been \ndeveloping over many years. Since 1989, the Army's military end \nstrength has been cut by more than 34 percent and civilian strength by \n45 percent, while undergoing a 300-percent increase in mission rate. \nFewer people, more demand. That has been the record since 1989 and \nbefore that even.\n  This operational tempo certainly became acute after September 11 and \nthe commencement of the global war on terrorism. A respected voice who \ndevoted his life to serving the nation, GEN Frederick Kroesen, wrote in \nNovember 2002, before the initiation of operations in Iraq:\n\n       It appears to this interested observer that we are \n     expending the force and doing little to ensure its viability \n     in the years to come, years we have been assured it will take \n     to win the war on terrorism. The quality of our effort, high \n     and commendable during the first year and showing no signs of \n     deterioration, can in the long run only be sustained by \n     preparing now for the force we will need then. Barring the \n     unlikely scenario of an all-out war and full mobilization, \n     soldiers now fighting the war on terrorism, with few \n     exceptions, will not be available for fighting two years from \n     now. Units and organizations of the reserve components, \n     mobilized for the first year of war, will not be available \n     for more of the same service off into the indefinite future. \n     It might be prudent now to ask the managers who decreed the \n     current second-year Reservists' extensions what they plan for \n     the third year.\n       The answer, of course, is to increase the size of the Army. \n     On September 10, 2001, the Army was too small for the \n     missions with which it was charged--a fact reported by both \n     the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army in congressional \n     testimony of that year.\n       On September 11, Army mission requirements grew \n     significantly; the Army did not. It instead begins the \n     expending of it and establishes the need to begin planning \n     for the replacement of that which is being used up.\n\n  General Kroesen, a distinguished soldier, commanded the 82nd Airborne \nDivision when I served as a young lieutenant. His insights are both \nprofound and to me compelling.\n  Again, these words from General Kroesen were written before Operation \nIraqi Freedom and before we found ourselves in a prolonged and costly \neffort to defeat an insurgency and rebuild a nation. The added stress \nof Iraq has made the acute absolutely critical.\n  James Kitfield of the National Journal wrote an insightful analysis \nof the stresses affecting the Army. He points out how this breakneck \noperational tempo is imposing great burdens throughout the Army. In his \nwords:\n\n       To understand why, shift the focus from individual soldiers \n     to major units such as the 82nd Airborne Division. \n     Traditionally America's quick reaction division, the 82nd \n     currently has a brigade in Iraq and another in Afghanistan. \n     The 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne, however, is the one \n     that most concerns Army planners. After leaving Afghanistan \n     earlier this year, the 3rd Brigade was home only about 6 \n     months before being sent to help relieve the 3rd Infantry \n     Division.\n\n  Then there is the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. Having \nreturned recently from Germany from an extended peacekeeping deployment \nin the Balkans, the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade are becoming \nreacquainted with their families and relearning the kinds of high-\nintensity combat skills the Army put to such impressive use during the \nIraq war. That training cycle itself requires weeks away from home. The \n1st Infantry soldiers will not have much time before turning their \nfocus to deployment preparations, however, because the 3rd Brigade is \nheading to Iraq next March to relieve elements of the 4th Infantry \nDivision.\n  What we are seeing every day is an increasing cycle of deployment and \nredeployment of brigades and divisions being shuffled about to cover \nall of these tremendous worldwide domains. This tempo and this stress \nis beginning to show in terms of our soldiers and in terms of the Army. \nUnless we provide additional soldiers for the Army, these stresses will \nbe manifested in growing problems, such as difficulties in recruitment \nand retention and difficulties in adequately and thoroughly training \nthe force.\n  The Army has begun to cancel or postpone many exercises and training \nrotations. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that since October \n1, 2002, the Pentagon has canceled or postponed 49 of the 182 training \nexercises scheduled for this fiscal year.\n  The superb force that entered Iraq was forged through intensive \ntraining. Without such training, we will lose the\n\n[[Page S12526]]\n\nedge in a world where there are other potential adversaries, such as \nNorth Korea whose army is more tenacious than the Iraqis under Saddam.\n  The effects on recruitment and retention are likely to be seen first \nin the National Guard and Reserves. Indeed, unless we add more active \ncomponent soldiers, we will continue to rely on the National Guard and \nReserves to fill the gaps. Such a policy is unsustainable over an \nextended period.\n  National Guard men and women and Reserve forces are dedicated \npatriots and skilled professionals, but they have lives outside the \nArmy. If we continually force them to choose between service to the \nNation and supporting their families, they will ultimately and \ninvariably choose their families.\n  Moreover, the stresses on the Guard and Reserves are not localized in \na few communities. These stresses are transmitted to every corner of \nthe country, and we will have great difficulty maintaining public \nsupport for an extended operation in Iraq if the public sees that \noperation through the prism of neighbors repeatedly called to service \nand sacrifice without relief.\n  There has been much discussion about the adequacy of our force \nstructure in Iraq, and I have become increasingly skeptical of the \nadequacy of the force structure in Iraq. You just have to pick up \ntoday's New York Times where there is an article that describes the \nfact that there is approximately 1 million tons of ammunition in Iraq, \nmuch of it unsecured because, frankly, we don't have enough troops \nthere. We don't have enough American troops. We have not received our \ninternational reinforcements, and we have not yet effectively trained \nand deployed Iraqi troops.\n  What is also frightening is the fact that apparently the Saddam \nHussein regime stockpiled at least 5,000 shoulder-fired missiles, air \ndefense missiles, capable of bringing down aircraft. Only about a third \nof these missiles are accounted for. There is the alarming possibility, \nbecause we are unable to secure these ammo dumps, that literally \nthousands of shoulder-fired air defense missiles are in Iraq or, even \nmore alarming, have filtered outside the country to terrorist groups. \nSo there is increasing evidence that the forces we have on the ground \nare not doing an essential job, which is to protect themselves from \nmunitions going into the hands of terrorists and being used against our \ntroops.\n  Regardless of how one feels about the number of troops in Iraq, we \nsimply will not be able to maintain even that level unless we increase \nthe end strength of our Army. Increased reliance on Guard and Reserves \nis not a sensible long-term strategy, and the arrival of international \nreinforcements is problematic. The Army is trying to squeeze more boots \non the ground from its current forces, but this improvisation is a \nquick fix, not a long-term solution.\n  This amendment would authorize and would pay for an increase in the \nactive duty Army end strength by 10,000 personnel and would focus on \nforces needed for constabulary duty, such as military police, civil \naffairs, light infantry, and special operations.\n  The objective of end strength, meaning the number of personnel \npermitted to serve in the military, was succinctly summed up by retired \nGEN Gordon R. Sullivan:\n\n       The objective is to have enough soldiers to execute Army \n     missions at the right time and the right place, have enough \n     in the total to have both tactical and operations flexibility \n     and to have adequate depth in numbers to support leader \n     development, required force structure manning and the \n     requisite balance needed across the ranks.\n\n  Indeed, the current numbers are not giving the flexibility and the \nredundancy we should have built in to our military.\n  Each year in the Defense authorization bill, Congress authorizes the \nend strength of each branch of the military service. There is a \nseparate end strength number for the Active and Reserve component, \nwhich includes the National Guard.\n\n  Presently, the authorized active duty end strength for the Army is \n480,000. The authorized end strength for the Army National Guard is \n350,000, and the authorized end strength for the Army Reserve is \n205,000.\n  In addition, there is a variance, which means the Secretary of \nDefense is authorized to exceed the active duty end strength by 3 \npercent when necessary, and the Guard and Reserve end strength by 2 \npercent.\n  I would argue that the present authorized end strength today, even \nwith the allowed variance, does not provide enough Army personnel to \nprovide the depth, the flexibility, and the balance it needs to carry \nout the missions of today and the future. This Army is stretched across \nthe globe. The demands increase and the number of soldiers who are \navailable is not able to give that needed flexibility, that \nadaptability, and that balance.\n  Five years ago in the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999, \nCongress lowered the authorized active duty end strength from 495,000 \nto its present 480,000. So there were at least 15,000 more soldiers \nseveral years ago before the war on terror, before the war in Iraq, \nbefore contingencies that have yet to present themselves to us.\n  Soon after that, however, the discussions began when we lowered this \nend strength, focusing on the inadequacies of the number of people we \nhad. During a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee in July \n2001--again, before September 11--General Shinseki stated:\n\n       Given today's mission profile, the Army is too small for \n     the mission load it is carrying.\n\n  At that time, both General Shinseki and Secretary White requested \nthat end strength be increased to 520,000. Again, that was before 9/11 \nand before Iraq.\n  Since 2001, the Association of the United States Army has been \nadvocating for increasing end strength by 30,000 to 40,000 additional \nsoldiers. Again, my amendment would only call for a 10,000 increase in \nthe number of soldiers.\n  However, despite the views of these professionals, end strength has \nnot been increased. Yet none of the Army's missions from 2000 have \nended, and with the advent of September 11, the war on terror, the war \nin Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq, the burden has increased \nexponentially.\n  Today, as this chart shows, the Army has 325,200 soldiers deployed \nand forward stationed in 120 countries. While some of these deployment \nnumbers may vary in the future, there will not be any significant \nchanges. No one, I think, reasonably expects that we will be \nwithdrawing within a year or two a major force from Iraq or forces from \nAfghanistan or forces from even Kosovo, Bosnia, and Hungary. These \ncommitments are there, and they must be met.\n  Retired LTG Jay Garner, the first director of Iraqi reconstruction, \ntold the National Journal that the active duty Army ``has already been \nburned out'' by trying to do too much with too few, and the ``reserves \nare going to be burned out'' by repeated activations.\n  General Garner argues that the Army needs to expand by two light \ninfantry divisions, about 20,000.\n  The U.S. Army's Center of Military History has looked at the numbers \nand experiences of forces needed to remain in country after the \nconventional battle has ended--occupation forces, in other words. The \ncenter notes that you can look at historical examples, but you must \nalso consider contemporary analyses and current capabilities.\n  With this three-pronged analysis, the Army's Center of Military \nHistory posited that if ``we and our allies were to directly and \neffectively steer the course of events,'' 300,000 troops would be \nrequired in Afghanistan for a generation and 100,000 troops would be \nneeded in Iraq for a number of years,'' assuming a modernized society \nand robust infrastructure. Without these numbers of military personnel, \nwe may have influence but not control.\n  I think we are seeing today in Iraq that we have influence and not \ncontrol, certainly not in Baghdad. We have influence in Afghanistan, \nbut not control. It is important to note that providing insufficient \ntroops to both Afghanistan and Iraq not only has consequences now but \nwell into the future.\n  Today, the Army presently has 501,000 soldiers serving on active \nduty. Not only is this above the authorized end strength of 480,000, \nbut it is also above the 3 percent variance rate. Indeed, the Army is \nso stretched at the moment, they are actually breaking the law on end \nstrength. Isn't that enough evidence to suggest we need to raise the \nlevel?\n  I also note that even when the Army is well over the authorized end\n\n[[Page S12527]]\n\nstrength, they are having an extraordinarily difficult time \nimplementing a rotation policy for Iraq and other areas around the \nglobe. This means that tours are being extended. More Guard and Reserve \nforces are being called up and our soldiers are getting tired by the \ndaily stress they are enduring and frustrated by the lack of certainty \nof when they may return home.\n\n  Currently more than 130,000 Guard and Reserve soldiers are deployed. \nApproximately 29,000 National Guard soldiers, infantry, signal \ntransportation, military police are serving in Iraq and Kuwait. Among \nthose are the 115th and 119th military police companies from Rhode \nIsland, and the 118th military police battalion from Rhode Island. They \nare doing a magnificent job, but they are feeling the stress of this \ndeployment.\n  More than 10,000 Reserve soldiers are in Kuwait, Afghanistan, and \nIraq. At this time, there are still requirements for National Guard \nsoldiers in Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Sinai. In fact, the National Guard \nhas taken command relationships in these countries--Bosnia, Kosovo, and \nthe Sinai. This is a development that I think many National Guard \nsoldiers did not anticipate when they joined the Guard several years \nago, certainly if they joined the Guard 10 or 15 years ago.\n  Since September 11, the Guard has mobilized 210,000 of its 350,000 \nsoldiers at one time or another. The Reserve has mobilized 85,000 of \nits 205,000 in that same time period.\n  In addition, the activation of the Reserve component has a different \neffect than the deployment of an active-duty soldier. For active-duty \npersonnel, the military is their primary employer and their families \nare prepared for the sacrifices required when their loved one is absent \nfrom home for a long period of time performing dangerous duty. With \nreservists, it is a different story. While slightly more than 50 \npercent of the active-component Army is married, 74 percent of \nreservists have at least 1 dependent. About one-half of these soldiers \nwork for employers with 1,000 or fewer employees and 15 percent work \nfor companies with less than 50 employees, where their absence is \nsorely felt.\n  While these soldiers are fighting for our country for at least a \nyear, employers are understaffed and spouses are struggling as single \nparents, often under financial duress, since some soldiers take a pay \ncut when they give up their civilian salary for an Army wage.\n  Goldman Sachs recently conducted a survey of Reserve component \nsoldiers and their employers and found these disturbing results: \nVirtually all the reservists felt that the activation was having a less \nthan favorable impact on their civilian careers. Nearly one-third of \nthe reservists were not sure their jobs would be waiting for them when \nthey came off active duty, and half believed there would be a negative \neffect on pay and promotion.\n  Indeed, there is a dire need to expand the number of active-duty \nmilitary personnel to avoid a future crisis in recruitment and \nretention in the military, specifically in the Reserve and National \nGuard units. With numbers like this reported by the Goldman Sachs \nsurvey, with the stress of a year deployment, with the additional \nburdens on spouses and children, I believe when these National Guards \nmen and women and reservists return home the likelihood they would \neagerly extend their careers in the Guard and Reserve is diminished \nsignificantly. Our soldiers need a break. They deserve better. We can \nhelp them and we should.\n  Now some may oppose this amendment by stating that senior officials \nfrom the administration and the Army have repeatedly stated that if \nthey needed more troops they would ask for them, and they do not need \nmore troops. I argue the administration is ignoring the facts I have \njust cited, and the simple and the obvious point that our Army is \noverworked and the work continues.\n  I think they are ignoring these facts for several reasons. First, \nincreasing end strength admits that we need more troops to create a \nreasonable rotation policy, which means we are going to be in Iraq for \na long time. The only other country where we have a one-year rotation \npolicy for troops is Korea, where we have been ensconced now for almost \n50 years. This administration simply must admit that a U.S. military \npresence in Iraq will be necessary for a very long time. Last \nSaturday's edition of the Washington Post quotes GEN Jim Jones, the \nU.S. European commander and NATO supreme allied commander, as saying \nU.S. soldiers may pull out of Bosnia in 2004--may. That is 8 years \nafter they went in and were also going to stay for just 1 year. I argue \nthat Iraq is likely a more difficult undertaking than Bosnia. Also, the \nonly reason the U.S. is able to leave Bosnia is because troops from \nother nations are remaining, a luxury we unfortunately do not have in \nIraq today.\n\n  Once again, the United States Army Center of Military History has \nnoted: Occupations have required not only manpower but also time to \nachieve success. In the Philippines, for example, the officers and NCOs \nof the Philippine constabulary were virtually all continental Americans \nin 1902. Yet, by 1935, 30 years later, everyone was a Filipino. The \nPhilippines was a challenging proposition with respect to both manpower \nand time, and it took a generation to achieve a satisfactory outcome. \nGermany and Japan transitioned from being occupied to being allies in \nabout a decade.\n  So looking at history, challenging countries take at least a \ngeneration to stabilize, less demanding countries perhaps a decade. We \nare in Iraq for at least 10 years, and we have to have a force \nstructure that will support that deployment. The Army must grow so they \ncan rotate troops and avoid sending the units again and again to Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  The second reason the administration is reluctant to increase end \nstrength is that as the New York Times noted in July,\n\n       . . . the concept on increasing troop numbers and its costs \n     contradicts a basic tenet of Secretary Rumsfeld's goal for \n     military transformation, which is to rely on new technology \n     and rewrite doctrine to allow smaller forces to attack with \n     greater speed and deadliness.\n\n  I argue that Secretary Rumsfeld was able to test his theories of \ntransformation during the period of conventional war in Iraq, and they \nwere a success. But he risks losing that victory by refusing to see a \nwar of this sort also requires nation building, and nation building \nrequires many more boots on the ground to ensure security and \nstability.\n  Retired LTG Walter Ulmer--and General Ulmer was one of the key \nleaders in the Army who analyzed and predicted the hollow Army of the \n1970s--stated recently:\n\n       One of the lessons we learned in the past, and we're \n     relearning in dramatic fashion in Iraq and Afghanistan, is \n     that the U.S. military may be able to fight a war with slim \n     forces, but it takes a lot more troops to secure an unruly \n     nation with many diverse interest groups and antagonists.\n\n  Ulmer argues the Army is short 40,000 to 50,000 troops. He said:\n\n       The Army is a very elastic institution with a can-do \n     culture, and that's a wonderful attribute, but it is not \n     infinitely elastic and its can-do ethos makes it possible for \n     the Army to practically respond itself to death.\n\n  Another senior Army official stated:\n\n       Essentially, we fought a just-in-time war. A unit would \n     arrive, get a bullet, the enemy would pop his head up and \n     we'd fire the bullet. That puts a lot of stress on a \n     commander who is simultaneously trying to execute the forward \n     battle, carefully balance his resources, pull a company from \n     here to plug a gap over there, all the while looking back \n     over his shoulder at very exposed logistical lines.\n\n  He asked:\n\n       Why fight a war like that when we could have deployed \n     overwhelming combat forces in a way that would reduce risks \n     and possibly protect lives? We've also seen in Iraq that \n     while lean forces can be successful in combat by focusing on \n     an enemy's finite centers of gravity, in [postwar] stability \n     operations, there are no decisive centers of gravity. You \n     have to spread your forces throughout each city, and that \n     takes more of them.\n\n  If we accept the need to increase the size of the Active Duty Army, \nwe need to then focus on what types of forces would be most beneficial. \nThe U.S. Army is the best in the world when it comes to skills and \nequipment needed to win on the battlefield, but the conventional battle \nin Iraq is over. Now I argue we need an occupation force, those who \nmust remain to accomplish the U.S. objective once the conventional \nbattle is finished. These forces must have different skills because \nthey have different missions: defending against an insurgency, \nenforcing law\n\n[[Page S12528]]\n\nand order, providing humanitarian relief, and reconstruction of \ninfrastructure. They need the skills required for nation building.\n  So my amendment directs that the Army should seek 10,000 soldiers who \nhave the skills that are the highest demand in Iraq: military police, \nspecial forces, civil affairs officers, and light infantry. These \nforces travel lighter, so they are less expensive to transport and \nmaintain. These forces will provide maximum effectiveness at minimal \ncost.\n\n  In January, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or \nCSIS, released a report called ``A Wiser Peace: An Action Strategy For \nPost-Conflict Iraq.'' The first recommendation in the report is to:\n\n       . . . create a transitional security force that is \n     effectively prepared, mandated and able to handle post-\n     conflict security needs.\n\n  The report states that:\n\n       The United States must immediately identify and train a \n     core force of U.S. military troops to perform constabulary \n     duties in Iraq. Working with its coalition partners, the U.S. \n     must also identify and ready other constabulary forces--such \n     as the Italian Carabinieri and French Gendarmerie--to assure \n     their timely arrival in theater.\n\n  We have yet to see the arrival of the French Gendarmerie and the \nItalian Carabinieri. There are Italian forces that are assisting there, \nbut the French have not yet arrived.\n  But the need the CSIS identified before the war ever began is clearly \nthere, and the U.S. Army is struggling to meet it. Presently, the \nActive-Duty Army has 19,432 authorized positions for military policemen \nand there are currently 22,476 MPs serving, well over authorized \ncapacity. There are 22,608 Reserve slots for military police and they \nare presently at 95 percent capacity. Clearly, there is a need for more \nmilitary police. This amendment assures we start meeting this need.\n  In addition, my amendment gives the Army the flexibility to either \nmove Reserve slots to active duty or recruit new soldiers. I should \nmake it clear that the positions move, not necessarily the people. No \nreservist can be forced to become an active-duty soldier.\n  Most of the Army's military police are in Reserve units--12,800 are \nin the Active Force while 22,800 are in the Reserves. Most Civil \nAffairs Units, those soldiers who provide a link between the military \nand civilian population in an area of operations, are also in Reserves.\n  Clearly, there needs to be a redistribution, given the demands on \ntoday's Army. In addition, if the Army has the flexibility to move \nreservists and guardsmen into the Active Force, these soldiers will be \nready for deployment much more quickly than new recruits.\n  The informal CBO cost of 10,000 additional soldiers is $409 million. \nThat number includes military personnel and operational and maintenance \ncosts of 10,000 additional troops for fiscal year 2004. I believe this \nis the most worthwhile expenditure.\n  This amendment offsets this cost with funding from the Iraqi Freedom \nFund. As we all know, the Iraq Freedom Fund was established in the \nfiscal year 2003 supplemental we passed in March. At that time, $15 \nbillion was set aside for Secretary Rumsfeld to use on emergency \nexpenses for military personnel, operation and maintenance, \nprocurement, or humanitarian assistance. Most of that funding has been \nexpended. Therefore, an additional $1.9 billion for the Iraqi Freedom \nFund is included in this supplemental for exigencies. I believe the \nexigency is here and we should pay for these troops now.\n  Many would argue that while the costs are $409 million the first \nyear, these troops will have to continue to be maintained in future \nyears, and the actual cradle-to-grave costs are much higher. I would \ncounter that this cost is minimal compared to what it will take if, in \njust a short time--2 or 3 years--the U.S. Army does not have the \nfighting force it needs to perform its mission because we squandered \nits strength.\n  Let me show another chart, which again contrasts the Army in August \nof 2000, when some were criticizing it as being unprepared, and the \nArmy in August of 2003.\n  There were 144,000 soldiers deployed in 2000; in 2003, about \n370,000--over 370,000; 7 brigades in 2000, 30 brigades in 2003. No \nNational Guard divisions deployed; 3 years later, 2 National Guard \ndivisions deployed. In 2000, fewer than 25,000 National Guard and \nReserve troops on active duty; today, 126,498 troops. This has an \nimpact.\n\n  These are the scenarios that are used as a template to plan our \nmilitary forces, the ``two major theater wars'' scenario: MTW east, \nIraq; MTW west, hypothetically Korea. This is the required order of \nbattle that has been devised after careful study: six divisions here \nand four divisions for MTW west. The units available in August of 2000, \nagain at a time when our Army was being criticized as not being up to \nthe task of defending the Nation--six divisions and one armored cavalry \nregiment ready, four divisions at MTW west and one armored cavalry \ndivision. Today, only four divisions here for the east scenario and \nonly three divisions here.\n  There is an impact in terms of our capability to do what we planned \nfor decades to do. We have to ensure that our Army is ready for any \nmission, and we have to ensure it today.\n  In his farewell speech, when he was retiring as Army Chief of Staff, \nGEN Eric Shinseki said:\n\n       We must ensure the Army has the capabilities to match the \n     strategic environment in which we operate, a force sized \n     correctly to meet the strategy set forth in the documents \n     that guide us. . . . beware the 12-division strategy for a \n     10-division Army.\n\n  We are rapidly approaching a 12-division strategy with a 10-division \nArmy.\n  Our Army is fighting on many fronts for us right now. They are doing \na magnificent job, as well as the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast \nGuard--all of our Defense Department personnel and related personnel. \nWe are extraordinarily proud of them. But they are overtaxed, \nparticularly so in the Army because of the nature of the Army. It is \nnot only the combat arm of decision but also is the combat arm of \nduration. It is the Army that typically is charged with the aftermath \nof the battle as well as the battle.\n  We have to help them. My amendment will provide a modicum of relief. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  As a final point, ultimately we all respond, not just to our \ncolleagues, not just to institutional pressures, but to our \nconstituents. I would find it very difficult, this month or 6 months \nfrom now, to go back and to meet my neighbors, who are in the National \nGuard and the Reserve, and explain to them that we could not increase \nthe size of our Army, that they are being deployed once again, after \nrepeated deployments, because we couldn't find the way or the will to \nincrease the size of our Army. I think we should. I think we must. And \nI hope we do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be added as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in recent months I have risen on several \noccasions to pay tribute to the men and women who are fighting in Iraq \nand Afghanistan in support of the global war on international terror. \nToday I rise once again to pay tribute and to honor an Arkansas native \nrecently who died last week in Afghanistan--LTC Paul Kimbrough, a \nnative of Little Rock, AR. He was 44 years old.\n  Paul Kimbrough graduated from Little Rock's Parkview High School in \n1977. Four years later, he graduated from the University of Central \nArkansas in Conway with a degree in political science. He joined the \nU.S. Army before returning to complete his education at the University \nof Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville, where he headed up the Black \nLaw Students Association. Paul followed his commitment to public \nservice into the political arena, first working on the staff of U.S. \nRepresentative Ray Thornton, and then running in his own campaign for a \nseat in the Arkansas House of Representatives. He lost that race, but \nthat didn't slow him down. Paul's next challenge took him to \nWashington, DC, where he came to work in the U.S. Department of \nTransportation in the inspector-general's office.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Kimbrough remained active in the U.S. Army \nreserve, and in June he was deployed to Afghanistan with the 416th \nEngineer Command, where he helped to oversee improvements to living \nconditions for\n\n[[Page S12530]]\n\nsoldiers at Bagram Air Base. On October 3, he was flown to Incirlik, \nTurkey, for medical treatment. He died of cardiac arrest en route to \nTurkey.\n  His family and friends remember him as a true leader--driven, \ndetermined, and deeply committed to his country and its cause. In a \nmessage to his colleagues at the Department of Transportation sent \nbefore he left for Afghanistan, Paul wrote, ``Always there echoes in my \nmind: duty, honor, and country. Therefore, I will do my duty as God has \ngiven me light to see.''\n  LTC Paul Kimbrough is survived by his father, Major Kimbrough; his \nson, Paul Kimbrough, Jr.; his four brothers; and his sister. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in extending our deepest condolences to Paul's \nfamily and friends.\n  Paul Kimbrough's resolve and his commitment to his country will not \nbe forgotten. The mission continues in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we \nremain confident that Paul Kimbrough's courage and sacrifice will have \nbeen given in a worthy cause.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Christopher Swisher, a fellow Nebraskan and staff sergeant in the \nUnited States Army. Sergeant Swisher was killed last week when his \nsquadron was attacked while on a mission in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 26 \nyears old.\n  Sergeant Swisher was one of thousands of brave American servicemen \nand women fighting in Iraq. Our soldiers confront danger everday--their \ntremendous risks and sacrifices must never be taken for granted.\n  A Lincoln native, Sergeant Swisher was a dedicated soldier who was \ncommitted to his family and country. His life-long interest in the \nmilitary led him to overcome a learning disability and embark on a \nsuccessful career in the Army.\n  On the frontlines of the war in Iraq, Sergeant Swisher demonstrated \nthe courage of a leader and an American hero. Before his deployment, \nSergeant Swisher told his mother, Sharon; ``I'm doing what I want to be \ndoing because I'm protecting my family, my home, and my country.'' In \naddition to his mother, Sergeant Swisher leaves behind a wife, Kristen; \ndaughter, Alexandria; brother, Terry; and sister, Lisa. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with them all at this difficult time.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring SGT Christopher Swisher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12530-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nSpringfield, VA. On September 7, 2003, a Muslim woman was stabbed in \nthe back outside a Fairfax County shopping mall and called a \n``terrorist pig'' by her assailant. The 47-year-old convert to Islam \nwas treated at a local hospital for a 2 to 3-inch deep wound on her \nlower back.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nrecalling and honoring the life and work of a physically tiny woman \nwith an immeasurably large dedication to serving the poorest of the \nworld's poor. Known to the world as Mother Teresa, she fulfilled what \nshe understood to be her vocation in the world--not as a saint, but as \na human being flawed and prone to the same temptations as are we all in \nthis Chamber. I greatly admire her faithfulness to her purpose, and her \nprofound faith in the Maker of us all.\n  Mother Teresa was born in August 1910 in Albania and became a Roman \nCatholic nun while still a young woman. A teacher, she was assigned to \na convent and school in Calcutta, where she discovered a material \npoverty that was scarcely believable. Whatever she had given up in \ndedicating her life to her vocation did not compare to the need she saw \naround her. She left the already demanding work of her convent to found \nthe Missionaries of Charity, a religious order of women whose work in \nthe world remains service to people who are abandoned, suffering, poor, \nand dying, wherever they may be found.\n  Today, when many in the world consider religious commitments as too-\noften contentious and divisive rather than fruitful and unifying, we do \nwell to ponder the 50 years of work by the Missionaries of Charity in \nmore than 700 homes and shelters established in India, Asia, Europe, \nand the Americas. The example they set for sacrificial giving of \noneself can best be described by Mother Teresa's own statement of her \nmission in this life:\n\n       My community is the poor. Their security is my own. My \n     house is the house of the poor--not just the poor, but the \n     poorest of the poor: those who are so dirty and full of germs \n     that no one goes near them; those who do not go to pray \n     because they are naked; those who do not eat because they do \n     not have the strength; those who collapse on the sidewalks \n     knowing they are about to die while the living walk by \n     without even looking back; those who do not cry because they \n     have no more tears left.\n\n  Many of the people served by Mother Teresa considered her to be a \nliving saint. But I find her all the more remarkable because she was \nhuman, fragile, and equipped with the same stubborn human nature we all \nstruggle with when our virtue is tried. We may count ourselves blessed \nif we avoid what Mother Teresa told us is the greatest poverty--that of \nthe heart. Like her, we must keep before us those ``not only hungry for \nbread, but hungry for love; not only naked from lack of clothing, but \nnaked of human dignity; not only homeless for a house, but homeless for \nunderstanding and for human respect.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that we who are privileged to serve in this \nbody, along with all people of goodwill, join the world in remembering \nthe life and example of one whose dedication to her duty became her \nlove.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nmodern history's most caring and unconditionally loving people on the \neve of her beatification. Through her work as a teacher and provider to \nthe poor and suffering, Mother Teresa of Calcutta demonstrated the \nessence of what it means to love.\n  It was March of 2002 that I was humbled and privileged during a \npersonal visit to the Nirmal Hriday, Pure of Heart, Home for the Dying \nDestitutes in Calcutta, started by Mother Teresa in 1952 to give hope \nand care to those with neither. Although Mother Teresa passed away 5 \nyears earlier, the spirit of kindness and concern that nearly \ntranscended human boundaries lived on in that small hospice, and showed \non the faces of its volunteers, and shined in the smiles of nuns \ncarrying on her work.\n  That day I was also honored to visit with Mother Teresa's successor, \nSister Nirmala. Sister Nirmala and I spoke briefly of the importance of \ncontinuing Mother Teresa's work, and in some small way, I hope the \nrecognition we provide will further that cause--that comfort, care, and \nlove she gave unconditionally.\n  Born in 1910, Mother Teresa became a Roman Catholic nun at the age of \n18. She began by teaching geography and history at St. Mary's School in \nCalcutta, but became anxious to aid those outside of the convent. \nTwenty years later, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a \nreligious order based on attending to the impoverished and afflicted \nwhom no one else served. Mother Teresa later turned her focus to the \nestablishment of care programs for AIDS victims.\n  Although she was the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, as \nwell as the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Foundation for Hospice \nand Homecare's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985, Mother Teresa felt \nmost honored by the joy of providing comfort and care to those in need.\n  As her beatification by Pope John Paul II nears, we pause to reflect \nupon the example set forth by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Mother Teresa \ndemonstrated true and unconditional love\n\n[[Page S12531]]\n\nfor her fellow persons, giving herself fully to their care, and shall \nforever be remembered as one of the world's most generous and inspiring \nhuman beings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12531-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements \nof an outstanding young woman. On October 8, 2003, Jennifer Jacques of \nChelsea, VT, received an award from the Vision, Strength and Artistic \nExpression Arts Program's national contest for students with \ndisabilities: Roadtrip: A Journey of Discovery. National recognition \nalone is deserving of applause and praise, but Jennifer's represents a \nvery special and unique achievement that reaches far beyond her \naccomplishments in art.\n  Born with severe cerebral palsy, Jennifer is confined to her \nwheelchair. Able to control only her head and neck, she controls her \nwheelchair and computer, as well as her communication device, through a \nswitch placed under her chin. A bright young woman of 18, Jennifer \nattends public school in Chelsea, where she is enrolled in classes with \nher peers.\n  Jennifer's art is not only a reflection of her talents, but also of \nher great ability to overcome the disabilities that have faced her. \nWorking with her teachers and instructors, Jennifer directed the \nplacement of paint on paper placed on the floor. By repeatedly driving \nher wheelchair over the paint, she was able to create textured \npaintings with striking color and design. Jennifer recently sold all of \nher abstract pieces that were displayed at an art show in Montpelier.\n  These accomplishments are a tribute to this exceptional young woman, \nher family and friends, her educators and instructors. Jennifer Jacques \nembodies what Vermont has done, what it can do, and what the future \nholds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12531-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MRS.

After 36 years of \nexemplary commitment and dedicated service to the Selma City school \nsystem, Mrs. Sewell plans to retire on October 18, 2003.\n  Mrs. Sewell is an educator, media specialist, civic leader, and \nstrong advocate for children. Since 1993, she has tenaciously served \nthe City of Selma, AL, as the first black female elected to its city \ncouncil. Mrs. Sewell is multi-talented and has excelled in every avenue \nof her life, as indicated by the numerous honors and awards bestowed \nupon her by her peers and community. She has never been content with \nthe status quo. Each endeavor throughout her rich life has been met \nwith new and innovative ideas, insurmountable energy, and the ability \nto motivate people.\n  Born and raised in Alabama, Mrs. Sewell married her college \nsweetheart, retired Coach Andrew A. Sewell, and became the mother of \nthree children, Terri, Andrew, and Anthony. Her distinguished \neducational background includes a bachelor of science degree from \nAlabama State University, a masters degree from Purdue University, and \nadvanced course work in other graduate studies at Atlanta University \nand the University of Alabama.\n  Among many of Mrs. Sewell's outstanding achievements and honors, she \npioneered the development of elementary libraries in the Selma City \nSchools, was instrumental in maintaining accreditation status for their \nlibraries, implemented the ``Accelerated Reader's Program,'' \nrevitalized the Selma-Dallas Youth and Government Council, and lobbied \nfor grants to improve literacy through school libraries, just to name a \nfew.\n  Alabama is honored to be home to Mrs. Sewell. It is no secret that \nshe is a woman who, day in and day out, goes above and beyond the call \nof duty. She is to be commended for all of her extraordinary efforts on \nbehalf of Selma, AL, and everyone whose life she has touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12531-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12531-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12531-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12531-S12532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate.\n\n       H.R. 408.

A bill to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act to improve \nprovisions relating to probate of trust and restricted land, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAmerican Indian Probate Reform Act of 2003, which builds on the solid \nfoundation laid in Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, \nP.L. 106-462, and S. 550, the Indian Probate Act of 2003, which I also \nsponsored. The bill I am introducing today would bring a number of \ngreatly needed amendments to the Indian Land Consolidation Act \nAmendments of 2000, including a revised uniform Federal probate code \napplicable to trust and restricted Indian lands, and provisions that \nwill facilitate the consolidation of interests in highly fractionated \nIndian lands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian Probate \n     Reform Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Act of February 8, 1887 (commonly known as the \n     ``Indian General Allotment Act'') (25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.), \n     which authorized the allotment of Indian reservations, did \n     not permit Indian allotment owners to provide for the \n     testamentary disposition of the land that was allotted to \n     them;\n       (2) that Act provided that allotments would descend \n     according to State law of intestate succession based on the \n     location of the allotment;\n       (3) the reliance of the Federal Government on the State law \n     of intestate succession with respect to the descent of \n     allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian \n     tribes, members of Indian tribes, and the Federal Government, \n     including\n       (A) the increasingly fractionated ownership of trust and \n     restricted land as that land is inherited by successive \n     generations of owners as tenants in common;\n       (B) the application of different rules of intestate \n     succession to each interest of a decedent in or to trust or \n     restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries \n     of more than 1 State, which application--\n       (i) makes probate planning unnecessarily difficult; and\n       (ii) impedes efforts to provide probate planning assistance \n     or advice;\n       (C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust \n     and restricted land, which makes it difficult for Indian \n     tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; \n     and\n       (D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for \n     many of the essential elements of general probate law, either \n     directly or by reference, which--\n       (i) is unfair to the owners of trust and restricted land \n     (and heirs and devisees of owners); and\n       (ii) makes probate planning more difficult; and\n       (4) a uniform Federal probate code would likely--\n       (A) reduce the number of fractionated interests in trust or \n     restricted land;\n       (B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning \n     assistance and advice;\n       (C) facilitate intertribal efforts to produce tribal \n     probate codes in accordance with section 206 of the Indian \n     Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and\n       (D) provide essential elements of general probate law that \n     are not applicable on the date of enactment of this Act to \n     interests in trust or restricted land.\n\n     SEC. 3. INDIAN PROBATE REFORM.\n\n       (a) Testamentary Disposition.--Section 207 of the Indian \n     Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) is amended by \n     striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) Testamentary Disposition.--\n       ``(1) General devise of an interest in trust or restricted \n     land.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to any applicable Federal law \n     relating to the devise or descent of trust or restricted \n     land, or a tribal probate code approved by the Secretary in \n     accordance with section 206, the owner of an interest in \n     trust or restricted land may devise such an interest to--\n       ``(i) an Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land;

A bill to authorize additional appropriations for the \nReclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce crucial \nlegislation regarding the safety of America's Dams. Ensuring the safety \nof the Bureau of Reclamation's dams must be a national priority. One of \nthe surest ways to protect the integrity of this existing \ninfrastructure is to ensure that adequate funding is accessible to \nproperly maintain and rehabilitate these great structures.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has existing authority that would allow \nthem to expend approximately $974 million dollars on Safety of Dam \nProjects; but only $109 million dollars of this authorization remains \nuncommitted. By the end of fiscal year 2002, over 61 dam modifications \nhad been completed under existing authority. Over the next several \nyears, at least 46 projects have been identified as critical. \nUnfortunately, these projects alone represent an additional \nauthorization need of close to $540 million. Thus, a huge gap exists \nand it is something we must correct. The bill that I am introducing \ntoday, would raise the current ceiling on the Safety of Dams Program to \nmeet the additional $540 million needed and by so doing to meet the \nneeds already identified by Reclamation in 11 of the 17 Reclamation \nStates.\n  Let me take a few moments to highlight exactly what it is I am \ntalking about. The United States Bureau of Reclamation currently has \nreservoirs impounded by 457 dams and dikes. Of these structures, 362 \ndams and dikes would likely cause loss of life if they were to fail. \nThese 362 structures, located at 252 different project facilities, form \nthe core of Reclamation's Dam Safety Program.\n  Approximately 50 percent of Reclamation's dams were built between \n1900 and 1950. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of the dams were \nbuilt before currently used state-of-the-art design and construction \npractices. A strong dam safety program must be maintained to identify \npotential adverse performance within Reclamation's inventory of aging \ndams and to carry out corrective actions expeditiously when \nunreasonable public risk is identified.\n  I plan to take action on this measure during this Congress and I urge \nmy colleagues to join with me in ensuring the safety and reliability of \nthese dams. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1727\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE \n                   RECLAMATION SAFETY OF DAMS ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (a) Reimbursement of Certain Modification Costs.--Section \n     4(c) of the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. \n     508(c)) is amended by striking ``(c) With respect to''\n\n[[Page S12544]]\n\n     and all that follows through ``2001'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Reimbursement of Certain Modification Costs.--With \n     respect to the additional amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 5''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 5 of the \n     Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 509) is \n     amended in the first sentence--\n       (1) by striking ``and effective October 1, 2001'' and \n     inserting ``effective October 1, 2001'';\n       (2) by inserting ``and, effective October 1, 2003, not to \n     exceed an additional $540,000,000 (October 1, 2003, price \n     levels),'' after ``(October 1, 2001, price levels),''; and\n       (3) by striking ``$750,000'' and inserting ``$1,250,000 \n     (October 1, 2003, price levels), as adjusted to reflect any \n     ordinary fluctuations in construction costs indicated by \n     applicable engineering cost indexes,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1729. A bill to establish an informatics grant program for \nhospitals and skilled nursing facilities in order to encourage health \ncare providers to make major information technology advances; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce \nthe Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003 with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Olympia Snowe.\n  In recent years we've heard much about the consequences of medication \nerrors. What we haven't heard as much about are the root causes for the \nmedication errors, or the solutions that are available to us to reduce \nerrors, save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce costs. Simply put, our \nlegislation is necessary because as a nation we face a serious patient-\nsafety problem. The good news is that we have a solution to the \nproblem: we have the technological ability to dramatically reduce \nmedication errors and thus save lives.\n  The bad news is that the start-up costs and a lack of awareness have \nto this point been preventing us from reaping the benefits of the new \ntechnologies. The solution is right in front of us, but has been just \nout of reach.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would bring the solution \nwithin our reach. It would address the causes of medication errors--\nwhich are systems breakdowns--and the solutions--use of clinical \ncomputerized information systems that can save lives.\n  We are here today to lend a helping hand, not to point a finger. We \nall share the goal of improving patient safety, and our bill will do \nthat in a very simple, straightforward manner. The legislation \nestablishes a voluntary grant program to encourage hospitals and \nskilled nursing facilities to become the pioneers of new, life-saving \ntechnologies. It does that by assisting with the often prohibitive \nstart-up costs associated with purchasing and implementing information \nsystems--systems that are designed to reduce medication errors and \nimprove patient safety.\n  I want to stress the goal of this legislation: to help build a safer \nmedication-delivery system. The great successes of our health care \nsystem are largely due to our highly committed and talented doctors, \nnurses, pharmacists, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care \nproviders. The problem we are addressing today is not theirs, but is a \nproblem with the system they rely on to provide inpatient care.\n  The Institute of Medicine report that kicked off much of this \ndiscussion 4 years ago tells us that we must address the ``systems \nproblems'' and design systems that will prevent errors--just as cars \nare designed so that drivers cannot start them while in reverse helps \nprevent automobile accidents.\n  The systems we want to fund would improve the medication-delivery \nsystem at many stages.\n  We leave it up to the hospitals and nursing homes to determine \nexactly what types of technology would best fit their institutions and \ntheir needs. The grants could be used to purchase or improve computer \nsoftware and hardware, purchase or lease communications capabilities, \nor provide education and training staff on computer patient safety \nprograms.\n  The grants could be used to improve patient safety at every stage of \nthe medication delivery process. For example, a hospital or nursing \nhome could use the funds to implement 1. electronic prescribing systems \nthat can intercept errors at the time medications are ordered, 2. \nelectronic medical records to alert doctors to possible drug \ninteractions and complications related to the patient's medical \nhistory, 3. automated pharmacy dispensing to make sure the nurse \nreceives the correct medication in the correct dosage for the correct \npatient, and 4. bedside verification--using bar codes on patient \nwristbands and the medications to ensure that the right medication is \nadministered to the right patient at the right time.\n  We could only have dreamed about clinical computerized information \nsystems when the Medicare program was implemented. Today, we have them \nat our disposal. The sooner we get them into our hospitals and nursing \nhomes, the sooner we start saving lives.\n  The Medication Errors Reduction Act is supported by the Florida \nHospital Association, National Rural Health Association, National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, Healthcare Leadership Council, \nAFSCME, Federation of American Hospitals, Catholic Health Association \nof the United States, Association of American Medical Colleges, \nPremier, Inc., the American Society of Heath-System Pharmacists, \nMcKesson Corporation, IBM, VHA, Inc., Vanderbilt University Medical \nCenter, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Aetna, Siemens, \nAmerisourceBergen Corporation, American Health Packaging, AutoMed, \nChoice Systems, Inc., Pharmacy Healthcare Solutions, Telepharmacy \nSolutions, Verizon, Becton Dickinson, American Health Care Association, \nAFL-CIO, Cardinal Health, and the eHealth Initiative.\n  I ask their letters of support to be included for the Record. With \ntheir help, this bill will become law and we will be well on our way to \nimproving patient safety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 13, 2003.\n     Hon. Robert Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n\n     Hon. Amo Houghton,\n     House of Representatives,\n\n     Hon. Earl Pomeroy,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Snowe and Representatives Houghton \n     and Pomery: Long engaged in efforts to improve patient \n     safety, the undersigned organizations strongly support the \n     ``Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003.'' This critical \n     legislation would fund efforts to improve our nation's \n     clinical safety systems. Since the release of the 1999 \n     Institute of Medicine report, to Err is Human, we have \n     collectively embraced a more vigorous commitment to the \n     advancement of patient safety in our healthcare system.\n       Concern over improving the quality of our nation's health \n     care extends far beyond the provider community. The business \n     community, consumers, and Labor have an equally vested \n     interest. While the issues surrounding the improvement of \n     patient safety are numerous and complex, we agree that the \n     facilitated deployment of new technologies to certain \n     providers would be of immense benefit. Further, we believe \n     that clinical healthcare informatics systems designed to \n     reduce the incidence of adverse events and complications \n     stemming from medication errors great promise.\n       New and evolving technologies like computer physician \n     order-entry (CPOE), bedside verification, and automated \n     pharmacy dispensing could prove particularly beneficial to \n     many healthcare providers. Still, sizable barriers to \n     acquisition and deployment exist. The inability to finance \n     such systems in perhaps the most insurmountable--but the \n     easiest to address, as well. This legislation would permit \n     providers and their patients to reap the rewards of these \n     critical patient safety improvement technology tools.\n       Again, we thank you for having introduced the ``Medication \n     Errors Reduction Act of 2003,'' and look forward to working \n     with you toward enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n         Premier, Inc.;\n         IBM;\n         VHA, Inc.;\n         Vanderbilt University Medical Center;\n         New York Presbyterian Hospital;\n         Aetna;\n         McKession Corporation;\n         Siemens;\n         AmerisourceBergen Corporation;\n         American Health Packaging;\n         AutoMed;\n         Choice Systems, Inc.;\n         Pharmacy Healthcare Solutions;\n         Telepharmacy Solutions;\n         National Rural Health Association;\n         National Association of Children's Hospitals;\n         Verizon;\n         Becton Dickenson;\n         Federation of American Hospitals;\n         American Health Care Association;\n         AFL-CIO;\n         Cardinal Health;\n\n[[Page S12545]]\n\n         American Society of Health-System Pharmacists;\n         Healthcare Leadership Council;\n         eHealth Initiative;\n         Catholic Health Association of the United States;\n         Association of American Medical Colleges; and\n         AFSCME.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Premier Advocacy,\n\n                                               September 12, 2003.\n     Hon.

Earl Pomeroy,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Snowe and Representatives Houghton \n     and Pomeroy:\n       On behalf of the more than 1,500 leading not-for-profit \n     hospitals and health systems allied in Premier, Inc., and the \n     millions of patients whose healthcare needs they serve, we \n     extend our vigorous support for the Medication Errors \n     Reduction Act of 2003.\n       This innovative legislation would provide grants to \n     hospitals and nursing facilities to offset the prohibitively \n     high costs of developing and implementing new patient safety \n     and information technologies to reduce medical errors and \n     adverse events. As such, the measure would undoubtedly \n     contribute to the sustained improvement of quality health \n     care in America.\n       The legislation's establishment of a ten-year, $1 billion \n     grant program would effectively mitigate the most formidable \n     barrier to hospitals' implementation of new, life-saving \n     technologies--namely, cost. In this way, the efforts of early \n     adopters of new technologies are simultaneously rewarded and \n     facilitated.\n       As you know, Premier is a long-standing champion of patient \n     safety and quality improvement. At present, we are hosting a \n     series of collaborative meetings designed to help members \n     implement and adopt computerized physician order entry \n     (CPOE). Participation by hospital executives, including CIOs, \n     CMOs and CEOs, as well as their CPOE project leaders, \n     facilitate and energize the exchange of knowledge and \n     experience, which are invaluable to the advancement of CPOE \n     adoption. In addition, Premier has long championed industry \n     adoption of the bar code for drug, biological, and \n     appropriate medical device labeling to reduce the incidence \n     of adverse events, and improve patient safety overall.\n       Premier and its member hospitals believe that the \n     Medication Errors Reduction Act represents a significant step \n     on the path to improved patient care. We applaud your \n     efforts, and look forward to working with you toward passage \n     of this critical legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Herb Kuhn,\n     Corporate Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         McKesson Corporation,\n\n                            San Francisco, CA, September 12, 2003.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Snowe: On behalf of McKesson \n     Corporation, I would like to thank you for authorizing the \n     Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003. We strongly support \n     this legislation and applaud your leadership in identifying \n     ways to help reduce medication errors and improve the quality \n     of health care in our nation.\n       As the world's largest healthcare services company, \n     McKesson provides automation, information systems, and \n     pharmacy services that enable medication management accuracy. \n     We have pioneered advances in medication management \n     technology by providing hospitals, retail pharmacies and \n     other clinical settings with unique robotic pharmaceutical \n     dispensing and bedside bar-coding technologies to ensure that \n     the right drug, in the appropriate dosage, is administered to \n     the right patient via the right route at the right time. In \n     addition, McKesson provides computerized physician order \n     systems, pharmacy information systems, and clinical \n     consulting services designed to improve the quality and \n     delivery of health care.\n       As early as 1993, the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and \n     Clinics (UWHC) embraced McKesson's automation and bar code \n     solutions for pharmaceutical distribution. Building on this \n     system, they have implemented point-of-care bar code scanning \n     at the bedside. In partnership with McKesson on clinical \n     programs and adverse drug event tracking, UWHC has \n     demonstrated a significant reduction in medication errors, \n     enhanced efficiency, increased clinician satisfaction, and \n     improved medication documentation. As an example of these \n     successes,they have achieved an 89 percent reduction in \n     medication administration errors due to point-of-care bar \n     code scanning, as well as a reduction in dispensing errors \n     from 1.43 percent to 0.13 percent. UWHC also realized a \n     return on investment in two years.\n       We commend you for recognizing the need for economic \n     incentives to accelerate the adoption of innovative \n     technology so critically needed in today's health care \n     environment. By providing grants to hospitals and skilled \n     nursing facilities, your legislation will facilitate the \n     widespread use of technology designed to prevent medication \n     errors and enhance patient safety. We stand ready to work \n     with you and your staff to support passage of this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Ann Richardson Berkey,\n      Vice President, Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Society of\n\n\n                                    Health-System Pharmacists,\n\n                                 Bethesda, MD, September 17, 2003.\n     Hon.

Earl Pomeroy,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Snowe and Representatives Houghton \n     and Pomeroy: The American Society of Health-System \n     Pharmacists (ASHP), the 30,000-member national professional \n     association that represents pharmacists who practice in \n     hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care \n     facilities, home care, and other components of health care \n     systems, would like to commend you on introduction of the \n     ``Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003.''\n       The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, To Err is Human: \n     Building a Safer Health System, pointed out as many as 98,000 \n     patients die annually as the result of medical errors, 7,000 \n     of which are the direct result of medication-related \n     complications. Handwritten clinical data, incomplete, \n     outdated, or improperly implemented information technology \n     within our nation's health system contributes to the high \n     number of adverse events or health care complications due to \n     medication use.\n       Research demonstrates that information technology \n     enhancements, when appropriately implemented, enhance the \n     appropriate, accurate, and timely distribution of \n     medications, and improve the quality of patient care.\n       The voluntary grant program for which your legislation \n     provides would allow early adopters of new technology to meet \n     the high price tag associated with this technology as well as \n     the necessary and important expense of properly educating and \n     training staff on the correct use of the information system.\n       ASHP hopes to foster a fail-safe medication process. Your \n     legislation helps move toward that goal and we look forward \n     to a continued partnership to make this a reality. For more \n     information, please contact Kathleen M.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the more than 230 members \n     of the Florida Hospital Association, I want to commend you \n     for introducing legislation to provide financial assistance \n     to help hospitals take patient safety to the next level. Your \n     bill, the ``Medication Errors Reduction Act of 2003,'' \n     represents a significant step toward assisting hospitals in \n     Florida and throughout the country in their continuous \n     efforts to improve their clinical safety systems.\n       Your initiative recognizes that our commitment to patient \n     safety requires more financial resources than are currently \n     available to hospitals, which continue to experience \n     extraordinary financial pressures. You are a realist--\n     matching resources in support of a great need.\n       The FHA will encourage other members of the Florida \n     Congressional Delegation to support your bill--a measure that \n     targets our desire to improve patient safety. It will be \n     important for the bill to retain its clear focus, and not \n     become weighted down with extraneous legislative baggage that \n     could change its focus.\n       Thank you for moving so swiftly to help us protect patients \n     while protecting the integrity of the Hospital Trust Fund.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Wayne NeSmith,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nBob Graham of Florida, in reintroducing the Medication Errors Reduction \nAct, which will serve to improve the quality of health care delivered \nin hospitals and skilled nursing facilities by reducing medical errors. \nThe lack of quality assurances in America's health care system has been \ndocumented many times. We believe this bill is the first step in the \nprocess to correct this troubling circumstance and to ensure that the \nAmerican health system is the world's safest.\n  We first began development of this legislation in 2001, following the \nrelease of the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) report ``To Err Is Human: \nBuilding a Safer Health System.'' We were prompted by the startling \nrevelations contained in the report that showed up\n\n[[Page S12546]]\n\nto 98,000 people per year lose their lives because of a medical error \nand the annual financial impact that results from these mistakes is \nbelieved to be as high as $29 billion.\n  As you might imagine, a medical error can be many things, but the \nInstitute defines it as ``the failure of a planned action to be \ncompleted as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim.'' \nThe Institute sites among the problems that commonly occur during the \ncourse of providing health care--adverse drug events and improper \ntransfusions, surgical injuries and wrong-site surgery, suicides, \nrestraint-related injuries or death, falls, burns, pressure ulcers and \nmistaken patient identities. All of these can have tragic endings, but \nall are preventable.\n  In developing the solution, we looked to incentives that would prompt \nhospitals and skilled nursing facilities to utilize technology to \nidentify inaccuracies and prevent medical errors before they happen. \nSenator Graham and I developed a proposal that provides Federal \nmatching funds to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities that \nintegrate into their medical systems technology that can prevent \nmedical errors. Technology exists, as never before, that can help \nidentify errors before they happen, and save lives. But this technology \nis rendered useless if it is not being utilized. That is why the \nFederal Government must step forward and provide the necessary \nincentives to prompt innovation.\n  In taking this step, we believe it is imperative that the Federal \nGovernment invest time and funding in not just identifying the \nsolution, but to provide the means to implement the solution. It is the \nrole of the Federal Government to lead, and I believe that providing \ngrant funding to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities to integrate \ntechnology into their health care delivery systems will in fact provide \nthe necessary leadership to see this idea become a reality.\n  More specifically, the grants provided by this legislation can be \nused to purchase or improve computer software and hardware, and provide \neducation and training to staff on computer patient safety programs. \nThey also may be used to improve patient safety at every stage of the \nmedication delivery process through: electronic prescribing systems \nthat can intercept errors at the time medications are ordered; \nelectronic medical records to alert doctors to possible drug \ninteractions and complications related to the patient's medical \nhistory; automated pharmacy dispensing to make sure the nurse receives \nthe correct medication in the correct dosage for the correct patient; \nand bedside verification--using bar codes on patient wristbands and the \nmedications to ensure that the right medication is administered to the \nright patient at the right time.\n  Further, we direct the funding to hospitals that serve predominately \npatients who receive insurance coverage through Medicare, Medicaid and \nS-CHIP. And to ensure that all hospitals, especially those in rural \ncommunities that have smaller operating margins, can afford to utilize \nthis innovative new program, we set aside 20 percent of the funding for \nrural hospitals. I believe this is an important and necessary step to \nprotect our rural communities and provide families with the highest \nquality care.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe soon will be able to reduce the number of Americans who are harmed \nby medical errors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Biden, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 1730. A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node \ndissection for the treatment of breast cancer and coverage for \nsecondary consultations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Women's \nHealth and Cancer Rights Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friends, \nSenator Murray of Washington and Senator Biden of Delaware, and Senator \nFeinstein of California, as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill has a two-fold purpose. First, it will ensure that \nappropriate medical care determines how long a woman stays in the \nhospital after undergoing a mastectomy--not a predetermined amount of \ntime legislated by Congress. This provision says that inpatient \ncoverage with respect to the treatment of mastectomy, lumpectomy, or \nlymph node dissection--regardless of whether the patient's plan is \nregulated by ERISA or State regulations--will be provided for a period \nof time as is determined by the attending physician, in consultation \nwith the patient, to be medically necessary and appropriate. Second, \nthis bill allows any person facing a cancer diagnosis of any type to \nget a second opinion on their course of treatment.\n  A diagnosis of breast cancer is something that every woman dreads. \nBut for an estimated 192,020 American women, this is the year their \nworst fears will be realized. One thousand new cases of breast cancer \nwill be diagnosed among the women in Maine, and 200 women in my home \nState will die from this tragic disease. The fact is, one in nine women \nwill develop breast cancer during their lifetime, and for women between \nthe ages of 35 and 54, there is no other disease which will claim more \nlives.\n  It's not hard to understand why the words ``you have breast cancer'' \nare some of the most frightening words in the English language. For the \nwoman who hears them, everything changes from that moment forward. No \nwonder, then, that it is a diagnosis not only accompanied by fear, but \nalso by uncertainty. What will become of me? What will they have to do \nto me? What will I have to endure? What's the next step?\n\n  For many women, the answer to that last question is a mastectomy or \nlumpectomy. Despite the medical and scientific advances that have been \nmade, despite the advances in early detection technology that more and \nmore often negate the need for radical surgery, it still remains a fact \nof life at the beginning of the 21st century these procedures can be \nthe most prudent option in attacking and eradicating cancer found in a \nwoman's breast.\n  These are the kind of decisions that come with a breast cancer \ndiagnosis. These are the kind of questions women must answer, and they \nmust do so under some of the most stressful and frightening \ncircumstances imaginable. The last question a woman should have to \nworry about at a time like this is whether or not their health \ninsurance plan will pay for appropriate care after a mastectomy or \nlumpectomy, or that she won't be able to remain in a doctor's immediate \ncare for as long as she needs to be. A woman diagnosed with breast \ncancer in many ways already feels as though she has lost control of her \nlife. She should not feel as though she has also lost control of her \ncourse of treatment.\n  The evidence for the need for this bill--especially when it comes to \nso-called ``drive through mastectomies'', is more than just \nallegorical. Indeed, the facts speak for themselves--between 1986 and \n1995, the average length of stay for a mastectomy dropped from about \nsix days to about two to three days. Thousands of women across the \ncountry are undergoing radical mastectomies on an outpatient basis and \nare being forced out of the hospital before either they or their doctor \nthink it's reasonable or prudent.\n  This decision must be returned to physicians and their patients, and \nall Americans who face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis must be \nable to make informed decisions about appropriate and necessary medical \ncare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and work \ntowards passing it this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/14/senate-section/article/S12546-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12546-S12547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1828.
