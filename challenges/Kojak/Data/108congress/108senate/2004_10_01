Mr. President, good morning to everyone.\n  Today, we once again will return to the intelligence reform \nlegislation sponsored by Senators Collins and Lieberman. This week, we \nhave made steady progress. As we set out, we will be completing this \nbill in the near future, but we have a number of amendments. I thank \nboth of the managers for their patience and willingness to work through \na maze of amendments.\n  We had all amendments submitted 2 days ago and all the language for \nthe amendments as of yesterday. The managers and staff and Senators \nhave been working hard over the course of the night to look at the \namendments, to address them, and to establish an order to which they \ncan be addressed over today and Monday.\n  As announced last night, there will be no rollcall votes today. We \nwill have a full day of debate with a number of people speaking on \ntheir individual amendments. We will continue to move forward. A number \nof Senators have committed to being present today to offer their \namendments. I thank them in advance for their participation. I \nencourage them to talk to the managers as to roughly when we will be \ndiscussing each of those amendments.\n  Monday, the plans are to stack the votes. We will have a series of \nvotes, probably beginning around 3 o'clock Monday. There will be a \nseries of rollcall votes beginning midafternoon. The specific time we \nwill announce a little bit later today.\n  The Democratic leader and I have come to the Senate floor regularly \nover the course of the last week to comment on the progress being made \non the bill. We will continue to monitor the progress. The bill itself \nis being discussed after full hearings in August and months and months \nof work, so the objective of completing this bill in the near future, \nboth the internal organization, reorganization, and external by the \ntime we depart, is the goal we hope to accomplish. We need to continue \nwith the deliberative process, but we do need to bring the bill to a \nconclusion; therefore, there is a sense of urgency to have Members come \nto the Chamber and discuss their amendments.\n  We had, as of 4 o'clock yesterday, 233 filed amendments. The Senate \nhas considered 34 amendments thus far, and 15 have been adopted, 5 \ntabled, and 14 are still pending.\n  Having said that, cloture may be a necessary tool. Again, the \nDemocrat leader and I have been in consultation. We first mentioned \ncloture a couple days ago. It is a tool we might use. I point out that \namendments that have been filed that are ready to be considered right \nnow and even after cloture will remain, and we have 30 hours and could \nconsider, of course, at that point all germane amendments.\n  I will be in consultation with the Democratic leader over the course \nof the day. We will have a full day today. I appreciate everyone's \nconsideration.\n  We are also--not on the Senate floor but in a task force--considering \nthe Senate's oversight of intelligence and homeland security. A number \nof people are asking: What is the appropriate vehicle? We are \nconcentrating through\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\nthe Collins-Lieberman bill on the external relationships, but what \nabout the internal relationships? The appropriate vehicle and the \nvehicle that has been set up by the Democratic leader and myself is \nthrough Senate resolution where specific changes to the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence would be entertained and where we would deal \nwith the changes in the Senate results, especially as it applies to \ncommittee jurisdictions.\n\n  It is my hope we can come to final agreement on this package by next \nFriday. The Democratic leader and I await the specific recommendations \nfrom the task force we appointed about a month ago.\n  We have had a long week, a very productive week. We have accomplished \na great deal. The task before the Senate is in reforming the \nintelligence community's responsibility and oversight. It is a huge but \nan essential task. We learned on 9/11 how our enemies are working day \nand night to visit terror on our soil. That is what we have learned \nsince September 11. They dream of ever more catastrophic attacks. They \nplot and they plan in the false belief that they will elude capture. \nThey are absolutely wrong.\n  The work we do this week and next week in the Senate will strengthen \nour defenses and it will improve our ability to gather data, to analyze \ndata, and to defeat our enemies. It will help us find them and to stop \nthem and bring them to justice. When we are done, America will be safer \nand more secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10196-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on a topic that we \nwill not be addressing in the Senate, and therefore, before we dive \ninto the bill, I will mention the issue of the Sudan.\n  Just to update my colleagues because on occasion it has been on the \nfront page, but we have not heard as much about it over the last \nseveral weeks, yet what is occurring, what we have called genocide in \nthis body and in the House of Representatives, indeed, continues to \noccur.\n  Two and a half weeks ago, the U.N. Security Council passed a second \nresolution on the Sudan. This resolution holds out the threat of \nsanctions on Sudan's leaders and its oil industry if the Government \nfails to act, fails to curb the ethnic violence in Darfur.\n  The Darfur region is in western Sudan. The Darfur region is about the \nsize of France. Around 50,000 people have died in that region in the \nlast several months, with hundreds of thousands more at risk.\n\n  I am very pleased by the action of the United Nations, even though, \ndespite the best efforts of the United States, I believe the resolution \nshould have been a lot tougher and it would have had a much greater \nimpact. It is no surprise some countries do not share our outrage and \ndetermination to end those atrocities.\n  Even after making modifications, the vote on the Security Council was \n11 to 0, with Algeria, China, Pakistan, and Russia abstaining.\n  The measure calls upon Secretary General Kofi Annan to create an \ninternational commission to determine if the campaign by marauding Arab \nmilitias--that Jinjaweed--against the villagers of Darfur in western \nSudan has reached the level of genocide.\n  The resolution also reinforces the role of the 53-member African \nUnion in taking the lead in calming the situation in Darfur and calls \non other nations and the Government of Sudan to help it expand its \npresence there with thousands of additional troops.\n  As the international community knows, the Congress made this \ndetermination in late July. It was no secret then, nor is it now, that \nthe Jinjaweed are supported and directed by Khartoum; that is, by the \nGovernment of Sudan, which has a sovereign responsibility to not do \nthat but protect its people, not to kill them.\n  The Jinjaweed have killed or participated in the deaths of up to \nabout 50,000 people in Darfur. They have engaged in mass rape of women \nand girls and destroyed crops and polluted water supplies. They have \nforced over 1.2 million people to leave their homes, leave their \nvillages, once pillaged.\n  Last month, as I mentioned on the floor of the Senate, I had the \nopportunity to travel through a refugee camp called Tulum, which is \nright on the border, about 30 kilometers from the border in Chad, where \nmany people have fled over the border. I had an opportunity to talk to \nwomen in little makeshift tents, women who had lost their husbands, \nkilled by the Jinjaweed, who were separated from their children, lost \nas they had to flee their burning villages.\n  It is wrong. We have spoken on this floor. We need to continue to \nspeak and to act and to encourage the United Nations to act.\n  The United States, under President Bush's leadership, has led the way \nglobally on this issue from the beginning. It does, once again, show \nthe importance of the United States acting even if the world community \nis slow to react, as we saw in the abstention of the resolution the \nother day by Algeria, China, Pakistan, and Russia.\n  The United States has supplied well over 70 percent of the \nhumanitarian effort and other supplies going to survivors now in Darfur \nand in that eastern part of Chad, and we have been providing assistance \nthere for years. So we need to be very proud as a nation. In parts of \nthe Darfur region, we are providing 90 to 95 percent of all the world \naid going in to assist the people in those regions.\n  We need to do a lot more. We need to work with and encourage the \ninternational community to do its share, especially the countries of \nthe European Union and Arab League.\n  This month, Secretary of State Colin Powell came before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and declared that the State Department's \nstudied judgment is that genocide has indeed occurred. Last night, in \nthe debates, we heard both Senator Kerry, from this floor, and the \nPresident of the United States call what is occurring in Darfur \ngenocide. It is now time for the international community to act.\n\n  Multiple sources are reporting from the region that attacks by both \nthe Jinjaweed and Government forces--again, it is the Government forces \nwho are, through direct and indirect aid, supporting this militia \ncalled the Jinjaweed--are still occurring despite the U.N.'s passage of \nResolution 1556 last month that, among other things, called for a halt \nto such actions.\n  I am pleased by the passage of this latest U.N. resolution, but I am \nnot optimistic. I am pleased but not optimistic. Khartoum did not live \nup to the requirements set forth in the U.N.'s July 30 resolution, so \nwhy do we believe they will now?\n  Khartoum will not end its genocide until it has either completed it \nor until it faces stiff international actions that compel it to stop. \nWe need the international community to stand up. The United States is \nstanding up. We need the international community to stand up.\n  This body has unanimously passed, since that time, a second \nresolution urging the Secretary of State to take appropriate actions \nwithin the U.N. to ``suspend'' Sudan's membership on the U.N. Human \nRights Commission. Such an action would be consistent with our \nobligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention and help preserve the \nintegrity of this commission; that is, the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission. Failure to take this action, I believe, mocks the \nprinciples and purpose for which the commission was formed; that is, \nhuman rights. Yet in Sudan we have what we have called, and with the \nravaging of villages we have seen, genocide.\n  Further, our resolution passed on this floor calls upon the Secretary \nof State to pursue Sudan's permanent removal from the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission if the U.N. determines, as it should, that genocide has been \ncommitted in the Darfur and that Khartoum is responsible.\n  The U.N. cannot continue to pass resolution after resolution nor can \nthe international community stand idly by while thousands die monthly \nin these remote regions of Sudan and eastern Chad. Our failure to act \nis not just another failure of the U.N., it is a failure of our own \nhumanity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10196-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HOMELAND SECURITY GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) geographic technologies and geographic data improve \n     government capabilities to detect, plan, prepare, and respond \n     to disasters in order to save lives and protect property;\n       (2) geographic data improves the ability of information \n     technology applications and systems to enhance public \n     security in a cost-effective manner; and\n       (3) geographic information preparedness in the United \n     States, and specifically in the Department of Homeland \n     Security, is insufficient because of--\n       (A) inadequate geographic data compatibility;\n       (B) insufficient geographic data sharing; and\n       (C) technology interoperability barriers.\n       (b) Homeland Security Geographic Information.--Section 703 \n     of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 343) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The Chief \n     Information''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Geographic Information Functions.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `geographic \n     information' means the information systems that involve \n     locational data, such as maps or other geospatial information \n     resources.\n       ``(2) Office of geospatial management.--\n       ``(A) Establishment.--The Office of Geospatial Management \n     is established within the Office of the Chief Information \n     Officer.\n       ``(B) Geospatial information officer.--\n       ``(i) Appointment.--The Office of Geospatial Management \n     shall be administered by the Geospatial Information Officer, \n     who shall be appointed by the Secretary and serve under the \n     direction of the Chief Information Officer.\n       ``(ii) Functions.--The Geospatial Information Officer shall \n     assist the Chief Information Officer in carrying out all \n     functions under this section and in coordinating the \n     geographic information needs of the Department.\n       ``(C) Coordination of geographic information.--The Chief \n     Information Officer shall establish and carry out a program \n     to provide for the efficient use of geographic information, \n     which shall include--\n       ``(i) providing such geographic information as may be \n     necessary to implement the critical infrastructure protection \n     programs;\n       ``(ii) providing leadership and coordination in meeting the \n     geographic information requirements of those responsible for \n     planning, prevention, mitigation, assessment and response to \n     emergencies, critical infrastructure protection, and other \n     functions of the Department; and\n       ``(iii) coordinating with users of geographic information \n     within the Department to assure interoperability and prevent \n     unnecessary duplication.\n       ``(D) Responsibilities.--In carrying out this subsection, \n     the responsibilities of the Chief Information Officer shall \n     include--\n       ``(i) coordinating the geographic information needs and \n     activities of the Department;\n       ``(ii) implementing standards, as adopted by the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget under the processes \n     established under section 216 of the E-Government Act of 2002 \n     (44 U.S.C. 3501 note), to facilitate the interoperability of \n     geographic information pertaining to homeland security among \n     all users of such information within--\n\n       ``(I) the Department;\n       ``(II) State and local government; and\n       ``(III) the private sector;\n\n       ``(iii) coordinating with the Federal Geographic Data \n     Committee and carrying out the responsibilities of the \n     Department pursuant to Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-16 and Executive Order 12906; and\n       ``(iv) making recommendations to the Secretary and the \n     Executive Director of the Office for State and Local \n     Government Coordination and Preparedness on awarding grants \n     to--\n\n       ``(I) fund the creation of geographic data; and\n       ``(II) execute information sharing agreements regarding \n     geographic data with State, local, and tribal governments.\n\n       ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary \n     to carry out this subsection for each fiscal year.''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, to briefly explain the amendment, it \nprovides additional responsibilities for the Chief Information Officer, \nDepartment of Homeland Security, relating to geographic information. \nThis amendment has been discussed by both managers, the Senator from \nMaine and the Senator from Connecticut. My understanding is the \namendment has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Colorado for \nthe work that he has done in coordinating the geospatial information \nneeds of the Department of Homeland Security. He first introduced a \nbill on this issue last year. He has been a leader in pushing for \nimprovements in how this information is handled. This legislation was \nrecently reported as a separate bill by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. It is acceptable and cleared on both sides. I urge adoption \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate? Without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3765) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Collins-\nLieberman bill. Later I will have another amendment that I will offer.\n  First, I thank the managers of the bill, Senator Collins and Senator\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\nLieberman, for their efforts in getting at least one of my amendments \naccepted. The other is pending. One involves the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and its ability to detect, plan, and prepare for disaster by \nbetter utilizing geospatial data throughout the U.S. Government. I \nthank both of them for that support.\n  The other amendment assures that the national intelligence director \nwill take action to ensure that commercial satellite imagery is used to \nfulfill the imagery information requirements of the intelligence \ncommunity. Both are important to the ongoing safety and security of the \ncountry. I am pleased to see the adoption of one, and further \nconsideration of the other.\n  In a moment I would like to offer a third amendment to strengthen the \nbill regarding management of the intelligence community workforce. \nBefore I offer my amendment, I would like to talk generally about the \noverall intelligence reform legislation.\n  September 11, 2001, was a day that none of us will forget in our \nlifetimes. Mr. President, 9/11 was a harsh wake-up call for our \ncountry. That catastrophic day forced us to recognize new threats and \nto energize our Government to rise up and eliminate terror threats and \nmodernize our national security institutions. Our Government has moved \nquickly and comprehensively to implement a significant body of \ngovernmental reforms.\n  It is a fact that through hard work and strong leadership, President \nBush's administration has already implemented planning of significant \nimprovements to our Government's intelligence planning and operations. \nOf the 39 recommendations from the 9/11 Commission that the President \ncould legally implement through Executive order, only three remain to \nbe addressed. It is a good idea, as we consider reforms to our \nintelligence community, to review again what the 9/11 Commission \nconcluded.\n  The 9/11 Commission primarily found that, first, we were slow to \nrespond to a clear and emerging threat. For far too long we stood still \nwhile extremist radical Muslims hijacked religion to stir up hatred, \nhijacked a country to operate their base camps from, and hijacked our \nairliners to murder more than 3,000 of our fellow Americans.\n  Second, we had inadequate human intelligence assets around the world \nto observe such threats and effectively warn us of impending dangers.\n  Third, for the intelligence we did get, we lacked an effective \nbureaucracy to integrate disparate but related pieces of information, \nand we lacked a strong quarterback to coordinate intelligence programs \nagainst emerging threats, to plan long-term strategies, or to steer a \nchange of course when the situation dictated.\n  Fourth, our military was not adequately prepared to deal with the \nthreat that day. And last and maybe most importantly, we need new tools \nand strategies for our diplomatic corps to reach out and lead troubled \nregions of the world against terrorism's misguided principles and \ncowardly acts. We need transformational military improvements to engage \nwhere and when our diplomacy does not succeed.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission also fashioned more than three dozen \nrecommendations to address these national security shortfalls. I \napplaud the effort of the chairman and ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in developing the proposals before us \ntoday. I agree with the majority of the initiatives in the intelligence \nreform legislation. The Collins-Lieberman bill will improve our ability \nto develop actionable intelligence and increase our Government's \ncoordination and responsiveness. Elevating the roles and \nresponsibilities of today's Director of Central Intelligence to the \nlevel of a national intelligence director, including the robust \nplanning and budgeting authority, is prudent and much needed.\n  Establishment of strategic intelligence planning and fusion centers \nsuch as the national counterterrorism center will also greatly \nstrengthen our national security team's ability to connect the dots. We \nneed to identify trends, anticipate threats, and develop coordinated \nplans to attack threats prior to their realization.\n  However, I am not convinced we are effectively matching solutions to \nidentify problems in all cases. My concerns are heightened because \ntoday we are a nation at war. Our men and women of the Armed Forces and \nthe intelligence community are in harm's way. I am just not certain \nthat we have thought through adequately the management changes or the \nunintended consequences relative to Defense Department operations. I \nwill follow closely the remainder of the debate to understand better \nthe potential adverse effects prior to voting to support them.\n  I am pleased to see the attention focused by the 9/11 Commission \nReport and the Collins-Lieberman bill on the topic of personnel \nmanagement policies and practices across the intelligence community. \nBoth panels recognize that in order to effect such a magnitude of \nchange in our Federal Government, uniform personnel standards and \ntraining are needed to align individual mindsets with the desired \nobjectives.\n  Our national security requirements demand that we recruit and retain \nthe best and the brightest defense and intelligence personnel our \ncountry has to offer.\n  We need to ensure the National Intelligence Director is armed with \nboth authority and flexibility to enforce only the highest performance \nand ethical standards across the intelligence community. This requires \nmodern personnel management policies and regulations that incorporate \ncompetitive compensation, incentives, and supervisory flexibility.\n  To keep pace with the dynamic work environment of the intelligence \ncommunity, these same supervisors require streamlined dismissal or \ntermination mechanisms for personnel failing to satisfy standards.\n  The bill before us today directs specific authorities and changes to \nperformance compensation and incentives across the national \nintelligence program. Section 163 explicitly grants the National \nIntelligence Director authorities governing new National Intelligence \nAuthority employees that mirror the authority held by the Director of \nCentral Intelligence Agency relative to CIA employees.\n  In section 301, the bill goes on to amplify the CIA Director's \nauthority to terminate employees ``. . . whenever the Director \nconsiders the termination of employment of such officer or employee \nnecessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.''\n  This is clear, unequivocal, and prudent authority that will bolster \nour intelligence leaders' personnel management capabilities. But I \nbelieve we need to go further.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3778\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that we lay \naside the pending amendment and that the clerk report amendment No. \n3778, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending amendment \nis set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3778.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve the management of the personnel of the National \n                        Intelligence Authority)\n\n       On page 113, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       (b) Termination of Employees.--(1) Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the National Intelligence Director \n     may, in the discretion of the Director, terminate the \n     employment of any officer or employee of the National \n     Intelligence Authority whenever the Director considers the \n     termination of employment of such officer or employee \n     necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\n       (2) Any termination of employment of an officer or employee \n     under paragraph (1) shall not affect the right of the officer \n     or employee to seek or accept employment in any other \n     department, agency, or element of the United States \n     Government if declared eligible for such employment by the \n     Office of Personnel Management.\n       On page 113, line 18, strike ``(b) Rights and Protections'' \n     and insert ``(c) Other Rights and Protections''.\n       On page 113, after line 24, add the following:\n       (d) Exclusion from Certain Personnel Management \n     Requirements.--\n       (1) Performance appraisals.--Section 4301(1)(ii) of title \n     5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``the National \n     Intelligence Authority,'' before ``the Central Intelligence \n     Agency,''.\n       (2) Labor-management relations.--Section 7103(a)(3) of that \n     title is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (G), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (H), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting a semicolon; and\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(I) the National Intelligence Authority;\n       ``(J) the Defense Intelligence Agency;\n       ``(K) the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; or\n       ``(L) any other Executive agency or unit thereof which is \n     designated by the President and the principal function of \n     which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or \n     counterintelligence activities.''.\n       (e) Regulations.--(1) In carrying out the responsibilities \n     and authorities specified in sections 112 and 113 and this \n     section (including the amendments made by this section), the \n     National Intelligence Director shall prescribe regulations \n     regarding the management of personnel of the National \n     Intelligence Authority.\n       (2) The regulations shall include provisions relating to \n     the following:\n       (A) The applicability to the personnel of the Authority of \n     the authorities referred to in subsection (a).\n       (B) The exercise of the authority under subsection (b) to \n     terminate officers and employees of the Authority.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my amendment will accomplish the \nfollowing: first, expressly grant this termination authority to the \nNational Intelligence Director in the statute; and second, direct the \nNational Intelligence Director to prescribe regulations specifying the \nexercise of this termination authority.\n  Notwithstanding this broad authority already in place today, the \nDirector of Central Intelligence maintains regulations that are \ninefficient, not appropriate for today's security environment, and are \nout of sync with his broad authority. For example, an intelligence \nsupervisor who deems an officer or employee as unsuitable is often \nrequired to maintain that employee in sensitive positions while adverse \npersonnel action is initiated.\n  After a final termination decision is rendered by the agency, the \nemployee can engage in a lengthy appeals process, both internal and \nexternal to the agency, that could last at least a year. In my opinion, \nthis practice is not in the best interest of the United States, and \nindeed presents a clear security risk.\n  With regulations requiring streamlined employee termination \npractices, I believe we can improve national security and fiscal \nresponsibility across the National Intelligence Authority. My amendment \nwould enhance this responsibility, and I urge my colleagues to support \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Chair and Ranking Members, indeed all Members of \nthe Government Affairs Committee, have served our country well. The \nCollins-Lieberman bill for intelligence reform brings forth bold and \nsweeping changes to our critical national security institutions. \nAccordingly, it is essential that we get this right. More is at stake \nthan simply moving boxes around on an organization chart. The decisions \nwe make over the next several days will be far-reaching and have \nsignificant consequences. Our Armed Forces are not only the largest \nprovider of intelligence information, they are also the largest \nconsumer. Our Nation's military, the most powerful and proficient ever \nassembled in the history of the world, hinges on a seamless and \nunbroken flow of intelligence information--regardless of whether that \nintelligence information is ``national'' or ``tactical.''\n  As we consider the Collins-Lieberman intelligence reform bill, let us \nredouble our efforts to ensure we're matching solutions to identified \nproblems. As long as we keep this perspective, I am confident this body \nwill do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \ngenerous comments. I very much enjoy working with him on the Armed \nServices Committee. He brings a great deal of expertise to this debate.\n  The amendment he has proposed this morning is one that our staffs are \nstarting to look at. I suggest that it be set aside so that we can do \nmore analysis of it, but I appreciate the spirit in which it was \noffered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside this \namendment? The amendment is set aside.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his statements \nabout the Collins-Lieberman legislation and also thank him for the \namendment. This looks to be exactly like the legislation the Senator \nand Senator Akaka introduced, which came out of our committee. This is \nthe right moment, and it strengthens the bill. I thank him for his \npersistence in offering it. I am glad we added it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the managers for their kind comments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this morning, I want to take a few \nminutes to talk about an amendment that was adopted yesterday. It was \nsponsored by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The amendment is about the 3,361 Presidential appointees and how they \nare confirmed. I am glad to see that as I am speaking the President pro \ntempore is here because he has been a Presidential appointee in an \nearlier administration. I am glad to see both the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee here because their \ncommittee deals with this issue. This is the kind of issue that never \nmakes the front page and is always on the back burner. But it has a \nmajor practical effect on how our Government works.\n  The 9/11 Commission has reminded us, once again, of the problem we \nhave. What the 9/11 Commission recommended, and what Senator \nVoinovich's amendment would do--an amendment that I was glad to \ncosponsor--is to, in the words of the 9/11 Commission--``speed up the \nnomination, financial reporting, security clearances, and confirmation \nprocess for national security officials at the start of an \nadministration.''\n  In other words, in plain English, to make it possible, if President \nBush reorganizes his administration in a second term, or if Senator \nKerry is the new President, they have 3,361 appointments to make. I \nthink it would come as a great shock to many of the voters who are \nvoting for one of them, and it will come as a shock, no doubt, to some \nof the people they nominate to know that if, for example, a President \nBush or a President Kerry picks a new Secretary of HHS or Secretary of \nEducation or Secretary of Defense, to begin with, that person is not \nallowed to go to the office of the Secretary of Defense or the \nSecretary of HHS or the Secretary of Education until he or she is \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  In other words, here we are in a war on terror. The President says he \nhas a new appointment requiring Presidential confirmation, let's say \nfor Secretary of State. That person is not allowed, out of courtesy to \nthis body, to go into the office of the Secretary of State until we \nconfirm them. One might say, well, there is nothing so wrong about \nthat. That should not take more than a few days, with the kind of well-\nknown person the President would probably pick--someone, for example, \nof the stature of Colin Powell.\n  I will give you an example of why it takes longer than a few days. \nThe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from \nMaine, all of us remember and know well Senator Howard Baker, who was \nthe majority leader of this body. Senator Baker, at one time, if memory \nserves me correctly, was selected as the most admired Senator in a poll \nparticipated in by both Democratic Senators and Republican Senators. He \nis known pretty well. He is today the Ambassador to Japan, nominated by \nPresident Bush. The Japanese consider that to be a great compliment to \nthe country, to have someone of such stature.\n\n  However, Howard Baker reminded me this week when I called him that \nwhen he was nominated by the President to be Ambassador to Japan, it \ntook him weeks to fill out the forms to be approved by the FBI, \napproved by the Government Ethics Office, nominated by the President, \nand confirmed by the Senate. He told me specifically that he spent more \nmoney hiring people to help him fill out his forms accurately so he \nwould not go to jail by making a mistake than he made in his first year \nas Ambassador to Japan.\n  Let's think of that. Here is a highly respected individual, at the \ntime 75 or 76 years old. He has been filling out forms for 18 years as \na Member of this body. He has run for President. He has been White \nHouse Chief of Staff. He is the most admired Senator. Yet by our\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\nrequirements it takes several weeks of his time, and he spends more \nmoney hiring people to fill out his forms than he made in his first \nyear in his Government job.\n  That is preposterous. That is a preposterous result.\n  He further told me he had another little issue with the Government \nEthics Office. Senator Baker is now married to former Senator Nancy \nKassebaum. It is the second marriage for both. When they became \nmarried, they wanted to keep their estates separate. They jointly owned \n25 head of cattle. This tied up Senator Baker's nomination for some \ntime in the Government Ethics Office because the question was jointly \nowning 25 head of cattle would require--just that single fact--Senator \nKassebaum to have to go through this week-long, very expensive process \nof disclosing everything once more about herself and filling out all \nthose forms.\n  Finally, in exasperation, Senator Baker simply gave his half interest \nin the 25 head of cattle to Senator Kassebaum, and that settled that \nproblem.\n  This is not so unusual. Senator Baker and Senator Kassebaum are not \nthe only Presidential nominees to go through the expense and delay of \nbeing appointed to a Presidential position.\n  I was nominated by the first President Bush as his Education \nSecretary. I was nominated in December of 1990. I was confirmed in I \nbelieve it was April of 1991. In the meantime, I was not allowed to go \nto the Office of the Secretary of Education.\n  During that time, 60 percent of American college students were going \nto colleges and universities followed by a Federal grant or a loan. \nThat is supposed to be supervised by the Secretary of Education of a \nPresident who said he wanted to be the education President. Yet his \nnominee is not allowed to go to the office, out of courtesy to this \nbody.\n  Then, of course, there is the matter of recruiting a team. I asked \nPresident Bush at that time: Mr. President, may I come up with a plan? \nMay I then recruit a team, subject to your approval, of course? So I \nwent to recruit David Kearns, the former head of Xerox, and Diane \nRavage, one of the most distinguished historians in America, Carolyn \nReed Wallace, the vice chancellor of the City University of New York.\n  All of them, of course, were not allowed to go to their office. Once \nthe President nominates and before they are confirmed, they must fill \nout all these forms, maybe not spend as much money as Senator Baker \ndid, but the same forms. They must go through this elaborate FBI check. \nThey must go through the President's political process, and then they \ncome over here. And if there is a divided body--for example, we have a \nRepublican President and a Democratic Senate--it takes a little longer.\n  What is the point of all this? The point of all this is we cannot get \nour work done. The voters all tune in to a Presidential debate, such as \nwe saw last night--two distinguished competitors, both doing pretty \nwell, I thought--they take off in January and say: Let's go this way \nand what happens? There is nobody to work for them. They cannot even go \nto their offices. They are all down here filling out forms that are \ngoing to cost them more than they make in their first year.\n  This is a problem. Who is at fault? A lot of places are at fault. \nPartisan politics is sometimes at fault. When I was going through \nconfirmation, I went around to see another former Member of this body, \nSenator Warren Rudman. He told me what happened in 1976. He was \nnominated by President Ford to the Federal Communications Commission, I \nbelieve, and a Senator from New Hampshire put a hold on his nomination.\n  It went along that way until the people of New Hampshire said: What \nis wrong with Warren Rudman? He must be a crook, he must have stolen \nsomething or else the Senate would be acting on his nomination. Out of \nembarrassment, Warren Rudman, a private citizen, asked President Ford \nto withdraw his name from consideration in the Senate. Then Senator \nRudman ran against the Senator who put a hold on his name, defeated \nhim, and served in this body.\n  I am not sure we can pass any law or change any rule that will \nprevent that kind of partisan politics, but we should be aware that is \npart of the problem.\n  Senator Voinovich's amendment does address some areas we can fix. One \nis there may be too many jobs subject to this kind of intensive review. \nMr. President, 3,361 is a lot of Presidential appointments to have to \ngo through that time-consuming, weeks-long process. It is too many jobs \nto leave vacant at the beginning of a new administration when we all \nexpect a new President to come in and say: Let's go in this direction. \nIt is too many jobs to leave vacant, the 9/11 Commission said, \nespecially when we are dealing with the national security of the United \nStates, and a great many of those men and women are people we are \nrelying upon to protect us.\n  The FBI review takes a long time. Maybe that could be simplified. If \nthey are doing 3,361 FBI reviews at one time and the FBI's major goal \nis supposed to be counterterrorism, maybe that is something we should \nbe looking at as well.\n  Then we get busy. An example exists today, and this is in no way \ncriticism, but it is an example of how we get busy. The President on \nMay 20 nominated Edwin Williamson to be Director of the Office of \nEthics for our Government. This is the very office that contributes to \na lot of the questions and reviews that slow down the process. That was \nMay 20. His hearing before the full committee is next week.\n  Everyone in the Senate can understand the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has been busy the last 8 weeks, but, nevertheless, we have a \nprocess that when we get busy, sometimes we contribute to the delay.\n\n  So the Voinovich amendment does not by itself solve the problem. It \nsets in motion a series of reviews and studies and discussions that \nmight help solve the problem.\n  The reason for my coming to the floor today is to say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, and the President pro tempore, I hope we keep this high \nenough on our agenda that it does not slip to the back page again. \nFormer Senator Fred Thompson prepared legislation on this issue. This \nis a lot like many of the issues that have come up with national \nintelligence reform. There have been about 30 or so reviews since World \nWar II on national intelligence reform, and they often slip to the back \npages, to the back burner, and we do not get it done.\n  This time we are getting it done. We have also taken steps on another \nso-called back-burner issue, as the 9/11 Commission put it and that is, \nspeeding up the nomination--financial reporting, security clearances, \nand confirmation process for officials nominated by the President at \nthe start of an administration. It is my hope that over the next year, \nthe reviews mentioned in the Voinovich amendment will go forward, that \nwe will simplify the process. Of course, for the national security \nofficials, we can all see the urgent need for that.\n  Of course, we do not want them sitting outside their offices next \nFebruary out of courtesy to us when there is some attack on the United \nStates that they might have helped prevent, but at the same time we do \nnot want students going to college with some Secretary of Education \nsitting outside his office not allowed to go in. We do not want Head \nStart dollars being spent with some Secretary of Health and Human \nServices sitting outside her offices not allowed to go in. We need to \nhave firm deadlines and firm dates, simplified forms, out of respect to \nthe people the President nominates, out of respect to the voters who \nexpect a President to be able to act, and out of respect to ourselves.\n  There will occasionally be a nominee--we are not talking about \njudicial nominees--there will occasionally be one of the 3,361 \nexecutive nominations where this is a problem, that requires an \nextended debate--and we are fully capable of doing that in the Senate--\nbut the rest of the nominations ought to speed through on a fairly \nautomatic, simplified review, allowing the executive branch to be in a \nposition to see urgent needs, develop a strategy, and try to persuade \nhalf of us that he is right, which is the job of the President.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for this time. I applaud them for \ntheir bipartisan action on this bill and their work on the committee. I \nam glad they adopted the amendment yesterday, and I look forward to \nworking with them\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\nover the next several months to see that it does not slide back to the \nback burner and get lost so that men of the stature of Howard Baker \nhave to spend more than they earn in their first year in Government \nfilling out the forms we require of them even though we have known them \nand known everything about them for 25 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise first to thank the Senator from \nTennessee for taking the time to come to the Senate floor to express \nhis thoughts, which he has talked to Senator Collins and me about \nearlier. I admire his focus on this area as well as the work and focus \nof the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The fact is that this is one of those aspects of governmental process \nand procedure that never gets much public attention but has great \nconsequences for the public, and in this case it is relevant to the \nunderlying bill for national security. There is not much political plus \nin making this a matter one focuses on in the sense that it does not \nget headlines, but it is a critically important matter because, as the \nSenator says so well and eloquently, the delay caused in confirming the \nnominees has an effect on the quality of public service, in fact has an \neffect on the content of national security if people cannot be put into \nthe positions where they are needed early enough.\n  So I thank the Senator. I encourage the Senator--although I probably \ndo not have to--to stay aggressive, to make sure that not only the \namendment the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Ohio \nsponsored yesterday that was adopted on the bill is put into place but, \nmore generally, to make sure we fix this.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has some great anecdotes, too. It is \npretty startling to have heard that Howard Baker, a great former Member \nof this body, spent more time filling out the forms, hiring people to \nhelp him fill out the forms, to be Ambassador to Japan than he was \ngoing to receive as a salary for the first year of his service. That \nought not to happen. Obviously, one of the things that also does, which \nthe Senator knows and has spoken to, is discourage people who may not \nhave the resources to pay for that kind of consultation from going into \npublic service where we need them.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  I rise briefly to speak in support of the--Mr. President, I am going \nto hold this statement, which is of a timeless nature, so I can deliver \nit, I am sure, at any point in the day where there may be a lull. This \ntime was devoted to Senator Byrd to offer an amendment. I did not \nrealize he was here. I welcome him to the Chamber and look forward to \nhearing his statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to offer an \namendment that affects the bill in more than one place. I have cleared \nthis with the two managers.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3845.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending amendment \nis set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Warner, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3845.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors of my amendment: Senators Stevens, \nInouye, Warner, Harkin, and Johnson.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first, I express my appreciation to the two \nmanagers for their courtesies that they never fail to extend. I also \nwant to express my appreciation to the distinguished President pro \ntempore who is in the chair this morning, Senator Stevens, my soulmate \non the Appropriations Committee.\n  In 2001, we witnessed the failure of our Government to utilize its \nintelligence capabilities to protect our Nation against a terrorist \nattack. For too long, the Congress has deferred to the executive branch \non intelligence matters. Congress has failed to vigorously discharge \nits constitutional oversight responsibilities. I do not say that by way \nof finding fault with any Senator.\n  The 9/11 Commission illustrated the dangers of this practice. The \nconsequence has been foreign policy failures, prison scandals, \npoliticized intelligence that has led not only to a desperate state of \naffairs in Iraq but has also left our Nation vulnerable to further \nterrorist attacks. It is painfully clear that there are dire \nconsequences when the Congress abdicates its constitutional duties to \noversee the intelligence agencies within the executive branch.\n  Senators need to be reminded--I need to be reminded as well--that the \nCongress is a consumer of intelligence. Senators must have access to \ngood intelligence to make informed decisions about our military, about \nour foreign policy, about the solemn charge to authorize war, and that \nremains a constitutional function, authorization of war.\n  I am sorry to say I did not hear anybody in last night's debate on \neither side mention the Constitution of the United States, not once. \nThe Constitution gives Congress alone the power to declare war or \nauthorize war. The Congress must ensure that it is fully and currently \ninformed of all matters that may bear on the exercise of that \nconstitutional authority. Senators ought to be cautious about \nintelligence reforms and ensure that the role of the Congress in \nintelligence matters is not undermined. Reform means fixing what has \ngone wrong, not giving the executive branch more authority to conduct \nend runs around the Congress.\n  When I speak of the executive branch, I speak generically, both when \nit is under Democratic control and Republican control. We must ensure \nthat the top national security officials specified in this bill are \nsubject to Senate confirmation so that they are held accountable to the \nelected representatives of the people.\n  The first three words in the preamble of the Constitution are, ``We \nthe people. . . .'' ``We the people. . . .'' And yet, I say, that \nConstitution was not mentioned once last night.\n  We must ensure that Senators have access to information necessary to \nfulfill their Constitutional duties. We must ensure that the Congress \ndoes not codify loopholes through which the executive can deny the \nCongress relevant information. Perhaps most importantly, we must ensure \nthat funds appropriated by the Congress cannot be rerouted without the \nconsent of the people's representatives in Congress.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has ensured accountability to the \nCongress in many of these areas, but I believe more can be done.\n  This is an amendment which I have proposed, along with Senators \nStevens, Inouye, Warner, Harkin, and Johnson to remove the qualifiers \non Congressional access to information, to ensure that the Congress's \nrole in intelligence matters is preserved, and to ensure that the \nAmerican people are protected.\n  This amendment requires Senate confirmation of the following \npositions within the National Intelligence Authority and the Office of \nManagement and Budget: four deputy national intelligence directors, the \nOfficer for Civil Rights and Liberties, the Privacy Officer, and the \nDeputy Director of OMB for Information Sharing. It is vital that the \nCongress have access to these officials and be able to hold them \naccountable for their decisions, particularly in the area of civil \nliberties.\n  To further that goal, my amendment requires that the Inspector \nGeneral of the National Intelligence Authority keep the congressional \nintelligence committees fully and currently informed of violations of \nlaw and civil liberties.\n  However, the greatest protection against abuse within the \nintelligence agencies is to monitor closely their budgets. The Congress \nshould jealously guard its power of the purse, and, to do that, I have \nworked with Senators Stevens and Inouye to ensure that the authorities \ngranted to the national intelligence director to transfer personnel and \nfunding within the National Intelligence Program closely reflect \ncurrent law.\n  Our amendment strikes language authorizing the Treasury Secretary to \nestablish new budget accounts for the use of the national intelligence \ndirector. This is a function of the Congress, which has the authority \nto determine how accounts should be constructed to fund our national \nintelligence.\n  My amendment allows the national intelligence director, with the \napproval of the OMB Director, to transfer appropriated funds within the \nNational Intelligence Program, and the heads of the departments and \nagencies to transfer personnel within the intelligence community for \nperiods up to 1 year, under the following conditions:\n  A transfer of funds or personnel may be made only to an activity that \nis a higher priority; and unforeseen requirement; but not to the \nReserve for Contingencies of the national intelligence director. The \ncumulative transfer in a single fiscal year must be less than $100 \nmillion and less than 5 percent of amounts available to such \ndepartment, agency, or element; and the transfer of funds cannot \nterminate a program.\n  A transfer may be made without regard to the $100 million and 5 \npercent limitation if the transfer has the concurrence of the head of \nthe department, agency, or entity concerned--provided, always, that the \ntransfer conforms with the strict limitations set by the Congress each \nyear in its annual appropriations acts.\n  Funds transferred shall remain available for the same period as the \nappropriations account to which transferred; and any transfer of funds \nor personnel shall be reported to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees, such as Appropriations, Judiciary, Armed Services, and \nIntelligence.\n  I am confident that if these qualifications are adhered to, the power \nof the purse will continue to rest safely in the hands of the people's \nelected representatives.\n  In addition, Senators should take note of Section 224(b)(3) of the \npending bill, which would permit the national intelligence director, \nthe Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, or the Director \nof a national intelligence center to withhold information requested by \nthe Congress if the President certifies that such information will not \nbe provided because the President is asserting a privilege pursuant to \nthe United States Constitution.\n  It is unclear exactly which privilege the President would invoke, \nbut, given the vague language contained in this provision, a bold and \nimpulsive administration, much like the one currently\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\ninhabiting the White House, could concoct nearly any excuse to invoke a \nso-called ``privilege'' to withhold documents requested by the \nCongress. Giving any administration an unrestrained green light to \ntrump any and all forthcoming Congressional requests for information, \nbased on some undefined and nefarious assertion of executive privilege \nas described in this provision, would be an unmitigated disaster. My \namendment strikes that egregious language.\n  It is my hope, as well as the hope of my colleagues who cosponsored \nthis measure with me, that this amendment will ensure that the \nCongress's Constitutional role in intelligence and foreign policy \nmatters is safeguarded.\n  However, Senators should understand that the statutory authority to \noversee our intelligence community means very little if it is not \nutilized. We must be vigilant in our oversight. We must be aggressive \nin our inquiries. We must not abdicate our Constitutional duties.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, needless to say, I thank the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, whom, as does everyone in the Chamber, I greatly \nadmire. He is a real authority on this matter, so I speak both with \nrespect and a certain sense of humility.\n  This recommendation that Senator Collins and I and our committee \nbrought before the Senate rose out of reality. And the reality is that \nwe have an intelligence community with a lot of extraordinary people \nand technological assets but, as the 9/11 Commission said, there is no \none in charge. I repeat, it is like a football team with great players \nbut no quarterback. In fact, some of the players, as great as they are, \nare playing in a different stadium than the one where the game is.\n  The 9/11 Commission has said to us that its foremost goal, the most \nurgent recommendation it makes to the Congress for what to do if we \nwant to believe that we have done everything we can to prevent a \nterrorist attack of the scope of 9/11 from happening in this country \nagain, is to create--establish a strong national intelligence director, \na leader where there is no leader, a quarterback where there is no \nquarterback. That is what Senator Collins and I have done in our \nproposal.\n  A strong national director--but what is the element of strength? It \nis budget authority. It is the power to bring together the agencies \nunder the director for a unity of effort, like the joint commands in \nour military which grew out of Goldwater-Nichols, after a period of \ntime and a lot of opposition when they were first considered on the \nfloor, not dissimilar to some of the opposition and anxiety that has \nbeen expressed about the national intelligence director in our time. \nThey worked extremely well.\n  So we have created a strong director with budget authority to \nformulate budgets, to receive funds, to allocate them--with \njustification, not wantonly; to transfer budget, transfer funds to meet \nan emergency; to transfer personnel to achieve a national purpose.\n  In our deliberations in the Governmental Affairs Committee we see \nwarning after warning that if you are going to do this right, you have \nto give this national intelligence director real power.\n  In this morning's paper, the Washington Post, Friday, October 1, an \narticle by Charles Babington quotes from a press conference I presume \nby the Chair and Cochair of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Kean, former \nRepublican Governor of New Jersey, and Congressman Hamilton, former \nDemocratic Congressman from Indiana. Governor Kean says at one point, \nthe story says:\n\n       Governor Kean meanwhile spoke sharply against House \n     provisions and proposed Senate amendments that would limit \n     the national intelligence director's authority over spending \n     and personnel decisions in agencies under them.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The House bill will keep more of that power in the \n     Pentagon.\n\n  Then Governor Kean says:\n\n       On behalf of the nonpartisan commission, this is not an \n     area where one can compromise. If you are not going to create \n     a strong national intelligence director with powers both \n     appointive and over the budget, don't do it.\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       If you are not going to create a strong national \n     intelligence director with powers both appointive and over \n     the budget, don't do it.\n\n  That is the advice we heard over and over again from former Directors \nof Central Intelligence, from experts in the field, from members of the \nCommission.\n  I say respectfully that the amendment which Senator Byrd and the \ndistinguished list of cosponsors put before us this morning would have \nthe effect of weakening the authority of the national intelligence \ndirector and, therefore, bring us back to the place where we were, \nwhere there wasn't a strong quarterback, where there wasn't a strong \ngeneral, if you will, of our intelligence forces in the war against \nterrorism.\n  As I read it, it strikes the section that establishes accounts for \nthe national intelligence program funds under the jurisdiction of the \nnational intelligence director, and the national intelligence director \nwould control the management, including the allotment of appropriated \nfunds to the elements of the intelligence community.\n  I would like to have some discussion on this. But as I read one of \nthe two parts of this which strike me as most troubling, it is the part \nthat seems to say that our attempt in this bill--our clear intention \nstated in the bill--is to make sure that strange situation we have \nwhere 80 percent of the funding for intelligence, billions and billions \nof dollars, goes not to the intelligence community first but to the \nDepartment of Defense. The Department of Defense is a critical--in some \nsense, the largest--customer of intelligence, but it is not the only \ncustomer. The President of the United States is the No. 1 customer. The \nDepartment of State, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI--one \ncould go on and on--they are also important users of intelligence.\n  We have said that the funds of the national intelligence program \nbudget should go to the national intelligence director and give that \nperson the authority that comes with the money to allocate those funds \nthroughout the agencies underneath him, and give him thereby some clout \nto create unity of effort, to bring people together, to overcome the \nweaknesses.\n\n  As the 9/11 Commission Report describes it--and Senator Collins and I \nkeep telling the story--George Tenet, former Director of Central \nIntelligence, in 1998, after a series of al-Qaida attacks on Americans \nand American targets abroad, declares war on terrorism. It was a \nclassified document within the intelligence community and it is now \npublic. It states the case very strongly. It says we have to devote all \nof our resources to it, and nothing happened.\n  Senator Byrd is a great student of the Bible. I so appreciate it. He \nbrought it with him to the Senate floor yesterday. I take this \nopportunity to quote from the Bible. Perhaps it was from Corinthians. \n``If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow into \nbattle?''\n  My worry here is that in this case, the trumpet is money. If the \nauthority of the national intelligence director over the funds is \nuncertain, then I worry that the troops are not going to follow them \ninto battle just as they didn't follow George Tenet when they declared \nwar or terrorists and terrorism in 1998. We might have even been better \noff and maybe even have avoided 9/11 if something had happened in \nresponse to that.\n  This amendment seems to say that the money we want to go to the \nnational intelligence director can't because in our attempt to \nestablish accounts, we now, in this act of Congress--Senator Byrd is \nabsolutely right, this is a congressional decision, but we are offering \nour colleagues that decision, which is to set up those accounts in the \nTreasury Department for the national intelligence director so that \ndirector can receive the funds and then allocate them.\n  Second, the two elements of authority for the national intelligence \ndirector as the general of our intelligence forces are to transfer \npersonnel and funds. I appreciate the fact that this amendment does not \ntake away that authority, and when Senator Collins and I started out, \nwe worried people\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nwould resist that authority altogether in the national intelligence \ndirector. So I appreciate that. But it does limit the authority of the \ndirector to transfer personnel and money in a way that I think weakens \nthe director and undercuts the purpose we want and the reasons we want \nthem to be powerful, to give this intelligence force the flexibility to \nfocus, the agility to respond to realities in the world.\n  These terrorists are not only brutal, not only inhumane, not only \ndon't value human life, not only convince themselves zealously that \nthey are doing God's work by killing God's children wantonly, but they \nare agile. They will look for weaknesses in the system and move to \nattack. That is why the national intelligence director has to have the \nability to move money quickly. It may be that there is a crisis area \nsomewhere or a new kind of threat to the United States and the director \ndecides he has to move funds to meet that threat.\n  This is not an authority that is unlimited or even beyond the control \nof the law today. Our bill makes sure that there is congressional \noversight on the transfer of the funds. The amendment would limit the \ntransfer of funds. It would have to be less than $100 million and less \nthan 5 percent of the budget of the entity from which the money is \nbeing transferred unless the relevant department head concurs in the \ntransfer.\n\n  I want to assure the Chamber and Senator Byrd that our amendment, \nthough it does not put those limits on the transfer because we don't \nknow what kind of threat may emerge and where the national intelligence \ndirector may feel in the national interest he wants to move those \nfunds, makes sure there is congressional oversight. It provides that \nany transfer of funds by the national intelligence director must be \ncarried out in accordance with the existing congressional notification \nprocedures. Congress still has the right to approve.\n  Moreover, the national intelligence director is required to submit a \nreport to the appropriate committees of Congress explaining the nature \nof the transfer and how it meets the relevant statutory requirements.\n  Finally, our bill also requires that any transfer of funds or \npersonnel not exceed applicable ceilings established in law for such.\n  This means that while we are setting the standard for the national \nintelligence director, Congress each year as it adopts the budget \nreserves the right to put instructions in that. I might oppose it, but \nit includes the possibility of limiting the transfers, as has happened \nin the past. We wanted to make sure--in some sense to reassure \nourselves and our appropriators--that this bill says that any transfer \nof funds or personnel would not exceed applicable ceilings established \nin law for such transfers.\n  We want to provide the national intelligence director with the \nnecessary flexibility and force to respond with speed to a crisis, and \nnot establish, therefore, permanent caps on this legislation that might \nhinder the director's ability to make those changes that are necessary.\n\n  Under the current system, the DCI lacks budget power. DOD controls 80 \npercent of the intelligence budget, whereas the director of central \nintelligence effectively only controls a budget of one agency, the CIA.\n  Secretary Powell commented on this current reality at our hearing on \nSeptember 13, 2004, by saying:\n\n       The DCI was there before but the DCI did not have that kind \n     of authority, and in this town it's budget authority that \n     counts.\n\n  Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton said in their testimony at \nour first hearing on July 30:\n\n       The national intelligence director would not be like other \n     czars who get the title but have no meaningful authority. He \n     will control national intelligence program purse strings.\n\n  For those reasons, respectfully, this amendment would seriously \nweaken the authority of the national intelligence director, and \ntherefore, I believe, the director's ability to protect our national \nsecurity in an age of terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I comment on the specifics of the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia, let me join Senator \nLieberman in expressing the utmost respect that I have for the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. His devotion to the Constitution, to the Senate, to \nthe country, and to his family is truly legendary. I have learned so \nmuch just from watching the Senator from West Virginia. In fact, he \ninspired me to get a copy of the Constitution, and while I don't carry \nit with me as he does, I have it in my briefcase. It was his example \nthat inspired me to do that.\n  Like Senator Lieberman, I have, nevertheless, many concerns about the \npending amendment. In drafting our bill, we made very clear the \nauthority that the new national intelligence director would have. We \ndid not want to simply create another layer of bureaucracy. What we \nwanted to do is to empower the NID with significant budget personnel, \nstandard-setting authority, so that this individual could make a \ndifference.\n  I remember in the testimony before our committee the consensus among \nthe witnesses was that in order for the NID to be effective, strong \nauthority was absolutely critical. Indeed, the assistant DCI for \ncommunity management said it very forthrightly. He testified as \nfollows:\n\n       We must be flexible in shifting people and money to respond \n     to emerging priorities. Today's intelligence budget system \n     does not meet this criteria.\n\n  Senator Byrd's amendment imposes significant restrictions on the \nability of NID to transfer personnel and to transfer funds. That \nconcerns me greatly.\n  Under the Collins-Lieberman bill, with OMB approval, the NID may \ntransfer or reprogram funds appropriated for a program within the \nnational intelligence budget to another program. The NID is required to \nconsult with the heads of the affected agencies prior to implementing \nsuch a reprogramming or transfer, but our bill does not require their \napproval. We make very clear that the reprogramming and transferring \napprovals and restrictions as far as congressional authority are \nincluded in our bill, as well.\n  If we require the concurrence of the agency heads before personnel or \nmoney can be moved around, we essentially have made no improvement in \nthe current system. That is not progress. In fact, it is exactly the \nproblem the 9/11 Commission identified over and over again as a major \nflaw in the current system.\n  The NID needs to be able to marshal the people, the funds, and the \nresources necessary to counter the threats we face. That is the bottom \nline.\n  The current authorities for the DCI are insufficient because they \npermit agencies to prevent the DCI from transferring funds or people \nsimply by objective. That is what we need to change.\n  I am also concerned about making additional positions created by this \nbill subject to Senate confirmation. The privacy and civil rights \nofficers at the Department of Homeland Security are not Senate-\nconfirmed positions. I see no reason for treating the privacy and civil \nrights officers that would be created by this bill any differently.\n  There is another point that I make about the restrictions in the \nSenator's amendments on reprogramming and transfer authority. That is, \nif we are going to impose these kinds of restrictions, we are not \nimproving the system in any significant way, and we are allowing the \nlong delays that plague the current system to continue.\n  Acting CIA Director John McLaughlin told me it can take as long as 5 \nmonths for him to reprogram funds. In the threat environment we face \ntoday, we cannot afford a 5-month delay in transferring urgently needed \nfunds to counter the threat we face.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia would represent a \nsignificant weakening of the authority in this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Walt Whitman said:\n\n       A man is a great thing upon the Earth, and through \n     eternity--but every jot of greatness of man is unfolded out \n     of woman.\n\n  So let me pay tribute to our Presiding Officer at this moment.\n  Madam President, I have the utmost respect for the two managers of \nthis bill. I have the utmost respect for their\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\ndedication and for the knowledge which they bring to bear upon this \nsubject. I am not a member of the committee that has jurisdiction over \nthe legislation before the Senate. So I salute them and tip my hat to \nthem and bow to them.\n  So what I say is certainly in no fashion, in no way or form any \ncriticism of them. They are doing the best they can do.\n\n  But the Constitution of the United States still lives. It still \ngoverns. Let's read this paragraph from section 9 of the U.S. \nConstitution:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  Let these words sink in:\n\n     . . . and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and \n     Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time \n     to time.\n\n  We have to keep that provision in mind.\n  The amendment I have offered today simply ensures that the national \nintelligence director spends money in accordance with the annual \nappropriations bills. It provides the flexibility that the director may \nrequire but limits that flexibility to the laws passed by Congress and \nto the knowledge that there is this provision:\n\n     . . . a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and \n     Expenditures of all public money--\n\n  ``All public money.''\n\n     . . . all public money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  We cannot allow this national intelligence director to spend the \npeople's tax dollars without restraint, without some limitation, \nwithout some restraint. A $40 billion blank check? We cannot allow the \nnational intelligence director to spend money without regard to \nCongress. There must be some limitations on his spending authority.\n  Without this amendment, the intelligence director, and not the \nCongress, will determine how certain appropriated moneys are spent. We \nmust not remove all limitations on this new intelligence director. If \nwe yield the power of the purse to this new intelligence director, then \nwe have only limited means to rein him in if there are abuses of power.\n  My amendment limits the transfer of appropriations to $100 million \nand even allows the Department heads to waive that limitation as long \nas it is consistent with appropriations law. That, it seems to me, \nshould be more than enough flexibility. We must retain some limitation. \nThe intelligence director must not be allowed to write his own \nappropriations bill. That would elevate him above the Congress. That \nwill elevate him, an intelligence director, above the people's elected \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  We talk about the trumpet that gives an uncertain sound. Yes. How can \nwe be certain as to what we are doing when we are rushed and pressured \ninto passing legislation as major as this legislation in such a limited \ntime, which is hours? We are being pressured to pass this legislation \nbefore we adjourn sine die. This is massive legislation. It is far-\nreaching legislation. The Congress should not have to operate under a \nhammer, as we are being driven here.\n  Henry Kissinger came before the Appropriations Committee when Senator \nStevens held those hearings. I compliment my chairman, Mr. Stevens, on \nhaving those hearings. Henry Kissinger, a man with vast experience, \nvast knowledge, advised us not to pass this gargantuan measure in such \na hurry and under such pressure and during a Presidential campaign.\n  I say to my colleagues, we ought not bend to the lash of the whip on \nthe part of the leadership, on the part of the administration, on the \npart of anyone else. We should take more time. We do not know what we \nare doing here. I am seeking to protect the people's representatives \nand the Congress from making what could be a major mistake.\n\n  We were rushed into passing legislation creating a Department of \nHomeland Security, were we not? I tried to get more time. I tried to \nget the leadership on both sides to listen. They would not listen. Now \nwe find that there are major problems with that Department.\n  On that fateful occasion on October 11, when the Senate voted to \nshift the constitutional power to declare war from the Congress--not \njust one body of Congress, but both bodies of Congress--to one man, oh, \nwhat a terrible mistake that was, what a terrible error. We were told: \nLet's get it behind us. Let's get it behind us. Let's get it behind us. \nThe idea was to get that legislation passed before that election. So \nthe Senate passed that legislation in a hurry, on October 11 of that \nyear.\n  Oh, we will always rue that day that the Senate bent to the urgings \nof the leadership, which said: Let's get it behind us. We have not \ngotten it behind us. We did not get it behind us. I said at the time we \nwould not get it behind us. I said at the time that the President, Mr. \nBush, would not let us get it behind us. That was what he wanted. He \nwanted the Senate to bend in that critical hour before an election so \nthat the Senators who voted on that measure would be somehow conscious \nthat there was an election down the road, and particularly those who \nwere running would be under the whiplash of an election.\n  Oh, what a terrible mistake. I felt so ashamed. For the first time in \nmy 46 years in this Senate, I felt ashamed that the Senate was \nknuckling under to the executive branch and making a mistake which is \nrued to this day and will be rued to the end of time. That blotch upon \nthe escutcheon of this great body, the first time in my 46 years that I \nwas ashamed, this Senate stood mute. It stood bowed. It was \nintimidated.\n  And we can make another mistake if we go and rush in too big a hurry. \nWe are doing a big thing here. I do not set myself up as anyone who has \nthe vast knowledge that Mr. Lieberman has or that Ms. Collins has over \nthis subject matter. I am not on that committee. But I do know when we \nare being pressured to act in too big a hurry. This is a big bill. Why \ncan't we wait until after the first of the year? Why can't we wait \nuntil a new Congress, perhaps with a new President--who knows?--a new \nChief Executive? Why can't we wait and do the job right? This is a job \nthat we ought to do right and not do it under the gun.\n  I do not know what is in this bill. I am not on the committee. I do \nnot know what is in this bill. I do not claim to know what is in the \nbill. But I tell you, we must not remove all limitations on this new \nintelligence director. Why, this man is going to be God when it comes \nto appropriations and legislation and matters affecting the people.\n  This is the perfect example of how we are rushing through this \nintelligence bill without fully understanding what we are doing. I do \nnot understand what we are doing, and I need to understand what we are \ndoing. To properly represent the people from West Virginia, I need to \nunderstand what we are doing.\n  Now, fortunately, I have a good colleague on the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Rockefeller. But I tell you, we are dealing with \nmatters that go to the heart--the heart--of a free government.\n  Englishmen spilled their blood for centuries to wield the power of \nthe purse away from monarchs in England. They shed their blood, \nyes, going all the way back to the Magna Carta, the great charter, in \n1215. It was signed on the banks of the Thames River.\n\n  I think we ought to go a little slower. This is a perfect example of \nhow we are rushing through this intelligence bill. I say it with all \ndue respect to Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins. I admire them, \nbut I admire the Constitution also. I think we ought to stop, look, and \nlisten, and slow down a little bit here.\n  Without this amendment, the Congress will cede its power of the purse \njust as it ceded the authority to declare war 2 years ago. We owe it to \nthe 9/11 families to get this right. I say to my staff all the time: If \nyou don't do the job right, how are you going to find time to do it \nover? That applies in this instance, too. I say that with all due \nrespect.\n  There is nothing to keep my colleague--my cherished friend, for whom \nI have great admiration--from coming back next year, from sitting in \nthe driver's seat and doing this thing and doing it perhaps better than \nhe has done it in the first instance. I have no doubt that he would go \nat it with a will.\n  In the long run, the victims of 9/11 will not forgive us if we give \naway the\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\npower of the purse. And don't forget, it is not just that first \nsentence. There is more to it than the first sentence:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of \n     all--\n\n  Not just some, all--\n\n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  Better ponder that bit of verbiage before we get in too big a hurry \nhere.\n  We will have some opportunities to talk further about this amendment. \nIn sitting down, let me again pay homage to my friend, a public servant \nwhom I long have admired, and this fine lady. I tell you, she is a \nstalwart. But God save the Constitution. God save it. Let's don't be in \ntoo big a hurry. Take a little more time and do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me first thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kind words. The truth is, these are critically \nimportant matters we are debating. I feel a sense of responsibility and \nhonor in having the opportunity to speak to them. But I must say, to be \ninvolved in a debate such as this with the Senator from West Virginia \nis in itself an honor.\n  We disagree on this particular amendment, but I so respect the core \nof his values that motivate him and guide him every day. I know he only \nwishes the best for our country and for our Congress. I don't say it \nlightly. I hope he understands these are not reflexive words and \npraise. It is an honor to be involved in this kind of debate with the \nSenator from West Virginia, who is a very vital Member of the Senate \ntoday but a part of Senate and American history. I thank him very much \nfor caring enough about what we are doing to come here this morning and \noffer this amendment.\n  Of course, he is the man who carries the Constitution right by his \nheart and reminds us of what it requires of us. It is a founding \ndocument. It is in many ways a sacred document to all of us Americans. \nI assure him, with regard to the sections of the Constitution he read \nabout the appropriate allocation of responsibility of the Congress and \nthe executive branch regarding fiscal decisions, there is nothing in \nthis bill Senator Collins and I bring to the Senate that would alter \nthat balance in any way. I will speak to that in a bit.\n  There is an alteration of authority and power in this proposal \nSenator Collins and I have made, but it is not altering the existing, \nconstitutionally based power relationship between Congress and the \nexecutive. It does alter the allocation of authority and money and, \ntherefore, power between various agencies of the executive branch. But \nthere is no change in the congressional-executive relationship.\n  Yes, there are some necessary changes in the relationship between the \nDepartment of Defense, CIA, FBI, and a new national intelligence \ndirector who gains power here. So some may have to give up a little \nbit, but that is in the national interest. That is the first point I \nwant to assure the Senator on.\n  Senator Collins and I are not only devoted to the Constitution, we \nare devoted to the critical role the Constitution gives Congress in \nthese matters. I want to assure the Senator, again, that we have done \nnothing to alter the authority of Congress.\n  I will read from page 28 of our bill, section (4). This is the \nsection that goes to the transfer authority of the national \nintelligence director. On line 23, it reads:\n\n       Any transfer of funds under this subsection shall be \n     carried out in accordance with existing procedures applicable \n     to reprogramming notifications for the appropriate \n     congressional committees.\n\n  Then it goes on:\n\n       The National Intelligence Director shall promptly submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report on any \n     transfer of personnel made pursuant to this subsection.\n\n  Of course, there is a section in here that ``requires any transfer of \nfunds or personnel not exceed applicable ceilings established in law \nfor such transfers.'' So any succeeding Congress reserves the right to \nestablish such limits in law, and they will not be altered by the \nCollins-Lieberman proposal.\n  The second thing to say is the authority we give the national \nintelligence director--that we believe so strongly that director \nneeds--is not without control. No one is going to confuse this director \nwith a god, even a god of intelligence. He will be a director of \nintelligence but he will be limited.\n  For instance, transfers of personnel and budget will be subject to \nthe approval of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  So ultimately what does that mean? It means the Commander in Chief \nhas to approve. If there is a fear that this national intelligence \ndirector may do some things that, let's say, the Secretary of Defense \ndoesn't like, the Secretary of Defense can go right to the President \nand say I don't like this and please get the OMB director not to \napprove these transfers. The final responsibility for the decision goes \nto where it should be ultimately in our system, which is to the \nPresident.\n  We also require consultation with department heads before transfers \nof budget or money or personnel are made. We require that the transfers \nonly be made for what we call a higher priority intelligence activity. \nWe don't expect this to be done wantonly. We are not allowing it to be \ndone wantonly, to override the appropriations of Congress. We are \nsaying we want that director, though, to have the ability, if there is \na crisis, to move money like a general moving troops to the point where \nthe Army is being attacked. As I said earlier, the transfers have to \noccur within applicable ceilings established by law.\n  So I say this, finally, to my dear friend and respected colleague \nfrom West Virginia. There is an urgency here, which is the urgency of \nthe terrorist threat that we face. The 9/11 Commission has been clear \nabout this. They believe we are in a situation where still, today, no \none is in charge of our intelligence community. We had testimony before \nour committee in terms of Osama bin Laden, that evil person who \nconcocted and directed, or conceived and directed the attack against \nAmerica on 9/11/01, killing almost 3,000 innocent civilians. Obviously, \nhe is the No. 1 target for us today. In the hunt for Osama bin Laden, \nthere is no one in charge. We have two or three agencies of our \nGovernment going at this, but there is no one in charge. The national \nintelligence director will put somebody in charge. That is the urgency, \nthat we remain at war and we are not organized as well as we should be. \nThe urgency is the urgency that a general in combat would feel is clear \nif the enemy is taking advantage of a particular vulnerability in his \nforces. He would move quickly to shore up that vulnerability. That is \nwhat we are doing as well.\n  In closing, families of the victims of September 11 have formed a \ngroup to advocate, in some ways, in the memory of their husbands, \nwives, fathers, mothers, and children who were lost on September 11, to \nmake sure we do what they think we ought to do to protect other \nfamilies from suffering. They sent a letter to Members of Congress a \nweek or two ago in which they said:\n\n       Sufficient information necessary to make a decision as to a \n     new, improved structure for the Nation's intelligence \n     community is currently available to all Members of Congress. \n     Opinions may differ as to how improvements are best \n     accomplished, but those differences can be addressed within \n     the framework of the legislation being proposed. There is no \n     excuse for deferring decisionmaking, given the wealth of \n     information available.\n\n  Again, that is from families of the victims of September 11. I \npromised that would be the last word, but this will be the last word. I \nsay to the Senator from West Virginia that the very introduction of \nthis amendment and the discussion it engenders today between yourself, \nSenator Collins, and me, and hopefully other Members listening and \ninvolved is part of the process, similar to what we went through in our \nCommittee. I think a lot of Members came to the Committee hearings and \ndeliberations, and we went on for two days of markup. We had almost 50 \namendments. We conducted a very open discussion. We listened and, in \nsome cases, we altered language in the mark we laid down because we \nthought Members made good points. In other cases, we said it hurts the \npurpose of what is required. In the end, because everybody felt we \nworked together and learned a lot, we were very pleased to say the bill \nwas reported out unanimously. I must say that one of the\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nmembers, when the roll was called, gave an answer that I had never \nheard before. Instead of saying yea or nay, he said ``barely yea.'' We \ngot him just over the threshold.\n\n  My hope is that as a result of the discussion on this amendment, we \nget to a point at the end of the day, or next week, that we can have a \nsimilarly strong vote that will reflect a confidence that we have all \ntogether learned, that we have protected our values, constitutionally \nspeaking, and our security, and done the best we could and will adopt \nthis with a real sense of confidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, as we have indicated, the legislation \nbefore the Senate is the product of a concerted effort by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to reflect the testimony of more than \ntwo dozen witnesses at eight hearings. It reflects the recommendations \nof other committees who gave us input into the legislation, and it \nbuilds upon the work of the 9/11 Commission. But it is important to \nknow that the 9/11 Commission did not start from scratch, either. Its \nwork takes into account nearly a half century of studies on \nintelligence reform, dating back to the Eisenhower administration. \nIndeed, the calls for reform go back 50 years. For nearly 2 years, the \n9/11 Commission conducted an investigation of unprecedented depth. They \ninterviewed more than 1,200 witnesses in 10 countries, yet we hear \nagain those who counsel: Not yet; we are going too fast; we should \nwait; we need more information; under the current threat of terrorism, \nthe time isn't right; the highly charged political atmosphere of a \nPresidential campaign creates an environment that is not right for such \nan important decision.\n  I ask, what more information do we need? If you look at the list of \nwitnesses who testified before the 9/11 Commission, before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, before the Armed Services and \nIntelligence Appropriations Committee, I would say, what point of view \nhas not been heard? What area of expertise was not explored? What more \ncompelling evidence do we need? I ask, if the time isn't right to act \nnow, when will the right time ever come? When will there be no threats? \nWhen will we be at peace?\n  The war against terrorism is likely to have to continue for many \nyears. I believe we will have failed the American people if we do not \nact on an issue that is so important to the security of our country.\n  I think the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas Kean, said it \nbest when he spoke at our very first committee hearing on July 30 of \nthe urgent need to move forward with these reforms. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       These people are planning to attack us again, and trying to \n     attack us sooner rather than later. Every delay that we have \n     in changing structures to make that less likely is a delay \n     that the American people can't tolerate.\n\n  I think he said it well. The stakes are too high. The matter before \nus is too compelling. Even as we debate this legislation, we know that \nterrorists are planning to attack our country. We know that we are at \nan increased risk of terrorist attack. We see it all around this \nCapitol at the intersections and with the increased security. How can \nwe not act? What more do we need to know?\n  If we do not act, I think we will have failed to respond to an urgent \nthreat, and we will have failed in our responsibility to do everything \nwe can to make our citizens safer.\n  Now is not the time to delay. Now is the time to move forward, and to \nmove forward with a bill that makes a difference, not a bill that \ntinkers around the edges or makes a few cosmetic changes but, rather, \nwith a bill that makes fundamental reforms to respond to deficiencies, \ninadequacies, and flaws that have been identified time and time again \nover 50 years.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have no intention of belaboring this \ntoday. I understand we are going to vote next week, on Monday at 3. I \nhope we will have an opportunity to debate this further on Monday.\n  The distinguished Senator, Ms. Collins, has said: What more do we \nneed? What other witnesses do we need to hear? Let me name some \nwitnesses who are represented by the distinguished Henry Kissinger when \nhe appeared before the Appropriations Committee. What an impressive \nbipartisan array of national security experts pleading with Congress \nnot to rush these reforms. The list is a list of stars from both sides \nof the aisle, as it were: David Boren, Bill Bradley, Frank Carlucci, \nWilliam Cohen, Robert Gates, John Hamre, Gary Hart, Sam Nunn, Warren \nRudman, George Shultz, as I have already mentioned, Henry Kissinger.\n  These men from both sides, both political parties, men who have held \npreeminent positions in this Government, Republicans and Democrats, \nappeared before the Appropriations Committee and said: Wait, don't act \nin too great a hurry. They have decades of knowledge and experience, \nand yet we stand ready to dismiss their concerns out of hand.\n  Let us not be rushed into this. I am not opposed to a national \nintelligence director. I am not opposed to that. Elections are a \nperfect time for a debate but a terrible time for decisionmaking. When \nit comes to intelligence reform, Americans should not settle for \nadjustments that are driven by the calendar instead of by common sense. \nThey deserve a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to these critical \nissues.\n  I am not saying the distinguished members of that committee were not \nthoughtful. They were. But if, as seems likely, Congress considers it \nis essential to act now on certain structural reforms, we believe it \nhas an obligation--I do--to return to this issue early next year in the \n109th Congress to address these issues more comprehensively. It would \nseem to me that--let me say again--such a list, a list of stars, as \nformer members of the Government are concerned: David Boren, Bill \nBradley, Frank Carlucci, William Cohen--so you see, we have former \nSecretaries of Defense here--Roberts Gates, John Hamre, Gary Hart, \nHenry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, Warren Rudman, and George Shultz. These \nluminaries are asking for more time. These witnesses testified before \nthe Appropriations Committee, and all of them said: Go slow; go slow.\n  Let me tell you who these people are.\n  Dr. John Hamre is the CEO at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies. The others have services and titles that speak \nfor themselves. I will not go into these. But I am simply saying we \nneed to talk some more about this next week. I hope we will ponder \ncarefully. I am not opposed to a national intelligence director, but I \nsimply say we should have more time.\n  We saw, Madam President, the unwisdom of being in a hurry when it \ncame to the invasion of Iraq. Our Government invaded. It won a short \nwar, but it had not given proper thought to what would come after, had \nnot given proper thought, it had not planned properly and carefully for \na postwar Iraq. And now look at what is happening. Look at the terrible \ncost, the terrible price this Government is paying--paying with the \nblood of the sons and daughters of our country. Think of it.\n  Let's don't be in such a big hurry. Let's take more time.\n  Madam President, I shall have more to say at a later time. I thank \nthe Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I note the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is now on the floor, and I would like him to proceed whenever \nhe wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the managers of the bill. Before \nI commence, I wonder if I might comment on the presentation of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, which I was privileged, as \nmany others were, to listen to very carefully. It was prepared in his \nusual very thorough style, magnificently delivered. I am going to take \na close look at it. I thank the Senator for his contribution to this \neffort.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Plato thanked the gods for having been born a man. He \nthanked the gods for having been born\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\na Greek. He thanked the gods for having let him live in the same age as \nSophocles. And so I thank the benign hand of destiny for allowing me to \nlive at a time and to serve at a time when the great Appropriations \nCommittee of the Senate was chaired by the very distinguished Senator \nfrom the great State that is the mother of Presidents, the State of \nVirginia, a state from which comes the first President of this country, \nthe first Commander in Chief of the Nation, George Washington.\n\n  I have always admired Senator Warner. He is a gentleman, first of \nall, and that goes a long way in this body. I thank him for his \ncomments. I thank him for his cosponsorship of this amendment, and I \nlook forward to what he has to say.\n  Right now, I should go to the Hart Building, where a woman who has \nbeen my wife for 67 years, 4 months, and 2 days, is waiting to see me. \nWe are going to have lunch together, thank the Good Lord. So if all \nSenators will allow me to leave the Chamber now, I shall go.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, not until I make the following \nobservation: First, I thank the Senator for his comments. They are \nundeserved but I appreciate them. I remember how many times on this \nfloor the Senator has recounted the importance of his wife's role in \nhis career, but the one I always remember--I have only been here a mere \n26 years as compared to my senior colleague--was during my first couple \nof years, and we were going well into the night. The Senator paused to \nsay how he used to go to night law school, and although he was a Member \nof Congress and burdened with the duties, she would come with a little \nlunch bag with a carton of milk and a sandwich to tide him over until \nhe left the Chamber, whether it was the House or the Senate, and go to \nnight law school to get his degree. I always remembered that.\n  Give her my warmest regards.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his magnificent \nencomium to my better half, a woman who has guided me and who has \nserved her country and her State so well. I thank the Senator for what \nhe has just said.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3877\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished managers of \nthis bill. I rise now for the purpose of sending an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration. I note that Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye are cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3877.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the requirements for the concurrence of the \n        National Intelligence Director in certain appointments)\n\n       On page 40, strike line 18 and all that follows through \n     page 41, line 4, and insert the following:\n       (b) Concurrence of NID in Certain Appointments Recommended \n     by Secretary of Defense.--(1) In the event of a vacancy in a \n     position referred to in paragraph (2), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall obtain the concurrence of the National \n     Intelligence Director before recommending to the President an \n     individual for nomination to fill such vacancy. If the \n     Director does not concur in the recommendation, the Secretary \n     may make the recommendation to the President without the \n     concurrence of the Director, but shall include in the \n     recommendation a statement that the Director does not concur \n     in the recommendation.\n       On page 41, line 12, strike ``Concurrence of'' and insert \n     ``Consultation With''.\n       On page 41, beginning on line 15, strike ``obtain the \n     concurrence of'' and insert ``consult with''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this amendment is for the purpose of \nbringing into realignment what I believe is the proper balance of the \nauthorities of the new NID together with the respective Cabinet \nofficers, each of whom has some portion of intelligence \nresponsibilities remaining, as well as the Director of the FBI.\n  I will read the amendment briefly so that colleagues can follow \nexactly what I am trying to do. The amendment says:\n\n       Concurrence of NID in certain appointments recommended by \n     Secretary of Defense. (1) In the event of a vacancy and a \n     position referred to in paragraph (2), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall obtain the concurrence of the National \n     Intelligence Director before recommending to the President an \n     individual for nomination to fill such vacancy. If the \n     Director does not concur in the recommendation, the Secretary \n     may make the recommendation to the President without the \n     concurrence of the Director, but shall include in the \n     recommendation a statement that the Director does not concur \n     in the recommendation.\n\n  It is just to bring into balance the fact that according to my \nresearch, each of the other departments and agencies that have an \nintelligence role get to recommend, with the concurrence of the Cabinet \nofficer or the head of the FBI. This is the one instance with regard to \nthese combat agencies where it should be brought in alignment with the \nother methodology and procedures adopted for these important personnel \nselections.\n  I draw the attention of the managers to section 117(b) of the bill \nbefore us. It gives the national intelligence director responsibility \nand authority to recommend appointments for several agencies that \nhopefully will continue to be retained within the Department of \nDefense: The National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\n  I say hopefully because we have thus far withstood the very \nsignificant amendment by the distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, \ncoauthored by the distinguished colleague from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, and \nothers. The Senate addressed that and by an overwhelming majority \nliterally rejected the taking of these three combat agencies and \nputting them under the direct jurisdiction of the NID.\n  Now, that is a concept that was hard fought, decided, and as a \nconsequence, hopefully it will remain as it is in the managers' bill.\n  The purpose of the amendment was to dislodge the managers' section \nwith regard to that. That was rejected by the Senate very resoundingly. \nI believe, therefore, it is appropriate at this time to bring into \nalignment with the other departments and agencies the authority for the \nSecretary of Defense over these three entities which remain in his \ndepartment to make the recommendation to the President with the \nconcurrence of the NID, and in those instances where there is \nnonconcurrence the President then would have the benefit of that \ndiversity of viewpoints. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  We must remind ourselves that these are combat support agencies in \nthe Department of Defense. Under the bill, as of this moment, the \nagencies remain under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Then the interesting aspect of this, which is important to my \namendment is that in the case of the NSA, this is normally a military \npromotion from two stars to three stars to take on this important \nposition of the Director of NSA, and that Director of NSA also serves \nin the position of Deputy Commander U.S. Strategic Command for \nInformation, Operations, Planning and Integration, a very critical \nwarfighting post. Consequently, these are matters that the Secretary of \nDefense, who is accountable to the President and who has direct line \nauthority from the President to the SECDEF to the combat commanders, \nthat are important to maintain.\n\n  In the case of the NRO, this is a civilian appointment, to direct the \nactivities of the National Reconnaissance Office but is an appointment \nas the Under Secretary of the Air Force. He is dual hatted, again, an \nindividual who serves not only in the important post of the \nintelligence NRO but as an Under Secretary of the Air Force in the \nDepartment of Defense. It is imperative that the Secretary of Defense \nhave the authority to make the recommendation together with the \nconcurrence of the NID.\n  In the case of the NGA, this can be a military appointment similar to \nthe NSA. One primary function of the NGA is to meet the mapping needs \nof our military forces. I repeat, the military forces are highly \ndependent upon this agency for the tactical maps that are needed \nwherever they are in the world today facing the challenges and the \nthreats to our country.\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\n  These three appointments, I say most respectfully to the managers, I \nfeel ever so strongly should be initiated by the Secretary of Defense \nwith a recommendation, and then the statute, if my amendment is \nadopted, will give the concurrence of the NID as an essential part of \nthe process.\n  Current law provides for the Secretary of Defense to recommend \nappointment of these individuals with the concurrence of the DCI. We \nhave clear evidence for many years this system has worked and worked \nwell. There are examples where the DCI nonconcurred and the Secretary \nrevised the nomination in a manner consistent with gaining the \nconcurrence of the Director of the CIA.\n  The President has said he does not want anything we do in the area of \nintelligence reform to blur the lines of authority, responsibility, and \naccountability between him and the heads of the departments. I feel my \namendment will meet that criterion as set forth by the President. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to examine the current provision, examine \nthe practice with respect to other departments and agencies in the \nGovernment, and hopefully I will gain the support of the managers as \nwell as of my colleagues and that this amendment will be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, for the national intelligence director \nto be truly accountable for the intelligence community, the director \nmust have the authority to have a real say in the selection of the \nheads of the principal agencies of the intelligence community. The 9/11 \nCommission said that the ability to hire the senior managers is one of \nthe key authorities, critical to the success of the national \nintelligence director. It is critical to the success of any leader, but \nparticularly it is important for the head of the intelligence \ncommunity. The 9/11 Commission cited the DCI's current lack of this \npower as one of the key flaws in the DCI's authorities.\n  Under the Collins-Lieberman bill, the NID will recommend to the \nPresident nominees to be the directors of the National Security Agency, \nthe National Reconnaissance Office, and the National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency--the agencies known better as NSA, NGA, and NRO. \nThe NID is required to obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of \nDefense before recommending the nominees to the President, and if the \nSecretary of Defense does not agree with the recommendations of the \nNID, the director must make that fact known to the President.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the \nmanagers of this bill each agree that these three critical agencies \nshould remain within the Department of Defense because of the dual role \nthese agencies play. For that reason, we joined forces to oppose the \namendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania that would have \nsevered the link between these agencies and the Secretary of Defense, \nthe reporting link.\n  In our bill, I believe we have taken the right approach. We have left \nthese three agencies within the Department of Defense, but we have made \nit clear that there is an important reporting responsibility to the \nnational intelligence director and that the national intelligence \ndirector will choose the individuals to lead these agencies with the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of Defense. It is actually the President's \nnomination, but the recommendations would go from the NID with the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Why did we do that? We struck that balance not only because it was \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission, and strongly recommended, but \nbecause we recognize that these three agencies do not just serve the \nDepartment of Defense; they are national intelligence assets. They \nprovide vital intelligence information throughout the intelligence \ncommunity. In fact, when Senator Lieberman and I met with the head of \nthe NSA, he told us he was on the phone far more often with the \nDirector of the CIA than he is with the Secretary of Defense.\n  These agencies provide critical information to the CIA, to the \nSecretary of State, to the Secretary of Energy, to the Secretary of the \nTreasury--to all those 15 agencies across our Government that vitally \nneed intelligence information. That is why we have the heads of these \nagencies recommended by the national intelligence director with the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of Defense.\n  I point out that if we were to adopt the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Virginia, we are essentially making no change in current \nlaw. Under current law, the Secretary of Defense recommends the \nappointment of these individuals to the President, and it is the \nDirector of Central Intelligence who concurs in the choice. So \nessentially the Senator from Virginia is simply restating current law. \nCurrent law is not adequate, and we know that that higher authority is \na key authority. If we are going to hold the national intelligence \ndirector accountable for the intelligence community, we have to give \nhim the authorities he needs to do his job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Virginia, the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee whom I so respect and \nfor whom I have such a feeling of personal affection. I probably should \nnot say this for the record, Senator Warner, but my wife probably \nwouldn't be happy to hear that I was opposing you. She has all too much \nregard for your judgment and opinions. But nonetheless, I go forward.\n  Let me put this amendment in context. In response to the 9/11 \nCommission Report, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle sent it to our \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to consider and then recommend, on the \nbasis of that report, action to the Senate--which we have done. Senator \nCollins and I and the members of the committee essentially built a \nstructure, a national intelligence director, a leader for our \nintelligence community where there is none now--what I called a \nquarterback for our intelligence team--where there is no quarterback, a \ngeneral for our intelligence service.\n  There have been two amendments put forward, in now this fifth day of \ndebate on the bill, that went at the architecture of the structure we \nhave recommended. One was by Senator Specter, which would have \ndramatically altered, gone well beyond, what we had. Senator Warner \nknows, because he was good enough to come and speak against the \namendment; it would have had the new NID in line control of all of \nthese intelligence agencies, including those that are housed and will \ncontinue to be housed in the Defense Department. That was \noverwhelmingly rejected by the Senate.\n  Yesterday, there was a different kind of assault on the structure we \nare proposing from our committee in the amendment offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina which I believe and represent would have \ncreated in name a national intelligence coordinator but given that \nperson no authority, no power. It would have been the status quo \nbecause it would have looked as if we had done something, but we would \nnot have done anything.\n  That amendment was overwhelmingly defeated.\n  I am grateful for both of those votes.\n  The amendment which the Senator from Virginia proposes, as in some \nsense the amendment the Senator from West Virginia proposed earlier \ntoday, does not knock off the structure we have proposed but alters it \nin ways that I fear--certainly cumulatively--would weaken the structure \nand not allow the national intelligence director to play the role the \n9/11 Commission and our committee wants it to play. Is it a big \ndifference? No. But one element of strengthening this position of \nnational intelligence director is to make the influence of the director \nover our national intelligence agencies--the National Security Agency, \nwhich deals with signal intelligence and communications that are heard \nin the interest of our national security, the National Reconnaissance \nOrganization, which puts satellites up in the air, and the National \nGeospatial Agency, which has all of these remarkable capacities \ntechnologically to see ground imagery and help our military and other \nintelligence services to do what they have to do to protect us.\n  Here is the point: Those are national assets. Of course, they are \nused every\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nday by the military, by the Department of Defense. The DOD is a very \nimportant customer, maybe the most active customer, but not the only \ncustomer of these assets--of signal intelligence, image intelligence, \nand human intelligence.\n  The CIA, as Senator Collins indicated, depends on these satellites \nand the other systems for important intelligence. So does the State \nDepartment. So does now the Department of Homeland Security, even the \nFBI.\n  We are trying to say that these national assets ought to report to \nthe national intelligence director, and part of that is to give the \ndirector the opportunity to start the process for nominating the heads \nof these agencies. That is a change. Now that is done. As Senator \nCollins indicated, with the Secretary of Defense, we want to make a \nslight change. The Secretary of Defense has the right to concur or \noppose. In most cases this will be worked out between the national \nintelligence director and the Secretary of Defense. Lord knows, they \nand their deputies are working out 100 decisions every day right now. \nBut if it is not worked out, the dissent will go to the President, and \nultimately the President will decide.\n  It is a only a difference. The Secretary of Defense will begin the \nprocess of who is going to head the national agency or the NID. \nUltimately, the President will decide. Why is that different under our \nbill for these three agencies as opposed to the head of a \ncounterterrorism division in the FBI, or that information analysis, \nintelligence, and for infrastructure protection division of Homeland \nSecurity? Because these three are uniquely national assets. The NSA, \nNRO, and NGA serve all of the community and they ought to be under the \ndirector of the community, and he or she ought to have the first say in \nwho fills that position.\n  That is why this is an important part of our structure, and why I \nrespectfully oppose the amendment, because it would weaken the \nstructure by pulling out a couple of the boards.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to pick up on the last point. I find there is no \neffort to change the authority of the Secretary of State in the \nselection of his people to do the work. But I feel strongly that the \nwork done by the Department of State serves the whole community. It \nisn't exclusive to the Secretary of State.\n  I bring to the Senator's attention the fact that the Department of \nState had some thoughts at variance with the Central Intelligence \nAgency as related to the aspect of the critical issues relating to the \nweapons of mass destruction. Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Through the Chair, the Senator from Virginia is \nabsolutely right. I do recall it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, they serve the whole community. And perhaps if \na caveat on some of that had been brought to the forefront in a more \nstrengthened fashion, who knows what the outcome might have been.\n  I do not believe the Senator can tell me that the person in the FBI \nwho has responsibility isn't serving the entire community. I think the \nSenator ought to go back and reexamine that representation. I do not \nfind it strengthened by making an exception for the Secretary of \nDefense as relates to these three individuals.\n  For example, I draw on my experience as Secretary of the Navy. There \nwas quite a competition when vacancies of the NRO and NSA came up. The \nservice Secretaries were invited to make nominations to the Secretary \nof Defense for the offices. In the capacity of a service Secretary, you \nget to know these individuals as they work their way up through the \nranks and are promoted. You have a special knowledge of their \ncapabilities and their strengths. You can advocate that to the \nSecretary of Defense, who then in turn makes the decision with regard \nto who should be selected to head the NRO based on the cumulative \nadvice of the several service Secretaries. Those positions are often \nrotated between the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy, and they are \nextremely important assignments.\n  With all due respect to the NID, he has so much to be done that he \ncannot possibly have the knowledge about the achievements of all of the \nvarious individuals to make a recommendation. He can, of course, come \nin after study and concur or not. But you are holding the Secretary of \nDefense saying you have all the responsibility with regard to this \nagency. In many respects personnelwise, you are reducing the Secretary \nof Defense to a payroll clerk when you do not allow him to make the \nselections of the people he thinks are best qualified. In the case of \nthe NRO, he serves as an under secretary of the Air Force with duties \nrelated to the NRO and duties related to the entire space program in \nthe Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of Defense should make \nthe appointment of the people who serve his Department.\n  I cannot accept the Senator's distinction about how you leave the \nState of Department alone, the FBI alone, the Energy Department alone, \nlet those Secretaries make their recommendation and decisions with \nregard to personnel, and then in almost a demeaning way say to the \nSecretary of Defense, Oh, no, when it comes to your people, you have \nthe right to concur or not.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may briefly respond to the Senator \nfrom Virginia, the case cited of the INR, the intelligence division at \nthe State Department, is an interesting one. They came to a different \nopinion than some other constituent agencies of the American \nintelligence community with regard to, for instance, prewar WMD in \nIraq. But that was a matter of analysis primarily, not collection. They \nlooked at the data. Incidentally, some of the data they looked at were \ndata they got from these three agencies. These are the three largest \ncollection agencies and they are unique in that they serve the whole \ncommunity.\n\n  There is certainly no intention to diminish the Secretary of Defense. \nThe Secretary of Defense has a very powerful position and Senator \nCollins and I want to have the Secretary remain that powerful. We had \nvery interesting testimony before our committee by a witness who said--\nhe had been in the Department of Defense and stepped out to work with a \nthink tank where he watches all of this--over the years when there were \nconflicts or disagreements between the Secretary of Defense and the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense always wins \nbecause the Secretary of Defense has so much muscle. And that is the \nreality.\n  We are not trying to undercut the authority of the Secretary of \nDefense, and we are certainly not trying to alter the chain of command, \nbut we are trying to give a little more authority to the national \nintelligence director so that director can really be in charge. One \nsmall piece of that is saying, Mr. Intelligence Director, you can, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense, make the suggestion for who \nought to head these three agencies which, unlike any other intelligence \nagency within our Government, serve the entire community.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense, as I said before, is an important customer \nof what these three agencies produce--``user'' may be a better term \nthan customer.\n  It was of great interest when General Hayden, head of the NSA, said \nhe spends more time on the phone with the Director of the CIA than with \nthe Secretary of Defense. We want to reflect that in this small \nmovement of authority.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is obvious the managers at the moment \nare somewhat entrenched in their views. I hope we will have an \nopportunity to appeal to the broader and hopefully more open minds of \nthe collective Senate as a whole.\n  Could the managers advise those Members who have deferred other \nplans, with the importance of being here today to advocate amendments, \nwhat will be the procedure when this will be laid aside? There will be \na record when we return Monday. I presume it would be scheduled in some \norder, at the discretion of the managers, together with the leaders of \nthe Senate, as to the vote.\n  Do I get 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes at the time the amendment is \nbrought up? I would like to weigh in a little bit now given that I have \nnot thus far persuaded my two distinguished colleagues, both members of\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\nthe Armed Services Committee, who are interfering, in my judgment, with \nthe direct chain of command between the President and his combatant \ncommanders and principal civilian appointees.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to respond to the question raised by the \nSenator from Virginia, it is the leader's intention to convene perhaps \nat 10 or 11 o'clock on Monday morning, allow for some further debate, \nand then stack votes beginning at 3 p.m. There will be 2 minutes \nequally divided before each vote, but knowing of the Senator's desire \nto have further debate on Monday, we are going to convene early enough \non Monday to allow that to occur. We expect a great many stacked votes \nto begin at approximately 3 o'clock Monday. Thus, we are not going to \nhave time for extensive debate between those votes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I shall certainly be \nhere. As a matter of fact, I will preside for a period of time. Maybe \nwhen I get in the chair and have the gavel, I can do something about \nthis amendment.\n  In any event, I am appreciative of the courtesies that have been \nextended to Members of the Senate deliberating on this bill. This is an \nimportant matter.\n  Hopefully, in the interim, I can persuade not only the Senate but the \nWhite House to indicate its position on this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleagues. I will be \navailable for further amendments as the managers decide to have them \nscheduled during the course of the day.\n  This amendment will now be laid aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask that the amendment be laid aside. The Senator from \nVermont is next. I wonder if the Senator could withhold for a couple of \nmoments to allow consultation among the three of us before he sends up \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. The distinguished chairman and ranking Member \nhave always been very courteous. I know, having managed a lot of bills, \nhow it is. It is a reasonable request.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3945\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask it be in order for me to send to the \ndesk an amendment on behalf of myself and Mr. Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand there may be a question regarding my \namendment. While this is being worked on by counsel, let me proceed to \ndiscuss it and we can go back to the amendment if there is no \nobjection.\n  Mr. President, three years after thousands of Americans were killed \nin the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, there have been some \ntroubling doubts about the effectiveness of a major investigative tool \nin our antiterrorism arsenal.\n  On Monday, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of \nJustice released an unclassified version of its audit of the FBI's \nForeign Language Program and the Translation of Counterterrorism and \nCounterintelligence Foreign Language Material. The results were \nunsettling. They deserve our immediate attention and action.\n  The report shows that despite concerns expressed for years by those \nin Congress and by former FBI contractors, among others, and despite an \ninflux of tens of millions of dollars Congress has appropriated in a \nbipartisan effort to hire new linguists, the FBI foreign language \ntranslation unit is saddled with problems across the board, including \ngrowing backlogs, systemic difficulties, security problems, too few \nqualified staff, and an astounding lack of organization. It is almost \nas though the Department of Justice does not take this question of \ntranslation seriously.\n  The question the Department of Justice must be asked is: What is the \nuse of taping thousands of hours of conversations of intelligence \ntargets in foreign languages if, after we have taped it all, we cannot \ntranslate it promptly, securely, accurately, and efficiently? The \ntranslation mess at the Department of Justice is a chronic problem that \nhas obvious and severe implications for our national security. We all \nwant America to be secure, Republicans and Democrats alike. But the \nadministration has shirked its responsibility to resolve these \nproblems. It has dodged its own accountability to the public and to \nCongress for this enormous failure. I believe the administration owes \nCongress and the American public an explanation as to why it has \nrepeatedly failed to take the necessary steps to fix these serious \nintelligence failings. We need to know, once and for all--and sooner \nrather than later--what steps will be taken to get this job done.\n\n  Now, to expedite this process, I will offer the Translator Reports \nAct of 2004. I am proud to be joined in this effort by Senator \nGrassley, my friend from Iowa. He has been ever-vigilant on FBI \noversight issues, whether it has been a Democratic administration or a \nRepublican administration. Our act clarifies and expands upon an \nimportant reporting requirement currently in law that has yet to be \nimplemented by the Department of Justice.\n  The Attorney General is required by law--by law--to report to the \nSenate and House Judiciary Committees about the number of translators \nemployed by the FBI; the legal and practical impediments to using \ntranslators employed by other Federal, State, or local agencies, on a \nfull, part-time, or shared basis; and the needs of the FBI for specific \ntranslation services in certain languages and recommendations for \nmeeting those needs. We saw this as such a high priority that we \nincluded this requirement in law. The President signed it into law.\n  You would think if anybody is going to follow the law, it would be \nthe Attorney General. To date, he has not. He has not made the report \nrequired by this law. Now, maybe he needs another deadline. We thought \nit was pretty clear already. The President thought it was pretty clear. \nRepublicans and Democrats thought it was pretty clear. But this \namendment provides an ironclad deadline.\n  I believe we have to prod the Department of Justice to get this \ninformation on a timely basis. It is somewhat like pulling teeth. This \namendment is the extraction tool for the teeth of the foreign \ntranslation program. It fills the gap in current law by legally \nrequiring the Attorney General to report ``not later than 30 days after \nthe date of enactment'' and ``annually thereafter.''\n  The bill also expands that reporting requirement in several critical \nways and in direct response to the Office of Inspector General's Audit. \nThis is in keeping with the 9/11 Commission's directive that Congress \nexercise greater oversight over the counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism needs of the executive branch. In its report, the 9/11 \nCommission noted that, ``Even as the FBI has increased its language \nservices cadre, the demand for translation services has also greatly \nincreased. Thus, the FBI must not only continue to bring on board more \nlinguists, it must also continue to take advantage of technology and \nbest practices to prioritize its workflow, enhance its capabilities and \nensure compliance with its quality control program.''\n  Well, I could not agree more.\n  The FBI in the past has drawn a distinction between contract \nlinguists and full-time employees when discussing hiring issues. But \nfor the purpose of getting the job done, this is a distinction without \na difference. We in Congress want to know the status of hiring overall \nbecause it is the entire picture that we are concerned with. The \namendment makes clear that the Department of Justice must report on \nlinguists employed by and contracted for by the FBI.\n  Our amendment adds further reporting requirements that will be \ncrucial to understanding whether or not the FBI is capable of fixing, \nand has fixed, the problems outlined by the Inspector General.\n  If enacted into law, the Attorney General will have to provide \nCongress with current information regarding: (1) the status of any \nautomated statistical reporting system so that we can ensure\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nthe FBI is monitoring workflow properly; (2) the storage capabilities \nof the digital collection system or systems utilized so that important \ndata is not lost for technological reasons; (3) a description of the \nFBI's establishment and compliance with audio retention policies that \nsatisfy the investigative and intelligence goals of the FBI; (4) a \ndescription of the implementation of quality control procedures and \nmechanisms for monitoring compliance with quality control procedures; \nand (5) the current counterterrorism and counterintelligence audio \nbacklog and recommendations for alleviating any such backlog.\n\n  These reporting requirements are in addition to what is currently \nrequired: hiring numbers and recommendations regarding the FBI's future \nneeds and the viability of using translators from other agencies and \nsources. This more detailed information will give Congress a better \nview and ultimately greater insight into how the FBI is handling this \ncritical investigative tool. With FISA wiretaps at an annual figure of \nmore than 1,700, the FBI has a lot of catching up to do. And so does \nCongress in its oversight of this translation program. With this \namendment, the information we will need to most effectively employ this \nimportant investigative tool will be at our fingertips.\n  We know our intelligence services have the ability to pick up \nconversations throughout the world. But you have to translate what you \npick up. On September 10, according to press reports, the \nAdministration picked up a very clear warning that we were going to be \nhit on September 11. They did not translate the warning until sometime \nafter September 11. This is like being warned that a bomb is going off \nin 5 minutes, and responding that we will translate and look at that \nwarning in 5 months.\n  For my security and the security of all of us, I want our law \nenforcement and intelligence services to know immediately. As a former \nprosecutor, I know that if you are using a wiretap or an intercept, it \nis valuable if you have the information immediately, especially if they \nare talking about a terrible act or a crime that is going to take place \nvery soon. It does you very little good to finally look at it long \nafter the fact. The only reason we do these intercepts, the only reason \nwe do these wiretaps, the only reason we do this electronic information \ngathering is so we will know where we are.\n  Mr. President, I understand my amendment is at the desk and I request \nit be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3945.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require Congressional oversight of translators employed \n       and contracted for by the Federal Bureau of Investigation)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF FBI USE OF TRANSLATORS.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney General of the \n     United States shall submit a report to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of \n     the House of Representatives, that contains, with respect to \n     each preceding 12-month period--\n       (1) the number of translators employed, or contracted for, \n     by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other components of \n     the Department of Justice;\n       (2) any legal or practical impediments to using translators \n     employed by the Federal, State, or local agencies on a full-\n     time, part-time, or shared basis;\n       (3) the needs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for \n     the specific translation services in certain languages, and \n     recommendations for meeting those needs;\n       (4) the status of any automated statistical reporting \n     system, including implementation and future viability;\n       (5) the storage capabilities of the digital collection \n     system or systems utilized;\n       (6) a description of the establishment and compliance with \n     audio retention policies that satisfy the investigative and \n     intelligence goals of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; \n     and\n       (7) a description of the implementation of quality control \n     procedures and mechanisms for monitoring compliance with \n     quality control procedures.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and the distinguished ranking member of the committee want to \nlook at this amendment. Because I am suppose to be at several places, I \nam not shackled to my desk on the floor as they are. I did want to get \nthe amendment offered. I thank them for their courtesy in giving me \ntime to do so. I urge the Senate to support this important oversight \nand reporting amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Vermont \nbringing his amendment forward. We are going to discuss it further with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid \naside temporarily and that the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized \nto offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is laid aside.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3908\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to award \n grants to public transportation agencies to improve security, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3908.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Corzine, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3908.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, September 30, \n2004, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with Senators \nSarbanes, Schumer, Boxer, and Corzine.\n  This amendment is, in essence, the text of S. 2453, which the Banking \nCommittee reported out unanimously on May 6 and placed on the calendar \non May 20.\n  Since that time, we have sought to pass the bill along with the \nCommerce Committee's similar rail security bill by unanimous consent, \nbut an objection has, to date, blocked the Senate from passing this \nbipartisan transit security legislation. Therefore, I rise with my \ncolleagues today to continue this effort to improve the security and \nsafety of our transit systems in the United States which on a daily \nbasis transport 14 million Americans.\n  Our amendment is straightforward and meets the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendation on page 391 for improved transportation security, which \nstates in part:\n\n       The U.S. government should identify and evaluate the \n     transportation assets that need to be protected, set risk-\n     based priorities for defending them, select the most \n     practical and cost-effective ways of doing so, and then \n     develop a plan, budget, and funding to implement the effort. \n     The plan should assign roles and missions to the relevant \n     authorities (federal, state, regional, and local) and to \n     private stakeholders. In measuring effectiveness, perfection \n     is unattainable. But terrorists should perceive that \n     potential targets are defended. They may be deterred by a \n     significant chance of failure.\n\n  In essence, the 9/11 Commission has called for three steps: first, \nclear responsibility; second, risk-based policies; and third, resources \nto meet these threats. Our amendment corresponds to these \nrecommendations by the Commission.\n  First, our amendment would require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to clearly accept responsibility for transit security by \nsigning a memorandum of understanding with the Federal Transit \nAdministration. Unfortunately, this is something that the Department of \nHomeland Security has failed to do, even after numerous Senate \ninquiries and the passage of a Senate amendment requiring it to do so.\n  Second, our amendment embodies the kind of risk-based priorities that \nthe Commission recommended by requiring the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to review the security assessments conducted by the Federal \nTransit Administration. DHS would then use these risk-based assessments \nas the basis for\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nallocating any funds. The Department would also have to annually update \nthese assessments.\n\n  Third, our amendment would authorize real resources over 3 years that \nare still a fraction of our investment in aviation security for a wide \nvariety of known capital and operating security needs, including \nsurveillance technologies, tunnel protection, chemical, biological, \nradiological, and explosive detection systems, perimeter protection, \ntraining, and other security improvements approved by the Department.\n  In sum, our amendment is not overly prescriptive and relies on the \nwisdom of the Nation's intelligence systems and the Department of \nHomeland Security to identify the threats, develop solid plans, and \ninvest in those initiatives which will do the most to make our transit \nsystems more secure.\n  Fourteen million Americans each day rely on transit systems. We only \nhave to recall the horrible and tragic incident in Spain a few months \nago to understand that these individuals are the potential targets for \nterrorist acts. It is incumbent upon us to take these steps today to \nprotect the transit systems for the people of America as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the very able \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, for offering this amendment. I am \npleased to join with him as a cosponsor.\n  Senator Reed has played a leading role in the Congress on the issue \nof transit security. In fact, in the last Congress he held a series of \nhearings on transit issues, and a good deal of the focus of those \nhearings was on the transit security challenges we face.\n  This is a vitally important amendment needed to better protect the \nAmerican people. I observe to my colleagues that throughout the world, \npublic transportation systems have been a target of terrorist attacks. \nA terrorist attack against a passenger train in Madrid, attacks against \ntransit systems in both Moscow and South Korea demonstrate that transit \nand rail systems are a target of terrorists worldwide.\n  Despite the significant threat which obviously exists to transit and \nrail systems, security funding has been grossly inadequate. As a \nresult, our Nation's transit and rail systems have been unable to \nimplement necessary security improvements, in many instances even those \nthat have been identified as necessary by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  To take one example, Washington Metro's greatest security need at the \nmoment is a backup operations control center. This need was identified \nby the Federal Transit Administration in its initial security \nassessment, and then identified again by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in its subsequent security assessment. Regrettably, this \ncritical need remains unaddressed because of a lack of funding.\n  Last March, I, along with Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Allen, wrote \nto Secretary Ridge urging funding for this and other critical needs \nsuch as chemical detection and decontamination systems, but the money \nis not there and the needs remain.\n  In May of this year, the Banking Committee undertook to address these \nissues on a national basis. My colleague from Rhode Island played an \ninstrumental role in considering this issue in the committee. The \ncommittee, on a bipartisan basis, with a unanimous vote, passed the \nPublic Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act. Regrettably, we have \nnot yet been able to move that legislation forward on the Senate floor. \nThis amendment tracks many of the provisions of that legislation. It \naddresses the need for increased transit security by providing for \ngrants along the lines of the bill that was reported out of the \ncommittee.\n\n  I note in that regard that Banking Committee Chairman Shelby took a \nkeen interest in this issue and we appreciate his recognition of the \nneed to increase transit security and his support for the legislation \nthat was brought from the committee.\n  I might note that the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee recently took action with respect to transit security that is \nsimilar to what is proposed in this amendment.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Reed and I requested the GAO to conduct \na study of the security needs of transit systems. In its report the GAO \nfound that, in analyzing the needs of eight transit systems, that they \nrequired $711 million for security purposes just for those eight \nsystems. There are 6,000 public transit agencies throughout our Nation. \nThe need is very great. The challenge is very real.\n  We know that transit and rail systems are serious potential targets \nfor terrorist attacks. We obviously know the vital role that these \nsystems play in our Nation's economic and security infrastructure. We \nmust address the vulnerabilities that have already been identified in \nsecurity assessments which have already been conducted.\n  The funding to do this is just not there. We need to harden tunnels, \nto provide detection teams, to train frontline employees, to update \ninfrastructure so that a transit system can continue to function even \nif attacked. The list of security needs goes on and on and on.\n  I strongly commend to my colleagues the amendment that my able \ncolleague from Rhode Island has put forward. I am pleased to join with \nhim as a cosponsor. I urge support of the amendment. This is a very \nreal need, with very important implications for our national security \nand for the functioning of our economy. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is my understanding, based on the \ntentative schedule that we worked out last night, that Senator Levin is \nto be recognized next to offer amendments, followed by Senator Roberts, \nfollowed by Senator Stevens, followed by Senator Kyl. I see the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is here to make a comment. My concern is how that \nfits in with the amendment schedule worked out last night.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield to Senators for their \namendments.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment raises several questions. It has \nvery worthy goals. We have previously adopted a McCain-Lieberman \namendment dealing with some of the same issues. We need to have a \ndiscussion with the sponsors of the amendment, Senators Reed and \nSarbanes and others, to see how their amendment interacts with the \nlegislation previously adopted, the McCain-Lieberman amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may speak on the amendment \nbriefly, I thank the Senators from Rhode Island and Maryland for coming \nforward with the amendment. It certainly speaks directly to a critical \nnational homeland security need. I want to take a little time to look \nat it and see how it fits into the overall picture with regard to the \nbill. I know this was reported out unanimously from the relevant \ncommittee. It has been held up perhaps only by one Senator as a result \nof an objection.\n  I don't want to have the underlying bill, which is so urgently \nneeded, get caught in that kind of situation. But I would like to work \nwith the sponsors of the amendment and perhaps with whoever is \nobjecting to see if we can't find a way to put these together. This \nspeaks to a real national need. It is consistent with other amendments \nthat have been adopted on the underlying bill or were part of the bill \ninitially and, of course, consistent with vulnerabilities that the 9/11 \nCommission spoke to.\n  I thank the sponsors and I look forward to working with them to see \nif we can work it out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                       Justifying the War in Iraq\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in watching the Presidential debate last \nnight, again, I think President Bush confused who attacked the United\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\nStates on September 11. President Bush, last night, in justifying the \nwar with Iraq, said they attacked us. Senator Kerry was quick to point \nout that Iraq did not attack us. It was al-Qaida, led by Osama bin \nLaden, that attacked us. This basic fact is absolutely essential to \nunderstanding what occurred and where we are headed.\n  I think it is helpful, perhaps, to review the record. Here is the \nreport of the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       The intelligence reports describe friendly contacts and \n     indicate some common themes in both side's hatred of the \n     United States [referring to Iraq and al-Qaida], but to date \n     we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts \n     ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship. \n     Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated \n     with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any attacks \n     against the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, it is not just the 9/11 Commission that tells us these \nbasic relationships; it is also our own Intelligence Committee. Their \nconclusions in their July 7 report included conclusion 96:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency's assessment that to date \n     there was no evidence providing Iraqi complicity or \n     assistance in an al-Qaida attack was reasonable and \n     objective. No additional information has emerged to suggest \n     otherwise.\n\n  Conclusion 93:\n\n       The Central Intelligence Agency reasonably assessed that \n     there were likely several instances of contacts between Iraq \n     and al-Qaida throughout the 1990s, but that these contacts \n     did not add up to an established, formal relationship.\n\n  Mr. President, one month after the dreadful September 11 attack, the \nState Department had on their Web site a list of countries where al-\nQaida has operated. This is a month after the September 11 attack. If \nyou look down this list--Bahrain, Bangladesh, France, Germany, Iran, \nand others--there is no mention of Iraq.\n  The Secretary of State has said as recently as September 13, just \nlast month, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' that he had seen \nnothing that makes a direct connection between Saddam Hussein and his \nawful regime and what happened on 9/11.\n  The President himself has previously said, on September 18 of last \nyear, that he saw no evidence of Hussein being tied to 9/11. Yet over \nand over, the Vice President and the President have left an impression \nwith the American people that somehow Iraq was behind the attacks of \nSeptember 11. It was not. Al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, was behind \nthe attacks of September 11. Those are the folks we need to hold to \naccount. They are the ones we need to bring to justice. That is not for \na moment to say that Saddam Hussein didn't run a dreadful regime. He \ndid. I think the world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. \nThe question is, What were the priorities of the United States in \nresponding to those horrific attacks on our country?\n  My belief at the time we were preparing to go to war with Iraq was \nthat it was a diversion from our attention in going after al-Qaida, led \nby Osama bin Laden. My own strong belief at the time was that ought to \nhave been our top priority and focus.\n  I graduated from an American Air Force base in Tripoli, Libya, in \nNorth Africa. I lived in the Arab world. I learned something about the \nArab world in living there. It is very clear to me that we have to be \nvery focused in going after those who attacked us. If we are going to \nbe successful against the terrorists, we have to go after the people \nwho attacked us. We have to go after those who are planning to attack \nus again. We cannot go off and go after every bad regime in the world. \nThat will swamp our ability to respond.\n\n  There has been some suggestion that Saddam Hussein was going to arm \nterrorists. Go back to what the intelligence told us, November 16, \n2003:\n\n       The CIA's search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \n     has found no evidence that former President Saddam Hussein \n     tried to transfer chemical or biological technology or \n     weapons to terrorists, according to a military intelligence \n     expert.\n\n  Mr. President, what happened was that our focus on getting those who \nattacked us was diverted by launching the attack on Iraq. This is from \nUSA Today, March 29, this year:\n\n       In 2002, troops from the 5th special forces group, who \n     specialize in the Middle East, were pulled out of the hunt \n     for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish cultures.\n\n  Mr. President, what sense does this make? We took people who were \nexperts in the culture of those who attacked us and we took them out of \nthe hunt for Osama bin Laden and shifted them over to Iraq in the hunt \nfor Saddam Hussein. And we replaced them with experts in Spanish \nculture. No wonder, over a thousand days after the attacks of September \n11, we still have not held to account Osama bin Laden, his top \nassistant, and the rest of their criminal group.\n  This story says:\n\n       The CIA, meanwhile, was stretched badly in its capacity to \n     collect, translate, and analyze information coming from \n     Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it \n     took specialists away from the Afghanistan effort to ensure \n     Iraq was covered.\n\n  I believe history is going to prove that was a serious mistake. \nAgain, Iraq did not attack us; al-Qaida, led by Osama bin Laden, \nattacked us. They are the ones we need to hunt down as our top \npriority.\n  Last year, in The Philadelphia Inquirer, this story ran, saying:\n\n       Some senior officials concede that the Iraq war also \n     diverted resources from two problems that could prove to be \n     even more pressing than Iraq was: rooting out the remnants of \n     Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorism network and confronting \n     Iran. A senior intelligence official, who spoke on condition \n     of anonymity, said the CIA reassigned to Iraq more than half \n     the operatives tracking al-Qaida fugitives in Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan. As a result, he said, U.S. forces were not able to \n     pursue bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders as aggressively.\n\n  This is a case of misplaced priorities by this administration. Our \ntop priority should have been nailing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. \nInstead, this President and this administration diverted resources from \nthat hunt and shifted them to Iraq. Again, as dreadful a regime as Iraq \nhad, they were not the ones who attacked us. Al-Qaida did.\n  This goes on to say:\n\n       Al-Qaida's continuing threat was shown when the Department \n     of Homeland Security raised its terrorism alert level \n     Tuesday, after bombings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco.\n\n  This is what the President said right after the attacks of September \n11, on September 15:\n\n       There is no question about it, this act will not stand; we \n     will find those who did it. We will smoke them out of their \n     holes; we will get them running and we will bring them to \n     justice.\n\n  I agree, absolutely, with the President's statement. He had the \npriority right at the time. Then something happened. I don't know why. \nI have never been able to decipher why the President's focus shifted. \nHere is what he said on March 13, 2002:\n\n       You know, I just don't spend that much time on him [Osama \n     bin Laden] . . . I don't know where he is . . . I truly am \n     not that concerned about him.\n\n  How can he not be that concerned about the man who was the architect \nof these attacks on the United States? How can that be? How can our \nPresident not be that concerned about Osama bin Laden, who is out there \nplotting, even now, to launch even more attacks on the United States?\n  The former Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, James \nWebb, made these comments this year in a USAToday op-ed piece:\n\n       Bush arguably has committed the greatest strategic blunder \n     in modern memory. To put it bluntly, he attacked the wrong \n     target. . . . Our military is being forced to trade away its \n     maneuverability in the wider war against terrorism while \n     being placed on the defensive in a single country that never \n     will fully accept its presence.\n\n  That is the conclusion of the Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan \nadministration, that this President attacked the wrong target. Instead \nof focusing on al-Qaida, he launched a preemptive attack on Iraq.\n  Mr. Webb, in that same opinion piece, said this:\n\n       There is no historical precedent for taking such action \n     when our country was not being directly threatened. The \n     reckless course that Bush and his advisers have set will \n     affect the economic and military energy of our Nation for \n     decades.\n\n  This is the man who ought to be our top priority. This is the man who \norganized the September 11 attacks against the United States. This is \nthe man who is plotting even now to attack the United States again. \nThis is Osama bin Laden. It is not Saddam Hussein. We cannot get \nconfused about who the primary threat is to the United States of \nAmerica. The top threat, the top priority for our military and \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\nservices has to be to bring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida to justice. \nThey are the ones who attacked us. They are the ones plotting to attack \nus again.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly am happy to be here today and \nthat I was--I do not know if happy is the right word--able to hear the \nSenator from North Dakota, who did such a good job. Not only is he \narticulate in his views, but he always has facts and figures to back \nthem up.\n  We have come to know Senator Conrad as someone in the Senate who \nknows the numbers better than anyone else. In addition to that, he \nobviously is aware of other issues going on, such as his presentation \ntoday, which is a presentation I heard developed previously. I want the \nSenator to know how much I appreciate his very clear and concise \nstatement. I appreciate it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3849\n\n(Purpose: To protect human health and the environment from the release \n             of hazardous substances by acts of terrorism)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Corzine, I ask that the \npending amendment be set aside, and I call up the Corzine amendment No. \n3849.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Corzine, for \n     himself and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3849.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, September 30, \n2004, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3782 and 3905\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lautenberg, I call up \namendment Nos. 3782 and 3905 to be considered at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes amendments numbered 3782 and 3905, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3782) is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require that any Federal funds appropriated to the \n   Department of Homeland Security for grants or other assistance be \nallocated based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL HOMELAND SECURITY ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Any Federal funds appropriated to the Department of \n     Homeland Security for grants or other assistance shall be \n     allocated based strictly on an assessment of risks and \n     vulnerabilities.\n\n  (The amendment (No. 3905) is printed in the Record of Thursday, \nSeptember 30, 2004, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3821\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendments be set \naside, and I call to the Senate's attention amendment No. 3821 offered \non behalf of Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3821.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the functions of the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n                Oversight Board, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 158, line 9, strike the period and insert ``, \n     including information regarding privacy and civil liberties \n     violations, which are made by departments, agencies, or \n     elements of the executive branch, of regulations, policies, \n     or guidelines concerning information sharing and information \n     collection; and''.\n       On page 158, between lines 9 and 10 insert the following:\n       (C) the minority views on any findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations of the Board resulting from its advice and \n     oversight functions under subsection (d).\n       On page 160, line 6, insert ``and the National Intelligence \n     Director and committees of Congress described under \n     subsection (e)(1)(B)(i)(I),'' after ``concerned''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, I recognize his \namendment would do three things. It first requires the privacy and \ncivil liberties board established by this bill to include as part of \nits findings any privacy or civil liberties violations made by the \nintelligence community or other elements of the executive branch in its \nsemiannual reports to Congress.\n  Second, it allows minority conclusions or recommendations to be sent \nto Congress.\n  Finally, the amendment would require the board to report an agency's \nfailure to cooperate with its requests for information or assistance to \nthe national intelligence director and appropriate committees of \nCongress.\n  This amendment strengthens the credibility of the board and improves \nthe board's ability to get the information it needs in the conduct of \nits duties.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do want to indicate that we have \nseveral other Senators who told us they would be coming over to the \nfloor today to offer amendments: Senator Levin, Senator Roberts, \nSenator Kyl, and Senator Stevens. I urge them to come over as soon as \nis possible. We are open for business, and there is time available. The \nsooner the debates occur, the sooner we will be able to set these \nmatters for votes on Monday.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3807\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In the meantime, Mr. President, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to say a word about amendment No. 3807 which Senator \nMcCain and I offered yesterday. This is another of the elements of the \n9/11 Commission report that was part of legislation Senator McCain and \nI introduced the day after Labor Day as a way to guarantee that all \nelements of the 9/11 report would be before the Senate.\n  This one has to do with effective screening to keep terrorists out of \nAmerica and away from vital infrastructure in America. It is a comment \non the age in which we live, something we have taken for granted in \nAmerica but has been a great asset of ours, and that is the size of our \ncountry, the size of our borders, and the welcome mat we generally have \nput out for people visiting our country.\n  That openness has been exploited--it certainly was prior to the \nattacks of September 11--exploited by those who, as someone else has \nsaid, hate us more than they love their own lives. They come in here \nand are prepared to blow themselves up to kill Americans. That demands \nthat we not try to put a wall around America--we can never do that--but \nthat we be aggressive and smart about raising our guard and requiring \nsome standards of personal identification from people coming into \nAmerica, something we have not required before.\n  We can do that without compromising unduly, unnecessarily, the \nopenness of our country and the welcome we put out to both those who \nwant to emigrate here and those who just plain want to visit.\n  The amendment Senator McCain and I offered has several parts to it. \nOne is to simply help us obtain better information about the way in \nwhich terrorists move around, the way in which they intend to exploit \nour transportation systems, our existing laws, to do damage to us and \nour people. We want to better screen for terrorists in foreign \ncountries long before they can reach our borders. We want to better \ntrain border personnel. We want to use the most sophisticated computer \nimaging equipment to detect fraudulent travel documents. We want to \nbetter screen at the borders and at points of access, as I say, to \ncritical infrastructure, transportation particularly, and we want to do \nmore to protect against\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\nidentity fraud and identity theft because so often these terrorists \nwill assume new identities as a way to gain access to the country and \naccess to places where they can inflict damage on us.\n  What it means to defend America has changed. In a different age, the \nage of serious conflict, it meant having the strongest military we \ncould, having the most sophisticated weapons we could, to deter enemy \nattack, to be prepared to go to the battlefield, to deploy our forces \nto meet the enemy and defeat the enemy. Today, it involves homeland \nsecurity in a way it never has before in our history, and this \namendment would enable us to raise our homeland security in the best \nway possible.\n  In its analysis of the events leading up to September 11, 2001, the \n9/11 Commission concluded that the terrorists are as reliant on travel \ndocuments as they ultimately are on weapons. To succeed, they have to \ntravel clandestinely to meet, train, plan, case targets, look at \ntargets, and gain access to sites they want to attack. They rely on \nnetworks of people to facilitate their travel, people they place within \nthis country. Commonly, their travel documents have been tampered with.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that as many as 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers \ncould have been intercepted at the borders. Two of them actually \nentered the United States even though they were known as terrorists by \nat least one agency in the intelligence community of the United States. \nThey were on a terrorist watch list. They had been heard at a meeting \nin Kuala Lumpur, kind of a world conference of terrorists, al-Qaida \nlargely, where we now believe the attacks of 9/11 were planned. Two of \nthem met that standard.\n  The point is we have to address the multiple opportunities to \nidentify and stop the terrorists at every point along their travel \nroutes long before they reach our entry points, at our border \ncrossings. Once inside the country, we have to find ways to detect \nthem.\n  The first thing this amendment does is seek to improve our \nintelligence about how terrorists travel. Before 9/11 and even today, \nthere is no agency within the Federal Government that has the \nresponsibility to consider this question. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity, therefore, would be directed by the amendment to work with \nthe appropriate intelligence and law enforcement agencies in a \ncoordinated effort to detect methods and patterns of travel, such as \nthe use of specific routes. They would look for those who assist \nterrorists, be they human smugglers or corrupt government officials.\n\n  There is information--and I can describe it because it was mentioned \nin a newspaper; I saw it in the Washington Times earlier this week--\nabout terrorist elements, al-Qaida working with certain gangs, drug \ngroups, who customarily smuggle people across our southern border to \nwork with them to smuggle in terrorists. We cannot sit back and let \nthat happen.\n  This amendment would also expand screening for terrorists long before \nthey reach our borders. Federal agencies would be required to develop a \nplan for working with foreign countries to share information on \nterrorists and increase inspection at foreign airports, not just U.S. \nairports. The amendment would increase investment in new technologies \nthat can detect false travel documents or those with certain indicators \nthat are consistent with terrorist use based on patterns of what we \nknow now, and would require both the Department of Homeland Security \nand the State Department to provide training about terrorist travel to \nour front-line border officials so they may better spot forged \npassports or other subtle clues that warrant further scrutiny.\n  The best available technology should also be provided to our \nembassies and consulates to detect doctored passports or other forms of \nfalse identification before the applicant is issued a visa, set up a \nkind of technological wall of identification, most specifically at \nvisa-granting points around the world for visas to come to the United \nStates. To improve screening at our borders, the 9/11 Commission \nrecognized the need for a robust entry and exit system based on the use \nof biometric information. A system of this sort has been under \ndevelopment for over a year now, but it needs to be improved and \naccelerated. Our amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security \nto do just that.\n  The 9/11 Commission also recommended that we close the gaping hole in \nour border security created by policies allowing easy passage into the \nUnited States from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean; logical enough in \nyears past, the natural neighborly tendency of the United States of \nAmerica and Americans generally, but unfortunately it is a policy of \nopenness that has been exploited and continues to be exploited by the \nterrorists.\n  Our lenient border policies with our neighbors to the north and south \ntoday constitute a vulnerability. Travelers may now cross these borders \nwith no other proof of U.S. citizenship than a verbal statement. \nIndividuals claiming to be Canadians enter our country from Canada \nwithout showing a passport. The policies are evidence of our good \nrelations with our neighbors, but in the age of terrorism, that \nfriendship must allow for better security for the benefit of both.\n  Our amendment would require biometric passports, or an identification \ndocument just as secure, for everyone crossing into the United States, \neven U.S. citizens and our closest neighbors.\n  As we make our borders more secure, we must not forsake the \nprinciples of openness and freedom that define us as a nation. This \namendment therefore requires that the Department of Homeland Security \nconsolidate and improve a registered travel program that allows \npreviously screened and trusted travelers to go quickly across our \nborders so that officials may focus on those who might do us harm.\n  Finally, this amendment improves the way we issue key identification \ndocuments, such as driver's licenses, birth certificates, or personal \nidentification cards that may be required before boarding a commercial \nairliner or requested by a law enforcement officer who has grounds to \nbe suspicious. It would require minimum security standards for these \ndocuments and directs the Federal Government to work with the States to \nestablish minimum standards for both the security features embedded in \nthese documents and for the way in which the documents are issued.\n  By the way, a similar program is already in effect for issuing \ncommercial driver's licenses. In this regard, I want to thank my \ncosponsor on this amendment, Senator McCain, and the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, for their long work together in the interest of \nestablishing not a national identity card but minimum uniform standards \nfor personal identification documents in the United States of \nAmerica. We have no intention of usurping the State's role here, their \ncapacity to design their own identification documents. The amendment \nspecifies that the States retain the full authority to decide who \nqualifies, for example, for a driver's license. We would, in addition, \nprovide grants to the States to help them implement these new \nstandards.\n\n  For several decades, study after study has told us how easy it is to \nobtain a false identity in this country. As recently as 2002, GAO \ninvestigators used fraudulent identification made by commercially \navailable computer software to obtain driver's licenses in several \nStates. Of course, the driver's license is an entry card to a personal \nidentification and clearance throughout the system.\n  We have known about this problem for decades, but after September 11 \nwe can't wait any longer--and we are still waiting, since September 11, \nto do anything about it. This bill will push us forward.\n  The 9/11 Commission described a variety of loopholes and flaws and \ninadequacies in our current border security personal identity system. \nWe must close and repair those; close those loopholes, repair those \nflaws, and put to an end, as best we can, to the terrorists' ability to \ncontinually reinvent themselves and escape detection. We are up to \nthis. We are technologically up to this. The question is whether we \nhave the will and the common sense to do so.\n  This amendment would help our border and law enforcement officials \naccomplish exactly that. For the sake of the safety of all Americans, I \nask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I note with gratitude the presence on the floor of Senator Levin. I \nyield the floor to him at this time for the purpose of offering an \namendment.\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3808\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Connecticut. I thank him and \nSenator Collins, again, for their leadership on this very critically \nimportant bill, one that is surely needed, one that surely must be done \nright. I think we are all determined to do both--to get this bill \npassed, but to get it passed in a form which not just improves our \nintelligence capability but also addresses an issue which I have been \nvery much concerned about, which is the shaping of intelligence, the \nexaggeration of intelligence, the distortion of intelligence to support \nparticular policy purposes.\n  Unhappily, this is not new. We saw the same problem in the Gulf of \nTonkin resolution, with a distortion of the intelligence that was used \nin order to obtain passage of a resolution which would support the \nexpansion of a war in Vietnam.\n  We saw the same problem with the Iran-contra matter, where \nintelligence was distorted, shaped, and misused in order to support a \nparticular policy position.\n  We recently saw, before Iraq, that intelligence was shaped and \nexaggerated and distorted inside the intelligence community, in my \njudgment, after it was received by the policymakers. But even before \nthey got it, it was shaped in a way that pointed, in every single \ninstance where there is an error in omission, toward a more imminent \nthreat, a stronger threat, which thereby supported the position of the \npolicymakers.\n  I believe in a stronger national intelligence director. We need a \nstronger national intelligence director, but we also want a director \nwho is going to exercise that power in a way which will not produce \nintelligence aimed at supporting policy. We need intelligence which is \naimed at providing facts--unvarnished, objective, independently arrived \nat.\n  While supporting a more powerful director, I do not want to support a \nstronger ``yes'' man or simply to support a stronger political arm of \nthe White House. Here, when I say that, I am referring to any \nadministration, not just this administration. I don't want national \nintelligence directors to be shaping intelligence to support the policy \nof any administration. I want them to be providing information which is \ncritically important to policymakers but information which must be \nright, must be accurate, must be objective, must be independently \narrived at. That is what my goal has been.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Maine, who are \nleading this effort, and the Governmental Affairs Committee have \nwillingly added a number of provisions which have furthered that goal. \nThere are a number of other provisions which I believe should be added \nhere on the floor.\n  I will be offering one today. I have not personally been able to talk \nto the Senator from Connecticut, but I understand that this first \namendment of mine may have been cleared now. I want to describe it, in \nany event.\n  I ask unanimous consent we set aside the pending amendment and that \namendment No. 3808 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) proposes an amendment numbered \n3808.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To enhance customer focus on intelligence and to ensure \n                   independent intelligence analyses)\n\n       On page 14, line 2, strike ``community,'' and insert \n     ``community following receipt of intelligence needs and \n     requirements from the consumers of national intelligence,''.\n       On page 14, line 8, insert before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, while ensuring that the elements of the \n     intelligence community are able to conduct independent \n     analyses so as to achieve, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     competitive analyses''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 9/11 Commission, in addition to \nrecommending a number of ways in which we could strengthen the national \nintelligence director and that office and produce more coordinated and \nhelpful intelligence reports where we have all the information \nnecessary to connect the dots and where agencies share information with \neach other, also reminded us on page 414 of their report that:\n\n       In managing the whole community, the National Intelligence \n     Director is still providing a service function. With the \n     partial exception of his or her responsibilities for \n     overseeing the NCTC [the National Counterterrorism Center] \n     the National Intelligence Director should support the \n     consumers of national intelligence--the president and \n     policymaking advisers, such as secretaries of state, defense \n     and homeland security, and the Attorney General.\n\n  The consumers of intelligence are the ones who need to set forth and \nlay out their needs. What do they need by way of collection? What is it \nthat they and their agencies--whether it is the State Department or \nHomeland Security Department or the Treasury Department or any other \ndepartment--what kind of satellite capabilities do they need? Where do \nthey need the electronics to be used? They need to tell that new \nnational intelligence director and the NCTC what it is they need for \ntheir purposes. They are in the best position to know what are the \nrequirements of their agency.\n  When all these requirements and needs are put together, we are then \nin a situation where the needs and the requirements of the agencies \nwill probably exceed the resources that we have available to meet those \nneeds. At that point, you need somebody to arbitrate. You need somebody \nto decide: We have this many needs, but we have only this many \nresources. How do we allocate limited resources--or at least not \nunlimited resources--among a very finite package of needs which \nfrequently will exceed the resources we have?\n  Who is going to arbitrate that problem? If the State Department says \nwe have to have satellite coverage here, and another department says, \nno, we have to have that coverage here, who is going to make that \ndecision?\n  The answer which this bill provides, and I think rightly so, is that \nthe national intelligence director needs to make the decision as to \nwhat needs are going to be met if we can't meet all of them. But in \nterms of what those needs are, in terms of setting forth the \nrequirements of the agency, that has to be something which the agency \nhead sets up. There is no way that the NID can decide what the State \nDepartment needs and what the Defense Department needs and what the \nTreasury Department needs. Those agencies and others have to lay out \nwhat their requirements are, what their needs are.\n  Where the NID comes in is deciding among those needs which ones have \nthe top priority. That is why the language in the bill which says that \nthe NID will establish the collection and analysis priorities and \nmanage collection tasking is, in my judgment, correct.\n  I want to make it clear that this amendment is truly intended to \nclarify what I believe is the intent of the sponsors of this bill. \nThere are other amendments I will be offering which differ on the \nsubstance, where there is something I would do differently from the \nsponsors of the bill. But this amendment is intended to clarify what I \nbelieve not only is but should be and must be the intent of the \nsponsors of this legislation in two ways.\n  First, as I have just described, and as the 9/11 Commission \ndescribed, one of the purposes of the national intelligence director is \nto support the consumers of national intelligence. It is the consumers \nwho must set forth and lay out their needs. When those needs exceed the \nresources or can't be met for whatever reason, you need an arbiter. \nThat is where the NID should come in. Sorry, we can't meet that \ndepartment's need; or, Sorry we can't meet the Treasury Department \nneeds because this Homeland Security need has to take priority. You \nneed someone who will make that decision and who can make it quickly. \nThat, I believe, is the intent.\n  No one is in a position to determine the needs of 15 intelligence \nagencies with intelligence operations except those agencies themselves. \nBut when you aggregate those needs and they exceed the resources, at \nthat point you have to have a national intelligence director who says, \nThat has priority and we are tasking that particular satellite; we are \ntasking an agency that has satellite capability to accomplish that \nparticular goal and meet that need rather than their other needs which \ncannot be met.\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\n  That is one part of the amendment.\n  The other clarification has to do with the analyses, the so-called \ncompetitive analyses, which are welcome.\n  Everybody who testified in front of us--Secretary Powell, Secretary \nRidge, the chairman of our committee and the ranking member said this \nat hearings--``We don't want group-think.'' We want independent \nanalyses. We want analyses which are competitive. We want to encourage \nthat. We don't want to discourage it.\n  We want to make it clear in the bill that by giving power to the \nnational intelligence director to direct that a competitive analysis be \nachieved, it is not exclusive. We are still urging all of the \nintelligence agencies on their own initiative to provide independently \narrived at and competitive analysis. We want agencies to tell us those \naluminum tubes have two purposes, not just one. We want agencies on \ntheir own initiative--not waiting for a direction by the NID but on \ntheir own initiative, should they determine that is what they wish to \ndo--to tell us, No, those unmanned aerial vehicles do not have a \npurpose of delivering biological weapons; they are more suited for a \nlegitimate purpose.\n  We want agencies, in other words, to give us those competitive \nanalyses which is what is the great antidote to group-think and which \nthe chairman, the ranking member, and every single witness, I think, \nwho came in front of us said should be encouraged. We have language in \nthe bill now which gives the power to the NID to direct a \ncompetitive analysis, which is fine. He or she ought to have that \npower.\n\n  We want to encourage independent or competitive analysis, and that \nmeans we don't want any agency to think they have to wait for a \ndirection, but they on their own will be encouraged by the NID to \nengage in those kinds of independent analyses.\n  I want to assure my dear friend from Connecticut, the ranking member, \nthat this particular amendment does have that purpose. I believe it is \na very commonsense amendment which is complimentary to everything that \nis in the bill.\n  I will be offering amendments perhaps on Monday which I think are \nvery modest amendments which do, though, make substantive changes to \nthe bill. This would carry out what I hope the intention is of the \nsponsors of the bill and which has been stated by the sponsors of the \nbill to be something they deeply believe in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan, the \ndistinguished member of our Governmental Affairs Committee, who has \nplayed a characteristically active, thoughtful, and constructive part \nin the markup of and consideration of the committee through the \nhearings, drafting, and markup of the bill last week, and he continues \nto with this amendment, an amendment somewhat like the one which the \ncommittee didn't agree on. We have worked together. This whole bill has \nhad so many moments where I felt we were legislating, we were reasoning \ntogether and coming to agreements that will make the system we want \nestablished better. This is one of them. It is totally consistent with \nthe intention Senator Collins and I have had in putting the bill \ntogether with the intention, in my opinion, of the September 11 \nCommission, which is to put somebody in charge of the intelligence \ncommunity where there is not someone in charge now; to not simply \nencourage but to the best of their ability mandate collaboration among \nthe component agencies of the intelligence community and make sure that \none result of collaboration is not so-called group-think; that there is \nindependent, competitive analysis going on.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Michigan, which is focused, does \nexactly that. It adds language to make clear that the national \nintelligence director shall establish collection and analysis \nrequirements for the intelligence community based on input from \nconsumers of that national intelligence which reflect their estimate of \ntheir need and requirements. That is plain common sense.\n  The director would also establish collection analysis requirements \nbased on the needs of intelligence consumers in order to produce timely \nand relevant products, which is what this is all about.\n  Senator Levin's amendment also makes clear the director has the \nresponsibility in setting analysis priorities to ensure that the \nelements of the intelligence community are able to conduct, as he has \nsaid, ``independent analyses so as to achieve to the maximum extent \npracticable competitive analysis.''\n  That, too, is not only sensible, but it is in the interest of our \nnational security.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan. I certainly support the amendment. \nI believe it has been cleared on both sides. But the Senator from Maine \nis not able to be on the floor right now. As soon as she can, I guess \nshe will want to speak on this and we should adopt this by consent.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my dear friend from \nConnecticut.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Inouye be added as a cosponsor \nto this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't know whether the Senator from \nConnecticut at this point wants to have a voice vote or wait for the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine is on her way to \nthe floor to speak about the amendment. I wonder if we might go into a \nquorum call for a moment until she does.\n  I note the presence of the very distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. He will go next after we agree to this \namendment.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I support the amendment proposed by \nSenator Levin. I thank him for offering it and for all of his hard \nwork. It reflects not only the Senator's unique experience as a member \nof the Intelligence Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, but also it reflects his usual care and \nattention to detail, which is unparalleled in this body.\n  The Levin amendment makes clear that the NID will establish \ncollection and analysis requirements for the intelligence community \nfollowing input from the consumers of intelligence. With these \nauthorities, the NID will be able to manage collection activities \nacross the intelligence community to ensure that defense, homeland \nsecurity, and diplomatic needs are prioritized and satisfied. \nSimilarly, a strong NID will ensure robust and competitive analysis of \nintelligence, prioritized to meet our most pressing needs.\n  Senator Levin's amendment will clarify that the consumers of national \nintelligence should set the requirements for collection and analysis. \nIt would also emphasize that independent and comparative analyses are \ncritical to an effective intelligence community.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his contribution. I urge \nagreement of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Levin \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3808) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3748\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3748 entitled ``The Analytic\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nReview Unit,'' which probably should be entitled ``The Accountability \nAmendment.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3748.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Ombudsman \nof the National Intelligence Authority and of the Analytic Review Unit \n                  within the Office of the Ombudsman)\n\n       On page 78, line 19, insert ``regular and detailed'' before \n     ``reviews''.\n       On page 79, strike lines 1 and 2 and insert the following:\n\n     political considerations, based upon all sources available to \n     the intelligence community, and performed in a manner \n     consistent with sound analytic methods and tradecraft, \n     including reviews for purposes of determining whether or \n     not--\n       (A) such product or products state separately, and \n     distinguish between, the intelligence underlying such product \n     or products and the assumptions and judgments of analysts \n     with respect to the intelligence and such product or \n     products;\n       (B) such product or products describe the quality and \n     reliability of the intelligence underlying such product or \n     products;\n       (C) such product or products present and explain \n     alternative conclusions, if any, with respect to the \n     intelligence underlying such product or products;\n       (D) such product or products characterizes the \n     uncertainties, if any, and the confidence in such product or \n     products; and\n       (E) the analyst or analysts responsible for such product or \n     products had appropriate access to intelligence information \n     from all sources, regardless of the source of the \n     information, the method of collection of the information, the \n     elements of the intelligence community that collected the \n     information, or the location of such collection.\n       On page 80, line 1, insert ``(A)'' after ``(5)''.\n       On page 80, line 3, strike ``, upon request,''.\n       On page 80, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       (B) The results of the evaluations under paragraph (4) \n     shall also be distributed as appropriate throughout the \n     intelligence community as a method for training intelligence \n     community analysts and promoting the development of sound \n     analytic methods and tradecraft. To ensure the widest \n     possible distribution of the evaluations, the Analytic Review \n     Unit shall, when appropriate, produce evaluations at multiple \n     classification levels.\n       (6) Upon completion of the evaluations under paragraph (4), \n     the Ombudsman may make recommendations to the National \n     Intelligence Director, and to the heads of the elements of \n     the intelligence community, for such personnel actions as the \n     Ombudsman considers appropriate in light of the evaluations, \n     including awards, commendations, reprimands, additional \n     training, or disciplinary action.\n       On page 80, line 6, strike ``Information.--'' and insert \n     ``Information and Personnel.--(1)''.\n       On page 80, line 8, insert ``, the Analytic Review Unit, \n     and other staff of the Office of the Ombudsman of the \n     National Intelligence Authority'' after ``Authority''.\n       On page 80, line 10, insert ``operational and'' before \n     ``field reports''.\n       On page 80, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       (2) The Ombudsman, the Analytic Review Unit, and other \n     staff of the Office shall have access to any employee, or any \n     employee of a contractor, of the intelligence community whose \n     testimony is needed for the performance of the duties of the \n     Ombudsman.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This amendment clarifies the role of the analytical \nreview unit that the Collins and Lieberman bill creates within the \nOffice of the Ombudsman of the National Intelligence Authority. The \namendment specifies that the unit will evaluate the quality of the \nanalysis of our national intelligence agency and, where appropriate, \nissue nonbinding--and I underline ``nonbinding''--recommendations for \npresent personnel actions to include additional training, \ncommendations, and also any action that would be disciplinary.\n  This quality control mechanism will help instill accountability--we \nhave heard that word over and over again in regard to intelligence \nreform, independence, leadership, and accountability--in the \nintelligence community's analytical effort in an effort to guard \nagainst analytical failures such as prewar intelligence assessment \nconcerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs by providing \nregular quality control audits of the intelligence community's \nanalysis.\n  I am extremely hopeful the managers can find a way to include this \nimportant amendment in the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3739 and 3750, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up en \nbloc amendments 3739 and 3750 and ask that they be considered \nseparately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes amendments \n     numbered 3739 and 3750, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

This amendment clarifies that a primary mission of \nNational Intelligence Authority is the elimination of barriers that \nimpede any coordination of all intelligence activities, not merely \ncounterterrorism activities.\n  Three years after 9/11, information sharing still remains, \nunfortunately, a serious problem. As recently as last week--as recently \nas last week--the Senate Intelligence Committee received a disturbing \nbriefing in closed session that clearly demonstrated that even on \nmatters related to the current terrorist threat to our homeland, the \nintelligence agencies still stubbornly refuse to adequately share \ninformation.\n  The National Security Act of 1947 clearly stipulates that a primary \nmission of the head of the intelligence community is to protect sources \nand methods. The current language of the Collins-Lieberman bill wisely \nbalances this with the need to also ensure that intelligence concerning \nterrorism is certainly shared with those who need it.\n  This amendment seeks to broaden that responsibility to include all \nintelligence threats, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, North Korea, and other intelligence threats, not just \nterrorism. Terrorism is a serious threat, but it is not the last threat \nthat we will face.\n  This amendment, which would build on the Collins-Lieberman bill and \ntheir already strong provisions for a ``trusted information network,'' \nalso stipulates that the national intelligence director is responsible \nfor ensuring that the information-sharing process be automated to allow \nintelligence analysts to ``pull'' information from databases rather \nthan waiting for somebody to push it to them. Currently, much of the \ninformation sharing that does occur in the intelligence community \nhappens only through phones and fax machines, which is very \ninefficient, and also it is unreliable.\n  I am hopeful the managers can find a way to include this important \namendment in the bill. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3747\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, this amendment would provide the national \nintelligence director with certain specified authorities already \nprovided to the Central Intelligence Agency. These provisions include \nflexible acquisition, spending, personnel, and management authorities. \nAs I have indicated, the national intelligence director already has \nthese authorities. In addition, the amendment permits the national \nintelligence director to delegate any of the specified authorities to \nthe head of an element of the intelligence community for use by that \nelement.\n  Under the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA has a range of \nauthorities in matters such as acquisition, spending, personnel, and \nmanagement that do not exist anywhere else in Government. These sorts \nof authorities are often required to effectively conduct intelligence \noperations in a very timely way. This amendment seeks to empower the \nnational intelligence director by allowing him to exercise these \nauthorities anywhere in the intelligence community that he sees fit, \nnot just at the CIA.\n  I am extremely hopeful that the managers can find a way to include \nthis very important amendment in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for his \nthoughtful amendments.\n  I have a great deal of admiration and respect for the Senator's \nknowledge in this area. I was very pleased that he participated in some \nof the committee's hearings, particularly the one where we had the \nformer DCIs come in and give us their views. Both and he Senator \nRockefeller took the time out of their August recess to come to that \nhearing and fully participated in it. They have been providing us with \ntheir insight and guidance, which I very much appreciate.\n  The Senator from Kansas has offered a series of thoughtful amendments \nthat are designed to clarify provisions in the bill with regard to \ninformation sharing, the primary mission of the National Intelligence \nAuthority, the authorities of the NID, and several other matters. We \nagree largely with the goals of these amendments, and we are trying to \nwork out agreement on specific language.\n  One of the problems we face, since we have adopted a lot of different \namendments, including one cosponsored by the Senator last night having \nto do with an office of alternative analysis, is we need to make sure \nwe are not duplicating changes that have been made by other amendments. \nIt is a bit of a moving target here.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  Another problem is, of course, we are trying to maintain that \ndelicate balance struck by our bill. Any amendment that further \nstrengthens the NID's authorities is a particular concern to one group; \nany amendment that weakens the NID's authorities is a particular \nconcern to another. I know the Senator is very aware of the competing \npressures in this regard.\n  In short, I want to assure the Senator and thank him for his \ncontributions. We will try to work out these amendments consistent with \nthe approach we have taken in the underlying bill. I very much \nappreciate the Senator's cooperation and good work and his leadership \nin this area.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to the Senator, I would like to thank you for your \nvery kind remarks. As the chairman knows, we have 22 professional \nstaffers who were former analysts throughout the intelligence \ncommunity. We would like to think we have expertise on this issue. As \nthe chairman knows and the distinguished ranking member knows, we did \nproduce a 511-page inquiry on WMD in regard to the inquiry on the \nprewar intelligence. I think it is the most thorough look at the \nintelligence community that has been conducted in the last 20 years. I \nam very proud of our staff. I think we have an outstanding staff.\n  I would just like to say this: This is not going to be the best \npossible bill. This is going to be the best bill possible to achieve \nthat delicate balance that the distinguished chairman has talked about. \nAnd that is not being untoward. That is not bad. This is a very \ncomprehensive bill. This touches our entire intelligence community. So \nwe are bound to have to take a good look at this, and we are also going \nto be bound in terms of our responsibilities in terms of oversight.\n  I would imagine that with any bill you have what is called technical \ncorrections. In this particular bill, we are going to have to take a \nhard look at not only technical corrections but monitor this bill as it \nevolves. But the important thing is that both Senators have been the \nprimary movers of this bill in moving it forward in a comprehensive \nway. I credit them for their work. I can speak for all members of the \nIntelligence Committee: We are here, and we are here to help.\n  I thank the Senator for her kind comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I cannot thank the Senator from Kansas \nenough, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, for what he has said. \nIt means everything to me and, I know, to Senator Collins. We were \nasked to take on this assignment in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nbecause we are the committee of jurisdiction over governmental \nreorganization. The Intelligence Committee clearly has the experience \nand expertise in matters of intelligence. Senator Roberts and Senator \nRockefeller have contributed to the product we have turned out. But it \nis critically important to the success of what we have started here \nthat our committee be working together with Senator Roberts and his \ncommittee.\n  I appreciate the effort and thoughtfulness that went into the many \namendments that the Senator from Kansas is offering. Our staffs are \nlooking them over. As Senator Collins said, I hope we can accept a \nnumber of them. They share the goals that we have together, and they \nwill strengthen the bill. Then I look forward to Senator Roberts being \non the conference committee and helping us to come up with a good \nresult when we meet our friends from the House.\n  Most of all, I thank him, my friend. Together we are going to get \nsomething good done, not just for the intelligence community but for \nthe reason for which our intelligence agencies exist, and that is for \nour national security.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 3801.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Kyl, in support of amendment No. 3801 which I will describe in \na minute.\n  Before I get to that, let me thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee for the great work they have done on \nthis bill. There has been no more delicate situation this body has had \nto deal with in many years, certainly in the 10 years I have been \nprivileged to be a part of the Congress. Certainly there is no more \nimportant issue before us today because this issue involves the safety \nand security of every American, not just this generation but future \ngenerations to come. No two people have the concern of the American \npeople more at heart than do Chairman Collins and Ranking Member \nLieberman, both of whom I have tremendous respect for. I appreciate \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  Today I rise along with Senator Kyl in support of amendment No. 3801 \nto S. 2845. This amendment focuses on intelligence reform relative to \nthe civil liberties provision in the underlying bill. Section 211 of \nthe underlying bill establishes a civil liberties board and gives that \nboard certain powers and authorities.\n  Let me be clear: There is no stronger advocate for civil liberties in \nthe Senate than myself. As a lawyer and a legislator, my entire \nprofessional life has been intertwined with the preservation of the \nliberties we all enjoy as Americans and which are enshrined in our \nConstitution and our Bill of Rights. The issue we debate today is not \nwhether we support our civil liberties; we all support them as \ncontained in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The question is, \nhow best to balance this issue with other rights that form the \ncornerstone of our Constitution: namely, that among our inalienable \nrights from our Creator are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  When Islamic terrorists threaten our life and our liberties, we must \nact to protect ourselves. That is why we are here today debating the \nreformation of our intelligence community. We know our enemies want to \nkill us, and we understand that good intelligence will protect us. In \nour country, we may differ on how to do this, but there is no \ndisagreement on why we need to do it. Our challenge is to increase our \nintelligence capabilities without undue infringement on our individual \nliberties.\n  Today our struggle is against an enemy unique in our history. The \nenemy is not a nation state. Rather, it is a warped philosophy that \ndistorts any rational notion of what a Supreme Being expects of \nmankind. There are no rules of warfare for our enemy. They feel free \nand unencumbered to fly civilian airplanes loaded with innocent \npassengers into buildings, killing thousands of ordinary, hard-working, \ngood citizens of our country. They relish in cutting off the heads of \npeople who have done no harm to them whatsoever, recording it on video \nand broadcasting their horrific, inhumane actions to the world.\n  One only has to look at one of those tapes or listen to the voices of \nhelpless victims pleading for their lives to grasp how evil and \ndangerous these Islamic terrorists are and why this Nation must succeed \nin our fight against them.\n  To win against such an enemy, we need to keep our focus. We need \nclear, unambiguous, and non-duplicative orders and laws pertaining to \nour war on terrorism and the protection of our civil liberties.\n  S. 2845 is a bill to strengthen our intelligence capabilities. It is \nmeant to put more teeth into our ability to track, find, and arrest or \nkill those who wish to murder our people and destroy our way of life. \nIt is not a bill regarding our civil liberties.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights, and Property Rights, which has oversight responsibility \nin this area, I\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\nam keenly aware of the safeguards that are already in place to protect \nour civil liberties from overreaching by the Government. Within the \nDepartment of Justice, there is an entire division devoted to \nprotecting our civil rights. This division is responsible for \ncoordinating the civil rights enforcement efforts of Federal agencies \nand assists in identifying and removing provisions, policies, and \nprograms that violate our individual rights and liberties.\n  Last month, by Executive Order 13353, President Bush created the \nPresident's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil Liberties. This \nboard is specifically designed to further strengthen the protection of \nthe rights of Americans in the effective performance of national \nsecurity and homeland security functions.\n  As the President said when he established the board and I quote, \n``The United States Government has a solemn obligation, and shall \ncontinue fully, to protect the legal rights of all Americans, including \nfreedoms, civil liberties, and information privacy guaranteed by \nFederal law, in the effective performance of national security and \nhomeland security functions.''\n  Our amendment to S. 2845 clearly highlights the importance we all \nplace on civil liberties, but it leaves the power to enforce our laws \non this issue where it belongs--with the appropriate Federal agencies \nthat are already equipped and designed for that function.\n  Whenever U.S. officials or U.S. military personnel violate any of our \nlaws, they need to be fully prosecuted. Of course, we have good systems \nalready in place to make sure that happens. For example, as bad as the \nabuse of some Iraqi prisoners was, our military justice system is \nhandling those soldiers accused in exactly the right way.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about what this board is designed to do \nand the powers and authorities of this board. I am reading from page \n155 of the underlying bill:\n\n       The Board shall continually review the information sharing \n     practices of the department's agencies, and elements of the \n     executive branch to determine whether they appropriately \n     protect privacy and civil liberties . . .\n\n  And so on.\n  Now, further, on page 158, in order to accomplish the provisions set \nforth in the section I just read, this board has access to information \nas follows, and I am quoting from page 158, line 21:\n\n       If determined by the Board to be necessary to carry out its \n     responsibilities under this section, the Board is authorized \n     to . . .\n\n  Now I read on page 159, line 12:\n\n     . . . require, by subpoena issued at the direction of a \n     majority of the members of the Board, persons (other than \n     departments, agencies, and elements of the executive branch) \n     to produce any relevant information, documents, reports, \n     answers, records, accounts, papers, and other documentary or \n     testimonial evidence.\n\n  Now, this board has an obligation not to sit back and wait for any \ncomplaints to be raised, or any issues to be raised with the board, but \nan affirmative obligation to go out and review the policies and \nprocedures of the civil organizations underneath the executive \ndepartment. So what is going to happen, without question, is there will \nbe problems in the intelligence community. We know and understand that. \nThe No. 1 deficiency in the intelligence community is highlighted by \nevery single board; every single committee within this body, or outside \ncommittee, that has looked at this issue has agreed that the lack of \nhuman intelligence is what the main deficiency has been and continues \nto be today.\n  The only way we are going to cure that problem is to encourage our \nspies in the field--and that is exactly what they are--and these spies \nare absolutely necessary to provide the kind of intelligence our \nmilitary and civilian authorities need to ensure our national security.\n  This board is going to have the authority to aggressively go out and \nreview any situation relative to a case that is ongoing by any officer \nof the CIA, wherever in the world that officer may be operating. This \nboard is going to have the ability to take statements from individuals \nwho are Government employees, or people outside the Government, who \nhave information relative to any case they want to look at.\n  This bill goes even further. It says this board has authority by \nsubpoena issued by just a majority of the members of this board, to \nrequire individuals or agencies to produce documents, including \nclassified documents, that may be reviewed on any particular case.\n  What is that going to do to every single CIA agent who operates in \nthe field, or to every DIA agent who operates in the field and who \nshares information with the CIA? I think, without question, what we are \ndoing by the enactment of these particular sections is to create a \nmorale problem at the Central Intelligence Agency and our other \nintelligence agencies throughout our intelligence community that we \nwill never repair.\n  We are on the back side today, thank goodness, of having repealed the \nDeutch guidelines that were implemented in 1995. Those guidelines \nprohibited the expenditure of tax money being paid to individuals \nproviding us intelligence if they had a criminal record or any kind of \ndisparaging record in their past. Well, what that meant was that we \ncould only hire Sunday school teachers to go out and spy on bad guys \naround the world. Thank goodness this body took affirmative action in \nthe last couple of years to repeal those guidelines. But it was only \nafter the events of September 11 that we were able to accomplish that.\n  In addition to the morale problem that will be created, which I don't \nthink we will ever overcome, one might say this is a board that is \ngoing to be appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and \nthey are not to be a political board. Everybody in this body knows what \nthat means. This is going to be a political board. In fact, the \nlegislation itself says that members of the board shall be selected \nsolely on the basis of their professional qualifications, achievements, \npublic stature, expertise in civil liberties and privacy, relevant \nexperience, and without regard to political affiliation. But in no \nevent shall more than three members of the board be members of the same \npolitical party. So what we are doing here, in effect, is creating a \npolitical board. It makes no difference to me which administration is \nin office. I think it is bad policy to have our CIA agents, DIA agents, \nand every other intelligence officer in the field that operates for the \nsole purpose of gathering intelligence to save and protect Americans \nfrom being killed or harmed, having this board look over their shoulder \nand have the ability not just to investigate the case they are \noperating on, but to look at any information they have shared with \nanybody else, or any information that they have received from anybody \ncan also be reviewed and traced back. I think it is bad policy to \ncreate a board and give them that kind of power and authority and \nexpect them to operate in any way other than a political manner.\n\n  Rather than set up another entity with broad powers, including \nsubpoena power, to look over the activities of our intelligence \npersonnel who are fully engaged in important and dangerous activities \nto protect all of us, I would rather give our support and confidence to \nthose in the Department of Justice who are working on our behalf every \nday to protect our civil liberties. I want to allow the newly formed \nPresident's Board on Safeguarding Americans' Civil Liberties to begin \ntheir work. Let us not establish competing and duplicative \nbureaucracies.\n  Our amendment will strike from section 211 those provisions expanding \nthe powers given to this board to the point of not allowing them to \nsubpoena information, including classified information, from agents \naround the world and other folks involved in the intelligence \ncommunity. We need to rapidly improve our intelligence capabilities, \nand that should be the focus of S. 2845. The protection of our civil \nliberties is already the focus of the President and the Department of \nJustice, and they have the resources to do just that.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Georgia has covered \nthis area very well. I spoke to it yesterday. I know Senator Stevens is \nhere to lay down some amendments. I will take a few minutes to add one \nprimary thought to what the Senator from Georgia has said, and then \nquickly lay down three amendments, and then I will be done.\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\n  Let me make this one key point about what the Senator from Georgia is \ntalking about. The 9/11 Commission did not recommend the board or the \nmany different assistant directorships and other provisions, from an \nombudsman to IGs and the like, that are included in the legislation \nthat is before us today. I am going to tell you what the 9/11 \nCommission did recommend. What it recommended is what the President has \ndone. What the committee did went far beyond that.\n  Our amendment does not eliminate all of that, but at least it cuts it \nback to some extent. That is what I want to explain. Senator Durbin \ndiscussed this privacy amendment at length yesterday. His primary point \nwas that the 9/11 Commission recommended this, and therefore the \ncommittee did it, and therefore we ought to not amend it out. In fact, \none of the things he said was the 9/11 Commission recommended this \nboard, and following their recommendation, the legislation included it.\n  What exactly did the 9/11 Commission recommend? There were three \nspecific recommendations. They take one and a half pages out of the \nentire report. I will paraphrase the first two because they are not \ndirectly on point:\n\n       As the President determines the guidelines for information \n     sharing among government agencies and by those agencies with \n     the private sector, he should safeguard the privacy of \n     individuals about whom information is shared.\n\n  Fine.\n  Two:\n\n       The burden of proof for retaining a particular governmental \n     power should be on the executive, to explain (a) that the \n     power actually materially enhances security and (b) that \n     there is adequate supervision of the executive's use of the \n     powers. . . .\n\n  And three, and this is the key:\n\n       At this time of increased and consolidated government \n     authority, there should be a board within the executive \n     branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend \n     and the commitment the government makes to defend our civil \n     liberties.\n\n  That is it. As the Senator from Georgia said, that is exactly what \nthe President did in his Executive Order 13353. The Senator from \nGeorgia described what that Executive order does. I have a full copy of \nall the entities involved in it, the instructions to that board to \nbring any credible information of possible violations of law to \nappropriate end, to undertake other efforts to protect the legal rights \nof all Americans, including freedoms, civil liberties, and information \nprivacy guaranteed by Federal law, and so on.\n  In other words, what the 9/11 Commission recommended the President \ndid. What is in this bill goes far beyond that. What I said yesterday \nwith respect to risk aversion makes it clear that what the committee \ndid not only goes far beyond what the 9/11 Commission recommended but \nwill virtually guarantee that the risk aversion, which is a problem \ntoday, is exacerbated tenfold so that instead of being able to collect \nmore intelligence and analyze that intelligence better and have people \nwho are not involved in group-think, who are actually willing to think \noutside the box and not be intimidated by risks aversion, instead of \nthat, we are going to get more of that because of all the layers of \nbureaucracy that is going to be looking over people's shoulders.\n  What the bill does is require two officers within the national \nintelligence authority, two out of six, one responsible for privacy, \nthe other for civil rights and civil liberties. In addition, there is \nan inspector general within the national intelligence authority who, \namong other things, is to monitor and inform the director of violations \nof civil liberties and privacy.\n  There is an ombudsman, which I mentioned a moment ago. There is an \nindependent privacy and civil liberties oversight board with extensive \ninvestigative authorities, which the Senator from Georgia talked about, \nand privacy and civil liberties officers within a long list of \nexecutive branch departments and agencies.\n  So what does the amendment we have offered do? It deletes sections \n126 and 127 which require officers for privacy and civil liberties \nwithin the national intelligence authority because those already exist; \nit would strike section 212 requiring privacy and civil liberties \nofficers within a long list of executive branch departments and \nagencies; and it would modify the privacy and civil liberties oversight \nboard described in section 211. It does not eliminate it, so it would \nbe duplicative of the board the President created.\n  There will be an executive branch board and an outside board, but \nthis board would not have the authority to subpoena private individuals \nor documents and reports, accounts, and other evidence of private \nindividuals, nor would it have the power to compel through subpoena, \nfor example, a department or agency to present documents.\n\n  I am not even sure, by the way, this board would have the authority \nto do that under the Constitution. I am not sure that authority could \nbe granted. In any event, that would be a very pernicious power granted \nto it when that power already exists in the ombudsman, in the inspector \ngeneral, and the other privacy officers that exist. It is duplicative \nand unnecessary.\n  The net result of all these different entities that have the same \nresponsibility is to basically tell intelligence agencies: If you want \nto get to the end of your career and have a pension at the end of it, \nyou better watch over your shoulder because there are a whole lot of \nother people doing that. That is not the way to enhance our security.\n  Those are the additional points I wanted to make in addition to those \nI made yesterday with respect to this amendment. I hope before we vote \non this amendment we will have an opportunity to present these \narguments in short form with all of the Members in attendance.\n  Mr. President, I indicated to the chairman of the committee what I \nintend to do next. Therefore, since our procedure is to lay down one \namendment at a time, I ask unanimous consent to lay down three \namendments, and I will explain what they are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3926\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first is amendment No. 3926, which is at \nthe desk, and I ask that amendment be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3926.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure that \n nonimmigrant visas are not issued to individuals with connections to \nterrorism or who intend to carry out terrorist activities in the United \n                                States)\n\n       At the end, add the following new title:\n\n                      TITLE IV--VISA REQUIREMENTS\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 214 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1184) governs the admission of nonimmigrants to the \n     United States and sets forth the process for that admission.\n       (2) Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     places the burden of proof on a visa applicant to establish \n     ``to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of \n     the application for a visa . . . that he is entitled to a \n     nonimmigrant status''.\n       (3) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States included a recommendation that \n     the United States ``combine terrorist travel intelligence, \n     operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to intercept \n     terrorists . . . and constrain terrorist mobility''.\n       (4) Fifteen of the 19 individuals who participated in the \n     aircraft hijackings on September 11, 2001, were nationals of \n     Saudi Arabia who legally entered the United States after \n     securing nonimmigrant visas despite the fact that they did \n     not adequately meet the burden of proof required by section \n     214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (5) Prior to September 11, 2001, the Department of State \n     allowed consular officers to approve nonimmigrant visa \n     applications that were incomplete, and without conducting \n     face-to-face interviews of many applicants.\n       (6) Each of the 15 individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, filed a visa application that contained inaccuracies \n     and omissions that should have prevented such individual from \n     obtaining a visa.\n       (7) Only one of the hijackers listed an actual address on \n     his visa application. The other hijackers simply wrote \n     answers such as ``California'', ``New York'', or ``Hotel'' \n     when asked to provide a destination inside the United States \n     on the visa application.\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n       (8) Only 3 of the individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, provided any information in the section of the visa \n     application that requests the name and address of an employer \n     or school in the United States.\n       (9) The 2002 General Accounting Office report entitled \n     ``Border Security: Visa Process Should Be Strengthened as \n     Antiterrorism Tool'' outlined the written guidelines and \n     practices of the Department of State related to visa issuance \n     and stated that the Department of State allowed for \n     widespread discretion among consular officers in adhering to \n     the burden of proof requirements under section 214(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (10) The General Accounting Office report further stated \n     that the ``Consular Best Practices Handbook'' of the \n     Department of State gave consular managers and staff the \n     discretion to ``waive personal appearance and interviews for \n     certain nonimmigrant visa applicants''.\n       (11) Only 2 of the 15 individuals from Saudi Arabia who \n     participated in the aircraft hijackings on September 11, \n     2001, were interviewed by Department of State consular \n     officers.\n       (12) If the Department of State had required all consular \n     officers to implement section 214(b) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, conduct face-to-face interviews, and require \n     that visa applications be completely and accurately filled \n     out, those who participated in the aircraft hijackings on \n     September 11, 2001, may have been denied nonimmigrant visas \n     and the tragedy of September 11, 2001, could have been \n     prevented.\n\n     SEC. 402. IN PERSON INTERVIEWS OF VISA APPLICANTS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Interviews.--Section 222 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1202) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     Secretary of State shall require every alien applying for a \n     nonimmigrant visa--\n       ``(1) who is at least 12 years of age and not more than 65 \n     years of age to submit to an in person interview with a \n     consular officer unless the requirement for such interview is \n     waived--\n       ``(A) by a consular official and such alien is within that \n     class of nonimmigrants enumerated in section 101(a)(15)(A) or \n     101(a)(15)(G) or is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic \n     passport or on the equivalent thereof;\n       ``(B) by a consular official and such alien is applying for \n     a visa--\n       ``(i) not more than 12 months after the date on which the \n     alien's prior visa expired;\n       ``(ii) for the classification under section 101(a)(15) for \n     which such prior visa was issued;\n       ``(iii) from the consular post located in the country in \n     which the alien is a national; and\n       ``(iv) the consular officer has no indication that the \n     alien has not complied with the immigration laws and \n     regulations of the United States; or\n       ``(C) by the Secretary of State if the Secretary determines \n     that such waiver is--\n       ``(i) in the national interest of the United States; or\n       ``(ii) necessary as a result of unusual circumstances; and\n       ``(2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), to submit to an in \n     person interview with a consular officer if such alien--\n       ``(A) is not a national of the country in which the alien \n     is applying for a visa;\n       ``(B) was previously refused a visa, unless such refusal \n     was overcome or a waiver of ineligibility has been obtained;\n       ``(C) is listed in the Consular Lookout and Support System \n     (or successor system at the Department of State);\n       ``(D) may not obtain a visa until a security advisory \n     opinion or other Department of State clearance is issued \n     unless such alien is--\n       ``(i) within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in \n     section 101(a)(15)(A) or 101(a)(15)(G); and\n       ``(ii) not a national of a country that is officially \n     designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism; or\n       ``(E) is identified as a member of a group or sector that \n     the Secretary of State determines--\n       ``(i) poses a substantial risk of submitting inaccurate \n     information in order to obtain a visa;\n       ``(ii) has historically had visa applications denied at a \n     rate that is higher than the average rate of such denials; or\n       ``(iii) poses a security threat to the United States.''.\n       (b) Conduct During Interviews.--Section 222 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1202), as amended \n     by subsection (a), is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) A consular officer who is conducting an in person \n     interview with an alien applying for a visa or other \n     documentation shall--\n       ``(1) make every effort to conduct such interview fairly;\n       ``(2) employ high professional standards during such \n     interview;\n       ``(3) use best interviewing techniques to elicit pertinent \n     information to assess the alien's qualifications, including \n     techniques to identify any potential security concerns posed \n     by the alien;\n       ``(4) provide the alien with an adequate opportunity to \n     present evidence establishing the accuracy of the information \n     in the alien's application; and\n       ``(5) make a careful record of the interview to document \n     the basis for the final action on the alien's application, if \n     appropriate.''.\n\n     SEC. 403. VISA APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 222(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1202(c)) is amended by inserting ``The alien shall \n     provide complete and accurate information in response to any \n     request for information contained in the application.'' after \n     the second sentence.\n\n     SEC. 404.

Mr. President, this amendment would codify and tighten the \nprocedures for personal interviews of people seeking temporary visas. \nMr. President, 15 of the 19 hijackers who came here received these \nkinds of visas.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3881.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, September 30, \n2004, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I recall in the Senate a vote of I think it \nwas 97 to 1 or 90-something to 1, in any event, earlier this year that \npassed a proposed statute to guarantee crime victims certain rights. \nThat bill is pending in the House.\n  What this does is take those exact rights and make them applicable to \nvictims of terrorist attacks, terrorist crimes.\n  Again, I invite comments. I do not think it will be difficult. We \nwill work that out.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3724\n\n  (Purpose: To strengthen anti-terrorism investigative tools, promote \ninformation sharing, punish terrorist offenses, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to go to my third amendment. This \nis amendment No. 3724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3724.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, September 28, \n2004 under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important \namendment that I will offer to the 9/11 Commission bill. My amendment \nis substantially the same as S. 2679, the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act, \na bill that I introduced earlier this year with several other members \nof the Judiciary Committee and the Senate leadership.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, congressional committees \nand executive agencies have conducted exhaustive reviews of our \nNation's antiterrorism safety net. We have had scores of hearings in \nthe House and Senate judiciary committees, a Joint Intelligence \nCommittee Inquiry, the \n9/11 Commission hearings and report, and the Justice Department has \nconducted extensive evaluations of its own antiterrorism capabilities. \nThese hearings have uncovered numerous flaws and gaps in our \nantiterrorism system. We have found, for example, that in many cases \nantiterror investigators still have less authority to access \ninformation than do investigators of other crimes that, while serious, \npale in comparison to the threat posed by international terrorism. We \nalso have seen that some of the federal code's criminal offenses and \npenalties are far too light, or too narrow in their scope,\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\nin light of the contemporary terrorist threat. Yet, despite all of \nthese hearings and reports--and all of the gaps in our antiterror laws \nthat have been identified--Congress has enacted no major antiterror \nlegislation in almost three years.\n  This amendment addresses many of the problems that these hearings and \nreports have identified over the last few years. At the outset, I would \nlike to emphasize 5 things about the amendment.\n  This amendment is not about the PATRIOT Act. This amendment does not \nreauthorize or extend the PATRIOT Act. Nor does it involve any of the \nsupposedly ``controversial'' provisions of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Nothing in TFTA deals with Section 215 subpoenas, which some critics \nhave complained can be used to access a terrorist's records of book \nwithdrawals and computer use at a library.\n  Nothing in TFTA deals with delayed-notice searches, which some \ncritics deride as ``sneak and peak'' searches, even though the PATRIOT \nAct only codified judicial standards that have been in place for \ndecades.\n  Nothing in TFTA deals with roving wiretaps, which some critics \nmischaracterize as allowing taps of the telephones of anyone who fits a \ngeneral description. This is not true. A roving wiretap can only be \nused for a particular person, though it applies to any phone that the \nperson uses.\n  Nothing in TFTA deals with National Security Letters, which allow \ncertain records to be subpoenaed and includes an automatic \nnondisclosure requirement.\n  I happen to support the PATRIOT and believe that it should not be \nallowed to expire. Nevertheless, with this amendment, I have deferred \nthat debate. This amendment does not involve the PATRIOT Act or the \ndebates about it. The only way that one can object to this amendment as \n``controversial'' is if one is willing to define all antiterror \nlegislation as ``controversial.'' In a post-9/11 world, with continuing \nthreats to the U.S. homeland--and clear gaps in some of our antiterror \nlaws--such a presumption against all antiterror legislation would be \ndeeply irresponsible. Fixing obvious flaws in our laws, and giving \nantiterror investigators the tools that they need, should not be \ncontroversial.\n  Much of TFTA is also in the House of Representatives' 9/11 Commission \nbill. Approximately half of the provisions of TFTA already have been \nincluded by the House of Representatives in their bill implementing the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. For example, the House bill \nalready contains the ``Moussaoui fix,'' which allows FISA warrants for \nlone-wolf terrorists--Section 412 of TFTA and section 2001 of H.R. 10.; \nnew offenses for hoaxes relating to terrorist crimes or the deaths of \nU.S. soldiers--Section 416 of TFTA and section 2021 of H.R. 10.; \nincreased penalties for obstruction of justice in terrorism \ninvestigations--Section 417 of TFTA and section 2023 of H.R. 10.; \nauthorization to share grand-jury information with state and local \ngovernments--Section 423(b) of TFTA and section 2191 of H.R. 10.; \nimprovements to and expansion of the material-support statute--Section \n424 of TFTA and section 2043 of H.R. 10.; a new offense targeted at \nthose who receive military-type training in terrorist camps--Section \n425 of TFTA and 2042 of H.R. 10.; expansion of the weapons-of-mass-\ndestruction laws--Section 426 of TFTA and section 2052 of H.R. 10.; and \nnew laws targeted at those who aid rogue states' nuclear \nproliferation--Section 427 of TFTA and section 2053 of H.R. 10.\n  In all these respects, my amendment is substantially identical to the \nHouse bill. The amendment thus helps to bring the Senate bill into line \nwith the House bill, lessening the need for a protracted conference and \navoiding delay in enacting this legislation.\n  TFTA directly implements a number of the key recommendations and \naddresses key concerns of the 9/11 Commission. The Report of the \nSeptember 11 Commission recommends that Congress address a number of \ndeficiencies in our nation's preparedness against a terrorist attack. \nThe underlying bill that we are considering responds to many of those \nrecommendations. This amendment addresses others.\n  The 9/11 Commission Report recommends action to address, among other \nthings, the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and their \nproliferation; the vulnerabilities of our seaports and mass-transit \nsystems; the need for improved information sharing; the need to address \nterrorist finance; the threat posed by sanctuaries where terrorists \noperate training camps; and the need for improved information sharing. \nThe report also discusses the problems created by terrorist hoaxes, and \nthe legal barriers encountered in the pre-September 11 investigation of \nsuspected hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui.\n\n  TFTA addresses every one of these \n9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  TFTA's provisions and the matters that it address have been \nextensively reviewed in congressional hearings. Every provision of TFTA \npreviously has either been introduced as a bill in the House or Senate \nor addresses a matter that has been the subject of a committee hearing. \nCollectively, the provisions of TFTA have been the subject of 9 \nseparate hearings before House and Senate committees and have been the \nsubject of 4 separate committee reports. In addition, the entire bill \nwas reviewed at a September 13 hearing before the Senate Subcommittee \non Terrorism. At that hearing, law professor Jonathan Turley testified \nthat every one of TFTA's provisions would be upheld as constitutional \nby the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  TFTA primarily consists of all or part of 11 bills currently pending \nin the House and Senate. Collectively, as of July 19, 2004--the day \nthat TFTA was introduced--the bills included in TFTA have been pending \nbefore Congress for 12 years, 10 months, and 28 days. No one can \ncontend that TFTA and its provisions have been ``rushed through'' the \nCongress.\n  TFTA has the support of antiterrorism experts across the ideological \nspectrum. The Justice Department, in its September 13 testimony on TFTA \nbefore the Terrorism Subcommittee, expressed its strong support for the \nbill. Hearing witnesses Barry Sabin--the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision's Counterterrorism Section--and Dan Bryant, the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Policy--made clear in their \njoint written testimony the Justice Department's view that the ``Tools \nto Fight Terrorism Act of 2004 makes well-considered, urgently needed \nchanges to current law, and would greatly aid law enforcement and \nintelligence officials in their common mission to prevent terrorist \nattacks and prosecute those who would do us harm. The new tools \nprovided by the TFTA will prevent--terrorist--attacks and will make \nAmerica safer.''\n  At the Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on TFTA, support for the bill \nalso was voiced by George Washington University law professor Jonathan \nTurley, a national-security expert who often has been critical of the \nJustice Department's conduct of the war on terror. In addition to a \nlarge number of academic works in the areas of national-security and \nconstitutional law, Professor Turley has represented clients in a \nvariety of high-profile national security cases in both criminal and \ncivil courts, including espionage cases in both federal and military \ncourts. In his testimony before my subcommittee, Professor Turley noted \nthat he ``also [has] been a vocal critic of some of the measures taken \nafter September 11th on constitutional and policy grounds.''\n  This is what Professor Turley had to say about the TFTA in his \ntestimony:\n\n       The Tools to Fight Terrorism Act of 2004 . . . contains \n     many beneficial changes that will increase the ability of the \n     government to pursue terrorists while preserving necessary \n     guarantees for civil liberties.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While we must be cautious not to legislate out of a \n     reflective impulse, September 11th exposed a number of \n     vulnerabilities and gaps in our legal and intelligence \n     systems that remain only partially addressed. This Act \n     continues to work to close those gaps and to accommodate the \n     interests of the Executive Branch in pursuing, prosecuting, \n     and (hopefully) deterring terrorists.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The vast majority of the[] provisions [of TFTA] are matters \n     that, in my view, should receive general support as balanced \n     and necessary measures.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       TFTA should be a matter for general consensus rather than \n     division among civil libertarians and advocates of national \n     security interests. . . . [W]e need to recognize the \n     improvements in this Act and the good-faith\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\n     changes that have been made by members seeking a fair balance \n     in the legislation.\n\n  In one part of his testimony before my subcommittee, Professor Turley \nalso recommended a change to a part of the bill--in order to better \nprotect civil liberties. He recommended that, if the FBI is given \nsubpoena authority for terrorism investigations, it also be required to \nreport on the use of that authority. The amendment that I offer today \nincorporates this recommendation--it would require the FBI to report to \nCongress on the number of subpoenas that it issues pursuant to this new \nauthority, and the circumstances under which those subpoenas are \nissued.\n  I will next discuss the provisions of this amendment--and how they \nhelp to address the recommendations and concerns raised by the 9/11 \nCommission, and what others have said about these provisions.\n  The Moussaoui fix: The case of suspected 9/11 conspirator Zacarias \nMoussaoui is discussed extensively in the 9/11 Commission Report. \nMoussaoui, you will recall, is the Al Qaeda operative who was arrested \nby Minneapolis FBI agents several weeks before the September 11 \nattacks. That summer, instructors at a Minnesota flight school became \nsuspicious when Moussaoui, with little apparent knowledge of flying, \nasked to be taught to pilot a 747. The instructors contacted the \nMinneapolis office of the FBI, which immediately suspected that \nMoussaoui might be a terrorist.\n  The hearings conducted by the 9/11 Commission raised some agonizing \nquestions about the FBI's pursuit of Moussaoui. Commissioner Richard \nBen-Veniste noted the possibility that the Moussaoui investigation \ncould have allowed the United States to ``possibly disrupt the [9/11] \nplot.'' Commissioner Bob Kerrey even suggested that with better use of \nthe information gleaned from Moussaoui, the ``conspiracy would have \nbeen rolled up.'' And Commissioner Jamie Gorelick followed up by asking \nwhether more could have been done to allow FBI agents to ``break \nthrough the barriers'' to their investigation of Moussaoui.\n  After the September 11 attacks, when FBI agents finally were allowed \nto search Moussaoui, they discovered information in his belongings that \nlinked him to two of the actual 9/11 hijackers, and to a high-level \norganizer of the attacks who later was arrested in Pakistan.\n  The 9/11 Commissioners are right to ask whether more could have been \ndone to pursue this case. The problem is that, given the state of the \nlaw at the time, the answer to that question is probably no. In fact, \ngiven the state of the law today, the answer to the question still \nwould be no.\n  FBI agents were blocked from searching Moussaoui because an outdated \nrequirement of the 1978 FISA statute. FISA sets rules for searches \nconducted for intelligence investigations. As the 9/11 Commission \nReport notes, the FBI field office was unable to obtain a FISA warrant \nfor Moussaoui because it lacked information linking him to a known \nterror group. As the Report states:\n\n       Minneapolis agents ``sought a special warrant under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to [search Moussaoui]. \n     To do so, however, the FBI needed to demonstrate probable \n     cause that Moussaoui was an agent of a foreign power, a \n     demonstration that [is] . . . a statutory requirement for a \n     FISA warrant. The agent did not have sufficient information \n     to connect Moussaoui to a foreign power.\n\n  Current law simply does not allow searches of apparent lone-wolf \nterrorists such as Zacarias Moussaoui--even if the FBI can show \nprobable cause to believe that the person is involved in international \nterrorism.\n  My amendment would correct this problem. Section 412 gives the FBI \nclear authority to conduct a search or surveillance under FISA when it \nhas probable cause to believe that the target is engaged in or \npreparing for international terrorism. This new authority would not \nrequire FBI to also link the suspect to a particular terrorist group.\n  It is inevitable that Islamist terrorists will try again to attack \nthe United States. As agonizing as it is today to review why we did not \nprevent the September 11 attacks, imagine if it happened again. Imagine \nif another attack occurred--and another review commission found that \ncritical FBI investigations again were undermined by the lack of FISA \nauthority to monitor and search lone-wolf terrorists. We simply cannot \nlet that happen. We must ensure that today's FBI agents are not \nhampered by the same unnecessary barriers that hurt the efforts of the \nMinneapolis agents in August of 2001.\n  Process: A bill that is substantially identical to section 412 first \nwas introduced in the Senate by Senator Schumer and me on June 5, 2002. \nWe reintroduced the same provision in the 108th Congress. That bill--S. \n113--was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee in March 2003, \nand was approved by the full Senate by a vote of 90-4 in May 2003. A \nsubstantially identical provision also has been included in a House \nbill introduced by Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Goss--and is included in \nthe House 9/11 Commission bill as section 2001. The Moussaoui fix also \nhas been the subject of two hearings--one in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on July 31, 2002, and one in the House Crime Subcommittee on \nMay 18, 2004.\n  Section 412 is substantially identical to section 2001 of the House \nof Representatives' 9/11 Commission bill.\n  Weapons of Mass Destruction and Shoulder-Fired Antiaircraft Rockets: \nThe 9/11 Commission Report notes that ``al Qaeda has tried to acquire \nor make weapons of mass destruction for at least ten years. . . . \nPreventing the proliferation of these weapons warrants a maximum \neffort.'' The Report also discusses ``Pakistan's illicit trade and \n[the] nuclear smuggling networks of Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. \nKhan.'' The Report recommends that the U.S. work with other nations \n``to develop laws and an international legal regime with universal \njurisdiction to enable the capture, interdiction, and prosecution of \nsuch smugglers by any state in the world.''\n  Sections 426 and 427 and subtitle B of my amendment all are directed \nat preventing terrorists from gaining access to weapons of mass \ndestruction. Section 427 makes it a crime to participate in or provide \nmaterial support to a nuclear-weapons program, or other weapons-of-\nmass-destruction program, of a designated terrorist organization or \nstate sponsor of terrorism. There would be extraterritorial \njurisdiction for an offense under this provision. Section 426 would \namend the federal weapons-of-mass-destruction statute to cover attacks \non property and would broaden the bases for federal jurisdiction under \nthat statute. Subtitle B is designed to deter the unlawful possession \nand use of atomic weapons, radiological dispersal devices, shoulder-\nfired rockets, and the variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox).\n  In his testimony about these provisions before the Terrorism \nSubcommittee, Professor Jonathan Turley had this to say:\n\n       [Section 426, the WMD-statute provision] would close \n     current loopholes in the interest of national security and \n     does not materially affect civil liberty interests.\n       [Section 427] would criminalize the participation in \n     programs involving special nuclear material, atomic weapons, \n     or weapons of mass destruction outside of the United States. \n     This new crime with extraterritorial jurisdiction is an \n     obvious response to recent threats identified by this country \n     and other allies like Pakistan. The obvious value of such a \n     law would be hard to overstate. . . . It is important for the \n     purposes of our extraterritorial enforcement efforts to have \n     a specific crime on the books to address this form of \n     misconduct.\n       [With regard to subtitle B--the new shoulder-fired rockets \n     proscription], [g]iven the enormous threats to our country \n     from such weapons, these increased penalties are manifestly \n     reasonable. . . . While it is certainly possible that a \n     defendant could be in possession of a MANPADS as part of arms \n     trafficking or some other motive than terrorism, this is \n     clearly one of the most likely forms of terrorist conduct.\n\n  Process: Sections 426 and 427 of my amendment are identical to \nsections 2052 and 2053 of the House 9/11 Commission bill. These--and \nthe new penalties for possession of shoulder-fired rockets and other \ndangerous weapons--also are identical to legislation that Senator \nCornyn introduced earlier this year.\n  Mass-Transportation and Seaport Security: The 9/11 Commission Report \nrecommends that the U.S. government ``identify and evaluate the \ntransportation assets that need to be protected, set risk-based \npriorities for defending them, select the most practical and cost-\neffective ways of doing so, and then develop a plan . . . to implement \nthe effort.'' While noting the continuing threat to aviation, the \nReport\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\nalso emphasizes that ``[o]pportunities to do harm are as great, or \ngreater, in maritime or surface transportation''--and that ``railroads \nand mass transit'' are particularly difficult to protect against \nterrorism.\n\n  Subtitles C and D of my amendment address the unique challenges of \nproviding security on mass-transportation systems and at seaports by \nupdating current criminal offenses and creating new offenses that are \ntailored to these venues.\n  Here is what Professor Turley had to say about the seaport-security \nprovision during the hearing on TFTA:\n\n       [Subtitle D] addresses a weakness in our domestic security \n     system that has been repeatedly criticized as perhaps the \n     country's single greatest threat: seaport security. While \n     much remains to be done in terms of real security \n     improvements at seaports, [subtitle D] represents one of the \n     most significant legal reforms in this area.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While many of [the acts of violence proscribed by TFTA] can \n     be currently prosecuted under other laws, [subtitle D] would \n     create a tailored series of offenses affecting seaports and \n     seagoing vessels. For example, one important addition would \n     be a crime for knowingly transporting dangerous material for \n     a terrorist operation or a terrorist. This new crime in \n     Section [455] will serve to increase the expected deterrent \n     for transporters. Currently, a transporter can be prosecuted \n     as a co-conspirator as well as charged with false statements \n     in many cases. However, Section [455] would define a crime \n     specifically with this type of opportunistic conduct in mind. \n     For a prosecutor, such a tailored law makes a case more \n     compelling for a jury.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       These laws give the Executive Branch more flexibility and \n     options in dealing with misconduct at our seaports. It could \n     not be more timely or more justified given recent warnings \n     from security experts.\n\n  Process: Subtitles C and D are identical to bills introduced this \nyear by Senators Sessions and Biden, respectively. The Sessions bill \nwas the subject of a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nApril 8, 2004. The Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism held a hearing on \nthe need to improve security at U.S. seaports on January 27 of this \nyear.\n  Information Sharing: The 9/11 Commission Report recommends that \n``information procedures should provide incentives for sharing, to \nrestore a better balance between security and shared knowledge.'' The \nReport also recommends that the President ``coordinate the resolution \nof the legal, policy, and technical issues across agencies to create a \n`trusted information network' ''--and that this information-sharing \nnetwork and the FBI ``build a reciprocal relationship, in which state \nand local governments understand what information they are looking for \nand, in return, receive some of the information being developed.''\n  Sections 422 and 423 of my amendment act on these recommendations by \nimproving the FBI's ability to share intelligence information that has \nbeen obtained under existing authorities. Section 422 creates a uniform \nstandard under which the FBI would disseminate intelligence information \nto other federal agencies. Under current law, several different \nstatutes govern the circumstances under which the FBI may disseminate \nintelligence information to other federal agencies. Some of these \nstatutes anomalously place restrictions on information sharing with \nother federal agencies that are greater than the restrictions applied \nto non-federal agencies. This section allows dissemination of \nintelligence information under uniform guidelines developed by the \nAttorney General.\n  Section 423 amends current law to make clear that national-security-\nrelated information may be shared with relevant Federal, State, and \nlocal officials regardless of whether the investigation that produced \nthe information is characterized as a ``criminal'' investigation or a \n``national security'' investigation. This section also would authorize \nthe sharing of grand-jury information with appropriate state and local \nauthorities.\n  I do not think one can overstate the importance of information \nsharing--of tearing down the walls that prevent different parts of the \ngovernment from exchanging intelligence and working together in the war \non terror.\n  A graphic illustration of the importance of tearing down the legal \nwalls between different terror investigators is provided by another \npre-September 11 investigation. Like the Moussaoui case, this \ninvestigation also came tantalizing close to substantially disrupting \nor even stopping the 9/11 plot--and also ultimately was blocked by a \nflaw in our antiterror laws. The investigation that I am talking about \ninvolved Khalid Al Midhar, one of the suicide hijackers of American \nAirlines Flight 77, which was crashed into the Pentagon, killing 58 \npassengers and crew and 125 people on the ground.\n  An account of the investigation of Midhar is provided in the 9/11 \nCommission's Staff Statement No. 10. That statement notes as follows:\n\n       During the summer of 2001 [an FBI official] . . . found [a] \n     cable reporting that Khalid Al Mihdhar had a visa to the \n     United States. A week later she found the cable reporting \n     that Mihdhar's visa application--what was later discovered to \n     be his first application--listed New York as his destination. \n     . . . The FBI official grasped the significance of this \n     information.\n       The FBI official and an FBI analyst working the case \n     promptly met with an INS representative at FBI Headquarters. \n     On August 22 INS told them that Mihdhar had entered the \n     United States on January 15, 2000, and again on July 4, 2001. \n     . . . The FBI agents decided that if Mihdhar was in the \n     United States, he should be found.\n\n  These alert agents immediately grasped the danger that Khalid Al \nMidhar posed to the United States--and immediately initiated an effort \nto track him down. Unfortunately, at the time, the law was not on their \nside. The Joint Inquiry Report of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees describes what happened next:\n\n       Even in late August 2001, when the CIA told the FBI, State, \n     INS, and Customs that Khalid al-Mihdhar, Nawaf al-Hazmi, and \n     two other ``Bin Laden-related individuals'' were in the \n     United States, FBI Headquarters refused to accede to the New \n     York field office recommendation that a criminal \n     investigation be opened, which might allow greater \n     resources to be dedicated to the search for the future \n     hijackers. . . . FBI attorneys took the position that \n     criminal investigators ``CAN NOT'' (emphasis original) be \n     involved and that criminal information discovered in the \n     intelligence case would be ``passed over the wall'' \n     according to proper procedures. An agent in the FBI's New \n     York field office responded by e-mail, saying: ``Whatever \n     has happened to this, someday someone will die and, wall \n     or not, the public will not understand why we were not \n     more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain problems.''\n\n  The 9/11 Commission staff report assesses the ultimate impact of \nthese legal barriers:\n\n       Many witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been \n     found, there was nothing the agents could have done except \n     follow him onto the planes. We believe this is incorrect. \n     Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held for immigration \n     violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case. \n     Investigation or interrogation of these individuals, and \n     their travel and financial activities, also may have yielded \n     evidence of connections to other participants in the 9/11 \n     plot. In any case, the opportunity did not arise.\n\n  Congress must do what it can now to make sure that something like \nthis does not happen again--that arbitrary, seemingly minor \nbureaucratic barriers are not allowed to undermine our best leads \ntoward uncovering an attack on the United States. Sections 422 and 423 \nof my amendment would do just that.\n  Process: Subsection (b) of section 423 is included in H.R. 10, the \nHouse of Representatives' 9/11 Commission bill. Sections 422 and 423 \nboth are identical to a bill that has been introduced by Senator \nChambliss.\n  Subpoena Authority: The bill that the Senate is now considering \nalready authorizes subpoena authority. Section 141(f)(5) of the bill \nauthorizes the National Intelligence Authority's Inspector General to \nissue subpoenas for his investigations. It also authorizes the \nInspector to go to federal court to enforce his subpoenas if a \nrecipient refuses to comply with them. Section 211(g) of the bill also \nauthorizes the new Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to issue \nadministrative subpoenas and to seek their judicial enforcement.\n  I agree with the bill's judgment that subpoena authority can be an \nimportant investigative tool. For this reason, section 415 of my \namendment authorizes the Attorney General to issue judicially \nenforceable subpoenas in an ``investigation of a Federal crime of \nterrorism.''\n  Rachel Brand, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the \nJustice Department's Office of Legal Policy, described the need for \nsubpoena authority in terrorism investigations\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\nin a hearing before my subcommittee on June 22 of this year. Ms. Brand \nnoted:\n\n       Although grand jury subpoenas are a sufficient tool in many \n     investigations, there are circumstances in which an \n     administrative subpoena would save precious minutes or hours \n     in a terrorism investigation. For example, the ability to use \n     an administrative subpoena will eliminate delays caused by \n     factors such as the unavailability of an Assistant United \n     States Attorney to immediately issue a grand-jury subpoena, \n     especially in rural areas; the time it takes to contact an \n     Assistant United States Attorney in the context of a time-\n     sensitive investigation; the lack of a grand jury sitting at \n     the moment the documents are needed (under federal law, the \n     ``return date'' for a grand-jury subpoena must be on a day \n     the grand jury is sitting); or the absence of an empaneled \n     grand jury in the judicial district where the investigation \n     is taking place, a rare circumstance that would prevent a \n     grand-jury subpoena from being issued at all.\n       To appreciate the potential importance of an administrative \n     subpoena in a terrorism case, consider the following \n     hypothetical example. On Friday afternoon, counter-terrorism \n     investigators learn that members of an al Qaeda cell have \n     purchased bomb-making materials from a chemical company. They \n     want to obtain records relating to the purchase that may \n     reveal what chemicals the terrorists bought, as well as \n     delivery records that might reveal the terrorists' location. \n     Investigators reach a prosecutor, who issues a grand jury \n     subpoena for those records. But because the grand jury is not \n     scheduled to meet again until Monday morning and the \n     recipient of a grand jury subpoena is not required to produce \n     the records until the next time the grand jury meets, \n     investigators may not be able to obtain the information for \n     three days during which time the al Qaeda cell may have \n     executed its plan. If investigators had the authority to \n     issue an administrative subpoena, they could obtain the \n     records immediately and neutralize the cell.\n\n  A recent paper issued by the Republican Policy Committee points out \nhow anomalous it is that the FBI does not have subpoena authority for \nterrorism investigations. As that report notes, ``[c]urrent provisions \nof federal law grant [administrative-subpoena] authority to most \ngovernment departments and agencies.'' Moreover, ``[t]hese authorities \nare not restricted to high-profile agencies conducting life-or-death \ninvestigations.'' As the paper notes, federal law currently authorizes \npostal inspectors to issue administrative subpoenas when investigating \nany ``criminal matters related to the Postal Service and the mails.'' \nSimilarly, the Small Business Administration is empowered to use \nadministrative subpoenas to investigate criminal activities under the \nSmall Business Act, such as embezzlement and fraud. The Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has administrative-subpoena \nauthority for investigations of violations of the immigration laws. And \nDEA agents have subpoena authority for criminal investigations under \nthe Controlled Substances Act.\n  As the RPC Policy Paper concludes, ``One can hardly contend that \nfederal investigators should be able to issue administrative subpoenas \nto investigate Mohammed Atta if they suspect that he broke into a \nmailbox--but should not have the same authority if they suspect he is \nplotting to fly airplanes into buildings.''\n  Professor Jonathan Turley also commented on TFTA's subpoenas \nprovision in his testimony before the Terrorism Subcommittee. He \nstated:\n\n       There is little reason to believe that a [Judicially \n     Enforceable Terrorism Subpoena] provision would be \n     unconstitutional.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Much is made [by some critics] of the shift from a grand-\n     jury subpoena to a JETS system. However, the term grand-jury \n     subpoena is misleading in that it is not issued by a grand \n     jury but a federal prosecutor. ``[A] grand jury subpoena gets \n     its name from the intended use of the . . . evidence, not \n     from the source of its issuance.'' Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d \n     74, 80 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Administrative subpoenas are \n     currently used in dozens of areas and they have been upheld \n     by the United States Supreme Court. It is extremely rare for \n     a federal prosecutor to deny such a request from the FBI and \n     the elimination of an Assistant United States Attorney from \n     the process is not likely to produce a significant change in \n     the level of review.\n\n  Professor Turley also added: ``I would strongly encourage the Senate \nto couple any JETS provision with a close oversight process to monitor \nthe number and nature of subpoenas issued under the new law.'' As I \npreviously noted, the amendment that I offer today implements this \nrecommendation: it includes a requirement that the FBI report on the \nnumber of subpoenas that it employs under the new authority and the \ncircumstances of their issue.\n  Terrorist Training Camps: The 9/11 Commission Report recommends that \nthe U.S. government ``identify and prioritize actual or potential \nterrorist sanctuaries. For each, it should have a realistic strategy to \nkeep possible terrorists insecure and on the run, using all elements of \nnational power.'' The Report explains that such sanctuaries pose a \nthreat because they provide terrorist groups with the ``opportunity and \nspace to recruit, train, and select operatives''--and that the \nhospitable environment in the United States also allowed this country \nto be used for terrorist training and exercises.\n  Section 425 of my amendment would make it a federal offense to \nknowingly receive military-type training from or on behalf of a \ndesignated foreign terrorist organization. This provision applies \nextraterritorially to U.S. nationals, permanent residents, stateless \npersons whose habitual residence is the United States, or a person who \nis brought into or found in the United States.\n  The Justice Department testified in favor of this provision at the \nTerrorism Subcommittee's hearing on the TFTA. The joint statement of \nMessrs. Sabin and Bryant notes that:\n\n       It is critical that the United States stem the flow of \n     recruits to terrorist training camps. A danger is posed to \n     the vital foreign policy interests and national security of \n     the United States whenever a person knowingly receives \n     military-type training from a designated terrorist \n     organization or persons acting on its behalf. Such an \n     individual stands ready to further the malicious intent of \n     the terrorist organization through terrorist activity that \n     threatens the security of United States nationals or the \n     national security of the United States. Moreover, a trainee's \n     mere participation in a terrorist organization's training \n     camp benefits the organization as a whole. For example, a \n     trainee's participation in group drills at a training camp \n     helps to improve both the skills of his fellow trainees and \n     the efficacy of his instructors' training methods. \n     Additionally, by attending a terrorist training camp, an \n     individual lends critical moral support to other trainees and \n     the organization as a whole, support that is essential to the \n     health and vitality of the organization.\n\n  Professor Turley had the following to say about this provision of \nTFTA in his testimony before the Terrorism Subcommittee:\n\n       This proposal would fill a gap in our laws revealed by \n     recent cases, like that of Jose Padilla, where citizens have \n     trained at terrorist camps. . . .  The proposed crime has \n     been narrowly tailored to require a clear knowledge element \n     as well as a reasonable definition of military-type training. \n     The United States has an obvious interest in criminalizing \n     such conduct and to deter citizens who are contemplating such \n     training. In my view, it raises no legitimate issue of free \n     association or free speech given the criminal nature of the \n     organization. Most importantly, given the use of these camps \n     to recruit and indoctrinate such citizens as Padilla and John \n     Walker Lindh, this new criminal offense is responsive to a \n     clear and present danger for the country.\n\n  Section 425 of my amendment is identical to section 2042 of the House \nof Representatives' 9/11 Commission bill.\n  Terrorist Hoaxes: The 9/11 Commission Report notes at several places \nthat false information about terrorist threats influenced key events on \nSeptember 11, 2001: possibly ``a false report of a third plane \napproaching'' influenced fire crews' decisions on the ground in New \nYork City on that day, and crisis managers were forced to sort out ``a \nnumber of unnerving false alarms'' immediately after the attacks.\n  The Justice Department also has commented on the harm caused by false \ninformation and terrorist hoaxes. In its testimony on the TFTA, the \nDepartment noted:\n\n       Since September 11, hoaxes have seriously disrupted \n     people's lives and needlessly diverted law-enforcement and \n     emergency-services resources. In the wake of the anthrax \n     attacks in the fall of 2001, for example, a number of \n     individuals mailed unidentified white powder, intending for \n     the recipient to believe it was anthrax. Many people were \n     inconvenienced, and emergency responders were forced to waste \n     a great deal of time and effort. Similarly, in a time when \n     those in uniform are making tremendous sacrifices for the \n     country, several people have received hoax phone calls \n     reporting the death of a loved one serving in Iraq or \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Section 416 of my amendment is intended to reduce the flow of false \ninformation about terrorist or national-security-related events by \nmaking it a criminal offense to knowingly convey false information \nabout terrorist\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\ncrimes or the death or injury of a U.S. soldier during war--if such \nmisinformation is conveyed under circumstances where it may reasonably \nbe believed.\n  Professor Turley, at the Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on TFTA, \ncommented that:\n\n       This new provision would create a serious deterrent to a \n     type of misconduct that routinely places the lives of \n     emergency personnel at risk and costs millions of dollars in \n     unrecouped costs for the federal and state governments. Since \n     a terrorist seeks first and foremost to terrorize, there is \n     precious [little] difference between a hoaxster and a \n     terrorist when the former seeks to shut down a business or \n     a community with a fake threat. . . . This provision \n     responds to the increase in this form of insidious \n     misconduct and correctly defines it as criminal conduct.\n\n  Process: A bill that is substantially identical to section 416 first \nwas introduced almost three years ago by Representative Lamar Smith on \nNovember 11, 2001. That proposal was the subject of a hearing before \nthe House Crime Subcommittee on November 7, 2001. The bill was reported \nby the House Judiciary Committee on November 29, 2001, which issued \nReport No. 107-306 for the bill. The Smith bill was then unanimously \napproved by the House of Representatives on December 12, 2001. \nRepresentative Smith reintroduced the bill in this Congress. The House \nCrime Subcommittee held another hearing on the proposal on July 10, \n2003, and the Judiciary Committee issued Report No. 108-505 for the new \nSmith bill. Also, Senator Hatch has introduced a version of this \nproposal in the Senate.\n  Section 416 of my amendment is nearly identical to section 2022 of \nthe House of Representatives' 9/11 Commission bill.\n  Financial and Material Support to Terrorists: The 9/11 Commission \nReport states in its recommendations that ``vigorous efforts to track \nterrorist financing must remain front and center in U.S. \ncounterterrorism efforts.''\n  Subtitle E of my amendment, the ``Combating Money Laundering and \nTerrorist Financing Act,'' expands the list of predicate offenses for \nmoney laundering to include burglary and embezzlement, operation of an \nillegal money-transmitting business, and offenses related to alien \nsmuggling, child exploitation, and obscenity that were enacted or \namended by the Protect Act. It also amends current law to prohibit \nconcealing having provided financing while knowing that it has been or \nwill be provided to terrorists.\n  Section 424 of my amendment expands existing prohibitions on \nproviding material support to terrorist groups. This provision makes it \na crime to provide material support to any crime of international or \ndomestic terrorism, and expands federal jurisdiction over such \noffenses.\n  The Justice Department emphasized the importance of the material-\nsupport statute in its joint statement on the TFTA before the Terrorism \nSubcommittee:\n\n       The TFTA . . . improves current law by clarifying several \n     aspects of the material support statutes. This is another key \n     tool in preventing terrorism. As the Department of Justice \n     has previously indicated, ``a key element of the Department's \n     strategy for winning the war against terrorism has been to \n     use the material support statutes to prosecute aggressively \n     those individuals who supply terrorists with the support and \n     resources they need to survive . . . . The Department seeks \n     to identify and apprehend terrorists before they can carry \n     out their plans, and the material support statutes are a \n     valuable tool for prosecutors seeking to bring charges \n     against and incapacitate terrorists before they are able to \n     cause death and destruction.''\n\n  The 9/11 Commission Report also emphasizes the need ``to ensure \nprotection of civil liberties'' during the war on terrorism. In order \nto address concerns raised by some courts and litigants about the \nchilling effect of the current material-support statute, section 424 of \nthe amendment clarifies what it means to provide ``training,'' \n``personnel,'' and ``expert advice or assistance'' to a terrorist \ngroup.\n  Professor Turley, in his Terrorism Subcommittee testimony on TFTA, \nsaid of section 424 that ``[t]his proposal would actually improve the \ncurrent federal law by correcting gaps and ambiguities that have led to \nrecent judicial reversals. In that sense, the proposal can be viewed as \na slight benefit to civil liberties by removing a dangerous level of \nambiguity in the law.''\n  A provision identical to section 424 of my amendment appears in the \nHouse of Representatives 9/11 Commission bill as section 2043.\n  Presumption of No Bail for Terrorists: Section 413 of my amendment \nwould add terrorists to the category of criminal defendants for whom \nthere is a presumption of no bail. Under current law, a criminal \nsuspect will be denied bail in federal court if the government shows \nthat there is a serious risk that the suspect will flee, obstruct \njustice, or injure or threaten a witness or juror. The judge must \npresume this showing is present if the suspect is charged with a crime \nof violence, a drug crime carrying a potential sentence of ten years or \nmore, any crime that carries a potential sentence of life or the death \npenalty, or the suspect previously has been convicted of two or more \nsuch offenses. Section 413 would add terrorist offenses to this list--\njudges would be required to presume that facts requiring a denial of \nbail are present. This is only a presumption--the terror suspect still \ncould attempt to show that he is not a flight risk or potential threat \nto jurors or witnesses.\n  The Justice Department testified as to the importance of this \nprovision at the Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on TFTA:\n\n       Current law provides that federal defendants who are \n     accused of serious crimes, including many drug offenses and \n     violent crimes, are presumptively denied pretrial release \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3142(e). But the law does not apply \n     this presumption to those charged with many terrorism \n     offenses. To presumptively detain suspected drug traffickers \n     and violent criminals before trial, but not suspected \n     terrorists, defies common sense.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       This omission has presented authorities real obstacles to \n     prosecuting the war on terrorism, as Michael Battle, U.S. \n     Attorney for the Western District of New York, testified \n     before this subcommittee on June 22. In the recent \n     ``Lackawanna Six'' terrorism case in his district, \n     prosecutors moved for pre-trial detention of the defendants, \n     most of whom were charged with (and ultimately pled guilty \n     to) providing material support to al Qaeda. It was expected \n     that the defendants would oppose the motion. What followed \n     was not expected, however. Because the law does not allow \n     presumptive pre-trial detention in terrorism cases, \n     prosecutors had to participate and prevail in a nearly three-\n     week hearing on the issue of detention, and were forced to \n     disclose a substantial amount of their evidence against the \n     defendants prematurely, at a time when the investigation was \n     still ongoing. Moreover, the presiding magistrate judge did \n     in fact authorize the release of one defendant, who, it was \n     later learned, had lied to the FBI about the fact that he had \n     met with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.\n       The Lackawanna Six case illustrates the real-life problems \n     the absence of presumptive pre-trial detention has posed to \n     law enforcement. But this shortcoming in the law has also \n     enabled terrorists to flee from justice altogether. For \n     example, a Hezbollah supporter was charged long ago with \n     providing material support to that terrorist organization. \n     Following his release on bail, he fled the country.\n\n  The suspect described above eventually was recaptured by the United \nStates 6 years after his escape. During that time, he was not a \nparticipant in a terrorist attack against the United States--but he \ncould have been.\n  Jonathan Turley also commented on section 413 in his testimony at the \nTerrorism Subcommittee hearing on TFTA. He stated:\n\n       [Section 413] would create a presumption against bail for \n     accused terrorists. Under this amendment, such a presumption \n     could be rebutted by the accused, but the court would begin \n     with a presumption that the accused represents a risk of \n     flight or danger to society. This has been opposed by various \n     groups, who point to the various terrorist cases where \n     charges were dismissed or rejected, including the recent \n     Detroit scandal where prosecutorial abuse was strongly \n     condemned by the Court. I do not share the opposition to this \n     provision because I believe that, while there have been \n     abuses in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism \n     cases, the proposed change sought by the Justice Department \n     is neither unconstitutional nor unreasonable.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       This proposal would not impose a categorical denial of bail \n     but a presumption against bail in terrorism cases. Congress \n     has a clearly reasonable basis for distinguishing terrorism \n     from other crimes in such a presumption. In my view, this \n     would be clearly constitutional.\n       While I have been critical of the policies of Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft, I do not share the view of some of my \n     colleagues in the civil liberties community in opposition to \n     this change. There is currently a presumption against \n     pretrial release for a variety of crimes in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     3142(e), including major drug crimes. It seems quite bizarre \n     to have such a presumption in drug cases but not terrorism \n     cases.\n\n  Use of FISA in immigration proceedings: The 9/11 Commission Report\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\nrecommends that the United States ``combine terrorist travel \nintelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to \nintercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and constrain \nterrorist mobility.'' The report also states that ``[t]he challenge for \nnational security in an age of terrorism is to prevent the very few \npeople who may pose overwhelming risks from entering or remaining in \nthe United States undetected.''\n  Section 419 of my amendment is designed to allow the federal \ngovernment to more readily employ intelligence information to keep \nsuspected terrorists out of the United States. The Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act requires the government to provide notice when \ninformation obtained through FISA is used in any federal proceeding. In \n1996, Congress created an exception to this requirement for alien-\nterrorist removal proceedings. This section would extend this exception \nto all immigration proceedings--the government would be able to use \nFISA information to deny an alien a particular immigration benefit, to \nbar his reentry, or to detain him on immigration charges, all without \nrevealing that the information was obtained through FISA. Such \nauthority would be useful because in many instances, notice that \ninformation was obtained through FISA would disclose to the alien that \nhe or his associates have been the target of a FISA investigation--a \ndisclosure that effectively would compromise an ongoing investigation.\n  Professor Turley addressed this provision in his testimony before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee on the TFTA:\n\n       This provision would change the current system in which the \n     government must notify parties in an immigration case that it \n     is using information obtained through FISA. . . .\n       Section [419] was criticized recently by the American \n     Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) group as \n     ``constitutionally dubious.'' Despite my respect for AILA and \n     its work, I must disagree with the suggestion that this \n     provision might be found unconstitutional. The government is \n     allowed to use secret evidence in such proceedings and the \n     only change here is the identification of the source of such \n     secret information. . . . This provision would, in my view, \n     pass constitutional muster.\n       . . . [T]he true legal change produced by Section [419] is \n     marginal. There are good-faith reasons for the government's \n     reluctance to acknowledge an on-going FISA investigation. \n     While I oppose FISA generally, this does not appear an \n     unreasonable request from the Justice Department.\n\n  Other provisions: lifetime post-release supervision, obstruction of \njustice, denial of benefits. In his testimony on TFTA before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee, Professor Turley also had the following to say \nabout these provisions of TFTA:\n\n       [Section 414] This provision would make terrorists eligible \n     for lifetime post-release supervision. Under the current law, \n     certain individuals convicted of terrorist crimes are not \n     eligible for lifetime post-release supervision because the \n     underlying offense did not create a foreseeable risk of death \n     or serious injury. The Justice Department has objected to the \n     current language of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3583 as too restrictive \n     since there are many individuals who knowingly support \n     terrorist activities, but do so through less overtly violent \n     means, such as computer-related crimes. The purpose is only \n     to make such individuals eligible for lifetime supervision. \n     This proposal seems facially reasonable in light of the \n     sophisticated web of supporting co-conspirators working with \n     groups like Al-Qaeda.\n       [Section 417] This provision increases the penalties for \n     obstruction of justice in terrorism cases. The Justice \n     Department believes that the increase from 5 to 10 years in \n     terrorism cases is needed to show the added severity of such \n     misconduct in this context. For the purpose of full \n     disclosure, I have represented defendants charged under false \n     statement provisions like 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 and I have been \n     a critic of the abusive use of false statement charges by the \n     Justice Department in non-terrorist cases. However, seeking \n     higher penalties for obstruction in the area of terrorism is \n     not an unreasonable demand and certainly would not raise any \n     immediate constitutional problems.\n       [Section 421] This provision would deny federal benefits to \n     convicted terrorists. The denial of such benefits is \n     currently allowed under the Controlled Substances Act and \n     makes obvious sense given the nature of these crimes.\n  In conclusion, I would simply remind my colleagues that every \nprovision of TFTA has been fully explored in congressional committee \nhearings--the individual provisions of the bill have been the subject \nof nine separate hearings--and every provision of TFTA has the full \nsupport of the Department of Justice. These provisions address obvious \nand in some cases glaring gaps in our nation's antiterrorism safety \nnet. We cannot allow these problems to continue to go unaddressed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is a controversial amendment. It is sometimes \ncalled the Tools for Terrorism Act. There are 20 specific provisions of \nthis amendment. Some of them are very uncontroversial, some have become \ncontroversial. What I am proposing to do by laying this amendment down \nis begin a dialog with members of both the majority and the minority to \nsee which of them we can agree to be adopted.\n  This was the most efficient way to do that rather than independently \noffering each one seriatim. But it is my intention to work out a \nunanimous consent agreement with both sides that would result in as \nmuch of this amendment as possible, from my perspective, but in any \nevent, as much as we can agree upon, being agreed to without any \nfurther debate or votes if they are not necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the cooperation of \nthe Senator from Arizona. We would be happy to work with him on the \nthree amendments that he has laid down.\n  I do want to debate further the other amendment, his first amendment \non privacy and civil liberties oversight. That is a key amendment, and \nI do want to engage on that. However, I know that Senator Stevens is \nunder a tight timeframe for this afternoon. I would be willing to delay \nmy response to the debate of the two Senators on my side of the aisle \nuntil after Senator Stevens has had an opportunity to lay down his \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I join Senator \nCollins in thanking Senator Kyl and Senator Chambliss for offering the \namendments. I thank Senator Kyl particularly for the spirit in which he \noffered--and some of the amendments we will be able to reach agreement \non--the last amendment--the so-called tools for terrorists?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Tools to fight terrorism, as I would call it. As you \nsaid, parts of it are very controversial. As an individual Senator, \nprobably a lot of it I would support, but I particularly appreciate the \nSenator's conclusion here because neither the Senator from Arizona nor \nI want to come into a situation where we are getting this bill's fate \nswept up in controversial amendments.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator and members of both \ncaucuses to pick out the parts that there is general agreement on, and \nI believe there will be a good number of those, and make the bill \nstronger and then get it moving to adoption. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a series of requests for \ncosponsors of amendments that I have introduced. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Amendments Nos. 3826, 3827, 3829 and 3840, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up the four amendments at the \ndesk. I ask unanimous consent that each of them be read and then set \naside so we can go through calling up the four of them, and then I will \nmake some comments about them.

Mr. President, I will address the amendment first in \norder, amendment No. 3826. This is offered to clarify the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Director of the National Counterterrorism \nCenter. The bill currently states that the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center shall serve as the principal adviser to the \nPresident and the national intelligence director on joint operations \nrelated to counterterrorism.\n  This amendment strikes ``joint operations'' and inserts in lieu \nthereof ``strategic planning.'' The bill under consideration creates \nthe National Counterterrorism Center to develop and unify strategy, to \ndevelop interagency terrorism plans, not to conduct joint operations.\n  I call attention to page 83, lines 3, 9, and 10, of the committee \nprint.\n  In support of the bill under consideration, this amendment clarifies \nthe role of the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center to \nsupport planning and not conduct operations.\n  It is the intent of this amendment to make it perfectly clear that \nthe national counterterrorism director would have no control over the \nconduct of joint operations. Having the intelligence director to report \ndirectly to the President would be inappropriate. Furthermore, the \nSecretary of Defense is the principal adviser to the President on \nmilitary operations. As currently drafted, the director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center shall serve as the principal adviser to the \nPresident on joint operations. This is very unclear. Does it include \nmilitary operations? Our amendment eliminates that ambiguity by \nstriking ``joint operation'' and inserting ``strategic planning,'' \nwhich would appear to be consistent with the amendment adopted by the \ncommittee in the markup to change the directorate of operations to \ndirectorate of planning within the National Counterterrorism Center. I \nwould hope that the manager of the bill would give this amendment \nserious consideration because I think it clears up a defect in the bill \nas it is presently written.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3829\n\n  Now I will address amendment No. 3829. This amendment would delay the \nimplementation of the bill from 6 months to 1 year. I want to make it \nclear that this amendment would not delay the implementation of the \noffice of the national intelligence director or the National \nCounterterrorism Center but gives the administration 6 more months to \nimplement the many offices, councils, and changes in the intelligence \ncommunity that the bill requires.\n  We are facing an election. We do not know what the outcome of the \nelection is, but to put the burdens of this bill in the first 6 months \non the administration, whether it is the existing one or a new one, is \nentirely inappropriate. The first 6 months of a new Congress and the \nnew year of an administration go by very quickly, and I think there is \njust too much to do with regard to budget, presentation of State of the \nUnion message, so many other things, to have this implementation done \nwithin 6 months.\n  I make this recommendation because many of the individuals I have \nspoken to in the intelligence community and those who appeared before \nour Appropriations Committee suggest that executing these changes \nshould not be at an accelerated pace. Here are the important quotes \nfrom Dr. Kissinger.\n\n       What I say and what I have written should be read in \n     conjunction with a joint statement that is being issued today \n     by the following group of individuals: former Senator Boren, \n     former Senator Bradley, former Secretary of Defense Carlucci, \n     former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, former Director of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Gates, former Under \n     Secretary of Defense John Hamre, former Senator Gary Hart, \n     myself, former Senator Sam Nunn, former Senator Warren \n     Rudman, and former Secretary of State George Shultz.\n       It is obviously a bipartisan group, and we are concerned \n     that the reforms of the magnitude that are being talked about \n     and with the impact that they will have on the conduct of \n     intelligence and on the national security machinery should \n     not be rushed through in the last weeks of the congressional \n     session in the middle of a Presidential election campaign. \n     The consequences of this reform will inevitably produce \n     months and maybe years of turmoil as the adjustments are made \n     in the operating procedures of the national security \n     apparatus and of the intelligence machinery. That is inherent \n     to reform. But we should not have to explain in retrospect \n     why it was so necessary to come to a conclusion in the middle \n     of a Presidential election campaign. Whatever decisions are \n     made this week, we will have to deal with the immediate \n     terrorist challenge by the apparatus that now exists, as it \n     has already been reformed in the light of the experience of \n     September 11. So urgency should not trump substance.\n\n  From Dr. John Hamre, former Deputy Secretary of Defense:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, we are now very far along the road in this \n     debate. Unfortunately, from my perspective, the shape of this \n     debate has been driven more by political imperative than deep \n     analysis of the challenges we face in this area. We do need \n     intelligence reform, I believe. But I believe the debate to \n     date, and the proposals before the Congress, are too narrowly \n     constructed around one perceived failure of the intelligence \n     community, and that is the failure to coordinate the \n     activities of the components of the intelligence community.\n\n  Without this extra 6 months, I feel the administration would be hard-\npressed to meet the strict requirements, recommendations, and \nguidelines this bill imposes. It does not require a delay of 6 months; \nit just gives 6 more months. If they can do it in 2 months, fine, but \nwhy put a 6-month deadline when the study that is involved has a 6-\nmonth deadline? My amendment allows the President to move fast if he \nbelieves it is prudent but does not mandate a rush to finish.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which would only work \nto help the administration to execute this mission well.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3827\n\n  The amendment strikes line 20 on page 130 of the bill and all text \nthat follows to line 2 on page 153 which relates to creation of a huge \ninformation sharing network. The current occupant of the Chair will be \nvery interested in this amendment.\n  I understand the need for this office to be created, and my amendment \nwill create such an office. But, it would strike the specific \nrequirements and guidelines that the national intelligence director \nwould have to follow to establish a network for intelligence \ninformation sharing. My amendment would allow the intelligence \ncommunity, and more importantly the national intelligence director, to \nbe using the information to determine what type of network they need.\n\n[[Page S10233]]\n\n  During our Committee hearings, Dr. Henry Kissinger made the following \nanalysis:\n\n       Different components of the government have different \n     missions and priorities that cause them to assign different \n     levels of importance to protecting intelligence information. \n     Good management requires that, when there are contradictions \n     between using intelligence and protecting it, decisions are \n     made by established procedure. Sharing should be optimized, \n     not managed in detail. To attempt to prescribe all the \n     circumstance in bureaucratic or legalistic language would \n     involve so much detail and so many exceptions as to defeat \n     its own purpose.\n\n  Also, sharing of this information will not be the ultimate panacea. \nADM James Ellis, former Commander of U.S. Strategic Commander until a \nfew months ago, made the following point:\n\n       We should be wary of homogenizing centralized processes \n     that, albeit unintentionally, may suppress or filter \n     differing views. Recent op-ed pieces have noted the \n     inevitability of surprise in our past and offered as well \n     that often a surprise is a result of deficient analysis, not \n     collection or even sharing of data.\n\n  Also, from our intelligence reform hearings, Judge Richard Posner, \nfrom the 7th Circuit, Court of Appeals stated the following:\n\n       The Commission thinks the reason the bits of information \n     that might have been assembled into a mosaic spelling 9/11 \n     never came together in one place is that no one person was in \n     charge of intelligence. That is not the reason. The reason, \n     or rather, the reasons are, first, that the volume of \n     information is so vast that even with the continued rapid \n     advances in data processing it cannot be collected, stored, \n     retrieved and analyzed in a single database or even network \n     of linked databases. Second, legitimate security concerns \n     limit the degree to which confidential information can safely \n     be shared, especially given the ever-present threat of moles \n     like the infamous Aldrich Ames. And third, the different \n     intelligence services and the subunits of each service tend, \n     because information is power, to hoard it. Efforts to \n     centralize the intelligence function are likely to lengthen \n     the time it takes for intelligence and analyses to reach the \n     President, reduce diversity and competition in the gathering \n     and analysis of intelligence data, limit the number of \n     threats given serious consideration and deprive the president \n     of a range of alternative interpretations of ambiguous and \n     incomplete data--and intelligence data will usually be \n     ambiguous and incomplete.\n\n  I point out that the administration's statement, so-called SAP which \ncame from the administration, says:\n\n     the administration supports the strong information-sharing \n     authorities granted to the NID in the bill. The \n     administration is concerned that the extensive authorities \n     and responsibilities granted the Office of Management and \n     Budget to implement the information-sharing network are both \n     outside of OMB's usual responsibilities and are inconsistent \n     with the goal of ensuring an NID with effective authority to \n     manage the intelligence community. These responsibilities \n     should be granted to the NID in such a way as to remain \n     consistent with section 892 of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002.\n       The administration also believes that the detail in which \n     the legislation prescribes the network is excessive. The \n     network would be more likely to accomplish its beneficial \n     goal if the bill simply provided the authority necessary for \n     its establishment while leaving the details to be worked out \n     and altered as the circumstances require.\n\n  I am also concerned with the very ambitious schedule that the bill \ndelineates. In 90 days, just 3 months, the Director of OMB would be \nrequired to submit to the President and the Congress a description of \nthe Network, establish a director of services and conduct a review of \nrelevant current Federal agency capabilities; it would seem to me that \nwe are setting the administration up to fail with such an unreasonable \ntime frame.\n  I am also concerned about the cost. The bill estimates this could \ncost at least $50 million dollars. Where would the funds for this \nprogram come from? Also, how would they influence existing programs to \ncoordinate these activities? Currently there are not any funds \ndesignated for these activities. Would they be requested from a \nsupplemental or would they be taken from the intelligence community's \nvery tight budget?\n  Also, I was hoping that the chairman and the ranking member could \nprovide a clearer picture about the protection of civil liberties. I \nunderstand that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Boards will be included \nin discussions--but I worry about the extent to which--and I am quoting \nfrom the bill now:\n\n     private sector data, including information from owners and \n     operators of critical infrastructure, is incorporated into \n     the Network; and that the private sector is both providing \n     and receiving information.\n\n  This is another czar. We already have an intelligence czar. Now this \nprovision in this bill creates an information czar.\n  It ``requires that the national intelligence director is to set \nstandards for information technology and communication.'' By the way, \nit does not say necessarily related to intelligence--across the entire \nexecutive branch, for every Cabinet Secretary and I presume for the \nFCC.\n\n       The NID would also develop an integrated information \n     technology and communication network that ensures information \n     sharing across the entire executive branch again for every \n     Cabinet Secretary\n\nand agency, as I understand it, in the Federal Government\n\n     and with the State and local governments and the private \n     sector.\n\n  The scope of this is beyond comprehension. How can this group, now, \ncreated by the OMB, assure that privacy and civil liberties will be \nensured when there is only one person at the helm, and that person is \nselected by the OMB?\n  Am I reading the bill wrong? I don't think so.\n\n       What purposes are to be gained from a governmentwide \n     database that includes every part of the Government--Federal. \n     State, local?\n\n  Are we dreaming up a new net? Is this a new Internet? Is this a \ngovernment net? What is it and why should we give one person the \nauthority to control communications in this manner in this bill?\n  It would create the largest technological surveillance system ever \nseen in the world. I repeat that: The largest technological \nsurveillance system ever seen in the world. I think it should be given \nvery thoughtful analysis.\n  We have to give NID time to establish what and how such information \nshould be gathered, how it is to be analyzed, how it is to be stored, \nand how it is to be shared. That is to take place in 90 days. I hope \nthe administration, the committee members and their staff take a look \nat this amendment. This provision is going to delay this bill, unless \nmy amendment is adopted or some form of that. Again, I am ready to hear \nif we have misanalyzed this, but we have checked it with people who \nhave been in the system a long time and they agree our reading is \ncorrect. I again refer the administration and the committee to \namendment No. 2837. That is a significant amendment, in my opinion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3840\n\n  I turn my attention to amendment No. 3840. This is an amendment \ncosponsored by Senators Warner, Inouye, and the current occupant of the \nchair, Senator Burns. It concerns the acquisition of major intelligence \nsystems. The purpose of this amendment is to strike the provisions of \nthe bill which transfer major decisionmaking authorities relating to \nacquisition of national security and defense systems to the national \nintelligence director.\n  My concern stems from a few items, based on the language in this \nbill. It is unclear to me and to us if the national intelligence \ndirector would be responsible for the creation of an entire new staff \nfor the acquisition of major systems or if the Department of Defense \nshall have to transfer to the NID its personnel to provide the \nmanpower, expertise, and staff for these acquisition functions. If that \nis the case, then how would the Department of Defense execute its own \noversight of its own programs? And, if the national intelligence \ndirectorate were to have to use its own people until they can hire new \npeople, the national director would have to fall back to utilizing the \npersonnel of the existing agencies, the people Congress deemed in 2004 \nwere the problem and not the solution.\n  Until it is clear to the Secretary of Defense whether the national \nintelligence director must create a bureaucracy or parallel structure, \nit is my recommendation that we continue the current structure which \npermits the Secretary of Defense the decision authority over these \nvital programs.\n  The NID should request what authority he needs. We should not give it \nall to him and then have the Secretary of Defense fight to get back \nsome of the normal functions of the Department of Defense. The \nunderlying bill leaves that determination now to NID to begin with.\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\n  The Secretary of Defense should continue to oversee the execution of \nacquisition programs within his Department, and the agencies related to \ndefense, especially those combat support agencies such as the National \nSecurity Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\n  The Congress recognized the fact that neither the National Security \nAgency nor the National Geospatial Agency currently possess capability \nto manage major acquisition programs by passing the fiscal year 2004 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 108-354, which \ntransferred these very responsibilities to the Department of Defense. \nWe, the Senate, just transferred these authorities and responsibilities \nto the Department of Defense. What led to this transfer of acquisition \nresponsibility was a series of critical mistakes regarding the ability \nto obtain and manage the acquisition of major systems. Some of these \nmistakes wound up costing the taxpayers close to $1 billion. This is \nnot something we should experiment with, especially with new, untested \nleadership or personnel.\n  I repeat, we just changed this this year. We moved it over to prevent \nthe further loss of money and now the committee suggests it should be \nchanged again and now put under a new director who has no experience \nand no background in acquisition at all.\n  The administration has taken a policy in that statement, indicating \nthey believe the committee's provision relating to the NID's role in \nacquisition of major systems needs further study to ensure that the \nrequirements of major consumers are met.\n  They understand this transfer is premature. It may be the Congress \nshould reverse itself now and move this acquisition authority back to \nthe NID. But let's let the NID get up and running. Let's find out \nwhether we have confidence in that system before we take it away from \nthe Department of Defense, when we just took it away from the \nIntelligence Committee because of the failures of the past.\n  Finally, the language currently in the bill would only cover the \nDepartment of Defense programs and not the programs in the National \nIntelligence Program, and that is where the problems lie.\n  I urge the Senate not to act in haste where such large amounts of \nfunds are currently in play. They currently have a considerable amount \nof money we have already put up for these acquisitions. The Senate \nshould not break a system that is now working well since this transfer \nearlier this year, nor put up obstacles to our obtaining major \nacquisition systems necessary for national security as quickly as \npossible.\n  Again, I urge members of the committee to take a look at that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3882\n\n  Mr. President, have I called up amendment No. 3882? If not, I do wish \nit to be called up at this time. I ask all other amendments be set \naside and this be called up, amendment No. 3882.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report \namendment No. 3882.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3882.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3882\n\n   (Purpose: To propose an alternative section 141, relating to the \n       Inspector General of the National Intelligence Authority)\n\n       On page 60, strike line 5 and all that follows through page \n     77, line 18, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 141.

(a) Notwithstanding the last 2 sentences of \n     section 3(a), the Inspector General of the National \n     Intelligence Authority shall be under the authority, \n     direction, and control of the National Intelligence Director \n     with respect to audits or investigations, or the issuance of \n     subpoenas, which require access to information concerning \n     intelligence or counterintelligence matters the disclosure of \n     which would constitute a serious threat to national security. \n     With respect to such information, the Director may prohibit \n     the Inspector General from initiating, carrying out, or \n     completing any investigation, inspection, or audit if the \n     Director determines that such prohibition is necessary to \n     preserve the vital national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       ``(b) If the National Intelligence Director exercises the \n     authority under subsection (a), the Director shall submit to \n     the congressional intelligence committees an appropriately \n     classified statement of the reasons for the exercise of such \n     authority within seven days.\n       ``(c) The National Intelligence Director shall advise the \n     Inspector General of the National Intelligence Authority at \n     the time a report under subsection (a) is submitted, and, to \n     the extent consistent with the protection of intelligence \n     sources and methods, provide the Inspector General with a \n     copy of such report.\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\n       ``(d) The Inspector General of the National Intelligence \n     Authority may submit to the congressional intelligence \n     committees any comments on a report of which the Inspector \n     General has notice under subsection (c) that the Inspector \n     General considers appropriate.\n       ``(e) In this section, the term `congressional intelligence \n     committees' means--\n       ``(1) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; \n     and\n       ``(2) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     House of Representatives.''.\n       (2) Section 8H(a)(1)(A) of that Act is amended by inserting \n     ``National Intelligence Authority,'' before ``Defense \n     Intelligence Agency''.\n       (3) Section 11 of that Act is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``the National \n     Intelligence Director;'' after ``the Office of Personnel \n     Management;''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``the National \n     Intelligence Authority,'' after ``the Office of Personnel \n     Management,''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the final amendment I would call \nup now. Again, I apologize for the way it is brought forward. The time \nfactors involved are very narrow, I know. I do want to say, \nparenthetically, again, one paper said I shouted at the chairman \nyesterday. I certainly hope I did not shout at the chairman of the \ncommittee. Having formerly been the chairman--and Senator Lieberman \nalso has been the chairman--I know the vast diversity of this committee \nand the difficulty we have had bringing this bill to the floor. I think \nthey have done an extremely fine job under the circumstances we have. I \ndon't know why we are being pressured as we are, but the decision has \nbeen made to get this bill out, and so we share the leadership position \nto accomplish that goal.\n  But I am worried, as I told the managers personally, that some of the \nin-depth study others of us have given to this bill is not being \nlistened to. The problem will be not in having the bill passed; the \nproblem will be in having the bill implemented if some of these \namendments are not adopted. The timeframes in particular worry me \ngreatly, the timeframes within this process. This is worse than \nestablishing a new department, really. This is a control mechanism over \na system that abhors control. It is hard to control. If we do it wrong, \nwe are going to bust this system. We are going to destroy the morale. \nAs I said the other day, it takes a minimum of 5 years to get an agent \nin the field, and it will take another 5 years before that agent can \nactively recruit people and deal with the nationals and really help \ncontrol the national assets we need for our security. The people we \nhave in the field right now really started out around 1994 or 1995. \nThey are out there. If we disturb their morale so they decide to pursue \nother courses, positions, or other goals, this Government is going to \nbe left literally exposed. All of these people are extremely capable \npeople. I have never encountered the intelligence quotient in any other \narea in our Government that I have run into in the intelligence field. \nThey are high-strung people. They are people whose morale is absolutely \nessential.\n\n  I urge the Senate to consider the morale of the people in the system \nnow and those who will be coming into the system as we moved forward. \nDo not set timeframes such that it is designed for failure. Give them \ntime. The system is working now. I have said that time and again. I \ndon't think most people know how much change has occurred in the \nintelligence community since 9/11. It is working. The fact that we \nhaven't had another 9/11 shows that it is working. I hope we will be \ncareful.\n  I want to talk about this one amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 minute? I \nassociate myself with his remarks about how we are going about this. We \nhave made enormous progress since the 1991 operation in Iraq, as the \nSenator well knows, particularly in the tactical level and in military \nintelligence. I am hopeful that in this haste, we do not \nunintentionally go back from the progress we have made so far.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. We made progress in a lot of areas \noutside of Iraq. I am in contact now with people in the Philippines. We \nhave problems. We have problems in Indonesia. We have problems \nthroughout the area. We have problems with all of these drugs from \nAfghanistan. This is a complex world. When we visited with the station \nchiefs throughout the world recently, they all said the same thing. \nOurs is a very difficult problem. It is hard to figure out our \npriorities right now. They are going to have to wait until NID gives \nthem their priorities. How long must they wait?\n  My amendment suggests an alternative to the inspector general of the \nNational Intelligence Authority as proposed in this bill.\n  This is amendment No. 3882.\n  Under the committee bill, the inspector general would have the \nauthority to provide policy direction on interagency relationships \nwithout consulting with the department heads of the affected agencies.\n  I see you shaking your head. You had better read the bill if you \ndisagree. I don't like to see that from staff, anyway. If you are going \nto shake your head, move.\n  I think this is a situation where we have been through the creation \nof inspectors general on the Governmental Affairs Committee. People \nought to look at what is being done under this bill. This is the only \ninspector general I know that would have the authority and direction to \nprovide policy direction on interagency relationships without \nconsulting with the department heads of the affected agencies.\n  Here is an inspector general of the intelligence community from NID. \nHe has the authority to interrogate people in other agencies to find \nout interagency relationships of his agency with these other agencies \nwithout consulting the heads of the other agencies. Nothing indicates \nthey are even going to consult the inspectors general of those \nagencies.\n\n  There are inspectors general of every agency covered by this bill. \nThat would give the inspector general of the NIA unprecedented \nauthority over appointed officials of other independent agencies and \ndepartments. I don't know why the inspector general of the NIA should \nhave unprecedented powers that no other inspector general has.\n  I raised this question before and I was told that was not the case. \nWhen I raised the question, I was told on the floor earlier that the \ninspector general has the same authority as the inspectors general. I \nchallenged that. And this amendment would bring that bill back into the \nsituation where I was told it was, and that is the inspectors general \nhave the same authority as any other inspector general. They would \nstill have the authority to audit programs and operations of the \nnational intelligence authority. They shall have the authority to \ninvestigate interagency relationships if they wanted to among the \nelements of the intelligence community both within and outside the \nnational intelligence program, but the inspector general of the \nNational Intelligence Authority will not direct the policy of other \nindependent agencies or any other agency. As a matter of fact, IGs \nshould not direct anything. They should make findings and report their \nfindings to the head of the agency.\n  My amendment is based on existing law that has proven successful in \nensuring that the authority of inspectors general of the intelligence \ncommunity does not infringe upon independent inspectors general of \nother agencies.\n  I urge the Senate to take a look at this. To have anyone authorized \nto investigate interagency relationships? How are you going to get \nalong with your colleagues in the other group? Inspectors general \nshould look for performance or for honesty and integrity, to examine \nthe operations and report. But to report on interagency relationships \ninvolving other departments and agencies that are not under his control \nand are under the control of other inspectors general, that is really \ngoing too far. I will say this categorically: If that provision is not \nchanged, I will vote against this bill. I have lived with inspectors \ngeneral now too long, and that goes too far. I will not vote for this \nbill unless it is altered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alaska is on a \ntight timeline this afternoon. I am not going to respond in depth to \nthe amendments he put forward.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Alaska that on some of his amendments \nhe has raised very valid concerns, and I would like the opportunity to \nwork with him to try to resolve some of the issues. For example, some \nof the implementation date issues I believe we might be able to work \nthrough. The\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nclarifying language on the counterterrorism center parallels the \nchanges we made in committee, and we may well be able to come up with \nsomething on that.\n  I appreciate the Senator's concerns and his desire to make sure that \nthe language is clear and accurate throughout the bill. While obviously \nwe have some fundamental disagreements on the underlying legislation, \nnevertheless I believe that some things in his amendments are \nbeneficial in the bill, if we are able to resolve some language. I want \nto pledge to him my appreciation for his effort and my willingness to \nwork with him on some of those issues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize, I do have to go. I want the \nRecord to show my support for Senator Byrd's amendment No. 3845, which \na few of us have endorsed. I hope we can negotiate some of that because \nthat covers, as the distinguished senior Member of this body has said, \nthe relationship that many of us have had with this process for a long \ntime. I hope we will have a chance to work it out.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank Senator from Alaska. I thank him for the \npromise he has made and for the suggestions he has offered. There are \nsome matters on which we have big disagreements. There are others on \nwhich we clearly do not. We have made some suggestions today that we \ncan work out over the weekend which will improve the bill.\n  Most of all, I want the Senator from Alaska to know that we always \nlisten to him whether he shouts or not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Shout doesn't count. Sometimes I am loud. I apologize.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Have a good weekend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, Senator Byrd \nand I have asked and urged all chairmen and ranking members of the \nappropriations subcommittees to start conferencing the substance of \ntheir bills with the House.\n  We need to resolve our differences now, before the recess next week, \nif possible. We have a short period of time when we come back. The \ncontinuing resolution will expire November 20.\n  I conferred with the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, \nChairman Bill Young. He agrees that something needs to be done while we \nare gone. I don't know if it is possible, but I hope the Senate and \nHouse staff will do their best to work with the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the subcommittees on their recommendations and make sure we \nhave them available when we come back on November 16. There will be no \ntime to do such preliminary conferencing when we get back.\n  At best, we will have 5 days to get something out of conference and \nresolve the issues and pass a conference report of some kind to deal \nwith as many bills as we can handle. That is a tall order.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Byrd, ranking member, former chairman of \nour committee. We are working together with the objectives of trying to \nfinish these bills this year. When the two chairmen retire from the \nHouse and the Senate Appropriations Committee, with us will go our \nstaffs. If the next chairman of the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has to continue the work that we should accomplish this year, \nit is going to take months this time because the trained staff, the \npeople who know the subject, will not be there. We move on to other \nsubjects.\n  Congress must get these appropriations bills done this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3849\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I call for the regular order with respect to the Corzine \namendment numbered 3849.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3946 to Amendment No. 3849\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine, [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3946 to amendment No. 3849.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so that other amendments can be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman for their hard work on this bill.\n  I called one of my Democratic colleagues who has been around this \nbody for a long time. I didn't know whether it was a good bill; he said \nhe didn't either. It certainly has good intent. I certainly believe \nthat improving our intelligence is of important national interest.\n  I want to be supportive of this bill, but I do think it is important \nthat we keep an eye on it because we have learned in the past that \nbills with language that may sound good at the moment, may not be what \nis best for the country. We may find out that very language, that one \nsentence or what have you, can be the very language that undermines the \nability of our intelligence community to be effective in protecting the \ninterests of the United States.\n  I certainly believe we need to do everything we can to create an \neffective joint national intelligence effort. Unfortunately, I am \nafraid there are things in this bill that, indeed, may pervert the very \npurpose of the legislation; that will handicap the intelligence \ncommunity rather than assist it.\n  The language would prevent the national intelligence director from \nhaving the very capabilities that allow unhindered and meaningful \nintelligence collection and analysis.\n  The bill establishes four new offices, additional new privacy and \ncivil liberty officers within each agency, and it creates a new civil \nliberties board, all with management authority.\n  If this was the kind of language we could work with, I would be \nsupportive, but I am afraid the way this language has been put together \ncould create bottlenecks and could undermine our ability to be \neffective. If so, I have a problem with it. I certainly don't want to \nhave a problem with a bill initiating such important reform, but I do.\n  September 11 did not happen because there was too little bureaucracy. \nIt did not happen because the intelligence community needed more \noffices and boards, more monitoring personnel, more supervision and \nmore second-guessing. In fact, the problems happened--many of them--\nbecause the intelligence community found it difficult to work through \nthe maze of bureaucracies that already exist in what we have today.\n  Adding more to this bureaucracy only serves to exacerbate \nintelligence-gathering problems, not help them. Proliferation of \ngovernment panels, boards, agencies, and ombudsman is not the answer.\n  There are six sections of the bill, including four offices, a board, \nand still more additional officers, all tasked with the same \nbureaucratic management responsibility: No, 1, section 126, officer for \ncivil rights and civil liberties of the national intelligence \nauthority; No. 2, section 127, privacy officer of the national \nintelligence authority; No. 3, under section 141, the inspector general \nof the national intelligence authority; No. 4, ombudsman of the \nnational intelligence authority; No. 5, section 211, the privacy and \ncivil liberties oversight board; and under section 212, the privacy and \ncivil liberties officers.\n  That is quite a bit of bureaucracy, and I know the Presiding Officer \nis concerned.\n\n  We have four new offices added to the national intelligence \nauthority, a board added to the Executive Office of the President, and \nadditional officers added to the various offices within the \nintelligence agency, all virtually with\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nunrestrained management responsibilities.\n  I don't believe this is what the 9/11 Commission had in mind. In \nfact, the \n9/11 Commission uses the words ``privacy'', ``civil rights'', and \n``civil liberties'' 23 times in the 567-page document. We have marked \nwith blue tabs the references to these terms. The Commission was \nconcerned about it and wanted to make sure we had the right provisions \nto deal with it. They confronted that issue and dealt with it \nseriously, mentioning it 23 times.\n  How about the legislation before the Senate today? How about the \nlegislation we now have under Collins-Lieberman? It has fewer pages, \nonly 213. Yet it has 126 such references to the terms. Members can see \nthe red marks I put on there. They are the marks that show references \nto these issues. The whole report is chock full of detail on this.\n  Of course, we know what our problems were with intelligence. We did \nnot have enough linguists. We did not focus enough on human \nintelligence. We had too much bureaucracy because of the wall between \nCIA and FBI intelligence that was thought being shared around the \nworld. Those are the real problems, not how much oversight we might \ncreate and make it even more difficult for our agents to function \nwithout fear that somebody will second-guess whatever they might do in \nareas of the world where their very lives could be at stake and, \nindeed, are at stake.\n  The legislation before the Senate mentions the terms six times as \nmuch as the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission recommended a single--\none--civil liberties oversight board. It certainly did not recommend \nnumerous layers of bureaucracy throughout the intelligence community. \nThese, I am afraid, would undermine or distract our ability to protect \nour security in this country.\n  I think one of our fears with regard to intelligence and national \nsecurity, as Senator Kyl has so eloquently mentioned, is timidity, a \nconcern that our agents around the world, who are working to find those \npeople who want to do us harm before they actually do us harm, identify \nthem, could make a mistake resulting in criticism and punishment. \nTimidity can be damaging to our work. That is the problem I am \nconcerned about. We need to create a system that promotes courage, \ninnovation, and creativity on the part of our agents.\n  When somebody does something new and creative, occasionally things do \nnot turn out the way you would like. Certainly in the intelligence \nfield, that is so. I used to be a Federal prosecutor. We would use \nundercover operatives, and we would do things, such as put recorders on \nthem. All kinds of things could happen, and sometimes things went \nastray. But, you want to encourage agents to try to do the kinds of \noperations that work, not want them in fear that somebody is looking \nover their shoulder every time they do something that might blow up and \nthen their career would be ruined. I feel strongly about this issue. I \nhope we can focus on it more clearly.\n  If you look through the offices that would be created in this bill, \nthey are duplicative and have many problems with them. For example, the \nofficer for civil rights and civil liberties, in section 126 of the \nbill, is tasked with assisting the national intelligence director in \nensuring that the protection of civil rights and civil liberties is \nappropriately incorporated in the policies and procedures under the \nnational intelligence authority.\n  This official is also given oversight authority and can ``review, \ninvestigate, and assess complaints and other information indicating \npossible abuses of civil rights and civil liberties'' in the \nadministration of and relationships among the National Intelligence \nAuthority, unless the NIA's Inspector General determines that the IG \ncan better review the matter--basically, they have to take over the \nmatter.\n  Here the officer is given powerful authority to conduct as many \ninvestigations into any area of the NIA as the officer chooses, all \nwithout having to get the agreement or approval of anyone. Only the IG, \nthe Inspector General, could intervene, and then basically only to take \nover the investigation. So this section provides for a powerful officer \nwho could prove to be disruptive to the goals of the NID.\n  While protecting and defending civil liberties is an important factor \nfor our Nation, granting an officer free, unfettered, and unchecked \nauthority to tie up intelligence operations and analysis through \ninvestigations is not the goal of intelligence reform, or the intention \nof the 9/11 Commission.\n  The Inspector General, is checked ``from initiating, carrying out, or \ncompleting any investigation, inspection, or audit if the Director \ndetermines that such prohibition is necessary to protect vital national \nsecurity interests of the United States.'' The Inspector General is \nconstrained by the national security interests of the United States, \nbut not this new officer for Civil Rights and Liberties. That officer \nshould be subject to similar constraints.\n  Secondly, there is a privacy officer provided for in section 127. \nThat officer is tasked with coordinating with the officer of civil \nrights and civil responsibilities to ensure that privacy policies are \nupheld. This person will conduct ``privacy impact assessments when \nappropriate or as required by law.'' Once again, the bill grants \nunrestrained access and power to a person to check up on the national \nintelligence director and the intelligence community. This superfluous \nmanagement could be a handicap to our intelligence-gathering \nactivities. It is something I am concerned about.\n  We also have in this bill an Inspector General for the NIA, an \nombudsman, the board mentioned in section 211, and the officers \nmentioned in section 212. The Inspectors General of the CIA and the \nDefense Department are made duplicative officers to the IG in Section \n141. And it can have the effect of not only creating excess officers \nand expense, but also creating competition and undermining the \ninitiative of the agency in question.\n\n  We want to be sure that civil rights and civil liberties are \nprotected. We want to be sure that American citizens are protected, not \nonly their civil liberties, which we absolutely intend to protect, but \nwe want to protect their lives, their health, and their families from \npeople who do not share our values and have the goal to destroy us.\n  While I believe we can defend America with a high degree of fidelity \nto the liberties and freedoms we cherish, I also know one of the \nbiggest problems we have had is the timidity and the restraint that \npeople feel who work in our intelligence community.\n  For example, I see Senator Kyl is the Presiding Officer. He, for \nyears, recognized the terrible impact on the intelligence-gathering \nprocess that resulted from legislation--well intentioned--that \nconstrained the ability of CIA agents and other agents of this United \nStates from dealing with a person who had a criminal record. These \nagents were prohibited from dealing with these disreputable people. \nWell, many of the people who have the critical, life or death \ninformation may have a reputation or conviction in some country around \nthe world of doing bad things. We know, after hearings, and after much \ndebate on this floor, Senator Kyl eventually got that reversed. But it \nwas late. We lost a lot.\n  The real problem with that constraint on intelligence gathering was \nthat agents themselves said: ``OK, they don't want me to do this. I am \nnot going to do it. I am not going to take a chance. I am not going to \ndeal with somebody who might have a criminal record because it may come \nback to haunt me, and they will haul me before the Church Committee or \nsome other such committee and embarrass me and my family and undermine \nmy career and record in this agency. I am not going to take a chance.''\n  That is what we know happened. It was not a good thing. We fixed \nthat, just as we fixed the wall between the FBI and CIA. These laws \nsounded like a good idea at the time to those who passed them. And, I \nam not saying people were not sincere about it. But the net result was, \nwe created timidity, pockets of information, and stovepipes, that did \nnot share information between one another. As a result, there may have \nbeen a possibility, had that not been in existence, that we could have \nprotected better the lives and fortunes of American citizens.\n  I thank Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman and the people who \nhave worked on this. I believe we do need to strengthen our \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\ncommunity, but there are a number of things in this legislation that \ncause me great concern. We need to be realistic, to work in a way that \nprotects the great traditions of freedom and liberty in this country, \nbut also protects the lives and safety of our families and our \ncommunities.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senators from Arizona \nand Alabama bringing forward their amendments today, but I have a \nnumber of concerns about them.\n  The proposed amendments strike an officer for civil rights and civil \nliberties and a privacy officer for the new national intelligence \nauthority. The amendment also strikes provisions requiring that a \nsenior official be designated in certain departments and agencies who \nwould be responsible for privacy and civil liberties issues. And \nfinally, the amendment changes the authority of the privacy and civil \nliberties oversight board by removing its subpoena authority. I \nparticularly want to address that last point, because I think there is \na misunderstanding on the extent of the subpoena authority and to whom \nit applies.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, during his \njoint address to the Congress, the President called on all Americans \nto:\n\n     . . . uphold the values of America and remember why so many \n     have come here. We're in a fight for our principles and our \n     first responsibility is to live by them.\n\n  Similarly, the 9/11 Commission concluded in its report that we must \nfind ways of reconciling security with liberty since the success of one \nhelps protect the other. The choice between security and liberty is a \nfalse choice, as nothing is more likely to endanger America's liberties \nthan the success of a terrorist attack at home.\n  The Commission went on to state that while protecting our homeland, \nAmericans should be mindful of the threats to vital personal and civil \nliberties. The shift of power and authority to the Government calls for \nan enhanced system of checks and balances to protect the precious \nliberties that are vital to our way of life.\n  In response to these concerns, the Commission recommended that at \nthis time of increased and consolidated Government authority, there \nshould be a board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to \nthe guidelines the Commission recommends and the commitment of our \nGovernment to protect civil liberties.\n  To respond to these recommendations and the concerns that we fight \nthis war against terrorism without sacrificing the values that define \nus as Americans, S. 2845 establishes the two officers, one for civil \nrights and one for privacy, to assist the national intelligence \ndirector on issues that may affect civil liberties and privacy. These \nofficials are modeled after those created by Congress for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. There is both a civil liberties \nofficer and a privacy officer. The creation of similar officers within \nthe Department of Homeland Security is a good example of how these \nofficers can assist the Department in considering relevant issues \nwithout compromising our efforts to protect the homeland.\n  The Department has found that having those two officials has helped \nthem strike the right balance as they pursue new policies. The \nDepartment has found that the work of these officials at DHS has not \nhindered its implementation of programs and activities but, rather, has \nimproved them. By providing advice and counsel as policies and programs \nare being developed, they help the Department address privacy and civil \nliberties concerns at the front end and minimize the possibility of \nhaving to respond to real problems after a policy or program that \ndidn't take into account privacy implications or civil liberties \nimplications has already been put into place.\n\n  I would have been more sympathetic to the amendment if the Senators \nhad made the argument that perhaps in this much smaller unit those two \nofficials could be combined into one position so that we could have one \nofficial for both privacy and civil liberties. That might be a possible \ncompromise. It is one about which I would have to talk with the other \nsponsor of the bill. But that might be a way to respond to a concern \nthat I know the Presiding Officer has about excessive positions or \nbureaucracies.\n  I want to speak particularly to the subpoena issue. The subpoena \npower provided in this bill to the civil liberties board applies only \nto persons other than departments, agencies, and elements of the \nexecutive branch. I want to repeat that. While the bill does authorize \nthe board to have access to executive department and agency materials \nand personnel, where appropriate, there is no subpoena power. There is \nno enforcement mechanism in the bill. That leaves compliance in the \nhands of the relevant department or agency head. The subpoena power \nonly applies to outside entities, not to Government agencies or \nofficials.\n  So the provisions of this subpoena authority do not allow the \nscenario brought forth by some of the sponsors of this amendment in \nwhich they raise the specter of the civil liberties board being able to \nsubpoena a CIA case officer. That is not allowed under this bill.\n  Moreover, the subpoena authority in this bill is narrower, much more \ncircumscribed, than the authority that is given to inspectors general \nthroughout the Federal Government who do have the ability to subpoena \ndocuments and individuals for information within the Federal \nGovernment. I wanted to correct that misunderstanding on the subpoena \npower.\n  We have a responsibility, as we continue to improve our capacity to \nfight terrorism--the all-important battle that our Nation faces--to \nuphold and protect the very liberties and freedom on which this Nation \nwas founded and for which we are fighting today. We need to make sure \nthat as we strengthen the power of Government, we do not infringe upon \nthe civil liberties and the privacy of law-abiding Americans. I believe \nthe provisions in this bill help to strike the right balance.\n  Let me complete my remarks on this issue by pointing out that the 9/\n11 Commission has endorsed the board created by this bill. I know the \nSenator from Alabama has suggested a different version of a civil \nliberties board.\n  In testimony before the House Government Reform Committee, two of our \ncommissioners--and I would note it was bipartisan; it was a Republican \ncommissioner and a Democratic commissioner--said:\n\n       A civil liberties board of the kind we recommend can be \n     found in the Collins-Lieberman bill in the Senate.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Chair, and the \nSenator from Alabama for introducing these amendments.\n  I understand their concerns very well. They have raised some \nreasonable and direct questions. I want to attempt at this moment to \ntry to reassure them, which is to say there is nothing in this \nunderlying bill intended to, or that I can see, restrict the capacity \nor the mobility of people working in our intelligence community to \noperate to protect us. The board that is created is intended to, as I \nsee it, do a broad review of policies before policies are ordered or \nissued, to consult with the policymakers, and afterward to do a review. \nI don't think there is any basis for feeling that if somebody felt \ntheir liberties were violated by a particular action of a particular \nagency or intelligence person or officer, they could appeal to this \nboard. So the intent is not to second-guess or create a place where \nthere can be second-guessing of individual cases, individual decisions. \nTherefore, to avoid what the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nArizona, I think quite understandably, worry about, a climate of risk \naversion--you don't want that to happen--you want these people to be \naggressive, fearless, and not risk averse.\n  As a matter of fact, all of the discussion we have had in another \ncontext about the bill, which is about encouraging competitive analyses \nand the so-called red team concepts--and we set up an audit review \nsection to do quality control--it is all about making sure people don't \nget in a group-think or that they get risk averse, but that they be \nbold and opinionated and they come up with the best result for us.\n  The other thing I want to say about the privacy and civil liberties \noffices is that, as Senator Collins said, we took this model--and I \nurge us to think\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\nabout this--from the Department of Homeland Security, which has both \nprivacy and civil liberties advisers in it. I will give you a couple of \nquotes as to early reports. Asa Hutchinson, Under Secretary for Border \nand Transportation Security at the Department of Homeland Security, \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee last month talking about the \nagency's existing privacy officer. He said:\n\n       Here in DHS, we can show the effectiveness of a strong \n     privacy officer at the agency level and the success that is \n     achievable only through direct integration of privacy \n     protections in operational work. Privacy is an issue that \n     stretches across the entire government and as we continue to \n     look at government-wide approaches to privacy, it is also \n     important to see how productive agency-level privacy \n     protections are.\n\n  That sounds to me like a good, healthy dialog has been created in \nwhich privacy is being considered but not standing in the way of that \nDepartment protecting our security.\n  I will also quote from Secretary Ridge, who noted the important role \nof the same office in providing what he called ``proactive legal and \npolicy advice to senior leadership in the Department and its \ncomponents.'' He cited the office's success in working with the Border \nand Transportation Security Directorate ``to craft positive policy \nchanges in response to the issues raised by the DOJ Inspector General's \nreport on the 9/11 immigration detainees,'' and in ``develop[ing] \npolicies to establish DHS as a model employer for people with \ndisabilities . . . ''--it goes on about helping to implement President \nBush's recent Executive order.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues and friends who introduced \nthis amendment. I understand their concern and I hope in some small way \nthrough what I have said I can alleviate the concerns they have.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these amendments deal with important \nmatters in a number of areas. I will provide more information at the \nappropriate time about them. I just note that one thing we certainly \nneed to do--I believe there is uniform agreement on this--is that the \nprovisions that deal with the wall between the FBI and CIA, basically, \nbetween domestic enforcement and foreign intelligence--that has been \nidentified as one of the primary reasons we did not coordinate our \nintelligence effectively prior to 9/11--that that wall that we have \ntemporarily removed be removed permanently. That is one of the \nprovisions I suggested in these amendments that have been called up. We \nwill go into more detail as time goes by.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his thoughtful comments, as always. He \nis very astute in the history and development of intelligence and his \ninterest in the security of the United States is not surpassed in this \nbody. I would say that my concerns are numerous about the legislation \nin general. Sometimes it is like when you are getting ready to buy that \nnew car or new house and you get the pen in your hand and angst arises \nbecause you are afraid to sign it. But when you do sign it, everything \ngoes along fine and it wasn't nearly as bad as you thought. That could \nbe what we are dealing with.\n  Also, maybe there are some reasons to be concerned about buying this \nhouse or this automobile; perhaps because it is a lemon. Maybe we don't \nhave the money. Maybe this isn't the best way to do it. I am concerned \nabout governmental bureaucracy and the real possibility that we will \nmake it worse.\n  As a Federal prosecutor for 12 years, I worked to try to coordinate \nall the Federal agencies involved--for example, in drug law \nenforcement. In Mobile, AL, under the Treasury Department, you had the \nIRS and they would do financial investigations of drug dealers. The \nCustoms officers were at the ports and they did investigations of drug \ndealers who shipped in through the ports. They had a lot of abilities--\nremarkable ability, really, to help in those instances. You had the \nDepartment of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, also part of Treasury. \nAnd ATF often got involved in drug cases, although it didn't have \ndirect jurisdiction in such cases. On the other side, you had the \nDepartment of Justice, and you had the U.S. Marshal Service and, of \ncourse, the U.S. Attorney, FBI, DEA, and Immigration Service. Then, \nbefore it went into Homeland Security, the Coast Guard, a part of the \nTransportation Department, which patrolled the Gulf of Mexico and \nfrequently stopped boats loaded with drugs. They were all independent \nagencies. I would try to get them to work together and at times it was \nvery difficult, but we made great progress.\n  How did it happen that we made progress in cooperation during the \nyears that I was an U.S. Attorney? I have thought about it. There was \nnot any major reorganization. In fact, there was no real reorganization \nof the Government. Ronald Reagan declared a war on drugs, and, we had a \nwar on drugs. It raised the attention level of every Government agency. \nHe said that we will cooperate with one another. The Attorney General \nof the United States, William French Smith, hired a young, aggressive, \ntalented prosecutor and made him third in command at the Department of \nJustice, the associate Attorney General, and he directed him to work \nwith the U.S. attorneys and every agency in the Government to make sure \nthey cooperated and worked together to deal with the war on drugs. That \nyoung prosecutor, Mr. President, is well known today. It was Rudy \nGiuliani. He made things happen. People knew he spoke for the President \nand we made tremendous progress.\n  If there was a discussion about how to investigate a major drug gang, \nand the FBI didn't cooperate with Customs or the DEA was unhappy with \nCustoms or the FBI, the U.S. attorney could just call up somebody in \nWashington and say: Look, these guys are fighting over bureaucratic \nturf. We have a case we need to prosecute, and we need to work \ntogether. It worked. The turf battles would end. Things happened in an \nextraordinary way. There was no new bureaucracy established. That is \nall I am saying. No new entity was established to create coopertion.\n  A number of years later, in order to obtain more coordination, \nCongress, after much debating and ballyhoo, created a drug czar, and \nthat was supposed to coordinate these activities.\n  The drug czar has some interesting powers, and the model of the drug \nczar might not be bad for this entity, for the challenge of improving \nour intelligence capabilities. The drug czar has the responsibility to \nget with every department and agency of the Government and to write, \nwith their input, a plan to fight drugs in America. He does that. They \nall sign off on it.\n  Then the drug czar, before the budget request of each one of these \nagencies goes to the Office of Management and Budget, approves their \nbudget, and if he concludes they are not funding or not asking for \nfunds to carry out the agreement they signed, then he has the ability \nto object and block that budget. It eventually goes to the President if \nthere is a dispute. But the drug czar has quite a bit of power. It is a \nsmall office compared to the other major departments and agencies in \nthe Government. We have to be careful with this legislation that we are \nnot creating another layer of Government.\n  Mr. McLaughlin, who was the Acting Director of the CIA before Mr. \nGoss was confirmed, appeared before Senator Warner's Armed Services \nCommittee. Chairman Warner asked him a number of questions. One of the \nthings he said that was important to me as a person who has been \ninvolved in dealing with Government agencies and knows how people pass \nthe buck and how they cover their own problems--all tendencies that are \nnatural inclinations of governmental entities--I have been there; I \nknow it--Mr. McLaughlin said: I think we need to ask ourselves a couple \nof questions. One is, who will brief the President of the United States \non matters involving intelligence? Who is going to tell the President \nwhether there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Right now, it is \nclear the CIA Director does that.\n  The second question is, who will be responsible if it is wrong? Today \nthat is clear still. It is the CIA Director.\n  We do not have the same CIA Director that we did. He told the \nPresident it was a slam dunk that WMD products were in Iraq, and \napparently they were not, or at least we have not found them, which is \nmore accurate. And he no longer holds the office.\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\n  If we come up with a new organization that organization leaves it \nless clear who is responsible for stating the intelligence situation of \nthe United States to the President, and we make it even less clear who \ncan be held responsible, then we have not made progress.\n  My colleagues say the national intelligence director can do it. He \ncould. Where does he get his information? Is he going to interview the \nCIA and then repeat what the CIA told him to the President? And then if \nhe is wrong, will he say: It wasn't my fault; the CIA told me that? We \nget into a little bit of a mess here.\n  The idea of having an enhanced unification of intelligence-gathering \ncapability and dissemination of intelligence appeals to me very much. I \nremain somewhat confused how we should do it, however. I just do not \nknow what is the best way to do it.\n  I so much appreciate the time Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman \nhave put into this legislation. I know it has many good things in it, \nbut I am just not sure how much progress we will have made when we do \nthis because we know what the real problems are: we did not have enough \nlinguists; we had legal walls between intelligence agencies. We have \ntaken those down. At the President's leadership and insistence, we are \nbringing in more human intelligence, a critical need, and we are \nbringing in more foreign language speakers at an incredible new rate. \nWe are moving more aggressively than we ever have against al-Qaida. \nThree-fourths of them have been captured or killed. We have made \nprogress all over the world. We have enhanced our partnerships with not \nonly our agencies within the United States but around the world. It is \nnot appropriate to mention or talk about all the cooperation we are \ngetting from agencies of other nations, foreign intelligence agencies. \nThey are sharing with us much better. A lot of things are going well.\n\n  I think it is fair to say the military feels the intensity of the \nleadership from the President on down has forced, such as Rudy Giuliani \nand President Reagan did on the war on drugs, a lot better cooperation \nbetween intelligence entities today. The DOD people know the people in \nthe CIA. CIA and the FBI are meeting daily with Homeland Security. And \nthose people know each other's names. They have had months of \npartnerships working together. The system is working, and I am afraid \nif we reorganize all this, it may look good on paper, but the personal \nrelationships that have caused confidence to be built up may be \nundermined. If that were to happen, in the middle of a war, we would \nnot be proud of ourselves.\n  I thank the Chair. Those are thoughts and concerns I have. I love \nthis country. I know we are in a dangerous period. This struggle \nagainst terrorism will continue for decades--for decades it will \ncontinue--and the key to victory is intelligence and identifying these \ndangerous cells before they attack us.\n  I think we are discussing an important issue. I thank the people who \nhave worked so hard on it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to compliment our distinguished \ncolleague. He has spent a lot of time on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. He is very familiar with these processes and the people.\n  We can write the laws as best we can, but it comes down very often to \nthose human relationships to which he referred and this particular \nframework in the NID. Because the NID cannot, as the distinguished \nchairman has said, create a whole new department, he has to rely on \nsubordinates who have direct line of authority over a lot of troops, \nbut he is not going to have troops in the sense the Senator from \nAlabama and I have used them for the departments and agencies of the \nGovernment as they function today. He is a step removed.\n  Those personal relationships with his immediate subordinates and \nadvisers are going to be very important. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, at this time, if it is convenient to the managers, I \nwill proceed on an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3876\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3876.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve certain authorities and accountability in the \n                 implementation of intelligence reform)\n\n       On page 213, insert after line 8, the following:\n\n     SEC. 352. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n       Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, \n     shall be construed to impair and otherwise affect the \n     authority of--\n       (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; or\n       (2) the principal officers of the executive departments as \n     heads of their respective departments, including, but not \n     limited to--\n       (A) the authority of the Secretary of State under section \n     199 of the Revised Statutes (22 U.S.C. 2651) and the State \n     Department Basic Authorities Act;\n       (B) the authority of the Secretary of Energy under title II \n     of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7131);\n       (C) the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     under section 102(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 \n     U.S.C. 112(a));\n       (D) the authority of the Secretary of Defense under \n     sections 113(b) and 162(b) of title 10, United States Code;\n       (E) the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury under \n     section 301(b) of title 31, United States Code;\n       (F) the authority of the Attorney General under section 503 \n     of title 28, United States Code; and\n       (G) the authority of the heads of executive departments \n     under section 301 of title 5, United States Code.\n       On page 213, line 9, strike ``352.'' and insert ``353.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I refer to the September 28, 2004 \nStatement of Administration Policy in which the administration \nexpresses their support for the very able work of the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member on S. 2845.\n  However, equally important are a number of items that were referred \nto in this document called the SAP. I draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to the last paragraph. I shall read the first sentence:\n\n       The Administration notes that the Committee bill did not \n     include Section 6 (``Preservation of Authority and \n     Accountability'') of the Administration's proposal.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire paragraph from the SAP be \nprinted in its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Administration notes that the Committee bill did not \n     include Section 6 (``Preservation of Authority and \n     Accountability'') of the Administration's proposal; the \n     Administration supports inclusion of this provision in the \n     Senate bill. The legislation should also recognize that its \n     provisions would be executed to the extent consistent with \n     the constitutional authority of the President: to conduct the \n     foreign affairs of the United States; to withhold information \n     the disclosure of which could impair the foreign relations, \n     the national security, deliberative processes of the \n     Executive, or the performance of the Executive's \n     constitutional duties; to recommended for congressional \n     consideration such measures as the President may judge \n     necessary or expedient; and to supervise the unitary \n     executive.\n  Mr. WARNER. Immediately following it, I ask unanimous consent that \nsection 6 to which it refers, drawn from the policy statement forwarded \nby the administration in its efforts to give the very helpful advice \nand counsel to the Senate--and I presume the House, as we are working \non this matter--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 6. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\n       Nothing in this Act or amendments made by this Act shall be \n     construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority of: (1) \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; or (2) \n     the principal officers of the executive departments as heads \n     of their respective departments, including, but not limited \n     to, under section 199 of the Revised Statutes (22 U.S.C. \n     2651), Title II of the Department of Energy Organization Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7131), the State Department Basic Authorities Act \n     of 1956, as amended, section 102(a) of the Homeland Security \n     Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 112(a)), and sections 301 of title 5, \n     113(b) and 162(b) of title 10, 503 of title 28, and 301(b) of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment which the Senator has drawn here, myself,\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\nSenator Stevens, and Senator Inouye as cosponsors, we have lifted \nessentially the language of that into the amendment such that the \nadministration's request in that SAP document is met.\n  In support for the action I am taking, I refer as follows: The \nPresident made two basic decisions with respect to intelligence reform \ndesigned to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. First, he \ndecided that the national intelligence director should have ``full \nbudget authority'' with respect to the national foreign intelligence \nprogram. The bill before us contains a number of provisions intended to \ncarry out that decision.\n  Second, the President made an equally important decision that the \nheads of the departments should continue to be in charge of and \ntherefore continue to be accountable for the performance of their \nrespective departments.\n  This amendment I have submitted would carry out the second \nPresidential goal.\n  The language of the amendment, as I said, is virtually identical to \nthe language of the administration's proposal which I have now placed \ninto the Record.\n  The amendment makes clear that the principal officers of the \nexecutive departments will remain as the organic statutes, for their \ndepartments currently provide the heads of their departments with \nauthority over and responsibility for those departments.\n  The amendment also preserves the existing authority of the Director \nof Office of Management and Budget with respect to the budget \nadministrative and legislative proposals.\n  With this amendment, the bill would provide for a strong national \nintelligence director and would also ensure that the heads of executive \ndepartments remain accountable for the performance of their \ndepartments, including the intelligence elements of those departments.\n  It seems to me that is essential. Again, we come back to the basic \nconcept, we are not creating a new department of government. \nConsequently, the NID has to rely on the department agency heads to \nperform their services, and to do that they have to be put into a \nposition of accountability. That accountability is essential to the \nsmooth operation of the goals of this particular legislation.\n  A strong national intelligence director and accountable heads of \ndepartments are compatible concepts. As part of their responsibility, \nheads of the departments will be accountable for ensuring faithful \nimplementation by their departments' intelligence elements of the \nguidance and tasking issued by the national intelligence director under \nsuch authority as may be granted by the final draft of this \nlegislation.\n  The President gave a very clear example that illustrates the need for \nthis amendment when he discussed the intelligence reform on August 2, \n2004. He said: The national intelligence director will work with the \nrespective agencies to set priorities, but let me make it also very \nclear that when it comes to operations, the chain of command will be \nintact. When the Defense Department is conducting operations to secure \nthe homeland, there will be nothing between the Secretary of Defense \nand me.\n  Consequently, I would add one other thought. The chief of staff \nthereafter echoed on the quote: We do not want to do anything that \nwould undermine the chain of command and the responsibilities that go \nwith the Department of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, the Secretary of the Homeland Security Department, and other \nintelligence agencies, the Attorney General, for example.\n  I am certain they meant to include the Department of State.\n  This amendment carries out that objective.\n  I would be interested in the comments of the chairman and the ranking \nmember, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, taking a look at this amendment, I say \nto my friend from Virginia it may be that we can work this one out \ntogether because I believe we have a common interest, which is by the \nchanges we are making in law, creating the national intelligence \ndirector, not to otherwise alter the authority of various department \nheads--State, Energy, Homeland Security, Defense, et cetera, that the \nSenator has enumerated--but clearly the underlying Collins-Lieberman \nbill does alter some of those authorities by creating authority in the \nnational intelligence director.\n  Except for that, I do not think there is any intention to otherwise \nundercut. So the language is a bit worrisome on first look, which is \nthat nothing in the act shall be construed to impair or otherwise \naffect the authority of these officers.\n  Well, we do want to affect the authority to the extent stated in the \nCollins-Lieberman proposal, but not otherwise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would have to reflect on that because it \nseems to me the Senator is trying to have it both ways, and I am sure \nmy distinguished colleague would not be seeking that goal.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No, I am not. But if I might say briefly--\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me repeat that. I did not have the microphone on.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That should be on the record.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say that the distinguished Senator is trying to have it \nboth ways.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I want my denial of that intention to also be in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  So what is the proposal of the Senator?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, I think we should reason together a little bit \non this. In other words, I am concerned, in the broadest reading of \nthis, this amendment could be read to undercut everything else the bill \ndoes. I do not believe the Senator would intend to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is not my intention.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Right. But only, if I understand it, to protect the \nauthority of the departments except as we specifically alter them in \nthe bill.\n  So, for instance, the national intelligence director will have \ncertain budget authorities or transfer authorities under the bill, as \nit exists, which do alter the authority of some of those constituent \ndepartments--State, Energy, Homeland Security, Defense, et cetera. I \nwould not want this language to obviate the impact of all of those \nchanges.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, but let's work around it and be very mindful of the \nPresident's language. He said: Equally important that the heads of the \ndepartments should continue to be in charge of and therefore continue \nto be accountable for the performance of their respective departments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I read his direct quotation, which seems to me we \nhave translated into this amendment in good faith.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I might, I hear what the Senator is saying, and \nthis goes back to the debate we have had off and on over the 5 days in \nwhich we have been on the bill. Let us take the Department of Defense, \nbecause that is a concern we have that has been expressed. This was \nsomething we argued with regard to the so-called Specter amendment \nwhich would have created line authority in the national intelligence \ndirector over all the constituent intelligence agencies, including \nthose in the Department of Defense. Senator Collins and I argued we do \nnot want to go that far. We want the Secretary of Defense to maintain \nline authority over NSA, NRA and NGA. On the other hand, we do want--\nand we may argue this on another amendment--the national intelligence \ndirector to be able to have the budget authority we give him and have \nthe transfer authority, et cetera.\n  Maybe we are heading in the same direction. I think this is one we \ncan try to work out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Obviously you tried to express the good intentions of \ntrying to work this out. Certainly I desire to do so. But we must be \nvery careful, under the extraordinary circumstances under which this \nvery important piece of legislation is being put together. I am sure \nlots of work will take place over the weekend, but Monday and Tuesday \nare days in which certainly this bill, in its construction, is likely \nto be completed. We have to be careful that we do not create gaps in \nit, where a department head now can say: Look, the\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\nbill took that authority away. If a problem occurred, that is the NID's \nproblem. And then the NID says: Oh, no, that is your problem on your \naccount. We just cannot have finger-pointing when it comes to issues as \nimportant as our Nation's intelligence.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Just a final word: We have been quite focused and \nspecific when we have granted authority to the national intelligence \ndirector. So, therefore, all the other authorities the law gives to the \nvarious department heads enumerated in the Senator's amendment would \nnot be affected. I see that language--perhaps we should consult with \nthe representatives of the White House, too, to find out what their \nparticular concern was.\n  We have amended the authority, or even affected the authority of the \nexisting departments, along the margins here.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that consultation would be helpful. I have \nundertaken it in connection with this amendment. I believe my views are \nconsistent with theirs. But an awful lot of work has gone on now. It \nmay be that there is some refinement that would further strengthen \nthis.\n  For the moment, if the distinguished chairman wishes to speak, I will \nbe happy to hear it and we will just put the amendment to one side.\n  I would like to come back this afternoon to modify an amendment that \nis at the desk, again, to clarify that in hopes that it comes near to \nwhat your goals are.\n  I will be back. If the chairman could advise me, is there going to be \nfurther time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we will be here for another \nhour, approximately--until 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. That should be adequate time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Before the Senator from Virginia leaves, I think we have \nthe same goal in this amendment. But I think to make sure that this \namendment is interpreted as I believe we would all have it interpreted, \nwe need to add language at the beginning that says something like: \nExcept as specifically set forth in this act, nothing herein or \namendments made by this amendment shall be construed to impair or \notherwise affect the authority of it.\n  That way it would be clear that in this provision we are not \naffecting the other authorities of these departments, but neither are \nwe wiping out what this legislation has done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I fully understand the import of the \nlanguage you are quoting. But that is almost putting a blessing on \neverything that is written into the bill. I am not sure I am prepared \nas yet to say that. That is going to require a little study on the part \nof both of us because I think the effect of your language is, don't \ntouch the bill, but what the bill leaves they are accountable for. That \nhas to be thought through.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, obviously we do want to preserve what is \nin the bill. That is why we are doing the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the intent of the Senator is to override the \nprovisions of the bill, then that would be a problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are trying to make certain just that undefined but all \nimportant concept of accountability remains. As you possibly take \nportions of the responsibility of department heads away and give it to \nthe NID, I want to make sure, if something goes wrong, who is \naccountable.\n  We will work. I understand your perspective, but I am not prepared, \nas yet, to accept that amendment. So we will lay this aside. I thank \nyou.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to go ahead with the other matter, if I \nmight.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3877, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I would like at this time to send to the desk a \nmodification to amendment No. 3877 by the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending and is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3877), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 42, line 25, and insert the following:\n       (a) National Intelligence Director Recommendation or \n     Concurrence in Certain Appointments.--With respect to any \n     position as head of an agency or organization within the \n     intelligence community--\n       (1) if the appointment to such position is made by the \n     President, any recommendation to the President to nominate or \n     appoint an individual to such position shall be accompanied \n     by the recommendation of the National Intelligence Director \n     with respect to the nomination or appointment of such \n     individual to such position; and\n       (2) if the appointment to such position is made by the head \n     of the department containing such agency or organization, the \n     Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, or a subordinate \n     official of such department or of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, no individual may be appointed to such position \n     without the concurrence of the National Intelligence \n     Director.\n       (b) Presidential Authority.--This section, and the \n     amendments made by this section, shall apply to the fullest \n     extent consistent with the authority of the President under \n     the Constitution relating to nomination, appointment, and \n     supervision of the unitary executive branch.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Section 201 of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) by striking subsection (a);\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (a) and (b), respectively;\n       (C) by striking ``Director of Central Intelligence'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``National Intelligence \n     Director'';\n       (D) in subsection (a), as so redesignated--\n       (i) in paragraph (1)--\n       (I) by striking ``seek'' and inserting ``obtain''; and\n       (II) by striking the second sentence; and\n       (ii) in paragraph (2)--\n       (I) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (II) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.''; \n     and\n       (E) in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), as so \n     redesignated--\n       (i) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (ii) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph (B):\n       ``(B) The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.''.\n       (2)(A) The heading of such section is amended by striking \n     ``consultation and''.\n       (B) The table of sections at the beginning of subchapter II \n     of chapter 8 of such title is amended in the item relating to \n     section 201 by striking ``consultation and''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier today I engaged in a colloquy and \nsubmitted the original form of this amendment. Subsequent thereto, I \nhad the opportunity to consult with a number of individuals. It is my \ndesire now, basically, to revise my amendment to comport with section \n106 of the President's proposal, which he forwarded to the Senate. That \nis entitled:\n\n       Appointment of officials responsible for intelligence-\n     related activities. Requirement for National Intelligence \n     Director concurrence with respect to certain appointments, \n     with respect to any positions that heads of agency or \n     organization within the intelligence community. . . .\n\n  My concern, what I am trying to achieve by this succession of \namendments, is to provide some uniformity in the process designating \nand selecting the heads of the various--for example, the combat \ncommands, as I refer to them, that was the subject of my earlier \namendment.\n  I find that the President's approach in the proposal that he \nforwarded to the Senate is preferable to my earlier attempt at this. It \nreads:\n\n       If the appointment to such position is made by the \n     President, any recommendation to the President to nominate or \n     appoint an individual to such position shall be accompanied \n     by the recommendation of the National Intelligence Director \n     with respect to the [proposed] nomination or appointment. . . \n     .\n       (2) if the appointment to such position is made by the head \n     of the department containing agency or organization [within \n     the intelligence community or] the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, or a subordinate official of such \n     department or of the Central Intelligence Agency, no \n     individual shall be appointed to such position without the \n     concurrence of the National Intelligence Director.\n\n  I believe that, then, confirms there is a certain degree of \nuniformity and preservation of accountability for the people selected \nin the various heads of the departments and the agencies.\n  With that, I will yield the floor for such comment as may be \nforthcoming from the chairman and ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee. I know he was present when Mr. McLaughlin was \nActing Director of the CIA and he testified, along with a number of \ndistinguished Government officials, including the Secretary of Defense. \nHe made clear one point. I mentioned it earlier. He said that in any \nreorganization, it needs to be clear where the responsibility and \naccountability lies.\n  He asked the question, who will brief the President, and, in fact, \nwho will be held accountable if he briefs the President incorrectly?\n  I see Senator Warner, and I would like to ask the bill managers, \nalso, but my question to Senator Warner is, from his study of the bill, \nwhich is more extensive than mine, does he think there is any clear \nanswer in this legislation that is moving forward to the question asked \nby Mr. McLaughlin? Who briefs the President and who is responsible if \nhe is in error?\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for the question because earlier \ntoday I had a number of discussions related to this question. I talked \nto some of the White House people. I think I have spoken in the Chamber \na number of times about my concern as to the future posture, standing, \nof this Director of Central Intelligence. He has this magnificent \norganization, albeit there was a problem on the weapons of mass \ndestruction, but in terms of numbers it was a relatively minute number \nof people, although the problem is very serious. The organization is \nall over the world and they are taking risks, extraordinary in some \ninstances, comparable to the men and women in uniform of the Armed \nForces as they pursue their assignments.\n  It is my concern in this reorganization where the director of \nintelligence now becomes a subordinate, and a decision is to be made by \nthe President, in this legislation it appears to be the case he will \nnot be at the moment on the council--are you familiar with the council \nof the Secretaries of State and Defense, Attorney General, Homeland \nSecurity, and others, who will be sort of a close-knit group and NID \nwill be chairman of the council, and from time to time they will be \nadvising the President, presumably, through the NID? I have tried to \nwork it out so if, say, the Secretary of Defense has views at variance \nwith the NID at the time the NID briefs the President on the NID's \nposition, he is obligated by law to brief the President on the \ndivergent position of one or more members of his council. That is a \npending amendment. It is a joint intelligence communities council.\n  Anyway, I felt that perhaps somehow the Director of the CIA should be \ninvolved. There is concern about protocol. It is all Cabinet. He, as \nsuch, does not have Cabinet rank. I am working on a proposition to see \nwhether we can preserve the integrity that has been accumulated over \nmany years of the Director of the CIA. It is not only in the United \nStates; he is known all over the world as a person who holds that \nposition. I don't want to see any loss in the eyes of the counterparts \nworldwide as this new structure, presumably, will be enacted into law.\n  The answer to the question is, of course, the President can have \nwhomever he wishes to brief him, but I presume NID is specifically \nsomeone that the President asked the Congress to create by law. He \nwould be the principal briefer. From time to time he would be \naccompanied perhaps by others and I think more often than not by the \nDirector of the CIA.\n  Given that it is the President's absolute authority to decide who he \nwants to brief him, I don't think it should be written into law, but I \nam seeking some clarification to the very question the Senator has \nasked because it is of concern to me. As soon as I gain further \ninformation, I will be happy to share it with my colleague.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Warner for his comments. It does appear \nif we pass this new procedure, we ought to understand who Congress \ncontemplates would be the person most likely to brief the President.\n  I think I understand what the Senator was saying. It is so important \nthat if the main person is going to be the NID, the national \nintelligence director who does the briefing, it seems to me he or she \nwould have to reach down and take about half of the CIA up to be on his \nstaff to help him prepare the brief or else he will be regurgitating \nwhat came from some other agency and then we have created a weakened \nCIA, a muddled NID, and who is responsible. Is that a problem?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is quite correct. We do not \nwant to do that.\n  In good faith, the chairman of the committee has repeatedly said, in \nthis Chamber, we are not creating a whole new department. I heard the \nranking member today mention that. Therefore, we would not in any way \nbe trying to create that number of persons.\n  Nevertheless, who knows them better--that is, the individual members \nof the CIA--than the Director who has daily hands-on authority, who \ntravels and visits in posts all over the world, who is basically \nresponsible for their promotion, demotion, and accountability.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The chairman is correct.\n  For the people following this debate, they need to know that the CIA \nhas operations in virtually every country in the world and it is from \nthose agents that much of our intelligence comes. It comes through the \nCIA Director and he has always briefed the President as the Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  Mr. WARNER. And that fact is known, if I can say to my colleague, \nthat fact is known the world over, that the man who directs the CIA and \nwho is visiting in Great Britain or Pakistan, that is the man who will \ngo home and look the President of the United States straight in the \neye. That carries a lot of weight as it results in the creation of \npersonal relationships between the director of our intelligence and his \ncounterparts worldwide.\n  I do not think it is a subject that can be legislated in law. It is \nsomething of legislative history being created in the Senate now and is \na vital part of the future interpretation and implementation of this \nnew law.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the distinguished managers of the bill, for whom \nI have so much respect, care to comment on the question that Acting \nDirector McLaughlin posed at our hearing when he said one thing we had \nto be clear about was who would be responsible for stating the \nintelligence position of the United States to the President and who \nwould be held accountable if they were wrong. It is a question we need \nto be clear about.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is a very important question and I am prepared to \ngive a very short and direct answer which I believe is reflected in the \nbill, which is that the national intelligence director is explicitly \nintended to be the principal intelligence advisor to the President of \nthe United States. There should be no doubt about that.\n  It will give him two roles: One as administrator of the intelligence \ncommunity--but then, why? To be the principal intelligence adviser to \nthe No. 1 user of intelligence, not the only one but the President of \nthe United States as Commander in Chief.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Lieberman, I would share your view \nthat the President is the No. 1 customer of the intelligence that comes \nforward. I think he may well need a No. 1 adviser to help assimilate \nall of it.\n  But let's go back now. Would it normally be that the person who walks \nin there and looks the President in the eye--should not that person \nhave line, control, and supervision over the people who provided him \nwith that intelligence? And isn't that the only way he can be held \nresponsible for the brief and the opinions to the President, if he \nobtained the information from sources that are accountable to him or \nher?\n  Whereas, in this case, if the NID does it, and the information is \ncoming up through the vast CIA network around the world, as it most \noften would be--not always but most often would be--then, isn't that a \nweakness in our concept here?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, through you, of course, I say to the \nSenator, I do not believe it is a weakness. Here is the judgment we had \nto make: The Director of Central Intelligence now is effectively the \nprincipal intelligence adviser to the President,\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\nbut as we have seen and stated over and over again in this debate, the \nrecord shows that the DCI has not had enough authority to coordinate \nthe activities of the intelligence community to create the kind of \nunity of effort that we need to make sure we do not have a repeat, at \nworst, of September 11 and, in a very different way, of what everybody \nacknowledges was an imperfect functioning of the intelligence community \nprior to the Iraq war, as documented by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  So we want to give him some authority, but we specifically rejected \nwhat would effectively be a department of intelligence, taking NSA, \nNRO, and NGA out of Defense, taking the counterterrorism out of the \nFBI, Information Analysis out of the Department of Homeland Security, \net cetera, et cetera, making it a department.\n  We are trying to strike a balance where you preserve the autonomy of \nthose departments' line control, but you put them all together, \nparticularly in that counterterrorism center, so that the director is \nhearing from all of them and is accountable, and then reports on these \nintelligence matters to the President.\n  Incidentally, the Collins-Lieberman proposal does make clear--I will \njust read from section 111:\n\n       The National Intelligence Director shall be responsible for \n     providing national intelligence--\n       (1) to the President;\n       (2) to the heads of other departments and agencies of the \n     executive branch;\n\n  Also consumers, the Defense Department the largest of the consumers.\n\n       (3) to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior \n     military commanders;\n       (4) to the Senate and House of Representatives and the \n     committees thereof;\n       (5) [and] to such other persons or entities as the \n     President shall direct.\n\n  So there is no question there is a balance. But I think it is a \nbalance that serves the Nation's interests well. We have power in the \nNID, but we have not broken the line of authority in other Departments.\n  As I believe I heard Senator Warner say at one point, I presume the \nnational intelligence director, in the exercise of his \nresponsibilities, will, from time to time, bring with him to advise the \nPresident the head of the CIA, the head of the Homeland Security \nDepartment, whoever seems relevant on a given occasion, but to say that \nfor intelligence there is one person ultimately accountable, and that \nis the national intelligence director.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I thank the Senator. I can see the concept there. \nI guess in my own mind I am having difficulty understanding why we \nshould not raise up the CIA director and make sure that entity \nexercises the power that it is supposed to have now. It is supposed to \nbe the central intelligence center for the country. And just to add \nanother office above it has a number of problems. As Senator Warner \nsaid, there are agents all over the world gathering intelligence who \nare responsible directly to the CIA Director, who then is supposed to \ndirectly advise the President.\n  So I hope we will think about this problem as we go forward. If we \nfollow the model of the drug czar, I might feel a bit more comfortable. \nThe drug czar, the Office of National Drug Control Policy Director, as \nI said earlier, requires that there be a written plan for combating \nillegal drugs in the United States. Every agency involved in that \neffort has to participate in drafting the plan and sign off on the plan \nwhen it is agreed to. And then that Director, the drug czar, reviews \ntheir budget request to make sure they are funding the effort in a \ncoordinated way and has the ear of the President if an entity or agency \nrefuses to cooperate.\n  But organizations have integrity. I do not think, in general, anyone \nwould argue that it is healthy governmental philosophy or political \nscience to have a person the head of an agency and then people under \nhim and parts of his budget be decided directly by somebody else, and \ndepartment heads have to be approved or appointed by other people. It \nclassically undermines responsibility. In America we have one \nGovernment. And within the Government there are three parts. There are \nthe executive, judicial, and legislative branches. But we have created \nso many fiefdoms in the executive branch it is hard to hold the \nPresident accountable. The FBI Director has--what?--a 12-year term? So \nit is hard to hold the President responsible for these entities. And \nthen you have Secretaries who do not even have control over the people \nwithin their agencies.\n  So those are some of my concerns. As I said, it may be that \nnervousness before you sign the deed on the new house. But, again, it \ncould be that some of these things may not work as well as we project \nthem to at this time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. President, I, obviously, respect and appreciate the \nconcerns that my friend from Alabama has. I want to assure him that we \nhave been over this. And the two things--one, is that not just the 9/11 \nCommission but a lot of folks, not universally felt, but a lot of \npeople feel that the drug czar has not been all that the position could \nhave been because he did not have any budget authority. He formed the \nbudget but did not really have the muscle. As a matter of fact, \nGovernor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, in their report, specifically \nsaid they did not want the national intelligence director to be like \nthe drug czar.\n  Second, one of the conclusions I gather from the Scowcroft Report, \nbut also others, including 9/11, is that what has happened up until now \nis that the Director of Central Intelligence has basically been the \nDirector of the CIA--of course, the same person--and not had the time \nor the clout to coordinate the rest of the intelligence community.\n  That is part of the failure prior to September 11. That is why we \nspecifically recommend breaking them in two, creating this director \nover everybody. The CIA is an important part, but there are a lot of \nother important parts. The FBI counterterrorism and the NSA, NRO, and \nNGA, as the Senator well knows, in terms of numbers of employees and \nthe amount of the budget, are very big entities that, for now, have \nbeen too much outside the control of the Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  So as I say, we have tried to balance. In some way, it might have \nbeen neater to take all the pieces and put them under a new secretary \nof intelligence, but then you really would have, for instance, broken \nthe chain of command in the Defense Department.\n  We didn't want to do that. We are trying to have a balance to say \nwhen it comes to intelligence, there is one person accountable, and \nthat is the national intelligence director.\n  I thank the Senator. I think this kind of discussion is very \nimportant to getting all of us to a point where we can not only proceed \nwith the amendments but go ahead and ultimately next week adopt the \nbill and have a good feeling about it. Hopefully, we can lead the \nSenator from Alabama over his buyer's anxiety right now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is a difficult thing. I remember the story very \ndistinctly. There was an attempt to merge the FBI and DEA in the early \n1980s. I wrote Associate Attorney General Giuliani a letter suggesting \nwhat should be merged is DEA and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I saw \nhim not long after that and he said: Jeff, we can't even merge agencies \nwithin the Department of Justice, don't you know? To merge an agency in \nTreasury with one of Justice is impossible.\n  While it is weird that we in the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States are not capable of merging agencies, as a practical \nmatter, it is very difficult to do these things. I don't think most \npeople realize how our Government really functions. It has great \npoints. Some of the best people I have ever known serve in our \nGovernment. But there are problems in making it efficient.\n  I thank the managers for their leadership and hard work.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3807\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I call up again amendment No. 3807 \noffered by Senator McCain and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to send to the desk a modification to the \namendment which is essentially a change of one word. I believe having \nmade that one-word change, this amendment implements another section of \nthe 9/11 Commission Report and is acceptable on both sides.\n  I thank my dear friend and colleague, Senator Collins, for all the \nwork we have done together on this amendment, and with other \nstakeholders who had some concerns about the amendment, generally \nsupported it, and we have worked them all out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut and \nmy colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for working with me to \naddress concerns that have been raised by the National Governors \nAssociation regarding the provisions in the McCain-Lieberman amendment \nthat dealt with the standardization of State drivers' licenses. I \nbelieve the change which has been made, which will require an \nassessment of the cost benefits of any new requirements, is an \nimportant one.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from the National Governors \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                National Governors\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the nation's Governors I \n     am writing to thank you for your efforts in negotiating a \n     compromise on amendment language regarding minimum standards \n     for state driver's licenses. I know that you share Governors' \n     concerns regarding the security and integrity of state \n     driver's license and identification processes and appreciate \n     the difficulties that federal mandates, particularly unfunded \n     mandates, placed on states.\n       Due in large part to your concern regarding the mandates in \n     the McCain/Lieberman driver's license amendment, NGA was able \n     to make suggestions to improve the measure. We understand \n     that a provision has been added to require that the \n     negotiated rulemaking committee perform an assessment of the \n     benefits and costs of its recommendations. This change is \n     essential to help ensure that the federal government provides \n     adequate funding to states to implement the required \n     mandates.\n       Governors are committed to working cooperatively with the \n     federal government to develop and implement realistic, \n     achievable standards that will enhance efforts to prevent \n     document fraud and other illegal activity related to the \n     issuance of driver's licenses and identification documents. \n     We appreciate your willingness to work with states to address \n     our concerns. With all the changes included in the amendment, \n     it will provide a reasonable compromise for addressing this \n     issue.\n       Thank you again for your consideration and assistance. We \n     look forward to working with you during conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Governors\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman: Governors share \n     your concerns regarding the security and integrity of state \n     driver's license and identification processes. While NGA \n     opposes federal mandates on states, particularly unfunded \n     mandates, we appreciate your willingness to work with states \n     to improve your amendment regarding minimum requirements for \n     state driver's licenses. As you know, NGA strongly opposes \n     the more proscriptive driver's license mandate provisions \n     under consideration in the House.\n       It is my understanding that your original amendment has \n     been modified to include two important changes: (1) \n     clarification that the standards that will be set in the \n     rulemaking process will initially apply only to newly-issued \n     and reissued driver's licenses; and (2) a requirement that \n     state elected officials, including Governors, serve on the \n     negotiated rulemaking committee. In addition, we request that \n     a provision be added to require that the negotiated \n     rulemaking committee perform an assessment of the annual \n     benefits and costs of its recommendations.\n       The first two changes are vital to ensuring that the \n     minimum requirements established under the amendment are \n     workable, do not unnecessarily interfere with existing state \n     laws and improvements, and benefit from the expertise and \n     knowledge of state officials. Likewise, the last change is \n     essential to help ensure that the federal government provides \n     adequate funding to states to implement the required \n     mandates.\n       Governors are committed to working cooperatively with the \n     federal government to develop and implement realistic, \n     achievable standards that will enhance efforts to prevent \n     document fraud and other illegal activity related to the \n     issuance of driver's licenses and identification documents. \n     We appreciate your willingness to work with states to address \n     our concerns. If all three changes are included in the \n     amendment it will provide a reasonable compromise for \n     addressing this issue.\n       Thank you again for your consideration and assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the modified \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3807), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their work on \nintelligence reform. I want to make a few remarks on the intelligence \nreform bill.\n  I am supportive of the overall efforts of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, what my colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, and my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, are doing as well on \nintelligence reform, and I want to support this overall effort.\n  Before I proceed, it is important to underscore why this is such an \nimportant debate in the United States, especially when it is so deeply \nengaged in many places around the world and particularly in the Middle \nEast and Iraq. In the context of the underlying bill, we need to make \nsure we clearly understand this.\n  There is some public uncertainty regarding these issues. As the \ndebate showed last night, we have fundamental differences even between \nPresident Bush and Senator Kerry. But both agree, in my opinion, why \nthe U.S. commitment to Iraq is absolutely essential and why we must not \nfail in Iraq or in this effort to reform our national intelligence.\n  For purposes of discussion, I recommend a rereading of Osama bin \nLaden's declaration of war against the Americans. He issued this in \n1998. It is in the 9/11 Commission Report and it is chilling, but it \ntells you what is at stake in this debate.\n  He says this, and this is a direct quote from that declaration of \nwar:\n\n       The Defence Secretary of the Crusading Americans had said \n     that the explosions at Riyadh and Al-Khobar had taught him \n     one lesson: that is not to withdraw when attacked by cowardly \n     terrorists.\n\n  bin Laden continues:\n\n       We say to the Defence Secretary that his talk could induce \n     a grieving mother to laughter! And it shows the fears that \n     have enveloped you all. Where was this courage of yours when \n     the explosion in Beirut took place in 1983 . . . You were \n     transformed into scattered bits and pieces: 241 soldiers were \n     killed, most of them Marines.\n\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\n\n  bin Laden continues:\n\n       When tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and \n     one American pilot was dragged in the street of Mogadishu, \n     you left the area in disappointment, humiliation, and defeat, \n     carrying your dead with you.\n       Clinton appeared in front of the whole world threatening \n     and promising revenge, but these threats were merely a \n     preparation for withdrawal. You had been disgraced by Allah \n     and you withdraw; the extent of your impotence and weaknesses \n     became very clear.\n\n  As bin Laden had explained earlier in the declaration:\n\n       Efforts should be concentrated on destroying, fighting, and \n     killing the (American) enemy until, by the grace of Allah, it \n     is completely defeated.\n\n  The task is stated quite simply by bin Laden:\n\n       Killing Americans.\n\n  In June 2002, bin Laden spokesman, Suleiman Abu Gheith, placed this \nstatement on the al-Qaida Web site:\n\n       We have the right to kill 4 million Americans--2 million of \n     them children--and to exile twice as many and wound and \n     cripple hundreds of thousands.\n\n  He said that:\n\n       We have the right to kill 4 million Americans--2 million of \n     them children. . . .\n\n  What can we do to forestall these promised attacks? According to bin \nLaden, if we follow what he says, we can forestall these promised \nattacks if ``America should abandon the Middle East, convert to Islam \nand end the immorality and godlessness of its society and culture,'' \nfor according to bin Laden, ``It is saddening to tell you that you are \nthe worst civilization witnessed by the history of mankind.''\n  That is what we fight, and that is what we must stand strong against \nand be as strong and as organized as we possibly can and have as good \nintelligence as we possibly can to fight these fanatics.\n  These terrorists are fanatics. They are wrong about America, and \nAmerica will fight. They may be fanatics--and they are--but James \nSchlesinger reminded us earlier this year in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that they are deadly serious and thoroughly persistent.\n  We have to therefore anticipate we will be engaged in this global war \non terrorism for years to come and we must not waiver in this effort.\n  As Osama himself has said:\n\n       When the people see a strong horse and a weak horse, they \n     naturally gravitate towards the strong horse.\n\n  Therefore, we as a nation and as a body must do everything within our \nmeans to demonstrate that we are not the weak horse. That is why \nretreat before we have successfully stabilized Iraq is not an option. \nNothing was more dramatically visible throughout the Middle East and \nelsewhere of our retreat than were those earlier retreats cited by \nOsama bin Laden.\n  The debate over Iraq will continue, even after the election, \nregarding the timing of our move into Iraq, but that is a moot issue. \nWe are there now and our soldiers are doing the best they can under \ndifficult circumstances. We will bring them home, but make no mistake \nabout the fact that we are anything but united in our determination to \npersevere and to prevail in Iraq. Success is the only acceptable course \nof action.\n  How then are we to be successful in sustaining order and stability in \nIraq and bringing order to the chaos that the terrorists can \npotentially produce around the world? Only by embracing certain \nfundamental realities. First and foremost, establishing reasonable \nsecurity is the prerequisite for achieving the goals of political \nstability. We are doing that in Iraq and we are doing that in \nAfghanistan. It is slow going and it is difficult, and there will be \nbumps along the way.\n  Second, neither the American nor the coalition forces can by \nthemselves impose security on Iraq. Iraqis themselves must provide \nindispensable support and their own security. Only Iraqis can gather \nthe intelligence to identify the regime remnants and foreign terrorists \nwho must be largely neutralized before adequate security can be \nassured.\n  Moreover, it will be essential for Iraqi security forces to be the \nprincipal elements in rooting out terrorists and destroying their \ncells, with the coalition military increasingly in a supporting role.\n  Similarly, America must take charge of its own security in a way that \nis consistent with the changed realities in our post-9/11 world. This \nlegislation we are debating, the first major overhaul of the \nintelligence system, is a major step in that direction. We have the \ncapability, the ability, and the motive--our national security--to do \nthis now and to do it right.\n  As my colleague Senator Kyl from Arizona said yesterday, the problem \nbefore 9/11 was not due to too much intelligence. The problem obviously \narose because we did not have enough intelligence, smart intelligence, \ncreative intelligence. We could not gather enough information in \na timely way to put together all of the possibilities in order to \nconnect the dots, in order to predict that a particular kind of attack \nwas going to occur on that day.\n\n  We have had a lot of good, constructive suggestions, from many \nplaces, from the 9/11 Commission, from the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, the great work of its chairman and my colleague Senator Pat \nRoberts from Kansas, from the administration, from the work of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Rockefeller also on the \nIntelligence Committee, from other commissions in trying to understand \nwhy we did not have enough intelligence and why we could not put it all \ntogether ahead of time.\n  Many of the recommendations of the Commission and legislative \nsolutions in the proposed bill try to correct that problem of not \nhaving enough good intelligence and knowing precisely what we need to \ndo with the intelligence once we have it.\n  Most importantly, we need to find a way of bringing the creativity \nand imagination back into the intelligence business. For too long, the \nsystem has been hampered by bureaucracy that by design is risk averse \nand unwilling to take the offensive. As Senator Kyl mentioned the other \nday, if we look back at President Clinton's directives to the \nintelligence community, he tried to be forward leaning, especially with \nregard to al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. But even though the President \nhimself seemed to say we have to do everything we can to try to get \nthese guys, he ran into bureaucratic barriers. Repeatedly, efforts were \nmade to bring to his attention operations that would have either \nimproved our intelligence or operationally deal with al-Qaida and Osama \nbin Laden, but they were shot down by various portions or places within \nthe bureaucracy or lawyers within the system. If someone tried to do \nsomething, somebody else said this is too risky, we cannot do it.\n  We have to change that mentality. That was why the 9/11 Commission, \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, and many other observers have said \nwe have to get out of this paralyzing risk-averse environment where \npeople are afraid somebody is looking over their shoulders, is going to \njump on them if they do anything that is the least bit out of the \nordinary or risky. We have to get this bureaucratic mindset out because \nour very security depends on it.\n  I thank the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nCollins, for her great work on this, and the ranking member, Senator \nLieberman. I appreciate the important work of my colleagues Senator \nRoberts and Senator Rockefeller, and I hope that we will speedily get \nto a resolution so we can pass this important bill soon and change the \ndynamic and make a safer America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \ngenerous comments and for presenting a very compelling case for passing \nthis legislation, a case that says we cannot delay; the stakes are too \nhigh; the issues are too compelling in the war against terrorism. I \nthank him for his support and for his hard work on this very important \nissue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3798, 3799, 3800, 3911, 3912, 3932, 3864, 3772, 3813 \n                           and 3717, en bloc\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we proceed to the consideration of the \nBingaman-Domenici amendment 3771, as modified. I send the modification \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Bingaman and \n     Mr. Domenici, , proposes an amendment numbered 3771, as \n     modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize employees of Federally Funded Research and \n Development Centers and certain employees of the Department of Energy \n  national laboratories to be eligible for the staff of the National \n     Counterterrorism Center and the national intelligence centers)\n\n       On page 91, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (C) Employees of Federally Funded Research and Development \n     Centers (as that term is defined in part 2 of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation), including employees of the \n     Department of Energy national laboratories who are associated \n     with field intelligence elements of the Department of Energy, \n     shall be eligible to serve under contract or other mechanism \n     with the National Counterterrorism Center under this \n     paragraph.\n       On page 98, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       (C) Employees of Federally Funded Research and Development \n     Centers (as that term is defined in part 2 of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation), including employees of the \n     Department of Energy national laboratories who are associated \n     with field intelligence elements of the Department of Energy, \n     shall be eligible to serve under contract or other mechanism \n     with a national intelligence center under this paragraph.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since World War II, our national \nlaboratories, primarily serving Energy and Defense Department missions, \nhave been the Nation's repository of expertise on nuclear weapons and \nother national security and technical issues. Although many of these \nnational laboratories are known as Federal Funded Research and \nDevelopment Centers, or FFRDC's, and are federally financed, lab \nemployees are not Federal employees. They are employees of the \ncontractors who operate these laboratories. This amendment would make \nemployees of the FFRDC's eligible to serve at the National \nCounterterrorism Center and other national intelligence centers.\n  I agree with the sponsors of this amendment that if the national \nintelligence director, or NID, determines that he or she needs to tap \nthe experts employed at our FFRDC's to help staff these centers, then \nhe or she should be able to do so. But I also want to make it clear, \nthat it is my understanding that we are not creating a new mission for \nthe FFRDC's or authorizing the creation of a new FFRDC for this \npurpose. Use of these employees would be subject to the availability of \nfunds to the NID, and would still be subject to the Federal conflict of \ninterest provisions and the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Finally, \nnothing in this amendment is intended to circumvent staff year ceilings \nestablished by law for Defense Department-sponsored FFRDC's or any \nother FFRDC's.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmodification be agreed to, that the amendment, as modified, be agreed \nto, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3771), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3756\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the Senate now proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of the Graham-Durbin amendment No. 3756.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill please report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. Graham of \n     Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 3756.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish additional education and training requirements \n                for the National Intelligence Authority)\n\n       On page 108, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 153.

Each report shall notify \n     Congress of any additional resources determined by the \n     Director to be required to meet such requirements.\n       (4) Each report under paragraph (3) shall be in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n       (c) Professional Intelligence Training.--The National \n     Intelligence Director shall require the head of each element \n     and component within the National Intelligence Authority who \n     has responsibility for professional intelligence training to \n     periodically review and revise the curriculum for the \n     professional intelligence training of the senior and \n     intermediate level personnel of such element or component in \n     order to--\n       (1) strengthen the focus of such curriculum on the \n     integration of intelligence collection and analysis \n     throughout the Authority; and\n       (2) prepare such personnel for duty with other departments, \n     agencies, and element of the intelligence community.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3756) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as I indicated, those amendments have all \nbeen worked out. They have been cleared on both sides. We are making \nprogress on this bill. There have been a great number of amendments \nfiled. I encourage all Senators to work closely with the managers of \nthe bill to allow us to proceed to consider this bill on Tuesday. We \nhave a great deal of work to be done before that time, but we made \nprogress today.\n  I also thank those Senators who came forward with their amendments \ntoday. Shortly, I will have an announcement about the voting schedule \nfor Monday. We do expect to have a number of stacked votes in the mid \nto late afternoon. We are working on that list even as we speak.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to pay \ntribute to a young Ohioan who gave his life in the line of duty \nfighting for freedom. Today I stand here to remember a soldier of \ninspiring independence and determination, a young man whose life was \ncut far too short when the tank he was in was hit by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade in Kufa, Iraq. He was 20 years old.\n  Army PFC Nicholaus Zimmer was the only child of Lisa and Harold \n``Gino'' Zimmer of Powell, OH. The two were proud, yet of course, \nworried when their son decided to enlist in the Army at the age of 17. \nDespite their natural parental concerns, they knew he would go his own \nway and do things in his own way. Because, you see, Nicholaus Zimmer \nwas special. He was voted most unique in the Westland High School class \nof 2002. He defied stereotypes. He was unconventional. He had an \nexceptional spirit. Nicholaus was lovingly described as a bookish, \npink-haired, 1970s-clothes-wearing, skateboarding kid who loved to \nquestion authority. I should note, though, that the pink hair \ndescription was constantly changing, as Nicholaus altered his hair \ncolor to blue and even shaved it once into a Mohawk haircut. Though \nmost would consider pink hair as strictly a defining characteristic, it \nwas not so for Nicholaus. As with other aspects of his life, Nicholaus \ncould not be easily pigeonholed--not really--especially as a punk rock \nyouth. No, he loved to read Shakespeare and would quote it while \ntalking to teachers. Nicholaus was considering becoming an English \nteacher. Well, that or maybe an Apache helicopter pilot. Nicholaus was \nambitious and set his goals high. He enlisted in the Army so he could \nearn money to go to college and see the world. He was assigned to the \n2nd Battalion, 37th Armored Regiment, 1st Armored Division out of \nFriedberg, Germany. His job was driving M1A1 tanks--another irony in \nhis life given the fact that Nicholaus didn't have a driver's license. \nNevertheless, he drove that tank with great skill and expertise.\n  At age 19, Nicholaus was sent to Iraq. Nicholaus would send his \nparents souvenirs from Iraq, including shrapnel and money with Saddam \nHussein's face on it. They in turn would send him his favorite books \nand baby wipes to take the sand off of his body.\n  Nicholaus was proud to serve. He was also anxious to come home, come \nhome to show his parents the man he had become in the time that he was \naway.\n  As his mom said;\n\n       His year was up on Mother's Day. You could tell he was \n     ready to come home. But he had a job to do.\n\n  Nicholaus was a good soldier. Here is how his company commander CPT \nJohn Moore described him:\n\n       Nick was a superb soldier and had a priceless sense of \n     humor in a place where that came at a premium. He always had \n     a great way of identifying with other soldiers and making the \n     best of some pretty rough situations. As a soldier he was \n     decorated twice for bravery in battle, and he never forgot \n     his duty to his fellow troops. After our company lost our \n     first man, Sergeant Mike Mitchell, Nick was best able to \n     verbalize our sense of loss and what that grief meant to us, \n     despite his junior rank, experience and young age. I will \n     never forget his ability to joke and see the brighter side of \n     any situation and his ability to identify with everybody \n     regardless of rank. Nick's loss hit the 3rd Platoon and \n     all of Crusader Company very hard and resonates through my \n     company still.\n\n  I would like to share with you now an e-mail message posted on a \nsoldier memorial Web site following Nicholaus's death. It is from the \nsister of that same Sergeant Mitchell. The sister writes:\n\n       To the family and friends of Nick--my name is Christine, \n     and I am the sister of Michael Mitchell, who served with \n     Nick. My brother was taken from us on April 4, 2004. My heart \n     goes out to you because we definitely can understand your \n     pain. . . . I want to thank you all since I will not be able \n     to tell Nick myself. I guess Nick was helping the soldiers \n     with the death of my brother. I read a letter that Captain \n     Moore wrote where he said, ``Nobody will ever forget that \n     Nick Zimmer was probably one of the most verbally expressive \n     soldiers in this command and that he more than anyone else in \n     the company helped us to identify the effects of Mike \n     Mitchell's death so we could soldier through it and \n     understand it.'' So Nick, thank you. You and my brother are \n     together now. Please take care of each other.\n\n  I have no doubt that they are taking care of each other. Soldiers \ntake care of each other in life and in death. When Nicholaus passed \naway, family, friends, and members of the Powell community came out to \nshow their support for the Zimmer family. American flags lined the \nyards down the street, and neighbors stood along the road to pay their \nrespects as the funeral procession passed, a procession that included \nNicholaus's father and dozens of motorcycles adorned with flags.\n  Though it is never easy to say goodbye, the funeral of Nicholaus \nZimmer was what he would have wanted. A two-star general sat next to a \nskateboarder with multiple piercings. Looking through the crowd, one \ncould see tattooed bikers, men in business suits, and teenagers with a \nvariety of unconventional hair colors. Yes, I think he would have liked \nit.\n  Indeed, Nicholaus Zimmer was a unique young man, a unique young man \nwith the ability to bring people together of all walks of life. This \nwas apparent at the funeral. It was apparent to anyone who knew him.\n  As his father said:\n\n       Look at Nicholaus as an example . . . He always lived the \n     way he wanted to--and he died that way, too.\n\n  Mr. President, I never had the chance to meet Nicholaus Zimmer, but I \nwish I could have. I did have the privilege of\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nmeeting Nicholaus's family during the calling hours for their son. I \nthank them for sharing their memories with me. They told me that \nNicholaus was not the only member of their family to serve overseas. \nNicholaus had an uncle who served in Vietnam and a grandfather who saw \naction in Korea. The Zimmer family is proud of their son's service. Our \nNation, too, is proud of his service.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with a message from the extended \nfamily of Army Specialist A.J. Vandayburg, an Ohio soldier from \nMansfied, who was also killed in Iraq in April. They wrote the \nfollowing to the Zimmer family:\n\n       Thank you, Nicholaus, for protecting us all. Sometimes we \n     forget what our Armed Forces are doing for us. Freedom, \n     unfortunately, comes with that unforgivable, unfathomable \n     price. You will not be forgotten for your sacrifice. To your \n     family, we say thank you, too, for your sacrifice. There are \n     no words to replace a child, a brother, an uncle--a loved \n     one. When you are able, seek out those who have given their \n     all. We know from experience the price you have paid, and we \n     mourn with you. God bless you all.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that letter expresses our sentiments, as well, \nto the family.\n\n\n                   marine lance corporal will stevens\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I today honor LCpl Will Stevens of \nRussell, KY, for his service to his country in the United States Marine \nCorps. While LCpl Stevens is recovering from a combat injury to his \nfoot in a hospital bed in San Diego, I point out the importance of his \nservice to our country.\n  Will's service to his country in Iraq ensures a safer future for \nAmerica and a more stable world in general. Will's family, his loved \nones and his countrymen are the people who benefit from the work he did \nin Iraq. We are all indebted to him for our way of life, our freedoms \nand for an example of what it means to be a good American.\n  In the words of Will's grandfather, ``He is my hero . . . I am really \nproud of him and am relieved he is going to be alright.'' And so am I. \nI thank Will and all his fellow service members for their work. May God \nbless them.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3930 And 3931, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I now ask for the regular order with respect to Collins-\nLieberman amendment No. 3705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir tremendous work today, really over the course of the last week, \nespecially on the amendments that we have addressed over the course of \nthe whole week. They have worked diligently. It has been a productive \nweek. It has been a long week, but we have had good debate on an issue \nthat is complex, an issue that we have all studied for a long period of \ntime but an issue on which I believe debate and the amendment process \ncontributes even greater to our understanding.\n  It has been very important for Members to come to the floor and \ndebate their different views and their thoughts with respect to our \nintelligence agencies, their relationships one to another.\n  We have a number of amendments now pending. As the preview order \nprovides, we will begin voting on some of those amendments at 4:15 on \nMonday.\n  I come to the floor at this time with the concern that the clock is \nstill ticking and is working against us on the bill, in part because of \nthe large number of potential amendments. People have submitted \namendments and put them in language and begun talking about them, but \nwe clearly need to pick up the pace in order to finish the bill early \nnext week.\n  Following the completion of this bill, the Senate still must address \nthe internal reform, the internal intelligence oversight reform that \ngoes on in this body. We will begin that on the Senate floor after we \ncomplete the Collins-Lieberman bill.\n  Having said that, I will file a cloture motion in a moment. I do this \nto ensure that we will being the Collins-Lieberman bill to conclusion \nat a reasonable time next week, still giving us time to address the \nother aspect of reform, and that is the internal oversight reform in \nthe Senate.\n  This is done in consultation with the managers and with the \nDemocratic leadership. The purpose is not in any way to cut off \nSenators' rights, but I do remind my colleagues that when colture is \ninvoked there is still an additional 30 hours of consideration if we \nneed that.\n  I hope all of that time will be considered but not be necessarily \nused. Rule XXII provides for that postcloture time.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Daschle and myself, I \nsend a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 2845, \n     Calendar No. 716, a bill to reform the intelligence community \n     and the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of \n     the United States Government, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Tom Daschle, Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander, \n           Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, John Warner, Judd Gregg, \n           Saxby Chambliss, John Cornyn, Kay Bailey Hutchison, \n           George Allen, Gordon Smith, Jim Talent, Norm Coleman, \n           Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Mitch McConnell, Joseph \n           Lieberman.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

American citizens in towns and communities all \nacross our Nation commemorated this occasion by pausing to remember \nAmerican prisoners of war, those who continue to be missing, and their \nfamilies.\n  A national observance was held on the River Parade Field at the \nPentagon with an honor guard parade consisting of units from the Army, \nMarine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. Guests included the \nfamilies of former POWs and MIAs and representatives of veterans' \norganizations.\n  The guest of honor for this occasion was our distinguished colleague \nand our dear friend, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii. Senator Inouye spoke \neloquently about the significance of this remembrance as did Gen \nRichard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Deputy \nSecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.\n  Secretary Wolfowitz's statement included an introduction of Senator \nInouye that captured the life and legacy of this great patriot. The \neloquent remarks of General Myers, Secretary Wolfowitz and Senator \nInouye deserve the attention of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the speeches of General Myers, Dr. Wolfowitz and Senator Inouye be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Richard B. \n               Myers, at POW/MIA Recognition Day Ceremony\n\n       Thank you so much for joining us as we remember our \n     Prisoners of War and those still Missing in Action.\n       A special thanks Senator for joining us today. In my view, \n     Senator Inouye embodies our nation's commitment to service \n     and sacrifice--from his decorated military service during \n     World War II to his dedicated public service over the last 40 \n     years. Sir, thank you so much for your support of our \n     military family and for taking the time to be with us today.\n       This past Saturday, as you know, marked the 3-year \n     anniversary of September 11 terrorist attacks. The tragedies \n     of that day, as well as our ongoing combat operations in the \n     War on Terrorism, serve as a solemn reminder that service and \n     sacrifice are really a part of our lives.\n       Those who take the oath of office, and put on our Nation's \n     uniform, make a commitment to put the interests of others \n     ahead of their own, and set aside their personal safety and \n     comfort for the well being of others. They become part of our \n     military family, dedicated to protecting all our families.\n       Today we remember those who embraced this quality to the \n     fullest. When one of our own is killed in action, taken \n     prisoner or missing, we lose a member of our military family. \n     Certainly, I've experienced the loss of friends and squadron \n     mates during my time in Vietnam and in the years since. I \n     expect and know most of you here have experienced similar \n     pain and similar grief.\n       When one of our own becomes a POW or is missing, their \n     families, both the immediate family and the larger military \n     family, endure the tragic pain of not knowing where they are \n     or if they will ever return.\n       So it is for both the immediate family, and our larger \n     military family, that today's ceremony carries really so much \n     meaning. We gather to formally remember our loved ones and \n     their service, and to renew our pledge that we shall never, \n     never forget them.\n       The character of our Nation, in many respects, is reflected \n     in the character of those who serve. Those we remember today \n     reflect the very best of our Nation.\n       Our Deputy Secretary of Defense is also passionate about \n     the welfare of our servicemen and women, and their families. \n     And there is no one who fights harder on their behalf. He's \n     demonstrated a selfless commitment to the ideals of freedom \n     and democracy as Assistant Secretary of State, as our U.S. \n     Ambassador to Indonesia, and teaching at some of our Nation's \n     finest institutions.\n       It's a privilege and an honor to introduce our Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense, the Honorable Paul Wolfowitz.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRemarks of Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz--Introduction of \n     Senator Daniel Inouye at the National POW/MIA Recognition Day\n\n       Thank you, General Myers, for those inspiring words. And \n     thank you for your strong leadership and faithful service to \n     our country.\n       We are joined today by more than a few others who have \n     served our nation: members of America's magnificent Armed \n     Forces, and\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n     many of our brave veterans, including the many former POWs \n     who join us, and our special guest, Senator Dan Inouye.\n       I want to take this occasion to say thank you to Jerry \n     Jennings, the President's point man for accounting for \n     America's missing; and the dedicated men and women on his \n     team. The recovery and return of our missing Americans can \n     mean years of painstaking effort. And some 600 men and women, \n     both military and civilians, around the world take part in \n     everything from diplomatic negotiations and field operations \n     to forensic analysis. They are tireless and dedicated. And \n     through their latest efforts, the remains of fallen Americans \n     have just been recovered in North Korea and are now headed \n     home.\n       A special welcome to those of you who serve as leaders and \n     volunteers of POW/MIA family groups. We appreciate your \n     tireless devotion in keeping the home fires burning for those \n     Americans still missing or unaccounted for. Your devotion to \n     loved ones who have yet to return helps our nation to honor \n     its commitment to those we must never forget.\n       We're here today to honor your commitment and your courage.\n       We're here to remember and honor the courage of America's \n     POW's and missing countrymen who risked everything, facing \n     the worst of war to preserve the best of America.\n       And we are here--above all--to reaffirm our commitment to \n     keep the pledge President Bush has made to achieve ``the \n     fullest possible accounting of our prisoners of war and those \n     missing in action.'' The brave men and women who serve \n     today--whether in Afghanistan or in Iraq or in other theaters \n     of the war on terrorism--can do so with the full confidence \n     that if they are captured, become missing or fall in battle, \n     this nation will spare no effort to bring them home. That, \n     too, is our solemn pledge. However long it takes, whatever it \n     takes, whatever the cost.''\n       As General Myers reminded us, on Saturday, we observed the \n     third anniversary of September 11th. I was with Secretary \n     Rumsfeld and General Pete Pace and family members in \n     Arlington Cemetery. We'd gathered at the burial spot for \n     the Americans who died at their Pentagon posts just a few \n     hundred yards away on that horrific day.\n       The serene beauty of their final resting place reminded us \n     all that Americans are reluctant warriors. But, as Secretary \n     Rumsfeld said, that September 11th three years ago was \n     America's call to arms. And as they've always done, brave \n     Americans have once again taken up arms to defend our safety, \n     our security and our liberty.\n       I recently met one young soldier who was wounded grievously \n     in Iraq. Yet, he described how ravaged Iraq had been before \n     the Americans arrived, and how much good he had been able to \n     do in the time he'd been there. Then, he put his own enormous \n     sacrifice into this selfless context. He said: We're fighting \n     for everything we believe in.'' He said: ``Something had to \n     be done.''\n       We have with us today a man who embodies that same love for \n     America, that same selfless devotion to preserve what America \n     stands for. As a soldier and a senator, he has spent a \n     lifetime fighting for everything America believes in. When \n     something had to be done, he was there to do it. Ladies and \n     gentlemen, Daniel Inouye is a true American hero.\n       On December 7, 1941, 17-year-old Dan Inouye stood beside \n     his father outside their home in Honolulu, watching as dive-\n     bombers attacked Pearl Harbor. As Japanese Americans, father \n     and son were especially pained and stunned--as the Senator \n     would later recall, they'd worked so hard to be good \n     Americans. Dan jumped on his bicycle and rushed to the Red \n     Cross station, where he taught first aid. There were so many \n     injuries, it would be five days before he would return home.\n       Dan Inouye wanted to do more. But because he was of \n     Japanese descent, he was classified as 4-C--meaning he was \n     considered a--quote--``enemy alien.'' That made him--and all \n     Japanese-Americans--ineligible for the draft.\n       Dan Inouye wasn't discouraged by the pain of this \n     prejudice. Instead, he signed petitions that went to the \n     President, asking for the opportunity to serve. And in the \n     meantime, he went to medical school.\n       In 1942, President Roosevelt authorized a combat team of \n     Japanese American volunteers. Senator Inouye has recalled \n     what Franklin Roosevelt said when he authorized the unit. It \n     was a phrase, the Senator has said, ``that meant a lot to the \n     men of the regiment: `Americanism is not and has never been a \n     matter of race or color,' said FDR. `Americanism is a matter \n     of mind and heart.' '' And Dan Inouye proved the truth in \n     those words. He immediately quit medical school to enlist in \n     the Army.\n       On the day young Dan Inouye left for Army training, his \n     father went with him to the pickup point. He'd been silent \n     for most of the ride. Then he cleared his throat, and looking \n     straight ahead, he said to his son: ``America has been good \n     to us... We all love this country. Whatever you do, do not \n     dishonor your country. Remember; never dishonor your family. \n     And if you must give your life, do so with honor.'' \n     Senator Inouye later recalled: ``I knew exactly what he \n     meant. I said, `Yes, sir. Good-bye.' ''\n       Dan Inouye shipped off to Europe, part of the 442nd \n     Regimental Combat Team, made up mostly of Japanese Americans. \n     As the Italian peninsula came into view, Dan Inouye asked \n     some of his comrades what they'd been thinking on their last \n     night aboard ship. Most said the same thing: they hoped they \n     wouldn't dishonor their families. Senator Inouye would later \n     say: ``We knew very well that, if we succeeded, their \n     lives''--the lives of the little brothers and sisters and \n     parents back home--``would be better.''\n       The 442nd's motto was ``Go for Broke.'' Its men would prove \n     they were prepared to risk everything they had to win. \n     Prepared to match prejudice with bravery of the highest \n     order.\n       Senator, you once told me about a particular day in Italy. \n     You sensed that the war was probably coming to an end, and \n     you told one of your sergeants--for you'd received a \n     battlefield commission by then, because the losses in your \n     unit had been so great--you told that sergeant that the war \n     was probably coming to an end soon, that he should be careful \n     and not become one of the last men killed. What you didn't \n     tell me was that you never intended to follow your own \n     advice.\n       The war ended in Europe on May 8, 1945. Just 18 days \n     before, on April 21, 1945, near San Terenzo, Lieutenant \n     Inouye's unit was ordered to attack a heavily defended ridge. \n     As the lieutenant crawled up the slope, he was hit by machine \n     gun fire. But he kept going, destroying one machine-gun nest, \n     then a second one, before he fell to the ground. He dragged \n     himself toward a third bunker, and as he was about to pull \n     the pin on his last grenade, a German grenade tore into his \n     arm. He pried the grenade out of his lifeless hand, and threw \n     it at the bunker. Another bullet hit him in the leg. Finally \n     a medic gave him a shot of morphine, but Lieutenant Inouye \n     wouldn't let them evacuate him until the area was secure . . \n     . until he knew his men were safe.\n       Dan Inouye didn't play it safe. He risked everything to \n     protect his men.\n       Uncommon valor was a common virtue throughout that unit. \n     Based on their numbers and length of service, the 442nd \n     became the most decorated unit in the history of the U.S. \n     Army. And Daniel Inouye was one of the most decorated heroes \n     among them . . . to include a much-belated Medal of Honor.\n       Dan Inouye's story of valor in battle would be more than \n     enough to secure his place in history. But, it was merely \n     prologue to an amazing story of service to our country.\n       The story continued when the people of Hawaii voted Daniel \n     Inouye into office in 1954, as a member of the Territorial \n     Legislature. In 1959, when Hawaii achieved statehood, he \n     became its first member of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. In 1962, he was elected to the Senate. He \n     is now in his seventh term.\n       Fifty years after entering public service, the man best \n     known to Hawaiians simply as . . . ``Dan'' . . . is a legend \n     on the Islands. I think Dan Inouye's an American legend, too.\n       Maybe there's a sort of irony that public servants from our \n     nation's farthest outposts--Hawaii and Alaska--stand at the \n     center of America's political life. I have had more than a \n     passing interest in America's relations with Asia, and I can \n     tell you how fortunate we are to have in Hawaii a state that \n     extends America's reach so deeply into the Asia-Pacific. How \n     fortunate we are to have a senator like Daniel Inouye, a man \n     informed by the wisdom of his years, who looks only to the \n     future. He gazes west, sees possibilities, and understands \n     how important our relations with that great region of the \n     world are for the future of this country. And he has done \n     great service to this nation to build and strengthen those \n     key relationships.\n       And we are fortunate in how great a friend Senator Dan \n     Inouye has been to America's Armed Forces.\n       There is no one who understands better what the men and \n     women of our Armed Forces want for this country and what they \n     are prepared to give.\n       No one who understands better how important the unstinting \n     support of the American people is for our troops as they \n     undertake their difficult and dangerous work.\n       No one who understands better than Dan Inouye the kind of \n     devotion to our nation the American soldier takes to war . . \n     . and how important is the pledge we make to them that we \n     will leave no man or woman behind.\n       Dan Inouye shares this nation's commitment . . . that we \n     will not rest until we have the fullest possible accounting \n     of each American who has risked it all in service to our \n     country.\n       We thank you, Senator, for your support of our men and \n     women in uniform, including on this critical issue.\n       Fifty years in public service is an impressive milestone. \n     And just last week, Senator Inouye celebrated another \n     significant milestone--his 80th birthday.\n       He spent that day as he spends most others . . . at his \n     desk, working for America and America's men and women in \n     uniform. It's a privilege, Senator, to have you here to wish \n     you ``Happy 80th Birthday.'' . . . And many more.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor to present to you \n     Senator Daniel Inouye.\n\n\n                         Senator Daniel Inouye\n\n       Secretary Wolfowitz, General Myers, former prisoners of \n     war, family members of our missing in action, fellow \n     veterans, and the men and women who proudly wear the uniform \n     of our Armed Forces who are with us here today.\n       It is an honor for me to stand with you this morning as our \n     Nation pauses to recognize those who have gone before us, \n     those who have sacrificed so much, and continue to do so.\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\n       Grateful Americans are holding events such as these in \n     cities and towns across this great land of ours, to express \n     their gratitude to those who sacrificed their freedom to \n     ensure ours, our American POWs, and to those who have never \n     returned from foreign battlefields, our MIAs.\n       Americans honor their POWs and MIAs, their comrades, and \n     their families through our worldwide commitment to account \n     for our missing warriors, to bring our heroes home from \n     distant lands, and to reunite them once again with their \n     loved ones.\n       American POWs and MIAs have honored their Nation through \n     their service and sacrifice, much like the magnificent young \n     men and women standing so proudly on the parade field before \n     us today. As I marched the line this morning, I was inspired \n     beyond words by their professionalism. You honor all of us \n     with your presence this morning.\n       Those who wear the uniform today, and those who went before \n     them know--better than most--why bringing our missing \n     Americans home is a sacred commitment. That mission rests \n     squarely on the shoulders of those of us to whom you have \n     entrusted some measure of leadership.\n       Your support and encouragement will continue to hold us \n     accountable. Though this effort is ingrained in the hearts \n     and minds of Americans, it is you who ensure this mission \n     continues.\n       I want to say especially to the families of the missing and \n     to you--their comrades--that your government will not rest \n     until all come home.\n       More than 140 years ago, President Lincoln, desperately \n     seeking to hold our Nation together, spoke of ``. . . those \n     brave men who are now on the tented field or nobly meeting \n     the foe in the front . . . that they who sleep in death . . . \n     are not forgotten by those in highest authority . . . and \n     should their fate be the same, their remains will not be \n     uncared-for.''\n       At the dedication of a grand, national cemetery near the \n     battlefield--at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in perhaps the most \n     eloquent 272 words in American history, the President spoke \n     to the families of those lost and to the soldiers still in \n     combat.\n       He spoke of the honor that we must pay to those who have \n     made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure their sacrifices were \n     not in vain to ensure that this Nation will never forget.\n       We are equally committed today to the families of the \n     missing from past conflicts, and to the soldiers still in \n     combat.\n       More than 600 men and women are working around the world on \n     that commitment--that mission. In my home State of Hawaii we \n     have the headquarters of the Joint Task Force on Full \n     Accounting that carries out these searches and the Combat \n     Identification Lab which goes through the painstaking process \n     of identifying the remains which are discovered.\n       I am very proud of their work and the small contribution \n     that my state makes to this effort.\n       You are aware of the monumental effort to account for the \n     missing from all wars. But the commitment goes much further \n     than that.\n       While we seek to bring home the warriors of the past, we \n     must also ensure that you warriors of the present--should you \n     go into harm's way--your Nation will bring you home. \n     ``Whatever it takes . . .''\n       The results of this mission can be seen on distant \n     battlefields where numerous personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq \n     have been recovered.\n       In Iraq alone, our heroic rescue forces have recovered more \n     than 75 of our warriors alive. But in spite of our commitment \n     to recover today's service members from today's battlefields, \n     our challenge remains to account for those who fell in past \n     conflicts.\n       I am told that more than 1,800 are unaccounted for from the \n     Vietnam war--730 others have been identified and returned to \n     their families since the end of that war.\n       Just last week, our troops from the Joint Task Force on \n     Full Accounting brought home the remains of more American \n     soldiers from the Korean war.\n       Throughout the world--from North Korea to Southeast Asia, \n     in the South Pacific, and even in Europe and Russia, with the \n     cooperation of the people and governments of many nations, \n     the work goes on around the clock.\n       My fellow Americans, this past weekend the Nation \n     commemorated the third anniversary of the terrorist attack on \n     the United States. The horrifying memory of the attack \n     remains fresh in our minds.\n       Less than one week after 9-11, Senator Ted Stevens and I \n     were sent by the Senate to New York to assess the damage as \n     we prepared our first supplemental appropriations measure to \n     respond to the tragedy. As we circled the smoldering ruins I \n     was struck by the devastation that lay below us.\n       The day before, we had toured the wreckage here at the \n     Pentagon.\n       Let me tell all of you that those two experiences are \n     etched in my brain never to be forgotten.\n       Today we recognize that the world remains a dangerous \n     place. As much as we desire to live in peace we understand \n     that there is likely to always be a need for a strong \n     military to defend this country and to fight our Nation's \n     wars.\n       Our obligation is both to future generations of those who \n     go in harm's way, and to those of the past, as Lincoln said, \n     we will assure all of you and them that we shall never \n     forget.\n       That, my fellow Americans is our solemn pledge. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10256-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10256-S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ABUSE OF FOREIGN DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, almost five months after learning of the \natrocities that occurred at Abu Ghraib, several of the investigations \ninto U.S. detention policies are now complete. I commend Chairman \nWarner for his efforts to investigate this scandal, but he remains \nhampered by the leadership of his own party and an administration that \ndoes not want the full truth revealed. While the investigations provide \nnew insight into how the abuses occurred, they frequently raise as many \nnew questions as they answer. Despite calls from a small handful of us \nwho want to find the truth, Congress and this administration have \nfailed to seriously investigate acts that bring dishonor upon our great \nNation and endanger our soldiers overseas.\n  The Bush administration circled the wagons long ago and has \ncontinually maintained that the abuses were the work of `a few bad \napples.' I have long said that somewhere in the upper reaches of the \nexecutive branch a process was set in motion that rolled forward until \nit produced this scandal. Even without a truly independent \ninvestigation, we now know that the responsibility for abuse runs high \nup into the chain of command. To put this matter behind us, first we \nneed to understand what happened at all levels of government. It is the \nresponsibility of the Senate to investigate the facts, from genesis to \nfinal approval to implementation and abuse. However, this Senate, and \nin particular the Judiciary Committee, continues to fall short in its \noversight responsibilities.\n  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee attempted in June to force the \ndisclosure of policy memos on the treatment of detainees, but were \ndefeated by a party-line vote. Recently, a Federal judge, recognizing \nthe importance of public examination of such documents, ordered the \nBush administration to comply with freedom of information laws and \nrelease a list of all documents on the detentions at Abu Ghraib prison \nby October 15. I commend this decision, but even that list would not \ntell the entire story.\n  A recent Washington Post column addressed the administration's \nattempt to whitewash this scandal. Jackson Diehl wrote:\n\n       Cynics will not be surprised to learn that senior military \n     commanders and Bush administration officials are on the verge \n     of avoiding any accountability for the scandal of prisoner \n     abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan--despite the enormous damage \n     done by that affair to U.S. standing in Iraq and around the \n     world; despite the well-documented malfeasance and possible \n     criminal wrongdoing by those officials; despite the \n     contrasting prosecution of low-ranking soldiers.\n\n  Allowing senior officials to avoid accountability sets a dangerous \nprecedent. It is time for Congress, even this Republican Congress, to \ndo its job and take action. We must send a message that no one in the \nchain of command--from an enlisted private at Abu Ghraib to the \nCommander-in-Chief--is above the laws of our Nation.\n  The investigations completed thus far provide additional insight into \nhow the prison abuses occurred, but their narrow mandates prevented \nthem from addressing critical issues. The reports by the Army Inspector \nGeneral, Maj. Gen. George Fay, and Lt. Gen. Anthony Jones all suffered \nfrom structural limitations. The Army IG report was designed as ``a \nfunctional analysis'' of operations, not an investigation into any \nspecific incidents. The Fay and Jones reports, tasked with reviewing \nthe role of military intelligence at Abu Ghraib, were limited in scope \nto the military itself despite acknowledging that relationships between \nmilitary intelligence, military police, and outside agencies were \nsignificant to the breakdown in order. Overall, these investigations \ncollectively suffered from a lack of scope and authority, leaving key \ninquiries into issues like contractor abuses and ``ghost detainees'' \nunexplored.\n  The panel led by former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger was \nsimilarly limited to the role of the military and could not investigate \nthe role of the CIA. The Schlesinger panel had no subpoena power and \nlacked true independence. Its loyalty to the Secretary of Defense is \nbetrayed by its acceptance of a policy that is proving to be one of the \nroot causes of this scandal. In August 2002, Assistant Attorney General\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\nJay Bybee wrote in a memo to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales that, \n``While many of these techniques may amount to cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment, they do not produce pain or suffering of the \nnecessary intensity to meet the definition of torture.'' Alarmingly, in \nhis recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Dr. \nSchlesinger sounded more like an administration official than an \nindependent investigator. His statement to the committee that, ``What \nconstitutes humane treatment lies in the eye of the beholder'' is \nsomething I would have expected to read in a memo from Jay Bybee, not \nthe head of an ``independent'' commission.\n  I could not disagree more with the statements of Dr. Schlesinger and \nMr. Bybee. The Geneva Conventions and Convention Against Torture define \nhumane treatment of prisoners, setting standards that protect our own \nsoldiers when they are captured. A number of State Department lawyers \nfought to protect these standards in early 2002, when the President \nbroke with decades of policy and decided against providing the Geneva \nprotections to terrorist suspects. Military lawyers fought the same \nbattle after Secretary Rumsfeld approved techniques for use at \nGuantanamo that are illegal under the Geneva Conventions.\n  The recently released reports illustrate why an independent \ninvestigation is still necessary. They brought us closer to the truth, \nbut questions remain unanswered. Despite its failings, the Schlesinger \nreport refuted the administration's efforts to avoid responsibility and \nto minimize this scandal as the misdeeds of `a few bad apples.' The \nreport documents a failure of leadership by some at higher levels in \nthe chain of command, as well as poor planning from the top and a great \ndeal of confusion about which interrogation and detention practices \nwere acceptable. But the confusion was not caused solely by a lack of \nleadership. In recent months we have learned that senior officials in \nthe White House, the Justice Department and the Pentagon set in motion \na systematic effort to minimize, distort and even ignore our laws, \npolicies and agreements on torture and the treatment of prisoners. The \nSchlesinger panel failed to follow the investigation to the highest \nlevels of the administration.\n  Ultimately, what emerges from these reports is a striking \ncontradiction. The reports state that there was no official policy of \nabuse and they do not recommend punishment for high-ranking officials. \nAnd yet, the reports show that decisions that were made by top \nofficials, including the President himself, led to the abuses that \noccurred in the fields of battle.\n  Piecing together the facts and findings of these reports with \ninformation contained in other official documents and press accounts, a \ntimeline emerges that shows how edicts from Washington trickled down, \ncrossed oceans, and migrated from the front lines on one continent to \nthe next.\n  In February 2002, President Bush signed a memorandum stating that the \nGeneva Conventions did not apply to members of al-Qaida and the \nTaliban. That decision was taken at the recommendation of the Attorney \nGeneral and White House counsel, and over the objection of the \nSecretary of State.\n\n  Eight months later, in October 2002, with hundreds of prisoners \ncaptured in Afghanistan then being held at Guantanamo Bay, the \nSchlesinger report states that authorities at the base ``requested \napproval of strengthened counter-interrogation techniques.'' In \nDecember of that year, according to the Fay report, Secretary Rumsfeld \napproved for use at Guantanamo techniques such as ``stress positions, \nisolation for up to thirty days, removal of clothing and the use of \ndetainees' phobias (such as the use of dogs).'' Lawyers in the military \nreacted negatively, strenuously arguing that the use of such techniques \nwas anathema to military tradition and would ultimately come back to \nhaunt the armed services. In January 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld rescinded \nhis approval of the extreme interrogation techniques; new guidelines \nwere issued in April 2003 from a Defense Department working group.\n  The Fay report reveals, however, that despite the Secretary's shift \nin policy, the methods he had authorized in December 2002 for use only \nat Guantanamo Bay quickly migrated to Afghanistan and other locations \nwhere our military is active. As early as December 2002, reports \nGeneral Fay, ``interrogators in Afghanistan were removing clothing, \nisolating people for long periods of time, using stress positions, \nexploiting fear of dogs and implementing sleep and light deprivation.''\n  It was also in December 2002 that two prisoners in U.S. custody were \nkilled. Both deaths were ruled homicides by pathologists, but, at the \ntime, the Army publicly attributed them to natural causes. It was not \nuntil journalists saw copies of the death certificates, which had been \ngiven to the non-English speaking families of the deceased, that the \ntruth about the fatalities came out. In September, criminal charges \nwere finally filed, 20 months after the deaths occurred.\n  These deaths are deeply disturbing, but at least we know some of the \ndetails of the cases and can seek justice against the perpetrators. A \nrecent report by the Crimes of War Project uncovered an Afghan \ndetainee's death that was never reported up the military chain of \ncommand. The detainee, Jamal Naseer, died in March 2003, allegedly \nafter weeks of torture by American soldiers. Because the Special Forces \nunit that reportedly controlled the detention facility failed to report \nthe death, it was never investigated. This incident is very troubling \non its own, but, like so many other incidents we have discovered, it \npoints to a much larger problem. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation \nCommand received a tip about Naseer's death earlier this year, but \ncould not investigate the matter due to a lack of information. \nChristopher Coffey, an Army detective based at Bagram air base, told \nthe L.A. Times:\n\n       We're trying to figure out who was running the base. We \n     don't know what unit was there. There are no records. The \n     reporting system is broke across the board. Units are \n     transferred in and out. There are no SOPs [standard operating \n     procedures] and each unit acts differently.\n\n  The L.A. Times article illustrates a serious failure of leadership by \nthe Department of Defense and the obvious shortcomings of allowing the \nPentagon to investigate itself. The Army Inspector General's report, \nreleased in July, stated that the investigation's team ``that visited \nIraq and Afghanistan discovered no incidents of abuse that had not been \nreported through command channels; all incidents were already under \ninvestigation.'' We now know this cannot be accurate. What we don't \nknow is how many more deaths and cases of torture have gone unreported.\n  As I stated before, the Schlesinger report agreed with administration \npolicy that detainees did not merit Geneva protections, a position with \nwhich I and many of those in uniform disagree. The panel acknowledged, \nhowever, that the President's policy of treating al-Qaida and Taliban \ndetainees ``consistent with the principles of Geneva,'' was ``vague and \nlacking.'' Even a government treating prisoners ``consistent'' with the \nConventions would not rely on interrogation practices like the ones we \nhave witnessed. The techniques I just described, ones that were used in \nGuantanamo, Afghanistan, and Iraq are clearly illegal under the Geneva \nConventions. Secretary Rumsfeld and, later, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, \nauthorized the use of techniques that were contrary to both U.S. \nmilitary manuals and international law. Given this incredible \noverstepping of bounds, I find it incredible that the reports generated \nthus far have not recommended punishment of any kind for high level \nofficials.\n  Meanwhile, the CIA conducted its own set of interrogations. The Fay \nand Schlesinger reports state that the CIA operated under a different \nset of rules, sometimes including the military and sometimes not. The \nFay report states that ``the CIA's detention and interrogation \npractices contributed to a loss of accountability and abuse at Abu \nGhraib.'' The result: further confusion among soldiers in the field \nover appropriate standards of treatment and the application of the \nGeneva Conventions.\n  How did these techniques, which were rescinded by Secretary Rumsfeld \nin January 2003 become so prevalent in Iraq? The Fay report states it \nflatly: ``Concepts for the non-doctrinal, in-field manual approaches \nand practices\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nclearly came from documents and personnel in Afghanistan and \nGuantanamo.'' Ultimately, the ``non-doctrinal'' approaches used at Abu \nGhraib included nakedness and humiliation, the use of dogs to ``fear \nup'' detainees, and sexual and physical assaults. These approaches \nmigrated to Iraq a number of ways, any of which might have been \nprevented by clear statements of policy from the top. Members of the \n519th Military Intelligence Battalion served at Bagram Air Force Base \nin Afghanistan in 2002. Some of these soldiers have been implicated in \nthe deaths of the two prisoners at Bagram. A number of soldiers from \nthe 519th were sent to Iraq, and some of those have been implicated in \nthe Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. As we all know, military intelligence \nplayed a major role in directing and carrying out the abuses at Abu \nGhraib.\n  In addition, as the Fay report cites, ``Interrogators in Iraq, \nalready familiar with the practice of some of these new ideas, \nimplemented them even prior to any policy guidelines.'' Before long, as \nthe Schlesinger report states, policy guidance backed up the \ninterrogators' actions. In August 2003, Maj. Gen. Miller ``brought the \nSecretary of Defense's April 16, 2003, policy guidelines for Guantanamo \nwith him,'' and gave this policy to Lt. Gen. Sanchez, who was, at the \ntime, the highest level commander in Iraq. On September 14 of last \nyear, according to the Schlesinger report, Lt. Gen. Sanchez approved a \npolicy on interrogation that included techniques that, up to that \npoint, had only been officially applied to so-called enemy combatants--\nthose who, in the minds of President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld, were \nnot protected by the Geneva Conventions. The Bush administration has \nsteadfastly claimed that the Geneva Conventions apply to the war in \nIraq. And yet, Lt. Gen. Sanchez determined, with no authorization to do \nso, that some of the detainees held in Iraq were to be categorized as \nunlawful combatants.\n  How did Lt. Gen. Sanchez justify his authority to approve such \ntechniques? The Schlesinger report found that Lt. Gen. Sanchez relied \non the President's February 2002 memorandum and the Department of \nJustice's notorious August 1, 2002 memo twisting the definition of \ntorture. It is deeply troubling, given this evidence, that the Bush \nadministration has held fast to the contention that the abuses at Abu \nGhraib were committed by ``a few bad apples.'' And it is extremely \ndisconcerting that the very outcome that military lawyers warned of \nwhen they fought against the administration's desire to suspend the \nGeneva Conventions--the undermining of the military's tradition of \nupholding the rule of law--came to fruition. Our armed forces have been \ntainted by this scandal and our soldiers in the field placed at greater \nrisk.\n  The Sanchez policy guidelines were technically in effect for only a \nmonth before being revised. But, as in Afghanistan, these illegal \ntechniques were put to use almost immediately. Interrogators in Iraq \nrelied upon the guidelines and may have done so believing that they \nwere appropriate. The Jones report states that, ``Some of these \nincidents involved conduct which, in retrospect, violated international \nlaw. However, at the time some of the soldiers or contractors committed \nthe acts, they may have honestly believed the techniques were \ncondoned.''\n  I find it deeply disturbing that American soldiers would have acted \non such guidelines. I have stated many times that those who violated \nthe laws by assaulting and humiliating prisoners should be prosecuted. \nThe buck should not stop there, however. The reports have shown that \nthere was a serious breakdown in training and operations. There was one \nMP for every 75 prisoners at Abu Ghraib when the abuses occurred. And \nas the Army Inspector General found, interrogation facilities lacked \noversight processes and control mechanisms. Even routine inspections \nwere lacking.\n  What these reports show--and, unfortunately, it is an unstated \nrevelation one discovers by reading between the lines--is that once \nPresident Bush and his top advisors let the genie out of the bottle by \ndenying the protections of the Geneva Conventions and rewriting the \ndefinition of torture, they set off a chain reaction that spanned the \nglobe. By changing the rules of treatment and interrogation for one \ngroup of detainees, by tossing away decades of military protocol, by \nwriting and rescinding and rewriting guidelines so often that soldiers \nhad no clear understanding of policy or practice, and by allowing the \nCIA to operate in the shadows, the leaders of the Bush administration \nlost control. What was initiated for one group of detainees in one \nlocation spilled over into other countries and to very different types \nof prisoners.\n  A day or two after the release of the Schlesinger and Fay-Jones \nreports, Secretary Rumsfeld still claimed that there was no evidence \nthat prisoners had been abused during interrogations. I wonder if he \ntook the time to read or to request a briefing on these investigations. \nHe made the same statement twice before his handlers corrected him, in \nthe middle of a press conference. Incredibly, he again misstated the \nfacts, ``correcting'' himself to say that only two or three cases of \nabuse took place during interrogation. In fact, 13 of 44 instances of \nabuse involved interrogation. It leaves me to wonder. Meanwhile, \nPresident Bush has kept quiet about the findings of the reports. His \nsilence is deafening.\n  As I have said before, there needs to be a thorough, independent \ninvestigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who \ncommitted abuses, to the officials who set these policies in motion. An \nindependent commission, structured on the model of the 9/11 Commission, \nwill allow us begin to heal the damage that has been done.\n  I am not alone in calling for an independent commission. Several \norganizations, including the American Bar Association, Human Rights \nFirst, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, have urged the \ncreation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the \nprisoner abuses. A recent letter from eight retired generals and \nadmirals to President Bush asked him to appoint a prisoner abuse \ncommission modeled on the 9/11 Commission. In that letter, the flag \nofficers stated, ``internal investigations by their nature . . . suffer \nfrom a critical lack of independence. Americans have never thought it \nwise or fair for one branch of government to police itself.''\n  The 9/11 Commission provides more than a structural model for a new \ncommission; it also provides a lesson in how perseverance can overcome \nthe administration's refusal to seek the truth. The Bush administration \ninitially opposed the formation of the 9/11 Commission, just as it now \nopposes a prisoner abuse commission. The administration used the same \nargument against both commissions. It asserts that the numerous \ninternal investigations are sufficient to uncover the truth. Dr. James \nSchlesinger, the head of the panel established by Secretary Rumsfeld to \ninvestigate the prisoner abuses, addressed this issue in his testimony \nto the Senate Government Affairs Committee in February 2002, as it \ndebated the need for the 9/11 Commission. He argued for the creation of \nthe Commission because, ``to this point many questions have been \naddressed piecemeal--or not at all. The purpose of the National \nCommission would be systematically and comprehensively to address such \nquestions--and to give a complete accounting of the events leading up \nto 9/11. In my judgment, such a Commission would serve a high, indeed \nindispensable, national purpose.'' This is exactly the same reason we \nneed an independent commission to investigate the prisoner abuse \nscandal.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee report on the bill to establish \nthe 9/11 Commission stated that it ``is a bipartisan initiative to help \nanswer the many remaining questions in a constructive, methodical, and \nnon-partisan way. The commission would complement investigations being \nundertaken by Congress and the Executive Branch.'' A prisoner abuse \ncommission would fulfill a similar need--to fill the gaps that \ninevitably occur when an investigation is addressed in a piecemeal \nfashion. We already know some gaps exist--such as the ghost detainee \nproblem and the role of contractors--others are sure to arise in the \ncourse of an independent investigation.\n  International law, as well as the Defense Department's own policies, \nrequires the registration and accounting of all detainees. Detainees \nkept off of the official rolls--so called 'ghost detainees'--are held \nin violation of the law. The Fay-Jones report revealed that the ghost \ndetainee problem was\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nfar more pervasive than the Defense Department had previously \nacknowledged. General Kern, the investigation's appointing officer, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that there could \nbe as many as 100 ghost detainees, but his panel could not thoroughly \ninvestigate the matter because the CIA refused to cooperate in the \ninquiry.\n  These revelations should not come as a surprise--human rights groups \nhave been calling for an investigation into the ghost detainee issue \nfor months. I first wrote to the National Security Advisor about \nmistreatment of detainees in June 2003, including a request for \ninformation on prisoners transferred in secret by the United States to \nother nations for interrogation. A report on secret detentions was \nreleased on June 17, 2004, by Human Rights First. The report, titled, \nEnding Secret Detentions, describes a number of officially undisclosed \nlocations that sources--typically unnamed government sources quoted in \nthe press--have described as detention centers for terrorism suspects. \nThese sources have discussed facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nJordan, Diego Garcia, and on U.S. war ships. The ICRC has not been \nallowed access to these facilities. It issued a public statement in \nMarch expressing its growing concern over ``the fate of an unknown \nnumber of people captured . . . and held in undisclosed locations.'' To \ndate, its requests have been denied.\n  After being rebuffed by the CIA, the Fay-Jones panel asked two \noffices to conduct further investigations into the ghost detainee \nissue: the Department of Defense Inspector General and the CIA \nInspector General. Once again, this would result in one branch of \ngovernment to policing itself. Like the Fay-Jones panel, the Inspectors \nGeneral lack the authority to follow such investigations beyond their \nown departments--again allowing many questions to remain unanswered. We \nneed to know what role senior administration officials in the White \nHouse, Justice Department, Defense Department, and CIA played in \nformulating the policies that allowed the illegal detention of ghost \ndetainees. We know this problem emanated from senior officials--\nSecretary Rumsfeld admitted in June that he approved the secret \ndetention of one detainee at the request of CIA Director Tenet. Only an \nindependent commission with significant authority will be able to fully \ninvestigate this matter.\n  The Fay-Jones report also found that civilian contractors were \ncomplicit in the abuse of detainees. We already knew this, but the \npanel's findings raise new questions about whether the contractors will \nbe held accountable for their actions. Thus far, one contractor has \nbeen charged for abuse in Afghanistan, but no charges have been filed \nagainst contractors in Iraq. As P.W. Singer points out in his recent \nWashington Post op-ed, ``Army investigators are at a loss over how to \nhold the contractors accountable. The Army referred individual \nemployees' names to the Justice Department more than three months ago, \nbut Attorney General Ashcroft has yet to take action.'' As these cases \nare referred to the Justice Department, the Judiciary Committee must \nfulfill its oversight responsibility to ensure these crimes do not go \nunpunished. Given the reports and allegations of abuses of Iraqi \nprisoners that involved civilian contractors, I am deeply troubled at \nthe passivity being displayed by the Department of Justice. If \nloopholes exist in the law, the Department should be working with \nCongress to fill them.\n  Some argue that another investigation will prevent us from putting \nthe scandal behind us, but ignoring the problem will not make it go \naway. Each week brings new allegations that reveal how much we still \ndon't know. Human rights groups and journalists have been unrelenting \nin their efforts to uncover this scandal, and I applaud their \ncontributions. The report released recently by the War Crimes Project \nrevealed unreported deaths in Afghanistan. Veteran journalist Seymour \nHersh claims in his new book that senior military and national security \nofficials were repeatedly warned in 2002 and 2003 that prisoners were \nbeing abused. Mr. Hersh writes that FBI agents notified their superiors \nabout abuses at Guantanamo and that these reports were passed along to \nofficials at the Pentagon. The ACLU continues to fight in Federal \ncourts to compel the administration to release documents related to \ntorture. Even without further Government action, this scandal is not \ngoing to go away. It is time for us to lead the investigation, rather \nthan wait to read about the latest discovery of abuse in tomorrow's \npaper. We must establish an independent commission.\n  In the coming months, the remaining Pentagon investigations will come \nto an end. It will be like finding an old jigsaw puzzle in the back of \nthe closet--it looks complete, but you can never tell if there are \npieces missing until you try to put it together. An independent \ncommission can take on this important task; it will ensure that no \npieces are missing and that we have a complete, unbiased assessment of \na sad chapter in our Nation's history. The 9/11 Commission showed us \nthat it can be painful to dredge up the past, but it is also a \nnecessary step to moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10259-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10259-S10260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CHILDREN'S HEALTH PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday marked a critical juncture \nin the fight to provide comprehensive and affordable health care \ncoverage for our Nation's children. Congress had a tremendous \nopportunity to improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of \nchildren, not just for the foreseeable future, but also over the long \nterm. September 30, 2004, should have gone down in history as the day \nCongress set aside partisan politics and took a stand for children. \nUnfortunately, yesterday will be remembered as the day Congress chose \npolitical rhetoric over action and failed to protect health care \ncoverage for children in working families.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that September 30 only marked a \nstatutory deadline and didn't really matter in terms of coverage for \nkids. I strongly disagree. Yesterday's deadline was about keeping our \npromise to America's working families that their children will have \naccess to comprehensive, affordable, and reliable health care coverage. \nWe in Congress have broken that promise, and it is unconscionable to \nthink that Members would go home to campaign while the health care of \nsome of most vulnerable children hangs in the balance.\n  We must act now to preserve health care coverage for children \nenrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP. This is too \nimportant an issue to delay even a day. Senators Chafee, Kennedy, \nSnowe, and I, along with Congressmen Barton and Dingell, have a \nbipartisan, bicameral bill on the table right now that will protect \ncoverage for America's children. The Children's Health Protection and \nImprovement Act has the support of 48 bipartisan cosponsors in the \nHouse of Representatives and 33 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate. \nOur legislation has been endorsed by over 100 local, state, and \nnational organizations including the National Governors Association, \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Hospital Association, \nthe National Association of Children's Hospitals, the Catholic Health \nAssociation, Families USA, the Children's Defense Fund, and the March \nof Dimes. There is no reason why we cannot pass this legislation today.\n  If my colleagues were to talk to their Governors about the merits of \nthe Children Health Protection and Improvement Act, all 50 Governors \nwould say that our legislation addresses the long-term Federal funding \nshortfalls that will occur in SCHIP over the next 3 years.\n  If my colleagues were to visit doctors' offices and hospital \nemergency rooms and talk to general practitioners, pediatricians, and \nsurgeons, these providers would confirm that our legislation makes it \neasier for children to access health services and reduces our Nation's \ngrowing uncompensated health care burden.\n  Most importantly, if my colleagues were to talk to working families \nin their home states who rely on CHIP, working families would say that \nour legislation guarantees real coverage for their children. Our \nlegislation gives working families the peace of mind that comes from \nknowing their children would not just receive health care coverage \ntomorrow, next month, or next year, but for the next several\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nyears until the CHIP program is reauthorized in fiscal year 2007.\n  It seems that some in this body are more concerned with sound bites \nthan with actually providing health coverage for children. Of course, \nwe can all attest to the success of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram over the years. We can all cite the 5.8 million children who \nwere covered last year. But, I ask my colleagues, how are we going to \ndo to protect the coverage of those 5.8 million children and ensure \nthat even more children are covered?\n  While I strongly support greater outreach and enrollment in the CHIP \nprogram, the bottom line is that outreach is not a solution to States' \ncoverage problems. States aren't covering additional children under \nCHIP because they cannot afford to cover the children already enrolled \nin their programs. In fact, according to the Kaiser Commission on \nMedicaid and the Uninsured, states are implementing measures--such as \nenrollment caps, premiums and enrollment fees, eligibility cuts, \nrestricted benefits, and increased co-payments to scale back outreach \nand enrollment instead of increase them. The State of Florida is a \nprime example of this. Enrollment in Florida's CHIP program is closed \nfor some children who are undeniably eligible. Outreach to more \nchildren who meet the eligibility requirements for Florida KidCare is \nfutile if those kids cannot access actual coverage.\n  States are experiencing both State and Federal funding shortfalls \nthat prevent them from covering kids. Senator Gordon Smith and I \noffered legislation earlier this year to address State budget \nshortfalls. The State Fiscal Relief Act would extend the federal fiscal \nrelief enacted last year to help resolve state budget deficits and \nprevent cuts in critical programs and services, including health care. \nYet, Congress has yet to consider this important legislation. And now, \nCongress has failed to preserve approximately $1.1 billion in expiring \nCHIP funds for coverage. Our failure to act is sending a very strong \nmessage to the states that not only is Congress not willing to assist \nwith budget shortfalls during an economic downturn, Congress is also \nnot willing to uphold the federal guarantee of CHIP coverage.\n  CHIP is a Federal entitlement, and the Federal Government has a \nresponsibility to make certain the program has the requisite funding to \ninsure eligible children. Additional Federal funding for CHIP outreach \nshould only be pursued after we have made sure states have the federal \nfunding needed to cover the children currently on their rolls. \nOtherwise, outreach efforts will be ineffective because children will \nnot have access to actual coverage.\n  The Children's Health Protection and Improvement Act would prevent \nnearly $1.1 billion in expiring CHIP funds from reverting to the \nTreasury so that states with unmet needs can use the money to preserve \ncoverage for children currently enrolled and higher-spending states can \ncover additional children. Our legislation would also establish \nredistribution rules that will keep CHIP money in the CHIP program \nthrough fiscal year 2007.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that our bill would not \nlead to new children being enrolled in CHIP. These concerns are simply \nunfounded. My home State of West Virginia, for example, is looking at \nthe feasibility of a CHIP expansion that would cover an additional 4400 \nchildren under 300 percent of poverty. The biggest barrier to West \nVirginia going forward with this expansion is the lack of Federal \nfunds. My state and many others are still recovering from the so-called \n``CHIP dip,'' when Federal CHIP funding was $1 billion lower in fiscal \nyears 2002-2004 than it was in fiscal year 2001. However, under the \nChildren's Health Protection and Improvement Act, WV would qualify for \nredistributed funds which would give the state the ability to proceed \nwith the expansion.\n\n  Finally, I respond to the claims made by some that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services should be allowed to redistribute \napproximately $660 million in unspent fiscal year 2002 funds to the six \nstates projected to have shortfalls next year. There are several \nproblems with this approach. First, such an approach would concentrate \nthe vast majority of the expiring fiscal year 2002 funds in just six \nstates, when a total of 30 states would qualify for redistributed \nfunds.\n  Second, unlike the Rockefeller-Chafee-Kennedy-Snowe bill, this \napproach would not address Federal funding shortfalls in these states \nin fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Moreover, such a proposal is likely to \nopen up a larger Federal shortfall in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for \nthe other 12 states projected to have insufficient Federal funding \nbefore SCHIP is reauthorized in fiscal year 2007. This is because these \n12 states would receive less in redistributed fiscal year 2002 funds \nunder such a proposal than they would otherwise receive under our \nlegislation.\n  Third, and most importantly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, has not offered a specific formula for allocating funds \nto states that need them the most in fiscal year 2005, so there is no \nguarantee that CMS would actually do so. Furthermore, it is critical to \nnote that Congress acted in both 2000 and 2003 to set a specific \nstatutory formula for redistribution and has never allowed the \nadministration, neither the previous one nor the current one, decide \nhow to reallocate unspent funds. Leadership in both the House and the \nSenate supported these previous redistributions, which have directly \ncontributed to the success of the CHIP program in recent years, so it \nis unclear why there seems to be a change in position now.\n  In recent days, several new ideas have been proposed for how to deal \nwith expiring CHIP funds. Perhaps if it were March or April, and we had \nample time to analyze these far-reaching proposals, then we could \nadequately consider each one. But, the fact of the matter is that we \nhave a strongly bipartisan bill, supported by the Governors of all 50 \nStates, that is ready to go right now. Our legislation has been \nproperly vetted and appropriately scrutinized. The score of our bill is \nrelatively small in relation to the number of children who would be \ncovered. And, our legislation is the product of a long collaborative \neffort between states, advocacy groups, and Members of Congress \ninstrumental in the creation of the CHIP program. I see no reason why \nwe cannot pass this legislation now.\n  I am encouraged by Chairman Grassley's statement that he wants to \naddress the long-term Federal CHIP funding shortfalls. After all, the \nFinance Committee has a history of protecting health care coverage for \nchildren. It is where the CHIP program was created and where previous \nredistributions were conceived. I cannot imagine that members of the \nFinance Committee would want to jeopardize such a remarkable history by \nfailing to protect CHIP coverage for hundreds of thousands of children \nover the next three years. I look forward to working with Chairman \nGrassley and other members of the Finance Committee to pass a unanimous \nconsent agreement on CHIP before we go home next week.\n  I also call on the President to take a similar stand for children. \nFor reasons that are inconceivable to me, some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the isle have indicated that our legislation is partisan \nor politically motivated. That could not be further from the truth. Our \nlegislation has strong bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, \nand all of the cosponsors have worked hard to keep this bill from \nbecoming part of election-year politics. There is no reason for \nCongress not to pass our legislation next week and for the President \nnot to sign it into law. Our children cannot afford to wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10260-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10260-S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

The 15-year odyssey for this museum has presented us with \nmore than just items behind glass. This museum tells the story of North \nand South Americas' native peoples. It shows their journey through time \nand gives optimism for the future.\n  First, I thank all those who have been involved since this process \nbegan so many years ago, in particular, Senators Inouye and Campbell, \nthe original sponsors of this bill. The efforts of\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\nthousands of people, both Native and non-native, are reflected in the \nmagnificent structure commemorating the lives of the first Americans. I \nalso thank the thousands of participants who have come from all over \nthe Western Hemisphere to be a part of this historic museum opening, \nespecially those Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples who have made the \njourney from the Great Plains and particularly South Dakota. Those that \nhave made the trip have shared with us the richness and beauty of their \ncultures.\n  I recently had the opportunity to tour the museum, and I am so proud \nto see the Native people of South Dakota represented in the museum. I \nam particularly contented to see that the exhibits are displayed in a \nmanner where the tribes are able to see their story from their own \npoint of view. This museum will forever grace the national mall in our \nNation's Capitol from the serenity gardens created to surround the \nmuseum to the heart of the building's Potomac gathering place. It will \ntake its visitors through time by allowing native people to tell their \nown story.\n  I also take this opportunity to speak of the future. With the ever \nchanging roles of the United States government and Indian Tribes, it is \nimperative we constantly examine paths that strengthen that \nrelationship. In regards to this relationship, I often hear of the \ntribal sovereignty and the obligations of the United States Government \nand its treaty and trust responsibilities. With health care in Indian \nCountry funded at 50 percent its necessary levels and schools that are \ndecades past their usefulness, I think that we need to take a serious \nlook at these responsibilities. We need to do more to combat the \ndeplorable conditions that many of our native peoples are subjected, \nand to develop a plan to alleviate these hardships.\n  Forever, this museum will grace our national mall. With this new \nbeginning and its reflections of the past, we must now look to the \nfuture, the future of Indian country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           BAYAUD INDUSTRIES\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to honor the fine work \nand dedication of Bayaud Industries of Denver, CO. This non-profit \norganization offers disabled Coloradans vocational rehabilitation and \nemployment services. I am pleased to acknowledge their efforts and \nsuccesses.\n  Founded in 1969, Bayaud Industries is celebrating this year its 35th \nanniversary of service to the disabled community. Bayaud currently \nemploys and trains more than 300 disabled individuals so that they can \nsucceed in the workplace with the goal to provide paid, steady work for \nevery person enrolled in these programs. More than 5,000 disabled \nColoradans have benefitted from the services provided by Bayaud \nIndustries. Bayaud Industries is comprised of 48 staff members who are \ndedicated to helping the disabled community. Its efforts have resulted \nin a listing by the Denver Business Journal as one of the top 25 \nColorado human service agencies. Additionally, Bayaud Industries has \nbeen awarded numerous grants from leading Colorado foundations and \ncorporations.\n  Bayaud's services include vocational evaluation, work adjustment \ntraining, a General Office Skills Training program, job placement, and \njob coaching. The first step in training is in the Vocational \nEvaluation Program, a 4-week process that assesses an individual's \nskill needs to succeed in the workplace.\n  After an individual goes through Bayaud's Vocational Evaluation, the \nWork Adjustment Training helps individuals increase their self-\nconfidence to help them acclimate appropriately to the workplace \nenvironment. Throughout this particular training, individuals are \ntaught how to manage the daily stresses of any work environment, which \nhelps create successful and stable employment.\n  Bayaud's General Office Skills Training program works to familiarize \npeople with the technological aspects of the workplace. Computers are \nessential in many jobs, and these individuals are given the training \nnecessary to make their employment a success.\n  Bayaud Industries uses these programs to provide help with one of the \nmost important aspects of employment assistance: Job placement. From \nresume writing to interview skills, Bayaud Industries strives to ensure \nthat all individuals are properly trained to search for a job that fits \ntheir needs and guarantees their achievement. This aspect of Bayaud is \ncrucial to better understand the individual and to find the perfect job \nfit for both the business and the employee.\n  After job training and placement, Bayaud continues its relationship \nwith their employees by offering job counseling. Through its quality \nassistance and care, Bayaud Industries fosters a relationship between \nthese individuals and the 200 businesses across Colorado that employ \nthem. Bayaud works to provide personalized assistance to all \nindividuals with disabilities, addressing each client's specific needs \nand goals.\n  I thank Bayaud Industries for their continued efforts for the \ndisabled community and to businesses across Colorado.\n  Bayaud's exemplary services are needed and greatly \nappreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10261-2", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DISCHARGED NOMINATION\n\n  The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations was discharged from further \nconsideration of the following nomination and the nomination was \nconfirmed: Alan Greenspan, of New York, to be United States Alternate \nGovernor of the International Monetary Fund for a term of five years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10261-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 4596.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2880. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nensure full and free competition in the medical device and hospital \nsupply industries; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator DeWine to \nintroduce the Medical Device Competition Act of 2004. The legislation \nthat we are introducing today is the product of perhaps the most \nimportant work of our Subcommittee in the last few years--ensuring that \nphysicians, patients, and health care workers have access to the best \nand safest medical devices, devices that can literally make the \ndifference between life and death.\n  For nearly three years, the Antitrust Subcommittee has undertaken a \nthorough investigation of the hospital purchasing industry. This \nindustry accounting for more than an estimated $50 billion in commerce \nis responsible for purchasing nearly everything that a hospital buys to \ntreat sick or injured patients, everything from simple band-aids to \nhigh tech x-ray machines, from pacemakers to surgical devices. Much of \nthis purchasing is done under contracts negotiated by what are known as \n``group purchasing organizations'', ``GPOs'', large organizations that \naggregate the buying power of hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of \nhospitals in order to gain bargaining power and volume discounts from \nhospital suppliers.\n  Without question, the goal of gaining volume discounts through \naggregating buying power that led to the creation of GPOs is laudable. \nUnfortunately, our inquiry revealed that a system created to aggregate \ndemand and hold down cost had sometimes mutated into a tool for \nentrenching market power of dominant suppliers, locking out \ncompetitors, and suppressing innovation. All too often conflicts of \ninterest and questionable GPO business practices denied physicians and \ntheir patients choice of needed medical devices and robbed hospitals of \nthe benefit of competition.\n  Moreover, the power and importance of GPOs to our health care system \nincreased as the GPO industry has undergone enormous consolidation in \nthe last decade. As originally envisioned, GPOs were generally local or \nregional buying cooperatives each of whom accounting for a very small \nproportion of the market. Today, this situation is transformed. The two \nlargest GPOs negotiate purchasing contracts for more than an estimated \n60 percent of the Nation's not for profit hospital beds. The size and \nnational scope of these large GPOs have turned them into the \ngatekeepers who can decide which medical devices doctors will use and \nwhich medical device companies will be able to sell their lifesaving \ngoods..\n  Our investigation uncovered abuses and questionable practices that \ninterfered with the GPOs' mission of buying the best products at the \nbest prices. At the time our investigation began in 2001, it was all \ntoo common a practice for GPOs to contract with only one supplier of a \nmedical device for lengthy terms. Industry observers also raised \nconcerns over contracts which bundled commodities like hospital gowns \nwith medical devices like pacemakers and surgical equipment, creating \nnearly insurmountable barriers for smaller manufacturers with \nspecialized product lines to compete, regardless of the quality or \neffectiveness of their product. Some GPOs accepted high payments--so-\ncalled ``administrative fees''--well in excess of 3 percent from \nmanufacturers. Worst of all, supposedly neutral contracting decisions \nwere at times infected by equity interests held by GPOs or their \nexecutives in medical device companies.\n  We can be proud of the work of our subcommittee--and, indeed, many in \nthe GPO industry--in responding to this situation. At our behest, six \nof the largest hospital buying groups agreed to fundamental reform by \nadopting codes of conduct governing their business activities and \nethical responsibilities. These codes forbid anti-competitive business \npractices, and ban conflicts of interest that interfere with the GPOs' \nmission of buying the best products at the lowest prices. The GPOs that \nagreed to these new codes should be commended for their willingness to \nengage in real reform. Thanks to these GPOs' good work and willingness \nto engage in reform, many of the most egregious practices began to \ndisappear from the marketplace and barriers to patients getting access \nto the best medical devices more have begun to come down.\n  Yet these reforms--as real and important as they are--have inherent \nlimitations. They are completely voluntary and can be modified or even \nwithdrawn by the GPOs at will. They have no enforcement mechanism nor \nany manner to objectively verify that they are being adhered to. We \nhave no assurance that the reforms will not be abridged or abrogated \nshould our subcommittee's oversight come to an end. We must now, \ntherefore, find a way to ensure that these gains cannot be reversed.\n  Despite their enormous influence, GPOs have until now operated with \nlittle, if any, governmental oversight. Quite the contrary, these GPOs \nhave operated under special government protection--a Congressionally \ngranted exemption from anti-kickback law. This exemption--commonly \nknown as the ``safe harbor'' for GPOs--allows GPOs to accept payments \nfrom hospital suppliers even though these purchases are reimbursed by \nthe Medicare program. Acceptance of these payments from suppliers would \nbe illegal absent this special exemption. The fact the hospital \npurchasing has this specially, Congressionally granted immunity from \nkickback mandates that government have the ability to oversee the \nmanner GPOs are behaving under the protection of this exemption--\noversight currently not required by law.\n\n  We are therefore today introducing legislation which will ensure that \nthe Department of Health and Human Services will have the authority to \noversee the functioning of the safe harbor and prevent anti-competitive \nor unethical GPO business practices. This is moderate and measured \nlegislation which is not prescriptive in almost all respects. With only \none exception, it does not outlaw any GPO practices or business \narrangements. Instead, the bill grants oversight authority over \nhospital purchasing to HHS, and directs the HHS to draft regulations to \nprevent improper GPO conduct--that is, unethical conduct, anti-\ncompetitive practices, or practices which preclude products necessary \nfor patient care or worker safety from reaching physicians and \npatients. HHS is further directed to consult with the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Attorney General in\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\ndeveloping these guidelines. Rather than micro-managing specific \nbusiness practices, the discretion is left to the health policy experts \nat HHS, after consulting with the antitrust agencies--and only with the \ninput of industry representatives through the notice and comment \nprocess--to develop the appropriate standards.\n  We recognize that different GPOs have different business models, and \nthe goal of this approach is to permit GPOs to maintain these models as \nlong as they do not violate basic precepts of good business conduct. As \nlong as a GPO does not violate these standards, it continues to receive \nthe immunity from anti-kickback law granted by the safe harbor. \nHowever, the penalty for GPOs that violate these standards is to be \nineligible to participate in the safe harbor--that is, being unable to \naccept payments from hospital suppliers. This sanction should prevent \nGPOs from reverting to unethical or anti-competitive conduct, and give \nHHS the regulatory tools to supervise the industry so that it serves \nthe interests of hospitals and patients.\n  The one area in which our legislation is prescriptive addresses a \nprinciple to which most parties on all sides of the GPO debate--\nhospitals, manufacturers, and most GPOs themselves--have already \nagreed. This is the provision that bans GPOs from accepting payments \nfrom vendors which exceed three percent of price of the good or service \nsold. The intent of this provision is to forbid excessive vendor fees \nwhich can bias a GPO contracting decision. The decision on which \nproduct is placed on a GPO contract should never turn on the amount of \nmoney paid by the manufacturer to the GPO; rather, a GPO's only goal \nshould be to contract for the highest quality product at the lowest \npossible price. Most GPO's codes of conduct already ban vendor fees \nhigher than 3 percent; however, during our investigation we learned \nthat one of the nation's two largest GPOs had accepted fees above 20 \npercent. Indeed, data submitted to the Subcommittee showed that during \n2002 over 20 percent of that GPO's revenues was derived from contracts \nwith vendor fees higher than 3 percent, a proportion that had increased \nfrom the previous year. The safe harbor should not shield such \npractices, conduct which has the strong potential to bias the whole \nsystem.\n  In sum, we believe that our bill is a modest yet effective \nlegislative approach to ensuring that the gains we have achieved over \nthe past two years are not reversed, and that the safe harbor is \nadministered in a way to promote innovation, competition, and cost \nsavings. This legislation will give the authority that HHS needs to be \nan effective watchdog over hospital purchasing practices. Once this \nlegislation is passed we can be confident that the reforms to the \nhospital purchasing industry that we have achieved over the last two \nyears will remain in place, and that there will never be a return to \npractices that imperiled patient health and health worker safety, and \nblocked competition and innovation in this vital industry.\n  The bottom line is that our bill will encourage medical innovation, \nensure doctors get the broadest choice of medical devices, and ensure \nthat patients will receive the best possible devices available. These \nare goals we should all support. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Device Competition \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Given the increasing costs of health care in the United \n     States, there is a compelling public interest in ensuring \n     that there is full and free competition in the medical device \n     and hospital supply industries so that the best and safest \n     products are available to physicians and patients at a \n     competitive price.\n       (2) By aggregating purchases, hospital group purchasing can \n     reduce the cost of acquiring medical equipment and hospital \n     supplies so long as such purchasing is done in a manner \n     consistent with antitrust law and free competition.\n       (3) Some practices engaged in by certain hospital group \n     purchasing organizations have had the effect of reducing \n     competition in the medical device and hospital supply \n     industries by denying some suppliers and device makers access \n     to the hospital marketplace.\n       (4) There is a compelling public interest in having the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with \n     the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission, engage in \n     oversight and supervision of the current Federal health care \n     program anti-kickback exemption (also known as the safe \n     harbor) provided to group purchasing organizations under \n     subparagraphs (C) and (E) of section 1128B(b)(3) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)). This \n     oversight and supervision should ensure that the safe harbor \n     does not shield conduct that harms competition in the \n     hospital supply and medical device industries.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1128B(b)(3)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)(3)(C)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``, and'' at the end and \n     inserting a semicolon;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since September 11, there has been an on-\ngoing debate about the quality of our Nation's intelligence \ncapabilities. In recent months, this debate has intensified as \nquestions have arisen about pre-war intelligence concerning Iraq's \nprogram for developing weapons of mass destruction. In this period, \nwhen the United States is engaged in a global war against terrorism, it \nis imperative that our intelligence resources are used to the utmost of \ntheir capability.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is charged with the \nresponsibility of overseeing our Nation's intelligence capabilities. As \na member of that committee, I can attest to the quality of the work \nperformed by members and staff who serve on the committee. But there is \na huge learning curve to fully comprehend how our Nation's intelligence \ncapabilities are being deployed. There are very complex technological \nissues associated with international intelligence and Senators often do \nnot have the time to develop expertise in understanding all of these \nsystems. And that makes it difficult for all committee members to \nengage in effective oversight.\n  I believe the current structure of the Intelligence Committee \nhandicaps the committee's ability to perform truly meaningful \noversight. Unlike any other committee in the Senate, there are severe \nrestrictions placed on how long a member can serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee. A Senator can only serve on the committee for eight \ncontinuous years. And one-third of the members of the committee are \nrequired to cycle off the committee every 2 years.\n  I think the Senate can no longer afford the luxury of cycling members \non and off the committee. We need an Intelligence Committee whose \nmembers have years of experience in understanding the entire spectrum \nof global intelligence just as we have a Finance Committee whose \nmembers have spent years learning the nuances and intricacies of the \ntax laws and Medicare. For that reason, I am today submitting a \nresolution eliminating both the 8-year term limit and the mandate to \nreplace one-third of the committee every 2 years. I would note that the \n9/11 Commission recommended that term limits on the committee be \neliminated.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues for \npassing by unanimous consent two bills which I sponsored--a bill to \nextend the pilot program for national criminal history background \nchecks for volunteers who work with children, and the Prevention of \nChild Abduction Partnership Act.\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\n  The first bill extends the pilot program created by the PROTECT Act. \nThe pilot program allows the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, NCMEC, in coorperation with the FBI, to provide a background \ncheck process for volunteers working for organizations, such as the \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America, National Mentoring Partnership, and \nthe National Council of Youth Sports. The National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children provides its expertise to assist volunteer \norganizations in evaluating the criminal records of volunteers to \ndetermine if the volunteers are fit to interact and provide care for \nchildren.\n  So far, the NCMEC has processed over 2,500 checks. Through these \nchecks the Center has been able to prevent criminals, including child \nmolesters, from applying and securing volunteer positions with youth \norganizations. Of those applicants whose files showed an offense, over \n50 percent of the applicants lied and indicated they did not have a \ncriminal record. Some of the startling examples of people who were \nfound unfit to work with children included: (1) one convicted of \nmanslaughter, (2) one found guilty on charges of Aggravated Criminal \nSexual Assault as well as domestic battery, (3) one convicted of three \ncharges of endangering the welfare of a child, (4) one convicted of \nlewdness and was charged for kidnapping, (5) one charged with sexual \ncontact with a child under the age of 16, (6) one charged with 31 \ncounts, including multiple rapes and assaults, indecent liberties, \neluding, and prostitution, (7) one charged with aggravated battery of a \npregnant woman, and (8) one charged with oral copulation by force, rape \nby force, and oral copulation by force, in one instance the victim \nunder 14 and in another, 10 years younger. My bill would allow this \ninvaluable program to continue to prevent convicted criminals such as \nthese from working with children.\n  The Prevention of Child Abduction Partnership Act grants private \nentities, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, immunity from tort liability when they are assisting the U.S. \nState Department in carrying out its functions under the International \nChild Abduction Remedies Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10277-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MISSING CHILD COLD CASE REVIEW ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 2435 and the Senate proceed \nto its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2485) to permit Inspectors General to authorize \n     staff to provide assistance to the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited children, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nand passing the ``Missing Child Cold Case Review Act of 2004,'' S. \n2435, which will allow an Inspector General to authorize his or her \nstaff to provide assistance on and conduct reviews of the inactive case \nfiles involving children, or ``cold cases,'' stored at the National \nCenter for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to develop \nrecommendations for further investigations.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Lincoln and Hatch for joining me as \ncosponsors of this bipartisan legislation. I thank them for their \nleadership in this area.\n  Speed is everything in homicide investigations. As a former \nprosecutor in Vermont, I know firsthand that speed is of the essence \nwhen trying to solve a homicide. This focus on speed, however, has led \nthe law enforcement community to generally believe that any case not \nsolved within the first 72 hours or lacking significant leads and \nwitness participation has little likelihood of being solved, regardless \nof the expertise and resources deployed. With time, such unsolved cases \nbecome ``cold,'' and these are among the most difficult and frustrating \ncases detectives face because they are, in effect, cases that other \ninvestigators, for whatever reason, failed to solve.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies, regardless of size, are not \nimmune to rising crime rates, staff shortages and budget restrictions. \nSuch obstacles have strained the investigative and administrative \nresources of all agencies. More crime often means that fewer cases are \nvigorously pursued, fewer opportunities arise for follow-up and \nindividual caseloads increase for already overworked detectives.\n  All the obstacles that hamper homicide investigations in their early \nphases contribute to cold cases. The National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children--our Nation's top resource center for child \nprotection--presently retains a backlog of cold cases involving \nchildren that law enforcement departments nationwide have stopped \ninvestigating primarily due to all those obstacles. NCMEC serves as a \nclearinghouse for all cold cases in which a child has not been found \nand/or the suspect has not been identified.\n  The bill that we pass today will allow an inspector general to \nprovide staff support to NCMEC for the purpose of conducting reviews of \ninactive case files to develop recommendations for further \ninvestigation and similar activities. The inspector general community \nhas one of the most diverse and talented criminal investigative cadres \nin the Federal Government. A vast majority of these special agents have \ncome from traditional law enforcement agencies, and are highly-trained \nand extremely capable of dealing with complex, criminal cases.\n  Under current law, an inspector general's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. Our \nbill would allow an inspector general to permit criminal investigators \nunder his or her supervision to review cold case files, so long as \ndoing so would not interfere with normal duties. An inspector general \nwould not conduct actual investigations, and any inspector general \nwould only commit staff when the office's mission-related workloads \npermitted. At no time would these activities be allowed to conflict \nwith or delay the stated missions of an inspector general.\n  From time to time a criminal investigator employed by an inspector \ngeneral may be between investigations or otherwise available for brief \nperiods of time. This act would also allow those resources to be \nprovided to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \nCommitment of resources would be at a minimum and would not materially \naffect the budget of any office.\n  We have before us the type of bipartisan legislation that should move \neasily through the House once it passes the Senate. It is supported by \nthe Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. I applaud \nthe ongoing work of the National Center for Missing & Exploited \nChildren and hope the House will follow the Senate's leadership and \npromptly pass this bill to provide NCMEC with the resources it requires \nto solve cold cases involving missing children.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on \nMonday the Senate will resume consideration of the intelligence reform \nbill. Under the order, there will be a series of stacked votes \nbeginning at 4:15 on Monday. That will be, in all likelihood, the first \nseries of votes on Monday. Monday will be a very, very busy day, and \nthere are likely to be many more votes after these stacked votes over \nthe course of the day into the evening. In all likelihood, we will be \nvoting and debating well into the evening on Monday in order that we \ncan complete this bill early next week.\n  The cloture motion I filed a few minutes ago will ripen on Tuesday \nmorning, and that will determine the remaining action on this bill. \nAgain, I will remind everyone that upon completion of this legislation, \nthe pending legislation, the Collins-Lieberman bill, which focuses on \nexecutive reforms, we will also address the Senate intelligence reforms \nnext week.\n  As you can tell, there is a lot of work that needs to be done before \nthe Senate adjourns. We will adjourn next Friday on October 8 after we \naddress both of these issues. Again, I want to stress we have both of \nthese important pieces of legislation we will address before departing. \nThus, I anticipate very busy sessions between now and next Friday.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have had a very busy week, a very \nproductive week. I thank all of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for their patience and for their hard work. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Alabama, for his commitment this afternoon, \nand now into the evening, and for his steady hand at the gavel.\n  I wish all a restful weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/01/senate-section/article/S10287-3", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2004, AT 10 A.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
