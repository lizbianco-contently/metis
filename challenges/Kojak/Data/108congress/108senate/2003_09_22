Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on H.R. \n2691, the Interior appropriations bill. We currently have five \namendments which are pending to the bill. This afternoon the two \nmanagers will be discussing which of those amendments will be ready for \nSenate votes.\n  I announced last week that we would be voting today and asked that \nthe managers consider beginning that vote--we will probably have two \nvotes, although we will be discussing that over the afternoon--at 5:30 \nthis afternoon. If further debate is necessary on amendments or we are \nunable to set a time certain for the votes on those amendments it will \nbe my intention to schedule a judicial nomination tonight. So I am \npretty certain we will be voting about 5:30, but as soon as we firm \nthat up after discussion with the leadership on both sides we will make \nthat known to our colleagues.\n  With respect to the remainder of the week, we will try to finish the \nInterior appropriations bill as early as possible tomorrow. The \nmanagers were here Thursday and continued to work through this past \nThursday morning. They, of course, are here and will continue to be \nhere through the afternoon and early evening, although I do not want to \nencourage any new amendments. If anybody is at all considering \namendments, we must have those come forward as soon as possible.\n  Following completion of the Interior appropriations bill, as we \nmentioned last week, we will continue with the appropriations process. \nWe will possibly begin consideration of the DC appropriations bill, \nalthough I want to talk to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nand the various managers. We will consult with the leadership, the \nmanagers, and the appropriate committee chairmen to make that \ndetermination as we move a little bit closer.\n\n  We finished last week very strong, and as a number of conference \nreports become ready, I anticipate bringing them to the floor this \nweek, if possible. We could schedule hopefully those conference reports \nwith short time agreements and votes this week.\n  At the end of last week, I also mentioned that there are 11 judicial \nnominations on today's Executive Calendar. Six are ready to be \nscheduled for votes, and I will be scheduling these for floor action \nover the course of the next couple of days.\n  At an appropriate time, I want to make a brief statement and would be \nhappy to turn to the assistant leader of the other side for any \ncomments about the week or the schedule for clarification for our \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11729-6", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But \nwe do have a very important appropriations hearing at 2:30, and I \nunderstand these two managers may wish to go there. Senator Bingaman is \non his way over to offer an amendment, so we should have some activity \non the floor this afternoon.\n  As the leader indicated, there is an amendment or two that we could \nvote on this evening. I have been informed, as the leader has just \nindicated, that he wants to do at least one judge tonight. So I think \nwe are going to have one or two votes tonight with ease and still have \na shot at finishing this bill tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11729-7", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11729-S11730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EFFECTS OF HURRICANE ISABEL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will comment on a couple of subjects. \nFirst, with regard to the natural disaster we had last Thursday and \nThursday night, the tragedies continue to unfold in regard to damage \nalong the east coast. As I walk around the Capitol today, it is very \nclear to me a large number of people on Capitol Hill, from Maryland, \nVirginia, and the surrounding areas have been struck very hard. A \nnumber of people are without electricity and clean water and are really \nsuffering daily right now as I speak. I have spoken to different people \nasking if their\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\nelectricity is up, and they have said: No. So that is Thursday night, \nFriday, Friday night, Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday, Sunday night, \nand now Monday. I know the local disaster relief and utility repair \npersons are working very hard, and we respect all of their work a great \ndeal.\n  Again, it is time for everybody to pull together as we address the \npowerful effects and potential devastation from this hurricane. So our \nthoughts and prayers are with everybody. Everybody should gather \ntogether and we will pull through this as well as we might.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11730-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The second subject I want to comment on is the continual \nnews that we have with regard to what is going on in Baghdad. Today we \nreceived news that a suicide bomber detonated himself at the entrance \nof the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. The bomber injured 19 people, \nincluding 2 Iraqi United Nations workers.\n  This terrorist action follows an assassination attempt over the \nweekend on Aquila al-Hashimi, one of the three women who is serving on \nthe Iraqi governing council. I understand through reports that Ms. Al-\nHashimi is recovering from the attempt on her life. Most of my \ncolleagues know she is a leading candidate to become Iraq's future \nUnited Nations ambassador.\n  These outrageous attacks demonstrate the level of cowardice and \ndepravity that indeed is almost beyond words, that the enemy would \nstalk and attack a woman who is serving her people and murder Iraqi \ncivilians attempting to build a representative democracy or, as we just \nsaw, one guardsman inspecting a car. That they would do these things \nshows us once again the ugly face of our enemy.\n  Some in this body have claimed there is no connection between Saddam \nand al-Qaida. This is false. As the President said last week, there is \nno question Saddam Hussein had al-Qaida ties. We know Saddam permitted \nthe operation of a terrorist training camp on Iraqi soil. We know the \nIraqi intelligence chief, Faruk Hijazi, met with bin Laden and his \nassociates. And we know Abdul Rahman Yasin, a suspect in the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing, was harbored in Iraq. We are now learning from \ndocuments found in Tikrit that he may have even received payments and a \nhome from the Iraqi Government.\n  Thus, there is no doubt--there is no doubt--that Saddam was in league \nwith terrorists. Saddam himself was the embodiment of terror.\n  There can also be no doubt that Saddam is finished; that Iraq, the \nAmerican people, and the civilized world are better off without him and \nwithout his terror-sponsoring regime.\n  It is my expectation the Senate will turn to consideration of the \nPresident's emergency request for Iraq and Afghanistan on the floor \nnext week. It is my hope that we will have good debate, both in \ncommittees over the course of this week and, indeed, on the Senate \nfloor, and complete action on this legislation before the Senate \nrecesses on October 3.\n  I know Senators on both sides of the aisle have a lot of questions--\nmany questions. The post-war situation in Iraq has required sacrifice. \nWe see it every day--from the families who are separated by service, \nthe families who are our constituents and friends to whom we talk on a \ndaily basis and, most of all, those who have lost loved ones in the \nongoing fighting.\n  The President has laid out a plan and a vision to move us forward. By \nactively participating in this debate we can fulfill that vision and \nsupport our service men and women who have already sacrificed so much. \nWe will also send a message to friend and foe around the world that \nAmerica will stand with the Iraqi people; that America will defeat the \nenemies of peace and democracy. It is that message that I believe, \nthrough our committee hearings this week, through our discussions and \nthrough the debate on the Senate floor, will ring most loudly--that \nAmerica will stand with the Iraqi people and America will defeat the \nenemies of peace and democracy.\n  In preparation for next week's debate, Senate committees--this week, \nin fact, beginning right now at 2--will begin holding a whole series of \nhearings to examine and discuss the President's request. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee will be holding two hearings, the Foreign \nRelations Committee will be holding three hearings, and the Armed \nServices Committee will be holding one hearing. Each will examine \nclosely the President's proposal, and I am confident that with the \nappropriate discussion and with that scrutiny it will win overwhelming \nsupport in the Senate.\n  The world now has before it a window to help the Iraqi people reclaim \ntheir future as a free people. The foundation of a democratic and \nstable Iraq will only be found in economic opportunity and liberty. It \nis this foundation that best defines--and this will play out as we talk \nover the course of this week--this is a foundation of economic \nopportunity coupled with security that President Bush's proposal best \nprovides.\n\n  With our $20 billion investment, we will not reconstruct the economy \nof Iraq, as a lot of people say or which they envision. That is not \nwhat the $20 billion will be doing. That can only be done by the Iraqi \npeople themselves. The Iraqi economy can only be reconstructed by the \nIraqi people. It can only be done by their own resourcefulness, by \ntheir own commitment, by their own entrepreneurship, and by their own \nimagination. Yes, Iraqis now have the freedom to become entrepreneurs, \nto be creative, and to have that creativity realized and translated \nthrough democratic principles into economic opportunity. What we must \ndo is create a stable environment in which that newfound freedom will \nbe allowed to flourish.\n  From our investment will flow other investments from other nations \nwilling to help the Iraqi people and from the developing resources of \nthe Iraqi people themselves. Our investment, at least as I see it, is \nnot an obligation: it is a choice. It is a choice that the United \nStates supports the Iraqi people. It is a choice that we believe \ndemocracy can and will flourish among them. And it is a choice that the \nAmerican people are made more secure by Iraq having a free and \ndemocratic state.\n  The swift victory of our troops this spring makes us forget in some \nways the threat Saddam once posed. We lived with the threat and \ninstability emanating from Iraq for over two decades. Twice Saddam \nHussein was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons--once stopped by \nthe courageous airstrike by Israel and once stopped by the United \nStates coalition in the 1991 gulf war. Twice Saddam Hussein invaded his \nneighbors to expand his reign of terror--once into Iran and once into \nKuwait. Twice we sent the United States military to confront Saddam \nHussein--once expelling him from Kuwait and once expelling him from \nBaghdad. Saddam Hussein played host to international terrorists to the \nvery last day of his reign.\n  Some will argue that we cannot afford to finish the job in Iraq. We \ncan't afford not to. We have already invested billions of dollars, \nthrough two wars and through two decades, in trying to end this \npersistent threat to the stability of the Middle East and to the safety \nof the United States and its allies.\n  We have it now within our power to ensure once and for all that there \nwill be no third attempt to build yet another nuclear weapon. We have \nit within our power to ensure that there is not a third gulf war for \nyet another generation of Americans to fight. We have it within our \npower to help the Iraqi people build Iraq to become an exporter of \nstability in the region instead of the source of deadly weapons of war \nand oppression.\n  By putting Iraq on the path to economic opportunity and democracy, we \nwill shift the entire strategic direction of the Middle East. By \nfinishing the job we started, we will ensure a safer future for our own \npeople.\n  I look forward to this debate in Senate, and I am confident that the \noutcome will be overwhelming support for the President of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11730-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11730-S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as we continue to work on the Interior \nappropriations this afternoon and tomorrow--and it appears there will \nbe a couple of votes later on this evening--I wish to bring to the \nattention of Senators and to this country what we are talking about \nwhen we talk about healthy forests and why our requests for more money \nto replace the accounts in the Forest Service, in the Department of \nAgriculture, in the Bureau of Land Management, in the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and in the Park Service in the Department of the Interior are \nimportant.\n  I stated on Thursday that this problem of forest fires which we have \nhad in the West is a national problem and one we have to address if we \nare to manage our land for the environment, for the safety of those who \nwork and recreate on public lands, and if we are to have public lands \nwhich Americans deserve and have paid for.\n  Once again, we have had a terrible fire season. Over 3 million acres \nhave burned--most of it in the West and about a third of the acreage in \nmy home State of Montana. I guess that makes us a little bit more \nsensitive about what we can do and what we can't do when it comes to \nforest fires and the protection of life, wildlife, and the health of \nour forests.\n  We took a firsthand look at the devastating impact of these fires on \nour parks, forests, and communities in August. We had a very dry and \nhot August in Montana. The fires were so bad in Glacier National Park \nand Yellowstone Park that they were closed to the public for many days. \nThe Montana Department of Environmental Quality was issuing a daily \nalert for dangerous air and air quality throughout the State of \nMontana.\n  The impact of these fires goes far beyond losing trees, brush, and \nthe flora of the forests of our Nation. We see a lot of the other \nramifications also. Wildlife is destroyed and wildlife habitat is \ndestroyed.\n  I will reiterate a conversation I had with some folks who lived here \nin Maryland who were watching the fire burn in Glacier. They were \nconcerned about the loss of wildlife in those fires. They were \nconcerned about endangered species. Where do they go? I said wherever \nthey go, they will not have a habitat to come back to.\n  Another impact is poor air quality. Seniors and other people with \nrespiratory problems suffer from the heaviest smoke which we have seen \nin many years. In fact, the airport in Missoula, MT, had to be shut \ndown one day because of smoke.\n  The aftermath of these fires means contaminated streams and \nwatersheds. Those watersheds not only feed wildlife but they also feed \nthe municipal water supplies of our State.\n  Tourism in Montana is a huge industry. So there are lost recreational \nopportunities. Businesses and homes were destroyed. In fact, over 700 \nbuildings and homes were lost. Unfortunately, there was also loss of \nlife. Statewide, 27 firefighters lost their lives this year in \nwildfires.\n  We have an opportunity to act now to address the poor conditions of \nour forests and rangelands before they get any worse. We have an \nopportunity to change the conditions for the future of our kids and our \ngrandkids.\n  In back of me is a map that depicts a great deal of both the east \nside and west side of the country which contain class 2 and 3 \nconditions. These conditions are classified as highly dangerous--or, \nlet us say, flammable. I think the color red is pretty apropos. Not \nonly do we see a lot of red up there in the panhandle of Idaho \nnorthwest of Montana, but look at the conditions in Arizona, New \nMexico, Colorado, and you can't overlook the conditions in Oregon and \nNorthern California. In fact, those fire conditions run all the way \ndown the Sierras in California. We have seen devastating fires there; \nfire conditions in South Dakota, in the Black Hills in the western part \nof the State; and over in the eastern part of the State, conditions for \nrain showers.\n\n  Nonetheless, we have to prepare for dry years. If you compare this \nlast year to the drought of the 1930s, which was just as bad, had we \nnot changed the way we farmed and ranched, we would have had another \nKansas dust bowl, an Oklahoma dust bowl. This time it would have been \nmore far reaching, reaching on up into the high plains of the Dakotas.\n  Look at northeastern Minnesota. Minnesota is almost solid red. Yet \ntheir fuel on the floor, the density of their forests, tells us it is \nhigh priority for fire. We see depicted the Ozarks of Missouri, the \nsouthern part of the State around the Lake of the Ozarks, reaching down \nalmost to Poplar Bluff, into the southeastern part of the State.\n  If people in the northeast United States are not worried about what \nis west of the Mississippi River, take a look at the northern part of \nPennsylvania and the wonderful forests of upstate New York. Right now \nour fuel load is high. Of course, after the storm this last week we \nmight have a little more moisture; nonetheless, the fuel is there when \nit dries out.\n  Look at West Virginia. Look at Virginia. Look at Alabama. All of this \nis a national problem. Firefighters who were fighting the fires in the \nWest--in Oregon, Idaho, and Montana this last time--came from Florida; \nthe firefighters on the Robert fires were from North Carolina; \nfirefighters from Kentucky--they are all trying to get the fires under \ncontrol. This is not just a western problem; it is a problem for the \nforests nationwide. That is what it is all about when we talk about \nthese situations.\n  The buildup of forest fuels occurred due to past management--or the \nlack of past management practices. Those practices allowed ladder fuel \nto grow into the healthy crowns of large trees; practices that did not \neffectively treat insect infestations and thus the high mortality rates \nin our forests; practices that did not effectively let us treat for \ntree mortality.\n  We talk about thinning and taking fuel off the forest floor. I would \nlove to see a demo project comparing thinned and unthinned forests. Let \none forest grow with no management and have an area not too far away \nthat has been managed. Fire behavior in managed and unmanaged forests \nis quite different.\n  I remember as a young man way back I was on a couple of fires: The \nEdith Peak fire in Montana in 1953--and we lost a person on that fire, \nby the way--and the Tango fire in 1953. We learned a lot about how \nthese fires react. I can state firsthand these fires now are hotter and \nare more devastating. There is more fuel on the floor of the forests.\n  This picture on the left is of a forest that has been thinned. In \nother words, the underbrush has been taken out, some of the trees have \nbeen thinned, and the larger trees can then grow. Where the sun is shut \nout part-time, you do not have nearly the amount of underbrush for \nfuel. Compare that to the picture on the right where nothing was done \nin the forest. Notice the downed timber and the old logs on the floor \nof the forest. They bored the logs\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\nand checked the moisture. Some only contained 6 percent moisture. That \nis how dry and hot it was. The desks in this Chamber have at least 6 \npercent moisture. When the fire creates that much heat, it takes \neverything. It takes the humus out of the soil. It loosens the soil. So \nafter the winter and then the spring thaw, we see erosion on the hills \nbecause there is nothing to hold the dirt in place. That is the \ndifference.\n\n  The thinned forest is a managed forest. Sure, we will have fires. We \nwill have lightning. And someone will have a campfire get away from \nthem every now and then. We will always have fires, but they do not \nhave to be of the intensity of the unthinned forests.\n  We watched a rampage fire move almost 2 miles--they move quickly--\nwhile we were standing there, in only 15 minutes. They had a 30-knot \nwind and the flames shot almost 200 feet into the air. That is where \nmost of our problem is, trying to thin and to clean up under the fuel \nthat is on the forest floor.\n  Grazing takes care of part of this. Where we had grazing permits, we \ndid not have those hot fires because the fuel on the floor was not as \ndense.\n  The next example describes forest health and fuels reduction and the \nimpact on the forest. See the healthy forest on the left. That is a \nyoung forest with trees running from 8 to 12 inches in diameter. I \nguarantee we cannot get from that young forest to this forest unless we \nthin and get the fuel off the floor of the forest. It is that simple. \nWe cannot put a dense growth on the ground, experience drought and \nlightning storms, and have it not burn. That is why you can only grow \nso many trees if you want many big trees, beautiful forests, habitat \nfor wildlife, habitat for endangered species, also a place to enjoy \nrecreation. The forest needs a little intervention when it comes to \nmanagement.\n  It is very simple. That is the reason, when farmers plant corn--and I \nappeal to my good friend in the chair today--they do not plant it an \ninch apart or they will have nothing. Give them space. Let them grow. \nLet them reproduce. We cannot get from the condition on the left to the \ncondition on the right without effectively treating the conditions that \nhave contributed to the poor health of our forests and our rangelands.\n  I have an illustration of the life history of a tree on the lower \nright hand side. This is a boring taken from a 100-year-old Ponderosa \npine. Notice the healthy growth for the first 20 years. It is very \nhealthy. Then notice the declining growth for the next 70 years. \nFinally, notice in the last 10 years, after the thinning occurred to \nallow that tree to breathe. The growth rate picked up again after it \nwas thinned from competing brush and maybe other trees. That is what we \nare talking about, the life of a tree. A tree is just like you and I: \nIt sprouts, it grows, it ages. Then one day it dies of old age, just \nlike the rest of us.\n  The House passed H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, a \ncouple months ago. Now we have the opportunity to do the same. I am \nconcerned about the healthy forest issue as I am concerned about \nreplenishing the money we borrowed to fight fires within the Forest \nService and Bureau of Land Management. So we have to work very hard to \nmake sure our prevention money is not used in suppression.\n\n  Now, there is one other thing we did not bring up. Any time you don't \nthin, any time you lose trees, some die. And we have an infestation of \npine bark beetles up in our part of the world. I will show you a chart \nthat demonstrates the infestation of that.\n  Is it a western problem? No. That little beetle may be called a \ndifferent name somewhere else, but basically, again, we have a national \nproblem. The heaviest infestation is in California, northern \nCalifornia, even down into the Sierras. Right now, it is estimated they \nhave anywhere from 400 to 800,000 acres infested with pine bark \nbeetles.\n  What pine bark beetles do is they kill the trees. In other words, \nthey destroy the cambium, its ability to grow. The cambium is the \ngrowing part; it is what makes the rings. If you are counting the \nrings, you are counting old cambium. It is the growing part of the \ntree. I took a couple years of forestry. I surprise myself every now \nand again.\n  That problem is not just west of the river. Look at Michigan. One of \nthe best forestry schools is in Madison, WI, the University of \nWisconsin. They have problems in their area, which is in the northern \npart of their State, the northeastern part of Minnesota, and the \nnorthwestern part of Wisconsin. It is also in the areas of Georgia, \nTennessee, and northern Alabama. We have a little bit of a problem over \nthere in a little State called New Jersey where we have a little bit of \na problem with pine bark beetles. It works the same, but I think it has \na different name. I am not big on names right now; I am just big on \nbugs.\n  But, nonetheless, it gives you the understanding this is not just a \nproblem isolated to one region of the United States. It is time we come \ntogether: industry, land managers, and people who use those lands maybe \nfor recreation, maybe to make a living. It is time we all come \ntogether. But it seems as though every time we get together on this \nbill everybody becomes a land manager and everybody becomes a forester, \nand sometimes that does not work.\n  But we know one thing. We have absolutely been crippled--they call it \nanalysis by paralysis--in putting together a management plan to deal \nwith this problem: both disease and fire. But we can do it. We have the \nability to do it. We can do it in a way that I think Americans want it \ndone.\n  They are tired of seeing fires every night on their summertime \ntelevision and the destruction they bring and what they cost the \ntaxpayers. Actually, we are about $850 million in arrears right now in \nthe Forest Service, and that is taxpayer money. Everybody puts money \ninto that pot.\n  We need to put a little more into prevention rather than in this \ndevastating thing called fighting fires. So it is not a conservative or \nliberal view. Agriculture and plants and soil and water and sunlight \ndon't claim any politics. The relationship of those four contributes to \nhow well we manage our forests. If you have ever been in a forest \nfire--and I have--it is an experience you will never ever forget.\n  So we are going to have an amendment that puts money back into the \nForest Service and the BLM for things such as forest stewardship, \nprevention, and water quality because, I will tell you, we will have--\nand it was the case in the Yellowstone fires in 1988--we will have \nerosion, we will have water quality problems for a long time just \nbecause once the growth is gone from the side of the mountain, then the \nsoil comes down. There is nothing to hold it. So it is just not very \ngood conservation. Now we see preservation--don't touch it; that is the \nway God meant it to be or whatever. This is a problem you run into \nbecause there have been 30 years of no management. Let's not say bad \nmanagement but no management. We just could not get it done.\n\n  So we have an opportunity to do what is right for our forests and for \nour agricultural lands because from these forests come livelihoods, \nproducts that all of America demands. They are still building houses \nand there is still a great demand for forests and forest products. \nThere is great demand for the recreational areas, great demand to \nprotect our wildlife. And, remember, once that forest is burned up, \nthere is no habitat to come back to. So we have an opportunity, and I \nthink we should seize that opportunity and do the right thing for our \nforests.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I see my good friend from New \nMexico has an amendment he wants to offer and speak to. I have to go to \na little hearing on Iraq. I am not smart enough to shift gears quite \nthat fast. I can't go from one to the other quite that quickly. But I \ntook a little of the time of my good friend from New Mexico, and I \nappreciate his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, the manager \nof the bill, for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside temporarily and I be allowed to offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1740\n\n     (Purpose: To ban commercial advertising on the National Mall)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1740:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this or any other Act, hereafter enacted, may be \n     used to permit the use of the National Mall for a special \n     event, unless the permit expressly prohibits the erection, \n     placement, or use of structures and signs bearing commercial \n     advertising. The Secretary may allow for recognition of \n     sponsors of special events, provided that the size and form \n     of the recognition shall be consistent with the special \n     nature and sanctity of the Mall and any lettering or design \n     identifying the sponsor shall be no larger than one-third the \n     size of the lettering or design identifying the special \n     event. In approving special events, the Secretary shall \n     ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that public use \n     of, and access to the Mall is not restricted. For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``special event'' shall have the \n     meaning given to it by section 7.96(g)(1)(ii) of title 36, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading the full \namendment. I wanted her to read it so all Members would know what the \nsubject of the amendment was and also the substance of it.\n  This amendment would prohibit the National Park Service from issuing \nany permit for a special event on the National Mall unless the permit \nexpressly prohibits the use of commercial advertising.\n  Last week, I spoke at length about my concern with a particular \nspecial event that took place on The Mall earlier this month. This \nevent was described by the Department of Interior as a football and \nmusical festival entitled--and this whole thing is the title of the \nevent--the ``NFL Kickoff Live from the National Mall Presented by Pepsi \nVanilla.''\n  The Mall is often used for large public gatherings. We are all \nfamiliar with the Smithsonian Folklife Festival during the Fourth of \nJuly celebration and the Cherry Blossom Festival in the spring. The \nNational Mall is also, of course, one of the most significant, if not \nthe most significant, sites for public demonstrations in our Nation.\n  As Judge Buckley of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia wrote:\n\n       It is here [on the National Mall] that the constitutional \n     right of speech and peaceful assembly find their fullest \n     expression.\n\n  The management of The Mall is entrusted to the Department of the \nInterior. More specifically, it is entrusted to the National Park \nService. The Park Service's own regulations and guidelines make clear \nthat The Mall is not intended to be used for commercial purposes. The \nPark Service guidelines state:\n\n       The theme of the special event must be consistent with the \n     mission of the park area in which it is to be held, including \n     consideration of possible damage and/or impairment to park \n     property and . . . values.\n\n  In my view, with respect to the recent event I have described, for \nwhatever reason, the Park Service decided to effectively ignore its own \npolicy.\n  Let me show a couple of photographs to make the point. I showed these \na week or so ago on the Senate floor. They fairly graphically point out \nthe problem I am trying to have addressed. This is a photograph that \nappeared in the Washington Post. It is a photograph down The Mall. You \ncan see the Capitol Building in the distance. You can see the various \nbanners which were essentially just commercial advertising banners for \nPepsi Vanilla. And then down at the bottom, it does say, ``Take Pride \nin America.'' But the main thrust of the banner, I suggest, to any \nunbiased observer is that it is an ad for Pepsi Vanilla.\n  Obviously, this very large football is intended to advertise the \nNational Football League which we all support, but clearly, what we see \nhere in this photo is commercial activity being conducted on The Mall.\n  Let me show another event to make the point even further. This is a \nphotograph related to the same event. It shows a large fence put up \naround a large portion of The Mall. It contains what are clearly \nadvertisements for various companies: AOL for broadband, Pepsi Vanilla, \nVerizon, Coors Light. According to our Secretary of the Interior and to \nthe Director of the National Park Service, these are not \nadvertisements. Instead, in their view, these constitute sponsor \nrecognition. Frankly, this is a distinction of which I was not aware.\n  The Department of the Interior and the Park Service continue to \ninsist that this event, about which I have complained in the way it was \nconducted, was entirely appropriate, that the banners and the signs \nwere just sponsor recognition. The Secretary of the Interior and the \nhead of the Park Service are, of course, by law the two public \nofficials appointed by the President and charged with the \nresponsibility of protecting The Mall and ensuring that the uses of The \nMall be appropriate. These photos clearly represent their view of what \nis appropriate use of The Mall. I strongly disagree.\n  Let me explain specifically what it is that I am opposed to. The \nInterior Department claims that the purpose of the event in this case \nwas to express support for the Department's ``Take Pride in America'' \nslogan, encouraging people to volunteer for projects on public lands \nand to honor members of the Armed Forces. Obviously, all of us, all \nAmericans favor these good purposes. But the stated rationale for \napproving the event is not consistent with what was taking place on The \nMall.\n  In my opinion, the Interior Department and the National Park Service \nallowed a large portion of The Mall to be virtually closed to public \nuse for several days to allow essentially for a commercial event. When \nI say ``for several days,'' the permit allowed the sponsor of this \nevent 17 days in which to organize and set up the extravaganza, conduct \nthe event, and then remove the various items put there as part of it. \nBut this was essentially a commercial event.\n\n  It featured commercial advertising by private corporations. The event \nwas used as the basis for a commercial television production. The \ncommercials featuring event sponsors were broadcast over large-screen \ntelevisions set up in The Mall. Those commercial uses and commercial \nadvertising were not an appropriate use of The Mall.\n  I also believe it is not appropriate to close a large portion of The \nMall for a commercially related purpose for long periods of time to the \nexclusion of the general public.\n  I received a letter last week from the Director of the National Park \nService. She wrote to express her concern that if sponsor recognition \nwere prohibited on The Mall, many special events that had been approved \nin the past would not be able to take place in the future. Frankly, I \nwould have felt better had she also indicated in the letter some \nconcern for the need to protect The Mall and to protect the public \nright to access to The Mall comparable to the level of interest that \nshe demonstrated for corporate sponsors. But I do agree with the main \npoint she was making, that most of these special events, many of which \ninvolve races or walks or various charitable causes, do not infringe on \nthe public's ability to use The Mall. Most are not inherently \ncommercial.\n  The amendment I am offering would allow the National Park Service to \nprovide for limited sponsor recognition. It would require that the size \nand form of the recognition be consistent with the special nature and \nsanctity of The Mall, which is identical to the language we approved in \nthe Senate earlier this year with respect to the proposed education \ncenter near the Vietnam Memorial on The Mall. It also would limit the \nsize of any sponsor recognition to one-third the size of the lettering \nor design that is put there to name the special event.\n  As the photos indicate, during the last event, that was essentially \nreversed. The sponsors' names were given by far the greatest \nvisibility.\n  Finally, the amendment directs that the Secretary, to the maximum \nextent possible, ensure that public use of The Mall and access not be \nrestricted in leading up to or during or following these special \nevents.\n  I do not believe in trying to micromanage agency management decisions \nthrough legislation. With respect to this amendment, we have tried to \ngive the Park Service flexibility to determine what is an appropriate \nmeans to\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\nrecognize event sponsors, while making it clear that at least the \nCongress believes commercial advertising should not be permitted.\n  Department of the Interior and National Park Service officials have \nnot shown the judgment necessary to protect the public's interest under \nthe authority they currently have. Instead, they have bent over \nbackwards to accommodate commercial interests that wanted to use The \nMall for commercial purposes. While it is impossible to legislate \ncommon sense and good judgment, I believe the amendment would at least \nmake clear that The Mall, which the Park Service itself has described \nas ``the single most significant public park and open space in our \nNation's Capital,'' should not be a venue for commercial use and for \nadvertising.\n  I believe this is an entirely reasonable amendment. It is one I am \noffering on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan and Reid of Nevada. I \nhope it can gain unanimous support and that by adopting it we can send \na strong message that we believe The Mall's special place in our \nnational heritage needs to be preserved.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have this bill narrowed down to about \nfive or six amendments we are working on right now. I would like to \nalert Senators, though, if they have any amendments they want to be a \npart of this bill, they should file them tonight if possible for their \nconsideration. We want to tie this bill up tomorrow and pass it and get \nit into conference and to the President's desk. We don't want to deny \nanybody their right to file their amendments, but we suggest they get \nthem over here tonight because we are going to finish the bill \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 1739.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been requested.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1739, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send a modification of amendment No. \n1739 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1739), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 46, line 7, strike ``expended: Provided, That'' and \n     insert the following: ``, and of which $79,000,000 (composed \n     of $20,000,000 from administrative accounts for operation and \n     support, $6,000,000 from the trust accountability account, \n     $15,000,000 from the field operations account, and \n     $38,000,000 from the historical accounting account) shall be \n     deducted from that amount, of which deducted amount \n     $63,000,000 shall be transferred to the Indian Health Service \n     and available for clinical services: Provided, That none of \n     the funds made available by this Act may be used for the \n     proposed trust reform reorganization of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs or the Office of Special Trustee: Provided further, \n     That''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I call for the regular order on amendment \nNo. 1734.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called for.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1734, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1734 be \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1734), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, beginning on line 17, strike ``$2,546,524,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``Provided'' on line 20, and \n     insert the following: ``$2,838,524,000, together with \n     payments received during the fiscal year pursuant to section \n     231(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 238(b)) \n     for services furnished by the Indian Health Service, of which \n     $2,329,414,000 shall be available for clinical services: \n     Provided, That funds made available to tribes and tribal \n     organizations through contracts, Provided further''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I offer these modifications in part \nbecause I have been informed that there are concerns about the \ngermaneness of the offset we had included in the health amendment (No. \n1734), and to make a minor technical correction to the trust reform \namendment (No. 1739). The customs user fee is a very legitimate and, I \nwould say, appropriate offset; but under the constraints presented to \nus under the rules, there is a technical point of order that can be \nraised. So in order to avoid points of order, we will avoid using this \noffset.\n  I regret that because I do believe that the offset would help us \nalleviate some of the appropriations pressures that understandably the \nranking member and the chairman had to confront as they were addressing \nthe issues of the overall allocation and availability of funding.\n  Let me just go back to my comments last week when I offered the \namendments. Very briefly, the first amendment would provide for $292 \nmillion in additional funding for the Indian Health Service. This was \nthe amendment that, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, we passed \nduring the budget resolution. I had offered an amendment that would \nhave provided for, I believe, $2.9 billion to fully fund the Indian \nHealth Service, in terms of meeting the basic health care needs of \ntheir current user population. The President has asked for $1.9 \nbillion, and it falls so dramatically short of what is needed that \nthere is a severe rationing of health care now on every reservation in \nthe country. That rationing has affected the quality of life and, in \nfact, life itself in so many cases.\n  The allocation of resources on a per capita basis on the reservations \ntoday is about $1,900. That is half of the $3,800 that we spend on \nFederal prisoners today on a per capita basis. Federal prisoners today \nare allocated, per capita, about $3,800 for the health care they \nreceive in Federal prison. An Indian child born on the reservation is \ngiven $1,900. Yet the incidence of diabetes, fetal alcohol syndrome, \nand some of the most difficult, challenging, and vexing problems we \nface in health care today--alcoholism, violent death--all are problems \nof far greater magnitude on reservations than anywhere else in the \ncountry. So their problems are worse than they are in prison, worse \nthan in the general population in the country. The resources we \nallocate are a fraction of what they are in prison or what we spend per \ncapita in the country.\n  Per capita health care spending for the U.S. general population is \nabout $5,000. So all this amendment says is we are going to put our \nmoney where our mouth was last spring. We said we will give at least \n$292 million. I do not think there was a dissenting vote. I think it \npassed virtually unanimously, and yet here we are with efforts, I am \ntold, to defeat this almost embarrassingly minimal amendment as we \naddress the consequences of life and death on the reservations today.\n  The other amendment said, basically, the same thing. We are not \nanywhere close to dealing with public policy issues involving trust \nreform, trust policy. Unfortunately, the problems associated with \ngovernment-to-government relationships and trust responsibility are as \nproblematic as anything we are dealing with on reservations today. I \ncannot think of a more vexing issue maybe except for the health care \nproblems we are facing.\n  Since we do not have the policy, it is almost impossible for us to \nput together the infrastructure within the\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\nbureaucracy to implement the policy. One has to have a policy before \nthey know what kind of a bureaucracy they are going to set up to \nimplement it, and yet this budget has $79 million to start creating the \ninfrastructure for the implementation of the policy without having a \nclue what it is going to be.\n  So what some of us are suggesting is that before we start spending \nanother dollar on bureaucracy and infrastructure, let us, No. 1, agree \non the policy but then, No. 2, let us put the money where it could do \nsome good. Let us put it in the health care area, where we are so \ndeficient today.\n  We have a problem. Just this weekend I was home and was reminded \nagain what a dentistry problem we have. I think on all nine \nreservations in South Dakota I was told this weekend that we have five \ndentists--nine reservations, five dentists. We have such a chronic \nshortage of dentists, and I will have to go back and verify whether \nthat number is accurate but whether it was five or six we do not even \nhave one dentist per reservation.\n  We are saying we do not have the money to allocate to health care, \nbut we have the money to allocate $79 million to this reorganization \nwithin the BAA dealing with trust land responsibilities, and we do not \neven have the policy. So we are putting the cart before the horse, and \nwe do not even have enough money to feed the horse when it comes to \nhealth care.\n  Both of these amendments are minor in scope and impact but could send \na significant message that we understand the chronic problems we are \nfacing in health care, and I hope that on a bipartisan basis we can \nsupport these amendments.\n  I understand there was some confusion about whether I was prepared to \noffer these modifications today and have votes on them. I would very \nmuch like to have the votes this evening. We had said we would work \nwith our Republican colleagues to finish this bill tomorrow, but it is \npretty hard to finish the bill if nobody is going to vote. So I want to \nhave both of these votes this afternoon. That is two votes we can have \nthis afternoon, and we can have a vote on the Bingaman amendment. \nSenator Bingaman has indicated he is willing to have a vote. So now we \nhave three Democratic amendments on which we are prepared to vote. We \ncan do it at this moment. We could do it at 5 or 5:30.\n  In order to accommodate Senators who are traveling, we generally \nagree not to have votes before 5, but I am certainly prepared to hold \nthe vote open to accommodate those Senators who are traveling. Let's \nhave at least those three votes this afternoon so we can work to \ncomplete our scheduled debate on this bill by the end of the day \ntomorrow.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Montana, the chair of the \nsubcommittee, has offered a very important amendment on emergency \nfunding. I hope to have that vote as well.\n  There is nobody on this side holding up votes on these amendments, \nand I would certainly hope that nobody on that side would, either. If \nwe are going to do what I had committed to last week, I had indicated \nto the distinguished majority leader that we want to work with him to \nsee if we can finish this bill by tomorrow night, and so I do not want \nanybody operating under an assumption that for some reason now we have \noffered these amendments and we are not prepared to vote. We are \nprepared to vote, and I hope we would begin doing so at 5.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Montana is standing and may want \nto address these votes as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from South Dakota. We are running the \ntrapline now. We have an objection to the Bingaman amendment, and \nsomeone wants to speak on it. Then we can vote in the morning. That \nwill go away very fast. We are now running the trapline on the \nmodifications of the Senator from South Dakota. We should have some \nkind of answer on that. I do not think we are going to vote before \n5:30.\n  With regard to the Senator's amendment on reforming the trust and \ndealing with this problem, the policy has almost been set by the \ncourts, as the Senator well knows. There is litigation on this. So I \nthink what the Secretary of the Interior wants to do is to move forward \nwith a system so they can finally bring closure to this problem that \nhas been going on for how many years. This stretches more years than \nthe Senator from South Dakota and I have probably been in the Senate.\n  We have not managed the trust moneys very well. Just getting the \nsystem up and knowing where we are so we can conform with parts of the \nlitigation is quite the challenge we have right now, and I think that \nhas to move forward because right now we cannot do it. I do not know if \nanybody wants to identify the horse or the cart. In fact, I am not real \nsure which one should go across the road first right now. I am not real \nsure that they know at Interior but at least they have a system in \norder to solve it, and we cannot move forward unless they have those \ndollars. So that is where we are.\n  There are a lot of people in Indian country who are very concerned \nabout this and so we should move on that, but we are running the \ntraplines.\n  I appreciate the distinguished minority leader coming today and \noffering his modification. We should have an answer for him pretty \nquickly, and I thank the minority leader for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the response of \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana. I argue that the court \ndecisions have actually made the situation even murkier and have \ncreated and compounded problems with regard to trust responsibility \nthat have to be clarified through a legislative decision. He is \nabsolutely right, this thing has gone on and on, but that is my point.\n  For us to lock into place, in bureaucracy somehow, a response to \nthese court decisions compounds and makes even more unlikely some \nresolution to this issue, but that is obviously a view that is \narguable. For whatever reason, the administration continues to persist \nin trying to lock in these court decisions, in my view in a very \nshortsighted and unacceptable manner for those who are involved in its \nimplementation, especially on the reservations themselves. This is not \ngoing to work. I can't find a tribal chairman, I can't find a tribal \ncouncil, that will tell you this is going to work. So to say we don't \ncare what you think and we are going to override the rule, your own \nobservations, or your own positions--our recognition of the need to \nwork this out jointly--is not the way to go about it. But that is what \nthis amendment is all about.\n\n  I appreciate, once again, the observations and the leadership \nprovided by the Senator from Montana.\n  I hope we could have votes at least on the two amendments that were \noffered last week. I await the word from our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the distinguished manager of the bill does not \nobject, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Historic Senate Debate\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are awaiting a couple of votes, I \nbelieve, at 5:30. We will vote on a couple of judgeships. Following the \nvotes today, we are going to see an event in the Senate that is unique. \nI will describe briefly what this is about.\n  Senator Kyl, who is the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, \nand I have visited about sponsoring debates in the Senate on a series \nof very big issues. I am chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee. \nWe thought it would be interesting and useful to create a setting in \nthe Senate that is\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\nnot connected to a specific piece of legislation on the Senate floor \nand have a debate back and forth, a structured debate about a big \nissue. We will do a series of those debates.\n  This evening, following the two votes will be the first of such \ndebates. I have asked, on the Democratic side, Senator Durbin and \nSenator Corzine to be involved in this debate. The debate will be on \nthe subject of Social Security. I believe--I hope I am not misstating \nthe hypothesis--I believe the Republican side, which will be \nrepresented by Senator Sununu and Senator Santorum, will be describing \ntheir proposition that we ought to have private accounts in Social \nSecurity and the Democratic side will describe, I believe, why having \nprivate accounts in the Social Security system is inherently risky and \nmoving in the wrong direction to provide security for this important \nprogram.\n  The point is, this is considered, and has always been considered, one \nof the great deliberative bodies in the world. Senate debate is a \nfascinating opportunity to not only inform Senators but inform the \nAmerican people about the respective positions of the Republican caucus \nor the Democratic caucus on very significant issues that have national \nimportance or worldwide importance.\n  I suspect my colleague, Senator Kyl, will be here in a while, perhaps \nwhen the debate begins. I wish to describe what will happen following \nthe two votes today.\n  I am pleased we are going to be able to do this with our two policy \ncommittees. It is important to have an aggressive, structured debate \nwith ground rules and portray to the American people the importance of \nan issue of this type. This is the first, but there will be a number of \nadditional debates in the coming months. We hope this will enhance the \nreputation and ability of the Senate to sink its teeth into big and \nimportant issues.\n  This is a great country in which we live. We are lucky to be \nAmericans. We are lucky to be alive now. Those who are fortunate to be \nable to serve, or are given the privilege of serving in this great \nbody, never for a moment misunderstand the wonder of it all. As you \nstand at these desks that have served this country in public debate and \nthe development of public policy for now two centuries, the more you \nunderstand the grandeur of this great body. There are times all of us \ngrit our teeth a bit or wipe our brow and wring our hands and wonder if \nthe partisanship or the way these issues are presented is very \nattractive to the American people. Yet for over two centuries this \ndemocracy has endured, and the Senate, this great Chamber of debate \nabout significant, important national policies, about who we are as \nAmericans, about what we aspire to become as Americans, this Chamber \nhas been the location of all of those great debates.\n\n  Those in the Senate who describe our experiences very often describe \nour experiences in the context of the Senate desk. I sat at a desk on \nthat side of the room. The first desk I was assigned permanently was a \ndesk of a man named Robert La Follette. He stood for many hours on May \n29, 1908, doing a filibuster. Apparently, according to history, he sat \ndown for a turkey sandwich and a glass of eggnog. He lifted the eggnog \nto his lips and spat it out and began screaming: ``I've been \npoisoned.'' This was 1908. They sent the glass of eggnog to a \nlaboratory to have it analyzed and discovered someone had put enough \npoison in his drink to have killed him if he had drunk it. One little \nmoment on the floor of the Senate. They never figured out who did that, \nby the way. That is one little desk and one little story. There are \nstories of majesty and courage and wonderful representation, great \ndebate.\n  This is the Chamber where Webster stood and gave his orations. It is \nthe Chamber where the great debates about this country's history and \nfuture occur. I am not suggesting tonight's debate will rise to quite \nthat occasion, but we are starting tonight to have an opportunity to \nexchange views in a debate sponsored by the Republican Policy Committee \nand the Democratic Policy Committee. I say thank you to the four \ncolleagues who will participate and say I think this does advance the \nopportunity to exchange views and to have the American people learn \nfrom that exchange of views about the two parties' positions on some \nvery important issues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, as in \nexecutive session, I ask unanimous consent that, at 5:30 this evening, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 356, \nto be followed immediately by a vote on the confirmation of No. 361, \nprovided that immediately following those votes the President be \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession; finally, that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate \nprior to each of the votes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and I shall not object--I do \nwant to have the Record spread with the same statement Senator Daschle \nmade earlier today. We have a number of amendments pending, two of \nwhich were offered by our Democratic leader, on which we are ready to \nvote. Senator Bingaman offered an amendment. We are ready to vote on \nthat. We are going to do everything we can to proceed through the \namendments tomorrow. We will cooperate as much as we can. There are \nother Senators who have amendments to offer. We have indicated to the \nmajority leader that we want to finish this bill tomorrow so we can \nmove on to another appropriations bill.\n  I want the Record spread with the fact it is not we who are holding \nup this bill. We are ready to vote as of 5 today--as of now. We still \nthink we can do the bill tomorrow. There are Senators who are going to \noffer amendments, and we do not want them to believe they are rushed \nbecause of our inactivity today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am informed that the manager is \nworking hard to try to establish a time in the morning for those votes.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11736-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11736-S11738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF GLEN E. CONRAD, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n               JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 356, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Glen E. Conrad, of \nVirginia, to be United States District Judge for the Western District \nof Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be a period of 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Glen Conrad, who has been nominated to serve as a judge on the \nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. I \nhad the pleasure of introducing him before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee this past July.\n  Judge Conrad has been nominated to fill the vacancy of Judge James \nTurk who began his service on this court in 1972 and recently took \nsenior status. After Judge Turk informed Senator Allen and me about his \nintent to take senior status, Senator Allen and I began our search to \nfind the most qualified and well-respected individual to fill Judge \nTurk's seat on the bench. During that process one name repeatedly was \nbrought up--that name was Glen Conrad.\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\n  After interviewing Judge Conrad personally, Senator Allen and I were \npleased to send this fine nominee's name to President Bush for \nconsideration. President Bush promptly thereafter nominated Judge \nConrad on April 28, 2003.\n  Judge Conrad's background makes him highly qualified for this \nposition, and I strongly support his nomination. His experience with \nthe law is extensive.\n  After graduating from the Marshall Wythe School of Law at the College \nof William and Mary, Mr. Conrad served as a probation officer in the \nWestern District of Virginia. A little more than a year later, Mr. \nConrad was selected to serve as a United States magistrate judge in the \nWestern District. And, for the last 27 years, Judge Conrad has served \nas a magistrate judge in the Western District.\n  During his over a quarter of a century as a magistrate judge in the \nWestern District of Virginia, Judge Conrad has earned a stellar \nreputation. From the many letters that I have received in support of \nhis nomination, there is unanimity in describing Judge Conrad as \nintelligent, courteous, hard working and having an excellent judicial \ntemperament.\n  I am confident that Judge Conrad will continue his service on the \nWestern District of Virginia bench consistent with this reputation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Judge Conrad's nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we vote to confirm two district \ncourt nominees, United States Magistrate Judge Glen Allen Conrad and \nSouth Carolina Judge Henry Floyd. Unfortunately, we are still \nneedlessly awaiting a vote on the judicial nominees from California, \nfor the emergency vacancies in the Southern District, the busiest court \nin the country.\n  With today's confirmations, the Senate will now have confirmed 153 \njudicial nominees for this President. As I mentioned last week, this \npace of confirmation stands in stark contrast to what occurred with \njudicial nominees during the Clinton Administration. It was not until \nwell into the fourth year of President Clinton's second term, when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, before this many judicial nominees \nwere confirmed. It took President Reagan, during his first term, almost \nto the end of his fourth year to get this many judicial nominees \nconfirmed, and that was with a Senate that was controlled by the same \nparty. It also took President George H.W. Bush well into his fourth \nyear to get this many of his judicial nominees confirmed.\n  In contrast, today, with the shifts in Senate control, it has \neffectively taken a little more than 2 years of rapid Senate action to \nconfirm 153 judicial nominees for this President, including 100 during \nDemocratic control. This year alone the Senate has confirmed 53 \njudicial nominees, including 11 circuit court nominees in 2003. That is \nmore confirmations in just 9 months than Republicans allowed for \nPresident Clinton in 1996, 1995, 1999, or 2000. Overall, we have \nconfirmed 28 circuit court nominees of President Bush since July of \n2001, which is more than were confirmed at this time in the third year \nof President Reagan's first term, President George H.W. Bush's term, or \neither of President Clinton's terms.\n  The records of these two judicial nominees stands in contrast to the \nrecord of many of this President's judicial nominees, particularly for \ncircuit court positions. Both Judge Conrad and Judge Floyd have \nsignificant judicial experience, with Judge Conrad serving as a \nMagistrate Judge for more than a quarter of a century. Far too many of \nthis President's judicial nominees have limited legal experience and no \njudicial experience but significant partisan experience.\n  I note that there are now more George W. Bush appointees on the bench \nthan there are active George Herbert Walker Bush appointees. The \nPresident's father served 4 full years. This President has served less \nthan 3.\n  With these confirmations, there are no more vacancies in the district \ncourt in Virginia, as Judge Conrad joins Judge Hudson, who we confirmed \nlast year to the district court in Virginia. Judge Floyd will join \nJudge Terry Wooten on the district court in South Carolina. Judge \nFloyd's confirmation will fill the vacancy created by the elevation of \nthe controversial Judge Dennis Shedd last year. I congratulate Judge \nConrad and Judge Floyd and their families.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the nomination \nof Glen E. Conrad to be District Court Judge for the Western District \nof Virginia.\n  I have known Glen Conrad since the day I got out of law school at the \nUniversity of Virginia, and I was a law clerk for Judge Williams in \nAbingdon, VA, not far from the Tennessee line. Glen Conrad was a U.S. \nmagistrate judge in Abingdon and then he later moved up to Roanoke.\n  Judge Conrad is tremendously qualified not only to be a judge in the \nU.S. district court for the Western District of Virginia but a leader--\na judge who is a leader, who understands the system and the operation \nof the court in the Western District of Virginia. In fact--and I know I \nspeak for my colleague, John Warner--we examine many highly qualified \nindividuals and we truly could find nobody more qualified by a proven \nrecord of experience and performance, with the proper judicial \nphilosophy, with a proven temperament to fill this judgeship.\n  Indeed, this judgeship has been declared a judicial emergency by the \nJudicial Conference. Glen Conrad is experienced, knowledgeable, fair, \nand possesses an outstanding reputation and proven judicial experience.\n  As I said, I have known him for many years. His wife is someone who I \nhave admired, and I put her on the community college board when I was \nGovernor of Virginia. Glen Conrad is a graduate of the College of \nWilliam and Mary, and that is a very good undergraduate and law school. \nHe is looked upon highly by his peers who know and acknowledge his \nqualifications and his experience.\n  He has been positively endorsed by the Virginia Bar Association, the \nRoanoke Bar Association, the Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys. \nHe has been highly recommended by the Virginia Women Attorneys \nAssociation and by the Virginia State Bar. In fact, he received a \nhighly qualified endorsement from the American Bar Association as well. \nSo whether he is serving in this very large 51-county district, which \nincludes courts in Danville, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, and then in \nthe valley of Harrisonburg, as well as in Roanoke, Abingdon, and Big \nStone Gap, regardless whether on the south side, the Piedmont, western, \nor southwestern Virginia, I believe the President has chosen a very \noutstanding nominee who will honorably and fairly administer justice in \nthe Western District of Virginia and I urge my colleagues to support \nhim.\n  I endorse him with my full confidence and recommend his approval this \nevening because we need to get him to work for the people and the \nlitigants in the Western District of Virginia.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back on the nomination.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Glen E. Conrad, of Virginia, to be United States District \nJudge for the Western District of Virginia? The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), and the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. \nLincoln), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), and the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) \nwould each vote ``yea.''\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FLOYD, OF SOUTH CAROLINA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consider the nomination of Henry F. Floyd, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The nomination of Henry F. Floyd, of South Carolina, to be \n     United States District Judge for the District of South \n     Carolina.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be a \nperiod of 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to \nvote for Henry Floyd to be a judge on the United States District Court \nfor the District of South Carolina.\n  Judge Floyd is known throughout my State as a fine, fair, and even-\nhanded jurist. There is no question a good judge has to possess a \nbalanced judicial temperament. Judge Floyd showed as a State circuit \ncourt judge he is balanced. He has presided over complex class action \nlitigation; felony criminal cases including capital murder cases; cases \nwith difficult constitutional issues, and everything else like that. By \nall accounts, he has applied the law fairly, and the South Carolina Bar \nsupports him.\n  This nominee also has a breadth of experience as a private \npractitioner, representing civil and criminal clients in all sorts of \nmatters; he was a lieutenant in the Army; and he was a South Carolina \nState legislator. He obviously is well qualified.\n  I think our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will find it \nrefreshing to vote on a nominee who doesn't make us quarrel over \nreligion, or advance any political agenda, and who answers our \nquestions. For 37 years, Senator Thurmond and I practiced bipartisan \ncooperation in filling South Carolina's Federal bench. I thank Senator \nGraham for continuing in this collegial tradition.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, Henry Floyd was the \nfirst person I thought of when a district court judgeship came open in \nSouth Carolina. I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed him today. \nPrior to becoming involved in politics, I had the good fortune of \npracticing before Judge Floyd on a number of occasions. He is the model \nof judicial temperament; learned, objective, and courteous.\n  A product of some of our State's finest educational institutions, \nJudge Floyd received his undergraduate degree at Wofford College and \nhis law degree from the University of South Carolina. In 1992, after a \ndecade of very successful private practice, he assumed the bench as a \njudge on the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Court of South Carolina. Since \nthat time, Judge Floyd has presided over several South Carolina's most \ncontroversial cases with skill and professionalism.\n  It was an pleasure to recommend Judge Floyd to President Bush. I \nwanted my first recommendation to be an example of how our judicial \nnominations process should work. We should seek only the best for the \nFederal judiciary. I believe my first recommendation fits that \ncriterion.\n  I'm confident Judge Floyd will demonstrate the highest degree of \nprofessionalism and serve our State and Nation well. Judge Floyd has an \nexceptional legal mind, impeccable character, and a legacy of fair \napplication of the law. He is a fine man and will be a great addition \nto the Federal bench.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Henry F. Floyd, of South Carolina, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of South Carolina? On this question the yeas and \nnays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Time on the Republican side will be controlled by Senator \nSantorum or Senator Sununu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me explain what that very rapidly read \nunanimous consent order provides for. Senator Dorgan and I chair the \npolicy committees of the Democratic and Republican sides and have \nagreed that every month or so we should have a debate which is really a \ndebate, rather than just a bunch of speeches read, which frequently \ncharacterizes what passes for debate here on the Senate floor. Our \nconstituents might tune in and see us reading speeches and wonder \nwhether we have a debate on a specific issue where we mix it up \ntogether, respond to each other's points, and have that all relative to \na very specific question.\n  So we agreed we would do that; we would try to pick a topic that was \nnot really current: that we would have different Members on each side \nengage in these debates when they were held. And we agreed that the \nfirst debate topic would be on the general subject of Social Security.\n  As a result, tonight we have the first of these debates with two \nMembers from the Republican side and two Members from the Democratic \nside debating a general topic relating to Social Security. All of the \nrequests for time will be through the President, of course, pursuant to \nthis unanimous consent agreement.\n  It is hoped that as a result of Democrats responding to Republicans \nand vice versa, asking each other questions, actually there may some \nelucidation, some light that would come out of this debate, rather than \nheat, and that we could agree or disagree in an agreeable spirit on an \nimportant topic to people around this country.\n  I am looking forward to this debate. This will be the first of our \nexperiments. Obviously, if the participants have suggestions about how \nto conduct future debates, we would like to hear those so we can \ncontinue, and maybe it will become a tradition in the Senate. I think \nwe are ready for that.\n  The debate will be started with Senator Sununu from New Hampshire and \ntherefore, again, with Senators Sununu and Santorum having time on this \nside. I yield now to the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11739-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11739-S11746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I welcome the remarks of the Senator from \nArizona and my colleagues tonight for what I hope will be an enjoyable \nevening and will set the tone for further debates to follow.\n  Tonight we are talking about the important issue of Social Security. \nLet us begin by recognizing together that this is an important issue, \none that deserves to be talked about with substance and in a direct and \nclear way. It is also an issue that we need to address with substantive \nlegislation, because the one thing I think we can agree on is that not \nacting provides us with the greatest risk of all.\n  If we look at what the Social Security actuaries have said, the \nPresident's bipartisan commission has said, and countless committees in \nCongress which have looked at this issue have said and recognize that \nif we don't act, we are faced with the stark choices of raising taxes \nor cutting benefits, which is not something any of us wish to do.\n  We need to strengthen Social Security by improving the rate of return \nof investments made within the system, and strengthen Social Security \nby extending the solvency of the trust fund by, I believe, empowering \nindividuals.\n  Tonight, I want to talk about that important notion, empowering \nindividuals and allowing them, as part of the Social Security reform \npackage, to invest a portion of what they pay in taxes every week in a \npersonal retirement account. We are going to hear a lot tonight about \nhow these personal retirement accounts might be risky, how we cannot \ntrust individuals or count on individuals to make good choices or \ndecisions, how we cannot count on the Government to enact a substantive \nregulatory regime that protects the markets or the individual \ninvestors, and how this is risky because it takes money out of the \nSocial Security trust fund. But I believe we need to recognize that \nempowering individuals to make such investments and control their \nretirement accounts is central to strengthening the rate of return I \ntalked about, to improving the solvency of the Social Security system, \nand making a stronger retirement system for future generations.\n  Let's be clear about what we are talking about here. The kinds of \ninvestment options that most all of the legislation that has been \nintroduced deals with offer voluntary accounts but don't touch the \nbenefits of anybody who is retired today or any near-retirees, and they \nstill provide a guaranteed minimum benefit. If you look at the \nlegislation introduced by Congressman Kolbe or Congressman Stenholm in \nthe House, or Senators Gregg and Breaux in the Senate, or Congressman \nNick Smith from Michigan in the House as well, these are pieces of \nlegislation that reflect and respect the individual's strength to make \ngood decisions, and the potential to improve the rate of return of the \nsystem, but at the same time protects the guaranteed minimum benefit \nthat our retirees, and especially those without a strong economic \nmeans, have come to count on.\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\n  There are two issues I want to focus on in my remarks. First is this \nnotion of empowerment and why it is so important to the strength of a \nretirement system that allows personal accounts. Second is the issue of \nsolvency, on which I am sure we will get into some detail.\n  First, empowerment. When I talk about power, I think it is hard not \nto talk about money. Money is power; we all understand that working \nhere in Washington. Any time we can take money out of Washington and \nreturn it to the individual or give the individual more control of \ntheir own money, we are strengthening and empowering them. In \nparticular, these personal investment accounts--all of them I have seen \nstructured in legislation more often than not increase opportunities \nfor low-income people.\n  Those with high incomes in America have IRAs and 401(k)s; they have \naccess to personal retirement accounts or retirement security \ninvestments that are independent from Government. Why is it that we are \nafraid to give that same economic empowerment to those at the lower \nside of the income scale?\n  These personal accounts create a real asset. Why are we afraid to \nallow individuals to control and own a real asset, a tangible asset \nthat they can pass on to their family when they die? The opponents of \npersonal retirement accounts say: We make a promise; we have a \nretirement promise within Social Security; we don't need to allow the \nindividual to own the asset.\n  Well, I maintain that a promise is something very different than \nowning an asset. If you don't believe that, you can go to developing \ncountries where they don't have private property rights, to former \nCommunist countries where the state always promised to allow them to \nkeep their land or promised to provide a pension. Owning something is \nvery different indeed than simply having a government promise.\n  We want to empower them with a real asset that they can count on to \nbe there when they retire. Over time, with a higher, stronger rate of \nreturn, the solvency of the overall retirement security system will be \nstrengthened. The worst thing is to do nothing.\n  Between 2017 and 2041, we will begin paying out of Social Security. \nWe may have Social Security surpluses today, and the trust fund may be \ngrowing today, but come 2017 it will stop growing and begin to shrink. \nThere will be $6 trillion in outflows from general revenues in that \ntimeframe and a $25 trillion unfunded liability over the next 75 years.\n  If we don't take action, we will be forced to increase taxes or \nforced to cut benefits. But thoughtful, substantive action that \nincludes the power of personal retirement accounts will make a \ndifference for the individuals across the entire country.\n  There is a lot of opposition here because these are not Government-\ncontrolled investments. There is a lot of opposition because the \nindividuals won't be beholden to the whims of the Government. There is \na lot of opposition here because some people don't want to harness the \npower of private markets, the power of compound interest, and the power \nof economic growth in order to create something that the Federal \nGovernment no longer controls.\n  I submit that those individuals and workers who are paying 13 percent \ntoday in payroll taxes will benefit greatly from this change. I think \nthe risk is not to act. I think we need to act, and I look forward to \nhearing from the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I thank the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle for sponsoring this debate on the future of America's Social \nSecurity system. It is one of the most important debates I think we can \nhave as a nation, and I think many on this side of the aisle believe \nSocial Security is the clearest expression of our Nation's values.\n  The Social Security system, for 70 years, has provided a promise, a \ncommitment between generations, that if you work hard, pay your taxes, \nand play by the rules, one day you will be able to retire. Actually, no \nexpression of the common good of our Nation has been more broadly \naccepted nor admired for the results: That the reduction in poverty of \nAmerica's seniors went from about 50 percent to 8 percent during the \nexistence of Social Security is a testimony to its great success.\n  It is not a handout; it is not welfare. It is an earned benefit that \nrewards work. It promotes and rewards what I think all of us would like \nto see in our society. Senator Durbin and I could not be more \nprivileged to stand in support of this national commitment to America's \nseniors, disabled, and children who lose a parent.\n  This universal insurance program provides guaranteed security for all \nseniors. Let me emphasize the word ``guaranteed.'' Regardless of the \nstate of the economy, rate of inflation, fluctuations in the financial \nmarkets, or the length of one's life, security is guaranteed, dignity \nis guaranteed.\n  It is hard to underestimate the importance of Social Security for our \nNation's elderly. Of the two-thirds of our seniors and the disabled, 50 \npercent or more of their income comes from Social Security. For 20 \npercent of seniors in this society, it is their only income. For women \nand minorities, it is a much higher percentage of their protection as \nthey go forward. Nearly 2 million children receive survivor benefits. \nFor the disabled, it is more than 50 percent of their income. It is the \nultimate safety net and one that is earned.\n  I think it is important for us as Democrats--and we certainly argue \nthis--that Social Security's guarantee of financial security should be \nat the top of our Nation's priorities, along with educating our kids \nand protecting national security. ``Social Security first'' is more \nthan a rhetorical phrase; it is a policy that works. That is why we so \nstrongly oppose privatization views on Social Security through so-\ncalled personal accounts.\n  Privatization, in our view, is not about choice. Privatization is \nabout mandatory cuts in guaranteed benefits. That is by the analysis \nfrom the President's own commission. All of the Social Security \nactuarial analyses admit that we will raid the trust funds for up to $2 \ntrillion and will force deep cuts in guaranteed benefits--up to 25 \npercent for many current workers and, as the years unfold, as much as \n45 percent for future enrollees. Those benefit cuts would not be \nvoluntary. They would apply to all retirees--even those who choose not \nto invest in private accounts. We think that is a major problem, a \nmajor flaw in the direction you take.\n\n  Seniors simply cannot afford to have benefits cut, particularly those \non the low-income side of our society. After all, today's Social \nSecurity guaranteed benefits are simply an average of $900 a month, or \nless than $11,000 a year. In fact, for women, it is $780 a month, or \nabout $9,300 a year. I think that is pretty tough to live on in New \nJersey; I don't know in Illinois, or Pennsylvania, or New Hampshire; \nbut $9,300 doesn't cut it. It is very hard to presume that somebody is \ngoing to live successfully in their retirement. Many of us look at this \nand argue about priorities. Some argue that we need deep cuts to make \nsure Social Security is solvent. But the numbers prove that wrong, in \nmy view.\n  In the next 75 years, the entire Social Security shortfall, in \npresent value terms, is $3.8 trillion. That is a lot of money. \nMeanwhile, the Bush tax cuts would cost more than $12 trillion, present \nvalue, in the same amount of time. We need to make priority choices. We \nbelieve we can fund this, since it ought to be one of the highest \npriorities in society that would necessarily be on our agenda. We have \nthe resources. It is a matter of will and of whether we want to make \nsure we have the fiscal discipline to set the priorities to make it \nhappen.\n  I also want to talk about this rate of return. I am an old grizzled \n30-year veteran of the financial markets, and I can tell you they go \nup, down, and move sideways for years on end. It is an uncertainty and \na risk that you build into markets if you put it into these personal \naccounts.\n  We believe in that three-legged stool. We are not against private \ninvesting. We are not against personal savings. We encourage 401(k)s \nand IRAs, but I think it is a mistake to put at risk the guaranteed \nbenefits for those 20 or 50 percent who are so dependent on Social \nSecurity.\n\n[[Page S11741]]\n\n  There are a number of other problems I could find with private \naccounts. As to management fees, I assure my colleagues, the smaller \nthe account, the higher the fees. They accumulate. We have had a number \nof problems with them in Great Britain and other countries. There are \nserious issues that need to be addressed before one even thinks about \nit.\n  I hope we do not lose track of that compact, of that commitment we \nhave, that promise to make sure that if one plays by the rules, they \npay their taxes and work hard, they will have a dignified retirement \nbenefit. That is how the world has changed post the creation of Social \nSecurity, and we believe strongly that we ought to implement a plan \nthat guarantees benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for staying this \nevening. The world's greatest deliberative body does not spend a lot of \ntime debating. That was one of the biggest surprises that I learned \nwhen I first came over to the Senate. I hope tonight, if we have a good \ndebate, it will set a standard that will lead to even more debates on \nthe Senate floor.\n  For 66 years, Social Security has been America's insurance policy. \nSocial Security has been America's promise that when all else fails, \nthe monthly check from Social Security is going to be there to help you \npay for your food, your utilities, and your prescription drugs.\n  Social Security has never been Uncle Charlie's red hot investment \ntip, that stock that just could not lose. Social Security has always \nbeen that rainy day fund that your dad and your grandfather told you to \ntake care of first before you even listened to Uncle Charlie.\n  Some politicians do not like Social Security. It is an old idea. It \nhas been around for several years. It is conservative. It is a \nGovernment program. It was created by Franklin Roosevelt during the New \nDeal. It is also the horse, though it never sets a track record, that \nalways finishes the race.\n  The critics want to dismantle Social Security for a flashy, dazzling \nmoney maker that just cannot lose. They want to cut the current Social \nSecurity monthly benefit and add higher administrative costs at the \nexpense of your parents' retirement and your own.\n  Now, they tell us that Social Security privatization adds up, but \nlike that hot stock tip, their privatization argument is all about \nfaith and not facts. As every good magician, they want to divert your \nattention from the most important part of their presentation.\n  The supporters of privatizing Social Security cannot explain how they \nwill fill the $2 trillion hole in the Social Security trust fund that \nwill be created when people lift out money to put in privatization \npersonal accounts. If they were honest about their $2 trillion \nshortfall, they would tell you that the options are very limited and \nvery painful.\n  For one thing, they might suggest we raise payroll taxes to make up \nthe difference, but who needs an increased payroll tax with this lame \neconomy? They could tell you honestly that we can raise the retirement \nage under Social Security and make up for the $2 trillion shortfall in \nprivatization. But is that something you want the Government to mandate \nat this point in your life? Or they could cut Social Security monthly \nbenefits, but that might come just at the time when your mother's \nprescription drug bill goes up $100 a month.\n  If it turns out that Uncle Charlie's hot stock tip, or the Republican \nprivatization of Social Security, fails, guess who ends up holding the \nbag. Well, first, your parents, then you as their children, and \nultimately, when the bottom falls out, future taxpayers.\n  The bad news about Social Security is not the bedrock principle on \nwhich it was founded. The bad news about Social Security is that this \nPresident and this Republican Congress, with their tax cuts for the \nwealthy and recordbreaking deficits, are endangering Social Security \nand Medicare at exactly the wrong time.\n  This is a news flash from those who are supporting privatization, \nwhich I think they should crawl across every TV screen in America \nwhenever this debate starts, and it ought to say, just so you did not \nmiss it: The baby boomers are on the way.\n  We have only known that for 50 years. We have seen them coming. We \nknow they expect Social Security to be there because they paid into it. \nSo instead of historic deficits and Social Security privatization \nschemes, how about some conservatism for a change? How about protecting \nthe Social Security trust fund?\n  In closing, this is a historic moment. Since the Republicans chose \nthe issue of privatizing Social Security as our topic tonight, it now \ncan be said officially to Republicans across America that it is now \nsafe to say privatize Social Security again. For 3 years, they would \nnot do it while the Dow Jones was diving, the Standard & Poor's was \nsliding, mutual funds were muddling, and corporate robbers were led \naway in shackles. Welcome back Social Security privatization. But there \nis one problem: the Republicans may now think it is safe to dive again \ninto the Social Security privatization pool, but when it comes to \ncommon sense that pool is still empty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make sure the record is \nstraight. I do not believe the Senator from New Hampshire used the word \n``privatization.'' My colleagues will not hear me use the term \n``privatization.''\n  Privatization intimates to the American public that we are going to \nabandon the current Social Security system and turn it over to \ncompletely private accounts, which is not what any proposal on this \nside of the aisle or what the President's commission suggested.\n  What the President's commission suggested, what every bill over on \nthis side of the aisle proposes--and, by the way, joined in a \nbipartisan fashion and has historically been a bipartisan issue--is to \ntake a portion of the contribution that comes into the Social Security \nAdministration and give people the option voluntarily to establish a \npersonal retirement account to be part of their Social Security benefit \nwhich continues to be guaranteed as it is, as much as it is, under \ncurrent law.\n  So let's understand that we are still talking about the foundation of \nthis system being the same. What we are talking about is trying to \nsolve the problem, a problem that my two colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle did not address. They talked about the criticisms of the \npersonal retirement account option for people to help finance the \nshortfall in Social Security, that $25 trillion shortfall. They did not \npropose one solution as to how to do that.\n  We have proposed a solution that uses the power of the market, which \nuses individual choice. If my colleagues want to talk about guarantees, \nask the people back in 1978 and 1984, after the 1977 and 1983 changes \nin Social Security, whether that benefit is guaranteed. In both 1977 \nand 1983 benefits were reduced. So this idea that there is some \nguarantee out there is only as good as the next Congress's vote. The \nreal guarantee is ownership. One owns that money in their account. That \nis a private property right that is now not subject to the whim of the \nnext Congress to take away from an individual. So what we are doing is \ngiving real guarantees, real security to Social Security, No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, this idea that if we don't do anything, things will be fine? I \nhold up a comment by David Walker before the Aging Committee in the \nSenate. He said:\n\n       Taking action now on Social Security would not only promote \n     increased budget flexibility in the future and stronger \n     economic growth but would also make less dramatic action \n     necessary than if we wait.\n\n  Waiting is not an option. There are three things we can do to fix the \nSocial Security shortfall. No. 1, raise taxes; No. 2, cut benefits; No. \n3, grow through investment and thereby make up the shortfall. Those are \nthe three options.\n  Senator Sununu and I think most Republicans, and some Democrats, \nthankfully, have said we prefer option 3.\n  By the way, this debate has been around a while, as the Senators have \nsuggested. One of the issues is, Do we include people who are not now \nin Social Security in Social Security, like teachers, local government \nemployees, State employees who are now exempt? They are vehemently \nagainst losing their investment-based Social Security\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\nsystem if they have to trade it for a pay-as-you-go, promise-from-\npoliticians system that we have. If it is such a bad system, then why \ndo all the people who have an investment-based system, at least in \npart, not want to be in this other system? The reason is because it \nworks. Every other pension system in this country is based on that. And \nvirtually every other pension system, Social Security system in the \nworld, has some component of private investment.\n  We will be--I underscore ``will'' because I think it will eventually \nhappen--the last to do this. But we should not wait because waiting \ncosts. The longer we wait, the deeper the cuts in benefits that will \nhave to be made if we do not go the personal retirement route, or the \nhigher the taxes must go, again, if we do not come up with another \nmethod to solve this problem.\n  I want to put up a chart from Senator Moynihan. I heard talk that \nsomehow or another, if this money is put aside, we are robbing money \nfrom the Social Security system. I have a couple of comments on that.\n  No. 1, the Social Security actuaries say:\n\n       If the personal accounts are considered as part of Social \n     Security, it is reasonable to combine the amounts of the \n     trust fund assets and the personal accounts for \n     representation of the total system.\n\n  So when the Senator from New Jersey said you are taking this money \nout of the system, you are not actually taking the money out. Actuaries \nsay you actually should include it as part of it since it is going to \npay benefits.\n  The Senator from New York said:\n\n       Critics charge that establishing personal savings accounts \n     would turn Social Security over to Wall Street. Dock workers \n     would become day traders. A market downturn could wipe out \n     benefits. The latter charge is obscene. The present \n     progressive retirement benefit would remain.\n\n  That is the point I was making before.\n\n       We are not eliminating the base Social Security Program. We \n     are enhancing it, we are stabilizing it, and we are better \n     securing it through investment. There is no occasion to touch \n     it.\n\n  Not one proposal the President has put forward or one proposal put \nforward on this side of the aisle, in a bipartisan fashion I might add, \ndoes anything to undermine the basic Social Security system. It is, in \nfact, a response to shore it up, to make it stronger, and to make it \nsecure and guaranteed for future generations. That is why we so \nstrongly believe in it.\n\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be a \nperiod for questions and answers: 1 minute has been allocated for \nquestions, 2 minutes for response. The Democrats are to propose the \nfirst question. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Paul Krugman of the New York Times summarized this pretty \nwell.\n\n       Social Security as we know it is a system in which each \n     generation's payroll taxes are mainly used to support the \n     previous generation's retirement. If contributions from \n     younger workers go into personal accounts instead, the \n     problem is obvious. Who will pay benefits to today's retirees \n     and older workers? Privatization creates a financial hole \n     that must be filled by slashing benefits, providing large \n     financial transfers.\n\n  The obvious question to the supporters of privatization is, Where \nwill you find the $2 trillion that makes your proposal honest? Without \nfilling that financial hole with $2 trillion, you have a theory that is \ntoo good to be true.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is a very good question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This question always hearkens me back to a commercial \nwhich dates me a little bit. It was Fram Oil Filters. The question was: \nPay me now or pay me later?\n  The issue is, and the issue that, again, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle fail to address, and that is there is an unfunded \nliability here. How are we going to make it up? The question is, What \nis the best way to guarantee that for future generations?\n  What I believe is, by allowing individuals to put money into accounts \nwhich they own, which increase in value, we will secure that system to \nthe future. Does that mean coming up with more money now to secure the \nsystem later? Yes. But if you don't do that, you are going to pay much \nmore later. So the question is, Pay me now--do it in a way that is \nprogressive in the sense that individuals own money and have control of \nthat investment, have real guarantees because it is their money--or pay \nme later, on a promise that my benefits will not be cut, which they \nwill have to be, or taxes will not increase, which they will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, in their opening statements we heard the \nother side use the word ``guarantee'' numerous times. To be sure, my \ncolleagues and I believe strongly in the moral obligation that we have \nto ensure a sound retirement system. But to simply say ``guarantee,'' \n``guarantee,'' as if that will solve the fundamental problems in our \nretirement security system is a huge mistake and it ignores both \ndemographics and the baby boom generation and history because, we all \nknow, in 1977 and 1983, significant changes were made.\n  We are willing to stand up and talk about ways that have been \nactuarially shown to strengthen the solvency of the system, but we \nstill have not heard a single idea or proposal of substance from the \nother side. If you are not going to cut benefits, and you are not going \nto raise taxes, what ever are you going to do?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New \nHampshire about guarantees. The idea of making certain that those \npayments, that $900 average that we are talking about, is available is \ngoing to take some of those kinds of choices that the Senator outlined, \nas did the Senator from Pennsylvania. We have to make some tough \nchoices.\n  We made a very tough choice when we said we are going to cut taxes, \nthe present value of taxes, $12.1 billion, which put us into deficit \nfinancing of $550 to $600 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, when the \nSocial Security shortfall in this country, on a present value basis as \nopposed to accumulating all those totals over 75 years, is $3.8 \ntrillion--three times the coverage of the estate tax. Even if you \nreformed it up to a $4 million or $5 million exemption, it would fill \nabout one-quarter of that hole. The dividend exclusion, the cut in \ncapital gains, would take it up a little over half.\n  There are other options than just sitting here and suggesting that \nthere are no ways to fund this Social Security gap. That was why it was \nso important to emphasize ``Save Social Security First'' when we were \nrunning surpluses. We wanted to build up that Social Security trust \nfund so there would be income from it, but also have the ability to \nmeet those needs as we go forward.\n  I think it is absolutely essential that we focus on guaranteed \nbenefits because we are looking at the core, the fundamental \ncornerstone of what retirement savings is for a vast number of \nAmericans. Fifty percent plus depend mostly on Social Security.\n  So having that at the risk of the whims of the market is a whole \ndifferent kettle of fish than having what a guaranteed benefit is \nabout. That is why we emphasize it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Next question, Democrat Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my colleagues on the Republican side, they say it \nis voluntary and all about giving people a choice. What kind of choice \ndo you give people who do not want to open a personal account, who \ndon't want to privatize? The choice you give them is to see their \nmonthly Social Security benefit reduced. The average benefit of $900 \nwill go down, if you decide that you don't want to play the stock \nmarket, you don't want to invest.\n  I have to ask you, How voluntary is that, if you are going to reduce \nthe monthly benefit payment to those who do not sign up? And, the \nultimate cost of this, since you cannot come up with a way to pay for \nthe $2 trillion, could be as much as 40 percent of that current $900 \nmonthly value. How voluntary is that? What kind of choice does that \nperson have, when they lose the benefit they counted on all their \nworking years?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I assume what the Senator is referring to is the \nproposal by the administration to use price indexing versus wage \nindexing. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was talking about the overall $2 trillion.\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Maybe I am confused. When the Senator says what change \nwould then occur, my guess is--I am confused by the question.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. If the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield on this point \nbecause it was a confusing question, to say the least, but I think it \ngets the facts completely wrong. There are pieces of legislation that \nprotect the guaranteed minimum benefit and that make no changes to \nthose in the current system. To suggest that simply the act of \nproposing to allow some worker to control 2 or 3 percent of what they \nearn every week in a private account means that somebody else's \nbenefits will be cut is simply demagoguery.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania addressed the question of pay me now or \npay me later. To be sure, if you allow personal accounts to be set up, \nyou won't have as much money flowing into the trust fund today, but you \nwill earn a rate of return and increase the value of those accounts in \nsuch a way that the total value of all the assets in your retirement \nsystem will be greater in the long run.\n  I think the Senator who worked on Wall Street understands that fact. \nI think anyone who has an IRA or a 401(k) understands that fact.\n  The legislation that has been introduced in a bipartisan way in this \nChamber and in the House has been scored by the Social Security actuary \nto increase the solvency of the Social Security trust fund over that \n75-year window.\n  That may be a frustration to those who vehemently oppose personal \naccounts in any way, shape, or form, but it is a fact. The Social \nSecurity actuaries are not partisan in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next question is from the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I reiterate the first question which the Senator from New Hampshire \noffered, which is, What specific plans are out there? But I am not sure \nwe are going to get an answer to that tonight. I will go to a second \nquestion.\n  We hear a lot, as I mentioned in my remarks, about their guarantee, \nand I know both Senators know about the Fleming v. Nestor case in \n1960--a U.S. Supreme Court case that said that Social Security benefits \nare not guaranteed. You do not have a private property right to Social \nSecurity benefits. It is a political promise.\n  We saw evidence of that in 1977 and 1983 with those amendments to the \nSocial Security Act which reduced benefits. So we are talking about \nthis great guarantee, this incredible, infallible promise. Yet we have \nseen cuts in Social Security by previous Congresses.\n  My question is, Can the Senator tell me that the 1977 and the 1983 \namendments are not examples of what you would call a guaranteed benefit \nand how those reductions in benefits square with you telling the \nAmerican public that there is a guaranteed benefit?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just say that we can argue for some \ntime as to whether this is a guaranteed entitlement. This much I can \nguarantee you. In a nation where 40 million people rely on Social \nSecurity for their checks, and where their families rely on receiving \nthem, trust me; the people who are elected to this Chamber and the \nHouse of Representatives will be responsive to guaranteeing the future \nof Social Security. There is much less political risk when it comes to \nthe future of Social Security than there is market risk when you decide \nthat you are going to take a chunk of your savings and hope that you \nhappen to retire at the right moment when the stock market is on the up \ntick rather than the down tick. The market risk is far greater than the \npolitical risk.\n\n  We might be able to suspend the rules of political science in this \ndebate. We certainly cannot suspend logic, common sense, and \nmathematics.\n  If you wonder why this Nation is in deficit, listen to the argument \non the other side. They will allow workers to opt out of Social \nSecurity and go into personal accounts and argue here calling this \ndemagoguery when we raise the question that even if these workers opt \nout, that did not endanger Social Security. That doesn't add up. Once \nthe workers opt out, there is not enough money to make current payments \nto retirees. They cannot explain to you how they will make up the \ndifference. That is the problem--if we are going to maintain benefits, \nmake it voluntary and not penalize current Social Security retirees. \nYou have to explain to us how we make up the difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next question is from the Democratic side.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me say on the \nconstitutional question, the Court rules. But if there is a law that \nhas to be changed, it has to come before this body. The political risk \nis no higher, in my view, than the market risk, being one who has lived \nwith market risk for a fairly substantial period of my life and \nunderstanding that those risks are real and tangible. We have very real \nand tangible examples of that in the world today.\n  Look at the underfunded pension liabilities that are managed for some \nof those teachers and other people who have been talked about.\n  I think we are talking about two relationships. And I think when you \nare talking about--which gets to my question: Is $900 a month too much \nto promise our seniors? Is a guaranteed benefit of $900--and then \nadjusted for wage indexes so it is a standard of living and replacement \nwage--is that really too much? I ask the Senators.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Only two-thirds of that $900--$600--is funded under the \nsystem we have right now. Three hundred dollars of that benefit--in \nother words, two-thirds of that benefit--over the course of the next 75 \nyears is going to be funded. So the question is, How are you going to \nmake up this difference? We have put forth a plan that reduces that \nunfunded liability, that makes up that gap substantially. If we were to \ndo one of the plans, it makes it up completely.\n  So I suggest that we have plans on the table on how you get there. \nWhat we have not heard from the other side is how they get there. We \nhave heard about the Bush tax cut. Are you suggesting we should \nincrease taxes? What taxes do you want to increase to pay for these \nbenefits? Are you suggesting that you don't want to increase taxes but \nsomehow you want to reduce benefits? What benefits are we going to \nreduce to pay for this? But the fact is, you can't say to folks, It \nwould cost this much--and it is not costing anything because all of the \nmoney stays in the system--to do their personal retirement account.\n  The question is, How do you make up the difference? Again, no answer \nand no ideas. We can do this or we can make up the difference or we \nwill make sure the guarantee is good--but no plan and no ideas and no \nhonesty to the American public as to what the particular solution is to \nsolve this problem.\n  We have been courageous enough and bold enough to put forward a plan \nwhich, by the way, looks remarkably, in part, like the Thrift Savings \nPlan. Over these last few years, as bad as the market was, I didn't \nhear any Member of Congress or anybody else say we will abolish the \nThrift Savings Plan. A diversified and balanced fund leads to good, \nlong-term, stable investments over time.\n  That is what we are talking about. If it is good enough for Federal \nemployees, it should be good enough for Social Security recipients.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, we always hear the opponents of personal \naccounts talk about risk. They love to talk about the fact that the \nmarket was down yesterday or the day before, or a particular stock \ndidn't perform well. But, of course, nobody is talking about investing \ntheir retirement savings in the market the day before they retire. We \nare not even talking about investment for 1 or 2 years. We are talking \nabout investing for 20, 30, or 35 years. Everybody knows the market \ngoes up and down. But in a portfolio that is balanced and that is mixed \nwith stocks and bonds, or with a blend of the two, the return over the \nlong term will be strong but will be much higher than you could \notherwise get from Social Security.\n  As a proof of that, I ask my colleagues if they can find any 20-year \nperiod in the last 100 years when this stock market didn't outperform \nU.S. Treasuries?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you will look at the funds to invest in \nfor\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nindividuals, virtually all of them suggest there is going to be an \nadministrative cost in that instance. Most of them require a minimum \ninvestment of $2,000 because, frankly, the administrative costs can be \nso overwhelming. You tend to ignore that when you talk about the \ncreation of personal accounts.\n  The British, in their experience in the United Kingdom, found that \nthe administrative costs got out of hand to the point where they had to \nstep in after several years. They also will step in because fraud was \ntaking place. People were deluding future retirees into believing they \nwere going to win in the market if they invested. That is a case in \npoint where they tried to take the retirement savings in the United \nKingdom using your model, and it didn't work. The administrative costs \nwere far greater than they anticipated. Also, there was a fraud \ninvolved.\n\n  Taking money and putting it in the stock market is an option every \nAmerican should have. But to use the Social Security funds of an \nindividual for that purpose raises a risk that is too great for some \npeople.\n  If the Senator from Pennsylvania suggests in the Thrift Savings Plan, \nthe Federal retirees--he did not say that is part of our retirement; \nthat is our savings account, over and above our retirement. I support \nwhat Al Gore supported, as do most Democrats, Social Security Plus. \nThat allows people to invest in the Social Security over and above \ntheir Social Security. That would give them a chance to take advantage \nof a good market and not be eaten alive by administrative costs or \ndefrauded out of the basic needs to survive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The next question is from the \nDemocrats.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from Pennsylvania will wait, I will ask \nthat question.\n  The question we have to get to when we are talking about an \nintellectually honest debate about Social Security and whether people \nhave a plan--you can ask whether one wants to talk about capital gains, \ntax dividend exclusion, inheritance tax, as I suggested, as a means to \nfill some of this gap. Others may have other choices. It happens to be \nthis Senator's choice with regard to these particular issues, but there \nare other ways to do it.\n  There is no answer that I am hearing from my Republican colleagues \nabout where you get the $2 trillion that is going to finance these \ntransitions to private accounts--there is none; I have yet to hear it--\nwithout entering into the general funds at a time when we already have \ndenigrated our fiscal posture in this country to an extraordinary \ndegree, switching from $250 billion surpluses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Republican response.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. First, I say again what we are talking about here with \nthis thrift savings model--and I know many have been critical of that. \nIt was stated that administrative costs would eat up the benefit. The \nadministrative costs on Thrift Savings was .05 percent, .07--only 50 \ncents on every $1,000 investment. So it will not eat up the benefits of \ninvestment. That is No. 1. It can be done in a way that makes sense \nfrom the market return point of view.\n  The question the Senator from New Jersey poses is, How are we going \nto finance this? Again, the cost of not doing something is much larger \nthan the cost of doing something.\n  The Senator has said he would increase taxes. I suggest that is \ncertainly not an option I support. But I certainly respect the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for coming forward and saying we can solve this problem \nby increasing taxes.\n  The Senator suggests we increase taxes on things having nothing to do \nwith Social Security, which would separate the covenant we have had, \nthat Franklin Roosevelt put forward, that the contribution would \nsomehow tie directly to the benefit you receive. So we will finance \nSocial Security with things outside of Social Security.\n  I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting we will finance the \nshortfall through allowing people to take a portion of what is already \nbeing paid. If we did it immediately, we could put a little over 2 \npercent into personal retirement accounts and it would not affect \nanything. We have a surplus right now big enough to finance 2 or 3 \npercent of benefits going to that account. And over time, yes, we would \nhave to come up with a mechanism in the short term to finance that 2 or \n3 percent, whatever we put aside. Again, that would grow, so we would \nnot have to do so over the long time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The next question is from the Republicans.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Illinois mentioned the British system. \nThe Senator from Illinois knows that the current Prime Minister of \nBritain, who is not a Conservative-Republican but a Labor-Democrat, if \nyou will, has suggested expanding the personal retirement accounts in \nBritain, saying they have learned from their mistakes, the system has \nbeen improved and reformed, and he wants to expand the system to create \nmore opportunities.\n  Just recently--in the last couple of years--Sweden--that conservative \nbastion in Scandinavia--has gone to personal retirement accounts. Most \nEuropean companies have done so. Almost all of the South American \ncountries have done so. Russia and China are going in that direction. \nThe rest of the developed world has recognized the power of the market \nas a reliable tool to finance long-term commitments for retirement. Not \nhere in America. Now, that is not a surprise because when we adopted \nSocial Security in the late 1930s, we were one of the last to do so.\n  I ask the Senator who asked the question, if it is good enough for \nthe rest of the world, why isn't it good enough for us?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. It is rare of him \nto argue that the social programs in Russia and China should be \nemulated here in the United States.\n  It is interesting he would start with the British because they \ncertainly have a much grander view when it comes to government \nresponsibility on health care. If we were to guarantee the same type of \nhealth care protection to Americans as the British, not only for \nretirees but for the people, perhaps we could follow their logic in \nsaying we may have failed over the last 10 or 15 years with their \nprivate savings accounts but people were not hurt that badly.\n  In the United States, if the experiment which the Senator has \nsuggested with Social Security benefits tries and fails, we will have a \ngeneration or two of retirees on the hook, people who will not have \nwhat they anticipated they would have at the time of retirement. Then \nwhere does the burden fall? It falls on their children, first, to try \nto take care of their parents, and ultimately on the rest of the \ntaxpayers.\n  This noble experiment, unfortunately, still has this big gap in it--\n$2 trillion--which the Republicans, suggesting privatization of Social \nSecurity, cannot come up with. Until they do, we are going to have to \ncut benefits. Cutting benefits is certainly not the answer to providing \nany kind of security for our retirees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next question is from the Democrats.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \na little resistant to talking about avoiding making permanent some of \nthe Bush tax cuts, but I wonder if there is any proposal at all, among \nthe tax cuts that the President has laid down and we as a Congress have \nsupported, that one would feel were appropriate to help finance this \nincredible deficit that I think we all agree is so important, whether \nit is to fill that $2 trillion gap that you admit is there and will \nhave to default. Is it looking at people who make more than $1 million? \nIs that worth trading off financing adequately the Social Security \nsystem? Is there no tax cut that has come through that would not be \njustified relative to the cost of having it?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, let me provide for my colleagues an \nexample of what it is to answer a question: No. Of course not.\n  Cutting taxes is about strengthening the economy. If you have not \nnoticed, we have been in a recession. When you are in a recession, you \nwant the economy to grow because economic growth is the single most \nimportant thing to increasing revenues. If you want to balance the \nbudget, you need to do two things: Strengthen the economy and \nstrengthen revenue growth, and of\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\ncourse control spending. I am not willing to forgo the tax cuts that \nhave strengthened the economy.\n  When we asked the Democrats in this Chamber tonight for a plan to \nstrengthen Social Security, we heard no answer. When we pointed out \nthat the long-term success of markets in generating economic growth and \na strong rate of return is historically without argument, they ignored \nthe question. When we asked about the success of personal retirement \naccounts in country after country around the world, they changed the \nsubject and decided they wanted to talk about health care.\n  We cannot ignore the challenge before us. We have talked about \nsubstantive solutions here. The suggestion that simply because we are \ncreating personal accounts means we have to cut benefits and the fact \nthat the Democrats want to ignore the rate of return that strengthens \nthe assets in the entire system is not reason not to take action. We \nneed to take action. We need to take up this challenge. And we need to \nbe clear in the answers to the questions that are being asked tonight.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This will be the final question that will be \nasked by the Republican side, which will have 1 minute.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, to that point about this suggestion that \nthere is $2 trillion or $3 trillion--the number seems to get greater--\nin this so-called hole that does not exist because in the long run the \nsystem will be in better actuarial balance and because those assets \nwill always be part of this system--to this point precisely, the \nnonpartisan actuaries of Social Security found that under a reformed \nsystem as proposed by the President's commission almost all workers \ncould expect to receive higher benefits with a personal account plan, \nand the biggest increase in benefits would go to low-income workers.\n  In 2050, a low-wage retiree could expect 26 percent higher benefits \nfrom the commission's personal account proposal. Why, if this kind of a \nproposal is not just actuarially sound but better for low-income \nworkers, are my opponents unwilling to even consider the idea of \npersonal accounts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minute response from the Democratic side.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from New Hampshire makes the assertion that \nthe Social Security actuaries have said that these plans--at least the \nPresident's commission's plans--will resolve the problem related to \nsolvency. I, for the life of me, do not read those actuarial reports \nwith that conclusion. In fact, the reason we are talking about the $2 \ntrillion that seems to be missing--the magic asterisk--is that that, in \nfact, is talked about in these actuarial reports as a basis for cutting \nguaranteed benefits--25 percent for near termers, 45 percent for people \nout in that 50-year timeframe.\n  There is a missing hole. It is not enough just to assert that this is \nactuarially sound when that is not, in fact, what the reports say, at \nleast as I read them. And I do not understand how we are going to get \nthrough those transition costs, which are repeated by almost any \nobjective analyst I have heard talking about moving to privatized \naccounts.\n  That is why we so strongly stand and speak to guaranteed benefits \nbecause that is what the program is about. Yes, it has the political \nrisk, but, as I think the Senator from New Hampshire knows, markets \nhave a risk. They have real risk.\n  The Senator talked about a 20-year timeframe. I think if one looked \nfrom 1929 to 1949, you would find a 20-year period where returns were \nat best flat, if not diminished. So it is a very tough analysis to show \nthat any individual retiring at any given point in time is going to be \nsecure because the markets have produced a 7-percent return, which, if \nyou look at 100 years or 50 years, may very well be the actuarial \nresult. But you don't eat actuarial results; you eat benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period for closing \narguments on either side. Each side has 5 minutes in which to close \ntheir arguments.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleagues for this debate and appreciate the opportunity \nto talk about this very important issue in a way that talks about the \nbigger issues of the day. I thank them for their engagement on this \nissue.\n  I end my part of this debate by going back to someone who is not \nnecessarily a great favorite of mine but someone who knew a little bit \nabout the Social Security system, and that is Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. He was adamant--adamant--that we have a funded Social \nSecurity system. He did not agree with the pay-as-you-go system that \nwas adopted in the late 1930s. In fact, his Secretary of Labor, Frances \nPerkins, said that he--``he'' being FDR--described building such a \nsystem, a pay-as-you-go system--which is the system today--as \n``immoral,'' immoral because he understood that a pay-as-you-go system \nwould pile up obligations on future generations of taxpayers.\n  That is exactly what is going on. Back in 1940, there were 40 workers \nfor every 1 beneficiary. Today, there are 3.4 workers for every 1 \nbeneficiary. In 20 years, there will be less than 2 workers for every 1 \nbeneficiary.\n  This system is becoming more and more and more inequitable. Franklin \nRoosevelt was right when he said such a system is immoral. A moral \nsystem, which every other retirement system in America is funded upon, \nis a funded system, a system that says you will contribute so much, \ninvest that money and have that money funded--real assets to pay \nbenefits, not taxing future generations for accrued benefits of someone \nin the past.\n  We are in a system that has what I described. We will keep that \nsystem forever. But we should at least have a partially funded system \nthat has some buildup of equities to be able to pay benefits for future \ngenerations. That is what we are trying to do. It is a more moral \nsystem. It is a better and more equitable system. Considering the \nchanges in demographics that we have going on in this country, it is \none that is necessary to avoid big cuts in benefits or big tax \nincreases. It is the fairest, most equitable, just way--most moral way, \naccording to Franklin Roosevelt--and we should adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, to clarify the UC, do I understand we have \n5 minutes to close, and we will be the final speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 5 minutes. The \nRepublican side had 5 minutes, and they have used 2\\1/2\\ minutes. There \nis nothing in the UC to determine which side goes last.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could read to the Chair--and perhaps I am mistaken \nhere--it said: Further, I ask consent that the next 10 minutes be \nequally divided for closing comments, with the Republicans controlling \nthe first 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order was not obtained.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It was changed.\n  Could I have clarification what the order is, then, so we can end \nthis appropriately?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was simply 10 minutes for closing argument. \nThere was no delineation as to who would go first or second in the \nfinal determination of the order that was obtained.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would ask to be notified when I have used 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate \ntonight and I have listened to the suggestions to privatize Social \nSecurity with personal accounts, and I have waited to hear the \nfollowing: If you take current people paying into Social Security for \ntoday's retirees out of the mix, who is going to make up the \ndifference? Who is going to make up the money that is lost currently \nbeing paid to retirees?\n  That is an unanswered question. Until that question is answered, this \ncannot be an honest proposal. That gap, that failure of any discussion \non privatization of Social Security, leaves\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\ncurrent retirees in the lurch--and those about to retire--because \npeople will be bailing out if they decide to take personal accounts \nproposed by the Republican side--and nobody makes up the difference.\n  I will say that the Republican side has been resolute in saying they \nwill not even consider looking at the tax cuts that President Bush has \nproposed twice now during his administration, resolute in their belief \nthat though they have failed to revive the economy--these tax cuts have \ndriven us into the deepest deficits in our history--and though the \ntotal cost of these tax cuts will be three times the amount of money \nthat we need to save Social Security on a permanent basis, they are \nresolute that we cannot ask one millionaire in America to give up a \npenny in his Bush tax cuts--too much, too far to go.\n  It shows you how this cannot be resolved in honest terms because \nunless and until we are all committed to the future of Social Security, \nunless and until we realize that rich and poor in this country all \nbenefit from having this insurance policy--which Franklin Roosevelt \nconceived so that our parents and grandparents could live in dignity--\nwe will continue to reach a stalemate in this conversation.\n  Stick with the basics. We should not cut current benefits. We should \nmake any program voluntary, and it should be an add-on to the Social \nSecurity retirement. It should not be in place of it, unless you can \ncome up with an honest answer of how we are going to fill the hole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Republicans have 2 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, earlier in the debate I made clear that it \nwas frustrating that we had asked the other side for a proposal, a \nplan, specifics to strengthen the Social Security system, and they had \nnot given an answer.\n  Here, finally, in the last minutes of a debate that has gone over 1 \nhour, we get an answer: They will commit to raising taxes. Because to \nsuspend or eliminate tax cuts in order to cover this shortfall in \nSocial Security is to make a firm commitment that you will raise taxes, \nthat you will take new taxes into the general revenues and divert them \nto Social Security. That is a tax increase. There is no ifs, ands, or \nbuts about it.\n  Every worker in the country already pays over 12 percent of their \npayroll every week in taxes into the Social Security system. I say that \nis enough. We can reform, strengthen, and vitalize this program by \nempowering workers, giving them the option to control 2 or 3 or 4 \npercent of those payroll taxes every week and put it in a personal \nretirement account, not to gamble it on penny stocks but to put it in a \nfund similar to the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, a mixed basket of \nstocks, a very secure investment in bonds, perhaps a mix of the two, to \ninvest not for 1 or 2 years but for 20 or 30 or 40 years; empower \nworkers today to control more of what they earn. Surely that is a good \nthing for those workers because it gives them an asset they can leave \nto their family.\n  When we take money out of the hands of bureaucrats and give more \ncontrol to individuals, we are making them more powerful and, to be \nsure, we are making the bureaucracies less powerful. That is indeed a \nstep in the right direction.\n  When they set up these accounts, the assets don't disappear or go \naway. They stay part of the retirement security system. If you look at \nthe proposal just introduced last week by Representative Nick Smith, \nthat has been scored by the actuaries as returning more to the system \nin the long run to cover any shortfall that you claim. Whether it is \n$500 million or $500 billion or $1 trillion or $2 trillion, whatever \nnumber you choose to pick today, over the long run there are more \nassets in the system to be used to pay benefits, and that is what makes \nit actuarially sound. That is what makes it a good idea for workers and \na good idea for the American people.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side is recognized for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, we could get into a debate about whether \nmaking tax cuts that have not occurred yet permanent is a tax hike. I \nthink that is not what we are talking about tonight.\n  Are there ways this can be financed? At least this Senator made some \nspecific suggestions about where one could look for funding that would \ncover this gap, and I think there are a number of ways of looking at \nit. They require tough choices. Is providing $900 monthly income to \nseniors more important than eliminating the estate tax, providing a \ndividend exclusion to a very narrow sector of our society, or is it \nbetter to provide $900, $11,000 a year on average, to the American \npeople, providing also for 2 million kids who lost their parents, \ndealing with the disabled in this country? It is hard for me to \nunderstand these tradeoffs, but at least I believe that that is an \nargument the American people would find winning.\n  I also believe Social Security has been a promise to the American \npeople--again, that if you live by the rules, you pay your taxes, if \nyou show up and work, if you are committed to a lifetime of work, you \nwill have a dignified retirement. And putting this into the risk of a \nmarketplace--a world that, both fortunately and unfortunately, from \ntime to time I have lived in--can lead to results for individuals that \nare much different than what the expectations or whatever actuarial \nnumbers are projected by people who are bureaucrats thinking about what \nreturns will average out over some long period of time. Because people \nlive in the here and now, in a 20-year timeframe or 40-year. They work \nand they retire at a certain point in time. And if the market is not \nperforming at that point in time, when that account they own comes up, \nthey don't have those guaranteed benefits.\n  By the way, this is a zero sum game. When you take out that $2 \ntrillion, it requires that somebody else give, not only the people who \nare choosing to leave the system but those people who choose to stay in \nthe system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. We should protect Social Security and oppose \nprivatization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate is concluded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11746-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11746-S11748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEEL TARIFFS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks \nabout the report of the International Trade Commission on steel \ntariffs, which was made over the weekend. Late last Friday night, the \nInternational Trade Commission released its report on the impact of the \nsteel tariff. The steel tariff is a tax. It is a tax that the \nadministration imposed in March of 2002 on at least 10 different kinds \nof imported steel, including the kind of steel that is used to make \nautomobiles and trucks in this country. The effect of the tariff was to \nincrease the price of that steel up to 30 percent. It had a noble \npurpose. The President hoped to save some steel jobs in this country.\n  The International Trade Commission (ITC) over the last several months \nhas taken a lot of testimony and done a good deal of study to see what \nwas the impact of that decision made in March of 2002 on both the steel \nindustry, the steel producing part of our country, and on the \nautomobile industry and on the other steel consuming parts of our \neconomy. The report's finding on the overall economic impact of the \nsteel tariff was not very surprising. According to the report, the \nsteel tariff has saved a few steel jobs by raising the price of steel. \nBut it has cost U.S. manufacturers, the auto parts suppliers, for \nexample, over $680 million. The report also claims that somehow to make \nup for this, the tariff revenue to the U.S. Government, collected on \nthe steel that came in from outside the country, was about $650 \nmillion. So the ITC estimates that there was not too much damage to the \neconomy, only a $30 million loss in GDP.\n  But what that overlooks is who paid the tax? It was, in part, the \nstruggling auto parts suppliers who are manufacturing parts in this \ncountry in competition with auto parts suppliers all over the world. \nThey paid the tariff to the federal government directly when they \nshipped in foreign steel themselves and in part indirectly when they \npaid higher prices to their distributors\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\nwho brought in steel from abroad for them. They paid the tax.\n  What has happened over the last year and a half, when all of us have \nbeen making speeches about how our greatest economic challenge may be \nhow to keep our manufacturing jobs from moving overseas, is that we \nhave imposed upon our manufacturers a tax, a tariff that has increased \ntheir costs by up to 30 percent and made them less competitive.\n  As a result, they have done what manufacturers have to do. Rather \nthan lose money, they have laid off a few employees or they have begun \nin a few cases--I know this in my own State of Tennessee; we are a big \nmanufacturing State and one-third of the manufacturing jobs are \nautomotive jobs--they have begun to move their parts suppliers to \nMexico or Japan or Korea or other parts of the world where parts can be \nmade, paying the global steel price.\n  So, yes, we may have brought in $650 million to the U.S. Treasury in \nthe tariff, but it has been paid on the backs of the steel-producing \nauto parts suppliers and other steel consumers of this country, and it \nhas had the effect of driving jobs overseas.\n  The report also illustrated something we knew to be true; that the \nsteel tariff is hurting steel-consuming firms all across the United \nStates, from auto parts suppliers to home appliance manufacturers, to \ntool and die shops to metal stamping facilities. All of these steel-\nconsuming firms have been affected by the burden of the steel tariff in \nsome shape or form.\n  Here are a few things the report said: One-half of the steel-\nconsuming firms surveyed reported they had difficulty in obtaining \nsteel in the qualities and quantities they needed. That is an added \ncost.\n  Second, almost a third of these firms relocated or shifted production \nto foreign plants, facilities, after the implementation of the tariff.\n\n  That is exactly what we do not want in this country is any kind of \nnew cost added by the Federal Government which causes a parts supplier \nin New Hampshire or Tennessee to move a plant overseas.\n  Third, one-quarter of these steel-consuming firms reported that their \ncustomers shifted to purchasing finished parts or assemblies overseas \nas a result of the steel tariff.\n  Let's say you are making a sunroof in Gordonsville, TN, and the cost \nof steel goes up 15 or 20 percent and that is the major raw material \nyou are using. The Nissan Smyrna plant in Tennessee can buy that roof \nfrom just down the road in Gordonsville, everything else being equal, \nbut the sunroof can also be made to a high standard of quality in many \nother countries in the world--in Japan, in Korea, in Mexico, in Canada. \nIf costs are too high, too much out of whack, then the American \nautomobile plant, in order to keep its costs down so it can be \ncompetitive, will buy that finished part from overseas. That is not \nsubject to any tariff.\n  Fourth, almost one-third of these firms reported the contracts they \nhad in place to purchase steel were broken or modified after the tariff \nwas imposed and reported a loss in profits due to these problems of \napproximately $190 million.\n  Finally, one-third of these firms reported longer lead and delivery \ntimes.\n  This also is very important. There is such a thing as just-in-time \ndelivery in the automobile business. That is why in Tennessee we have \ngone from having two dozen auto parts suppliers 12 or 14 years ago to \nmore than 950 today. The Toyota plant and the Nissan plant and the \nSaturn plant and the Mercedes plant--all of them located in the South, \nsome still located in the Midwest--they like to have their parts \nsuppliers nearby. If those firms have longer lead and delivery times, \nit makes that just-in-time delivery advantage less reliable.\n  In addition, the report further highlighted the impact the steel \ntariff had specifically on auto parts suppliers. There are a lot of \nautomotive people in the country. Historically, they have been in \nMichigan and in Ohio--the song ``Detroit City'' was written about \nTennesseans who went to the Midwest to get good jobs and send the money \nhome, and then they would come back themselves one day. Now, a lot of \nthose auto parts suppliers have followed the auto plants to the rest of \nthe country, to the Southeast and the Deep South.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Tennessee is home to about 950 of these auto \nparts suppliers. They make up about one-third of all our State's \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. President, 85 percent of the auto parts suppliers surveyed in the \nITC report said that their steel prices in the United States were \nhigher than global prices; 31 percent reported that customers had \nshifted purchases to buying finished parts or assemblies overseas as a \nresult of the tariff; 74 percent reported changes in contract prices \nfor steel; and 55 percent reported the steel tariff was the only \nimportant factor in these changes in steel prices. Mr. President, 79 \npercent reported an inability to pass on steel price increases to \ncustomers.\n  There is a lot of back and forth about just to what extent these \nsteel prices have gone up. The report mentioned a variety of figures. \nIt mentioned a figure of an 8 percent increase in hot bar steel. I \nwonder if maybe taking a snapshot of 8 percent in March of this year \nover March of last year ignores some of what goes in between.\n  But here is what some of the auto parts suppliers said in testimony \nbefore the International Trade Commission was the effect of the steel \ntariff on steel prices.\n  Arvin Meritor said its price increases were 25 percent to 40 percent \non cold rolled and galvanized steel. Delphi said its prices increased 5 \npercent to 48 percent. DURA saw its prices increase 30 percent. Federal \nMogul saw its prices increase 25 percent. Metaldyne saw its prices \nincrease 10 percent. Transpro saw its prices increase 25 percent.\n  Maybe some were lower and maybe some were higher, but these plants \nfound in a very competitive business that even a few pennies more in \ncost per part makes a difference in their ability to keep a job in the \nUnited States. They found their costs suddenly way up--15 percent, 20 \npercent, or 25 percent. All of these burdens have meant extra costs to \nsteel-consuming firms--extra costs that have affected steel-consuming \njobs all across America. The steel tariff may have saved some steel-\nproducing jobs, but it has already destroyed a lot more steel-consuming \njobs. The findings of the ITC report alone should give the President \nample reason to end the steel tariffs.\n  I spoke on this subject on July 16 in this Chamber. I tried to point \nout at that time how both steel-consuming and steel-producing jobs are \nimportant to our country. But if that is all you are considering, there \nare a whole lot more steel-consuming jobs than there are steel-\nproducing jobs. For example, in Tennessee, there are about 328,000 \nsteel-consuming jobs. There are only about 3,000 steel-producing jobs. \nThere are 100 times more steel-consuming jobs than steel-producing \njobs.\n  The United States has 12.8 million steel-consuming jobs--2.1 million \nof which are in the auto business. The United States has 226,000 steel-\nproducing jobs.\n  Everybody's job is important. Just to come along and say we want to \nsave steel jobs cannot be used as a rationale for a steel tariff when \nthe effect is that it destroys a lot more steel-consuming jobs. Even in \nStates such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania, there are a lot more \nsteel-consuming jobs than there are steel-producing jobs. There are \nmore auto jobs in Pennsylvania than there are steel-producing jobs. \nThat is no reason for the steel tariff.\n  The economy is beginning to recover. Manufacturing is up. \nManufacturing jobs are not up. We are more productive. So there are \nfewer jobs. But manufacturing for the last 3 months, according to the \nWall Street Journal, is up.\n  I strongly believe this recovery is a direct result of the \nPresident's job and economic growth plan. The last thing we need now is \nto continue any new costs such as the steel tariff on a major \nmanufacturing sector that slows down our economic growth. I fear that \nif the steel tariff remains, we will see more plant costs during 2004 \nin Tennessee and across America.\n  I believe the President has made an honest, good-faith effort to save \nsteel jobs. But it has backfired by destroying auto and other steel-\nconsuming jobs. I hope he takes into account the information that was \nrevealed in this report this weekend. The President is a very good \nlistener. He has given this decision almost 2 years to operate. I hope\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\nhe will decide based on the fact that the tariff is destroying auto \njobs that the best decision he could make for the American worker is to \nend the steel tariff, and to end the steel tariff now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11748-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, of course we have an important bill before \nthe Senate. However, one of the overriding activities, and it is \nunfortunate, is the discussion of our efforts in Iraq and probably the \nhighest priority now, the fight over terrorism.\n  It is a challenge, of course, to deal with terrorism, which is not \nonly focused in one place but particularly in that part of the world. \nWe have a commitment to win on our terms. We are highly committed.\n  Our world changed September 11. The things attached to September 11 \nwent beyond Iraq, went beyond Afghanistan. We are dedicated to complete \nour work there. We are dedicated to completing the job we have begun. \nEveryone understands that. It is a difficult task. Never before have \nour troops done such a wonderful job. We have ahead following up with \nstability in Iraq. It is a long-term, difficult job.\n  We have heard stated our involvement in Iraq is based on fraud put \nforth in Texas. This is unreal and something that we do not need to put \nup with in the Senate.\n  Our involvement with Iraq goes back a long time, to the gulf war. Our \ntroops did a great job there. We worked with Iraq following that. They \nfailed to agree with the United Nations agreement on the followup. So \nobviously, there were many reasons to do something with Saddam Hussein. \nI don't think there is any question about that.\n  The key to Iraq is winning the war on terrorism. That is why we are \nthere. The President has asked for a large amount of money to fund the \nwar on terrorism. We knew that would be the case. Certainly of the $87 \nbillion, some is for our troops. No one argues with the notion we have \nto give our troops the support they need. The majority of the money \nwill go to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan while we continue to give \nthem the resources they need to continue to win.\n  There are also other needs if we are going to finally get this \ncountry to be self-supportive, which is our goal, and to do away with \nterrorism so it is not a source of danger around the world. We have to \nbe committed. The stakes are high. And our spending has been high.\n  We have been, since September 11, in some unusual arrangements. I am \nserious about trying to control spending and to keep it within the \nbudget, but when there are extraordinary circumstances, you have to \ntake extraordinary steps. And certainly September 11 is extraordinary. \nCertainly the economy now, which we are trying to strengthen, is \nextraordinary. The terrorism that continues to take place is \nextraordinary.\n\n  So if we are to be successful in this global war, we must be willing \nto pay that price, and we must do the job correctly. I think that is \nparticularly important after we are there. I guess before we began, you \ncould talk about all kinds of things. The fact is, we are there. The \nfact is, we are committed. The fact is, we have done a great deal. We \nneed to continue to see it through and see our duty through.\n  Where are we today? We are winning the war in Iraq. The situation \nremains dangerous, of course, and it is not settled, it is not steady. \nBut great progress has been made.\n  It is interesting how much of a different picture you receive from \npeople who have been to Iraq and then come back and tell what they have \nseen and what they feel as compared to what you see on the news \nnightly. I understand that bad things are always news, and so that is \nnot a new idea. But progress is being made. There is no food crisis, no \nrefugee crisis, no public health crisis.\n  The coalition is helping Iraq establish a representative basis for a \ndemocratic government of their own, something they, of course, have \nnever had. And it is part of our goal for the future. The coalition \nauthorities continue to help repair the vital infrastructure all across \nthe country. We are seeing increasingly other countries becoming \ninvolved. I think soon we will see the U.N. be more involved than it is \nnow. Coalition forces are aggressively hunting down members of the \nformer regime.\n  Unfortunately, some would rather ignore the achievements, I think, \nfor political purposes. That is too bad. I understand there can be \ndifferences of view. That is perfectly legitimate. But when you get the \nsense that sort of thing is being designed toward an election in 2004, \nit is a little disturbing.\n  The former regime in Iraq had ties to al-Qaida; there is no question. \nIt harbored and supported terrorists; there is no question. It \npossessed weapons and used weapons of mass destruction. They had done \nthat; there is no question. They were a threat to the region and the \nworld. We know that was the case.\n  When we decided to use military force, the President made the best \ndecision he could make. To suggest this was dreamed up in Texas for \npolitical purposes is not realistic, nor is it fair. Using the best \ninformation available at the time, the President made his decision--a \ntough decision. Can you imagine having to make that kind of decision \nfollowing September 11?\n  So it is a very difficult issue. But I think, truly--and my only \npoint is--we can disagree, but we ought to disagree taking into account \nthe facts, letting people make their own judgments. I understand that. \nBut I think to portray the President as deliberately misleading the \npublic is not a reasonable approach and one that should not take place \namong our associates. The war on terrorism takes time and patience and \ndollars, and we must see it through.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly about this issue, so I wanted to \nmake those comments today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11748-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11748-S11749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATIONS TO LAIRD LARSON AND BOB DUXBURY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to offer my warmest regards \nand sincere congratulations to Laird Larson of Clark, SD, and Bob \nDuxbury of Wessington, South Dakota, on their receipt of South Dakota \nState University's Eminent Farmer award for 2003 in Brookings last \nFriday night.\n  Laird Larson and Bob Duxbury are well known and highly respected \nwithin SD, not only as dedicated farmers, but also as innovative \ncommunity leaders. I know of no individuals more deserving of this \nrecognition than Laird and Bob.\n  Laird and his wife, Kathy, have farmed in Clark County, SD, for \nalmost 30 years. They are active in a number of farm organizations, \nincluding the South Dakota Crop Improvement Association, SDCIA, where \nLaird has served on the county board of directors for nearly 20 years \nand as State president. This year the SDCIA recognized Laird as is its \nPremier Certified Seed Grower.\n  Laird also has a long history promoting agricultural education. He \nhas raised funds for renovating greenhouses at South Dakota State \nUniversity and is currently working to develop a seed science center at \nthe school.\n  Laird and Kathy Larson understand the unique character of rural life \nand have passed on its values to their three accomplished children: \nHeidi, who works for Wisconsin Crop Improvement; Shane, who I had the \npleasure of getting to know when he worked on my Senate staff several \nyears ago; and Sara, who is majoring in special education at Augustana \nCollege in Sioux Falls. The Larson family reflects the strength and \ncharacter of rural life in America today.\n  Bob Duxbury and his wife, Rose, farm and ranch near Wessington, in \ncentral South Dakota. In a landscape dotted with farms, ranches and \nsmall communities, farmers and ranchers not only are called upon to \nfeed our Nation with safe and affordable food, but in many instances \nare also called upon to serve in public office. Bob exemplifies that \ndual commitment, standing today as a shining example of Thomas \nJefferson's enduring ideal of the citizen farmer.\n  Bob's commitment to agriculture started at a very young age, with his \nown participation in 4-H and continued with his degree from South \nDakota State University in 1956, which he used to teach animal science. \nHe served as the State's Secretary of Agriculture from 1975 to 1978 and \nwas a member of the State Fair Board from 1971 to 1975.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Redwood \nCity, CA. On September 13, 2003, a Sikh cab driver, Devinder Singh, was \nshot and killed in an apparent hate crime. Two days after the \nanniversary of the September 11, 2001, bombing tragedy, Devinder Singh \nwas called to pick up two passengers and drive them from Redwood City, \nCA to Menlo Park, CA. One or both of the passengers shot and killed him \nafter driving less than four blocks in the cab.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11749-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11749-S11751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  2004\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the annual \nenergy and water appropriations bill. As my colleagues well know, the \nenergy and water development appropriations bill is perhaps one of the \nmost important measures this body considers each year. This bill \nprovides funding for our Nation's energy resources, finances much-\nneeded improvements to our water infrastructure and provides funding \nfor critical aspects of our national security needs.\n  Let me begin, by commending the managers of this bill, Senator \nDomenici, the chairman of the subcommittee on energy and water \ndevelopment, and Senator Reid, the subcommittee's ranking member, for \ntheir hard work on this legislation. The task before them was great, \nand they successfully completed this bill in a timely fashion, allowing \nthe appropriations process to move forward.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation funds critical cleanup \nactivities at various sites across the country and continues ongoing \nwater infrastructure projects managed by the Army Corps of Engineers \nand the Bureau of Reclamation. Furthermore, the bill increases funding \nfor the energy supply, designed to develop new energy technologies and \nimprove existing energy programs. These are significant aspects of this \nlegislation and seek to ensure a diverse energy supply for our nation.\n  Given the energy problems facing our country, these aspects of the \nbill are worthy pursuits. Again, I have tremendous respect for the hard \nwork done by the managers in putting this bill together. I am, however, \ndisappointed that once again my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee have succumbed to temptation and loaded this bill with \nnumerous locality-specific earmarks, special deals and unnecessary, \nwasteful porkbarrel spending projects.\n  This bill contains nearly $1.2 billion more than what was \nappropriated for fiscal year 2003 and is over $700 million more than \nthe administration's budget request. In this bill, I have identified \nover 700 items of unrequested, locality specific earmarks, unauthorized \nspending and special deals for certain states totaling nearly $1.5 \nbillion. I will post a list of these items on my official Senate \nwebsite.\n  Let me highlight just some of the egregious aspects of this bill. \nThere is $6.9 million for the New Mexico Education Enrichment \nFoundation. Aren't any of the other 49 States in this country entitled \nto ``Education Enrichment?''. There is $1 million for water management \nin Hawaii. There is $1.5 million above the budget request for oyster \nrecovery in Maryland and Virginia. There is $500,000 for exhibits at \nthe Atomic Testing History Institute in Nevada. History Institute--a \npretty fancy name for a museum. There is language directing the Corps \nof Engineers to repair a Fish Viewing Building in Washington State. \nThere is $13 million above the budget request for the Kanawha River in \nWest Virginia.\n  There is $1.5 million for the University of Nevada-Las Vegas to \nconduct safety and risk analysis. There is $20 million for the Lewis \nand Clark Water Project in South Dakota. There is $3 million above the \nbudget request for the Tropicana and Flamingo Washes in Nevada. There \nis $105 million to build a ``microsystem and engineering'' facility in \nNew Mexico. There is $690 million to build a waste treatment plant in \nRichland, WA. There is $14 million to build an ``immobilized'' interim \nwaste storage facility in Richland, WA. Just how many wastes facilities \ndoes Richland, WA need? Thankfully this one is ``immobilized''--there \nis nothing more disturbing than ``mobilized'' waste.\n  There is $20.2 million to build a glass waste storage building in \nSavannah River, SC. There is $38 million above the request for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission. There is $5 million above the budget \nrequest for the Delta Regional Authority. There is $39 million above \nthe budget request for the Denali Commission.\n  The Corps of Engineers general construction account itself contains \n128 unrequested, locality-specific projects which total over $382 \nmillion. Let me read a few of those for the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the list of these 128 projects be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Unrequested Army Corps of Engineer Construction Projects\n\n\n                                 Alaska\n\n     $4 Million for Dillingham Emergency Bank\n     $3 Million for Dillingham Small Boak\n     $4 Million for Kake Dam\n     $1 Million for Sand Point\n     $1 Million for Sitka\n     $10 Million for Wrangell\n\n\n                                Arizona:\n\n     $3.5 Million for Rio De Flagg, Flagstaff\n     $7 Million for Tres Rios\n     $5 Million for Tucson Drainage Area\n\n\n                                Arkansas\n\n     An increase of $7 Million over the budget request for \n         Montgomery Point Lock and Dam\n     $3 Million for Ozark- Jeta Taylor (Rehabilitation for \n         powerhouse)\n     $750,000 for the Red River below Denison Dam\n     $1.25 Million for the Red River Emergency Bank\n\n\n                               California\n\n     An increase of $1 Million over the budget request for \n         Hamilton Airfield Wetlands Restoration\n     $4 Million for Harbor South Bay Water Recycling\n     $200,000 for Imperial Beach\n     An increase of $2.5 Million over the budget request for Napa \n         River\n     An increase of $13 Million over the budget request amount for \n         Oakland Harbor\n     $15 Million for the Port of Los Angeles Main Deepening\n\n\n                                Delaware\n\n     $214,000 for the Delaware Cost from Cape Henlopen to Fenwick \n         Island\n     $500,000 for the Delaware Bay Coastline, Port Mahon\n\n\n                                Florida\n\n     $1 Million for Florida Keys Water Quality Improvement\n     $500,000 for Tampa Harbor\n\n\n                                Georgia\n\n     An increase of $1.5 Million over the budget request for \n         Brunswick Harbor\n     $3.85 Million for the Richard B.

 Mr. McCAIN. I am confident that many of my colleagues will maintain \nthe importance of the need to fully fund these and many of the other \nprojects in their respective States. That is fine. I do not fault them \nfor it. In fact, let me state clearly, that I do not question the \nmerits of these projects. Most of them, I am sure, are very important \nand worthy of Federal funds.\n  It is the process, with which I have a serious problem. The \nAppropriations Committee has effectively usurped the power of the \nauthorizing committees and acts as one, all-powerful funding machine. \nProjects are often funded with little or no background study, and are \napproved after simply being requested by a fellow Senator. These same \nprojects are directed to certain states and localities, completely \ncircumventing the proper, competitive-based awards process. \nAdditionally, as is the case throughout this bill, members of the \nAppropriations Committee use directive language to force cabinet \nsecretaries and agency heads to use scarce taxpayer dollars to fund \nmembers' pet projects, while not allotting them a single dime with \nwhich to fulfill the requirements imposed upon them by the \nappropriators.\n  Additionally, this bill deauthorizes 20 inactive corps projects, some \ndating as far back as 1946. While I appreciate the committee \nrecognizing the need for inactive projects to be deauthorized, I\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\nmust point out that an appropriations bill is simply not the place for \nthis type of language. A project should be deauthorized in the same way \nit is supposed to be authorized--by the appropriate authorizing \ncommittee, not by the Appropriations Committee.\n  As I often do during consideration of the appropriations bills, I had \nplanned to offer an amendment to this bill to strip a provision that is \ndesigned to benefit one specific water project in the State of New \nMexico. I chose not to offer my amendment in this case for various \nreasons. But I am putting the Senate on notice--I will continue to \noffer amendments to the remaining appropriations bills if these bills \ncontinue to come before this body loaded with unrequested earmarks or \nother unnecessary or wasteful spending.\n  As all of my colleagues know, CBO recently projected a potentially \ndebilitating $480 billion deficit for 2004. More importantly, we are at \nwar. President Bush is poised to request a supplemental appropriation \nof $87 billion for the ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Every one of us has asked ourselves the same question: \nWhere is that money going to come from? I have an idea. Let's start \nwith this bill. Let's eliminate all of the unrequested earmarks, all of \nthe special deals, all of the pork and all of the waste. Let's prove to \nthe American taxpayer that we in Washington do not see them as simply a \ncash cow for our every financial whim.\n  Both the President and the Vice President have recently called on \nCongress to control spending at this crucial time. Is it too much to \nask Congress to tighten their own belts in order to benefit the men and \nwomen of the armed forces who continue to fight--and die--so that \nothers may live free of tyranny and oppression? I don't think it is a \nlot to ask, I think it is our responsibility. We simply cannot continue \nto spend hardworking American's tax dollars in such an irresponsible \nmanner any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11751-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11751-S11752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MR. KIRK BLOODSWORTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a man, Kirk \nNoble Bloodsworth, who was the victim of a grossly imperfect system. I \nfirst met Kirk Bloodsworth in 2000 when he came to me as a man who had \nbeen exonerated after almost 9 years of wrongful imprisonment. I am \nproud to say that we have become close friends and partners in the \nfight to reform capital punishment in America.\n  For 8 years, 11 months and 19 days, Kirk Bloodsworth served time in \nprison as an innocent man. And for the next 10 years, Mr. Bloodsworth \nlived in a jail without bars. He lived in a world where people \nquestioned his innocence, where rumors followed him everywhere he went, \nand where he was unable to find stable employment.\n  On July 25, 1984, 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton was brutally raped and \nmurdered. Fifteen days later, Kirk Bloodsworth was arrested based on \nthe testimony of several witnesses who said they had seen him near the \nspot where they found Miss Hamilton. There was no physical evidence \nlinking Mr. Bloodsworth to the crime.\n  In March, 1985, Mr. Bloodsworth, a former Marine with no criminal \nbackground, was convicted and sentenced to death in Maryland. He was 24 \nyears old. Subsequently, the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned Mr. \nBloodsworth's conviction. However, a second jury trial found him \nguilty, and sentenced him to two consecutive life terms. In 1992, at \nthe request of Mr. Bloodsworth and his attorney, the evidence from his \ntrial--Miss Hamilton's shirt and underpants--was tested for DNA. By \nJune 1993, two DNA fingerprinting tests--one conducted by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and one conducted by Forensic Science \nAssociates concluded that Mr. Bloodsworth's DNA was not the same as DNA \nfound on Miss Hamilton's underpants.\n  On June 28, 1993, Mr. Bloodsworth was released from prison; in \nDecember, 1993, Maryland Governor William Schaefer pardoned him; and in \nJune, 1994, the State of Maryland awarded him $300,000 in compensation.\n  The wheels of justice broke down in this case, but we cannot pretend \nthat what happened to Kirk Bloodsworth was an exceptional occurrence. \nMr. Bloodsworth's nightmare of wrongful conviction has been repeated \nagain and again across the country. To date, 111 individuals convicted \nand sentenced to death have been released from death row with evidence \nof their innocence, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n  Today Mr. Bloodsworth is outspoken about the importance of making \npost-conviction DNA testing available to defendants with a credible \nclaim of innocence, something I have fought hard to accomplish as part \nof the Innocence Protection Act. People of good conscience can and will \ndisagree on the morality of the death penalty. But we can all agree \nthat a system that sentences innocent persons to death has no place in \na civilized society, much less in 21st century America.\n  While DNA testing freed Mr. Bloodsworth from prison in 1993, the test \nresults did not convince everyone that Kirk Bloodsworth was not guilty. \nProsecutors refused to lift the veil of suspicion over him, in effect \nsaying that the DNA tests might be sufficient to undermine his \nconviction, but not to prove his innocence. Mr. Bloodsworth told the \nBaltimore Sun that he spent years asking the county to run the DNA \nfound on Dawn Hamilton's clothing through the State DNA database. \nFinally, last week, the State ran the DNA evidence through its database \nand the black cloud that had followed Mr. Bloodsworth for 10 years was \nlifted.\n  On September 5, 2003, Mr. Bloodsworth was told that the State tests \nimplicated Mr. Kimberly Shay Ruffner, a convicted sex offender, as the \nrapist and murderer of Dawn Hamilton. Mr. Ruffner has now been charged \nwith first-degree murder. The prosecutor who previously refused to \nacknowledge Mr. Bloodsworth's innocence went to his home to apologize \nto him.\n  I know that I am joined by many others when I say that I am delighted \nthat Mr. Bloodsworth can finally feel truly free. His fight to prove \nhis own innocence has been won. I am certain that he will continue with \nhis efforts to fix the broken machinery of capital punishment in \nAmerica and especially to assist others who experienced wrongful \nconviction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Baltimore Sun article detailing the \nrecent events in Mr. Bloodsworth's case be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 6, 2003]\n\n  DNA That Freed Man Leads to New Suspect; Killing: Kirk Bloodsworth, \nConvicted and Then Cleared in the Rape-Murder of a Child, Learns a Man \n              he Knew in Prison is Charged With the Crimes\n\n                          (By Stephanie Hanes)\n\n       The same DNA evidence that freed Kirk Bloodsworth from \n     prison 10 years ago has now implicated another man in the \n     1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton of Rosedale, \n     quashing any lingering questions about Bloodsworth's \n     involvement in the crime.\n       Kimberly Shay Ruffner, a 45-year-old convicted sex offender \n     who went to prison for an attempted rape and attempted murder \n     in Fells Point only weeks after Dawn Hamilton was killed, was \n     charged yesterday with first-degree murder.\n       The Baltimore County state's attorney's office--which has \n     never publicly acknowledged Bloodsworth's innocence--\n     announced the development, and a prosecutor apologized to \n     Bloodsworth in person.\n       ``Even though I was cleared, there were so many people who \n     didn't believe me,'' said Bloodsworth, 42, who was reached at \n     his home in Cambridge. ``This is the proof everyone needs.''\n       Ruffner is still in prison for the Fells Point attack, with \n     a release date of 2020. Baltimore County State's Attorney \n     Sandra A. O'Connor said prosecutors will seek the death \n     penalty in Dawn's killing.\n       ``This was a horrendous rape-murder of a 9-year-old girl,'' \n     O'Connor said. ``Whether or not he is incarcerated, he will \n     be held accountable.''\n       While Bloodsworth's supporters said they were delighted \n     with the outcome, they criticized Baltimore County law \n     enforcement officials for not testing the DNA earlier.\n       In June, The Sun wrote that the DNA in Bloodsworth's case \n     had not been compared to the state's DNA database of \n     convicted felons. As a convicted sex offender, Ruffner's DNA \n     would have been in the state's database as early as 1994.\n       Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said the \n     comparison was made last month.\n       ``I can't tell you how pleased I am for Kirk,but what \n     happened here today should have happened earlier,'' said \n     Barry C. Scheck, the co-founder of the New York-based \n     Innocence Project, which tries to free the wrongly \n     convicted.\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\n                            delay in testing\n\n       Scheck, who helped exonerate Bloodsworth, said he has been \n     asking for this sort of testing for years. It was after \n     Scheck's most recent letter to the Baltimore County State's \n     Attorney's Office that police and prosecutors started moving \n     toward testing the DNA against the database, The Sun reported \n     in June.\n       Yesterday morning, Assistant State's Attorney S. Ann \n     Brobst, who prosecuted Bloodsworth and who had been \n     criticized by his supporters for refusing to admit his \n     innocence, went to Bloodsworth's home to tell him the news.\n       ``She apologized up and down,'' Bloodsworth said yesterday. \n     ``She had to eat a lot of crow to come. You've got to give \n     her something for it.''\n       O'Connor said Dawn's father, Thomas Hamilton, was also told \n     of the new arrest. He was unavailable for comment.\n\n\n                          death row, then life\n\n       Bloodsworth was convicted of Dawn's murder in 1985 and sent \n     to death row. Multiple witnesses had testified that they saw \n     him near the crime scene.\n       The next year, the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned his \n     conviction. But when Bloodsworth was retried, he was again \n     found guilty and this time sentenced to life in prison.\n       In 1992, prosecutors agreed to run DNA tests on a semen \n     stain found on Dawn's underwear--a stain that law enforcement \n     officials said they had not noticed earlier. Those tests \n     showed that Bloodsworth was not the person who had sexually \n     assaulted the little girl.\n       Prosecutors agreed to release Bloodsworth immediately but \n     would not apologize or say he was innocent.\n       ``I believe that he is not guilty,'' O'Connor said at the \n     time. ``I'm not prepared to say he's innocent. Only the \n     people who were there know what happened.''\n\n\n                            Lingering doubts\n\n       Bloodsworth was pardoned by former Gov. William Donald \n     Schaefer and given $300,000 from the state. But life after \n     prison was a struggle, one that he now talks about openly.\n       At first, he had trouble holding jobs and grappled with \n     freedom after nine years behind bars. He heard the derogatory \n     whispers and saw the dirty looks. He once wiped the scrawled \n     words ``Child Killer'' off his car.\n       ``He has confided to me many, many times that people echo \n     what Ann Brobst kept saying: (The DNA) doesn't mean he's \n     innocent,'' Scheck said.\n       In recent years, Bloodsworth married and started working as \n     a consultant for the Justice Project, a Washington advocacy \n     group for justice reform. He has testified for lawmakers and \n     spoken in classrooms across the country about the importance \n     of DNA evidence.\n       In his own case, he said he has pushed for years for county \n     law enforcement to run the preserved DNA evidence through the \n     state's database.\n       A month after Dawn Hamilton was killed, Kimberly Ruffner \n     was arrested for the Fells Point attack.\n       He had broken into a woman's house Aug. 28, 1984, and had \n     tried to rape her, police said. When she struggled, he tried \n     to kill her with a pair of scissors. The woman managed to \n     escape, and police found Ruffner hours later.\n       He was tried and convicted of breaking and entering, \n     assault with intent to murder and attempted rape, said Mark \n     Vernarelli, spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public \n     Safety and Correctional Services. He was sentenced to 45 \n     years in prison.\n       According to court records, Ruffner had been charged with \n     two other sex offenses in 1983.\n       In the Maryland Correctional Institution at Jessup, Ruffner \n     slept on the tier below Bloodsworth in the same building.\n       The two men lifted weights together, and Bloodsworth, who \n     worked in the prison library, would give him books, \n     Bloodsworth said. They both had red hair. But Bloodsworth \n     said they were nothing more than acquaintances.\n       Not once, Bloodsworth said, did Ruffner indicate that he \n     was responsible for Dawn's murder.\n       ``It's spooky,'' Bloodsworth said. ``The whole time he was \n     there. I just can't get over it.''\n\n\n                             case timeline\n\n       July 1984--The body of 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton is found in \n     a wooded area near the Fontana Village apartments in \n     Rosedale, Baltimore County.\n       August 1984--Police arrest and charge Kirk Noble \n     Bloodsworth, a former waterman from Cambridge, in Dawn \n     Hamilton's death.\n       Also, Kimberly Shay Ruffner is arrested on charges of \n     breaking and entering, assault with intent to murder and \n     attempted rape after attacking a Fells Point woman with a \n     pair of scissors.\n       March 1985--A jury convicts Bloodsworth of Dawn Hamilton's \n     murder.

Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncongratulate Saints Peter and Paul Church for 155 years of dedication \nand service to the Detroit community. On September 24, 2003, people \nwill be gathering in my hometown of Detroit, MI to celebrate this \nimportant achievement. I am also pleased that Michigan's First \nGentleman, Dan Mulhern, husband of Governor Jennifer Granholm, will \nshare in the celebration of Saints Peter and Paul's anniversary.\n  Completed and dedicated on June 29, 1848, Saints Peter and Paul \nChurch was originally built as the cathedral for the Catholic Church in \nDetroit. It is the oldest church building in continuous use in the \ncity. In 1877, Saints Peter and Paul Church was given to the Jesuits to \nbe used as a local center for Jesuit ministry and a church for the \nUniversity of Detroit, then named Detroit College. Toward the end of \nthe 19th century, working class people, many of them recent immigrants, \nbecame a large part of the parish population. As a result, Saints Peter \nand Paul Church refocused its ministry in response to the changing \nneeds of its congregation.\n  After World War I, the prosperity of the church declined because its \nneighborhood became more commercial and industrial. In spite of a \ndiminished congregation, loyal community members remained intent on a \npreserving Saints Peter and Paul Church as a place of worship. A sharp \nincrease in homelessness in the area toward the end of the 20th century \nstrengthened the church's dedication to members of the community in \nneed.\n  Today, Saints Peter and Paul Church remains committed to serving \nurban Detroit. One of its most important outreach programs is the \nWarming Center, which serves nearly 100 guests a day. Most of the \nvisitors are people in need. The Warming Center offers its guests a \nsafe haven, a warm meal, hospitality, and an opportunity to engage in \nmutual reflection and sharing. The center also offers free use of a \ntelephone, laundry facilities, a shower, and clothing.\n  I take great pride in recognizing the commitment of Saints Peter and \nPaul Church to Detroit throughout its 155-year history. The church \nattends to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the Detroit \ncommunity. I know my Senate colleagues join me in saluting the ministry \nof Saints Peter and Paul Church and in wishing the church continued \nsupport and success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11752-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11752-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11752-S11753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11752-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11752-S11753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11753-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO WAIVING THE SUSPENSIONS UNDER SECTION 920(A) OF THE \nFOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATIONS ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1990 AND 1991, WITH \n     RESPECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF LICENSES FOR QSR 11 SENSORS--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of \nthe Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 \n(Public Law 101-246) (the ``Act''), and as President of the United \nStates, I hereby report to the Congress that it is in the national \ninterest of the United States to waive the suspensions under section \n902(a) of the Act with respect to the issuance of licenses for QSR-11 \nsensors that serve as components of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) \nused in commercial aircraft and spare IMU for such aircraft.

A bill to amend title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto increase teacher familiarity with the educational needs of gifted \nand talented students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to help \nprepare new teachers to recognize and meet the needs of gifted and \ntalented students. As many of my colleagues are aware, I have been \nworking for some time to advance a comprehensive approach aimed at \nimproving access to gifted and talented educational services in every \nState. My proposal has been introduced in this Congress as S. 501. \nWhile I will continue to work to enact this needed legislation, the \nbill I am introducing today addresses the different but related need to \nraise awareness among all teachers about the unique educational needs \nof gifted and talented students.\n  Unfortunately, many misconceptions persist about the needs of gifted \nchildren in both the educational community and in public policy \ncircles. There is often a tendency to think of gifted kids as those \nkids who will succeed with or without help. This is simply not the case \nand reflects a misunderstanding of giftedness. What makes a child \ngifted and talented is not how well the child does in school, but how \nhe or she learns. A student may get straight A's and not be a gifted \nlearner, while a gifted and talented student might do poorly on his or \nher schoolwork. Gifted and talented children actually have a different \nway of looking at the world. They tend to have distinct approaches to \nlearning and interacting socially, and they frequently learn at a \ndifferent pace, and to different depths, than others their age. The \nbottom line is that gifted and talented children have unique learning \nneeds that need to be met in order for them to succeed in school.\n  Earlier this year, when I re-introduced my bill to expand the \navailability of gifted education services, I told the Senate about a \nthird grade student from Iowa City names Jose. I would like to remind \nthe Senate about Jose's experience because I think it illustrates some \nimportant points about gifted students and their needs. Jose wasn't \ncompleting his assignments and his grades were suffering. He had \ntrouble paying attention and would act up in class. He got along with \nhis classmates, but didn't have much social interaction with others. \nJose's teacher tried to get him to pay attention and do his work like \nthe other kids, but was left frustrated. Still, Jose's parents \nrecognized in him a real hunger for learning and had his IQ tested over \nthe summer. It turns out that, while Jose's teacher saw him as a \nproblem student, the problems she noticed were really symptoms of a \ngifted student who was bored because he was not being properly \nchallenged. Jose now leaves his regular classroom a couple of times a \nweek for what Iowa City schools call the ``extended learning program.'' \nAs a result of the added stimulation he now receives, Jose enjoys \nschool more, has made friends\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\nwith his gifted peers, and is doing great with his regular school work.\n  Jose's experience is more than just a success story showing how \nquality gifted education services can make a real difference for a \nchild. It also illustrates that gifted students have real needs that \ncan all too easily go unrecognized and unmet. Moreover, Jose' \nexperience highlights the need for teachers to understand the \ncharacteristics of gifted kids. In Jose's case, he had parents who were \nable to recognize his gifts and have him assessed privately. Jose's \nparents were then able to take these findings to the gifted education \nteacher at Jose's school and have him identified to receive gifted \neducation services. Had his former teacher been able to recognize the \nindications of giftedness, she could have referred him for services \nearlier and she would have been better able to help him succeed in the \nregular classroom.\n\n  I would like to cite another real-life example; this time of a 12-\nyear-old girl from Shenandoah, IA named Leah. Leah has two parents with \na high school education who work hard to provide for her, but they \ndon't have much discretionary income. Her parents want her to be \nsuccessful, but they rely on the public school system to meet her \neducational needs. Leah came to school able to read, but was a very \nquiet child so no one noticed anything exceptional about her. A year \nlater, the first grade teacher caught Leah reading in the coat closet \nand realized that she could read exceptionally well. Leah's teacher \nreferred her to the gifted and talented teacher and she has thrived in \nthe gifted and talented program ever since. Leah's experiences have \nbeen limited by her circumstances. She lives in a small town in rural \nsouth-west Iowa and has not traveled farther than Des Moines or Omaha. \nLeah hasn't grown up with every advantage, yet she is lucky to have had \nan astute classroom teacher who recognized her abilities. Leah now has \naccess to a quality gifted education program of services that includes \na specially trained teacher available to help Leah develop her gifts.\n  While Leah is another success story, it is easy to see the important \nrole that teachers played in her experience. It is important to \nremember that gifted and talented students come from all backgrounds \nand can be found in any community. A gifted student could be the child \nof a single mom working three jobs, the child of recent immigrants, or \na foster child. I've even heard stories of a gifted child in Iowa who \nmissed school because her parents had her begging for money on the \nstreets. Not all gifted children have parents who are equipped to \nrecognize their child's gifts or have the resources and ability to see \nthat their child gets the services he or she needs to be successful. \nThat is why it is so important that classroom teachers have some \nunderstanding of how to identify gifted kids and how to meet their \nneeds while they are in the regular classroom. It is impossible to know \nhow many gifted students are overlooked because their teachers do not \nknow how to recognize the signs of giftedness or are unprepared to deal \nwith the unique needs that gifted kids have. While Iowa requires school \ndistricts to provide gifted and talented services, a great many school \ndistricts in many States have little or no programs for gifted kids. \nMoreover, according to the federally funded National Research Center on \nthe Gifted and Talented, the large majority of gifted and talented \nstudents spend at least 80 percent of their time in a regular education \nclassroom. As a result, it is vital that all teachers have at least \nbasic knowledge and skills to address gifted students' learning needs. \nHowever, a national survey of third and fourth grade teachers by the \nNational Research Center on the Gifted and Talented found that 61 \npercent had no training whatsoever in teaching highly able students.\n  Ultimately, all teachers should have at least some exposure to the \ncharacteristics of gifted and talented students and strategies to \naddress their needs. Yet, only one State currently requires regular \nclassroom teachers to have coursework in gifted education. Some of the \ntechniques used in classrooms to accommodate gifted kids include \ndifferentiated curriculum, cluster grouping, and accelerated learning. \nThe time to make sure teachers have the necessary knowledge is when \nprospective teachers are in their pre-service training programs. If \nteachers aren't exposed to information about the needs of gifted \nstudents in their pre-service training, they may never acquire the \nnecessary knowledge. Title II of the Higher Education Act already \ncontains grants designed to enhance the quality of teacher preparation \nprograms. My bill would simply add allowable uses to these existing \ngrants to provide an incentive for States and teacher training programs \nto incorporate the needs of gifted and talented students into teacher \npreparation and licensure requirements.\n  Under current law, Title II State grants are awarded directly to \nStates and are to be used to reform State teacher preparation \nrequirements. The law lists seven potential reforms under the allowable \nuses for grant funds. The first three allowable uses include: \nstrengthening State requirements for teacher preparation programs to \nensure teachers are highly competent in their respective academic \ncontent areas, reforming certification and licensure requirements with \nrespect to competency in content areas, and providing alternatives to \ntraditional teacher preparation programs. My legislation would add \nanother allowable use, referencing these three reforms, to encourage \nStates to incorporate a focus on the learning needs of gifted ant \ntalented students into reforms of State requirements for teacher \npreparation programs, reforms of State certification and licensure \nrequirements, or new alternative teacher preparation programs. In \naddition, my bill would add a new allowable use so that States could \nuse grant funds to create or expand new-teacher mentoring programs on \nthe needs of gifted and talented students. This way, new teachers could \nlearn from veteran teachers about how to identify classroom indicators \nof giftedness and provide appropriate instruction to gifted students.\n  My bill would also add language to the Partnership Grants, which \nprovide funds to partnerships among teacher preparation institutions, \nschool of arts and sciences, and high-need school districts to \nstrengthen new teacher education. These grants come with three required \nuses, including reforming teacher preparation programs to ensure \nteachers are highly competent in academic content areas, providing pre-\nservice clinical experience, and creating opportunities for enhanced \nand ongoing professional development. One allowable use for which a \npartnership may use funds is preparing teachers to work with diverse \npopulations, including individuals with disabilities and limited \nEnglish proficient individuals. To this section, my legislation would \nadd gifted and talented students. Recognizing that every teacher will \nhave gifted students in his or her classroom, my bill would also add a \nnew allowable use so that teacher preparation programs could use the \nfunds to infuse teacher coursework with units on the characteristics of \nhigh-ability learners. In other words, the idea is not to require \nadditional courses, but rather to discuss how to accommodate for the \nneeds of gifted students throughout the teacher preparation curriculum \nwhen new teachers are learning how to present lessons.\n  My bill does not create a new grant program or require new funds. It \nsimply provides an incentive through existing grant programs that will \nencourage States and teacher preparation programs to improve the \nknowledge of new teachers about the unique needs of gifted and talented \nstudents. New teachers will encounter gifted and talented students. It \nis important they know how to recognize them and how to help them \nsucceed. As we have seen with Jose and Leah, having a teacher that \nunderstands a child's needs can make a huge difference. In fact, it can \nmean the difference between a child hating school and a child loving \nschool; a child falling behind, and a child succeeding beyond all \nexpectations. When a gifted child is left behind, the loss of human \npotential is tragic. We may not know what we are missing, but it is \nmore than we can afford to lose. The legislation I have proposed today \nis a relatively modest step that could have a tremendous impact. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, during the 103rd Congress in 1994, the \nPetroleum Marketing Practices Act, PMPA, was amended to protect \nindependent petroleum wholesalers and retailers from arbitrary and \nunfair termination or non-renewal of their franchise relationships with \nmajor oil companies.\n  However, this protection was provided only to motor and diesel fuel \nfranchisees.\n  Franchisees of other petroleum products sold by the major oil \ncompanies lack similar protection.\n  Today, I rise with Senators Burns and Ensign to introduce a bill that \nextends the same protections enjoyed by the motor fuel industry to the \nlubricant industry.\n  I have heard from a constituent in Nevada that his franchise \nagreement to sell lubricating oils to car dealers in Las Vegas was \narbitrarily canceled with 30 days notice.\n  In essence, he had thirty days to convert all of his customers to a \nnew brand.\n  This seems grossly unfair and, in fact, if the product sold by my \nconstituent were gasoline or diesel fuel rather than lubricating oil, \nit would have been illegal.\n  I have been made aware of similar terminations or non-renewals in \nother States.\n  Without equal protection under the law, lubricant franchisees are \nvulnerable to predatory cancellation by their suppliers. This situation \nis exacerbated by recent mergers and acquisitions in the petroleum \nindustry.\n  The merger of oil giants Chevron and Texaco and Shell Oil's recent \nacquisition of Penzoil-Quaker State will undoubtedly result in the \ntermination of many independent lubricant franchisees.\n  In New Mexico, there was a lubricant franchisee who had been \npromoting and distributing a branded lubricant to his customers for \nover 30 years, only to be canceled with 30 days notice following a \nmerger of refiners.\n  This unfair practice stifles competition in the marketplace and \ninvariably results in raising the price of the product, which hurts \nAmerican consumers and small businesses.\n  This is especially troublesome in rural areas.\n  Given the increasingly anti-competitive nature of the petroleum \nindustry, the time has come to extend protections under current law for \nmotor fuel marketers to include lubricant franchisees.\n  There are approximately 3,500 independent distributors and nearly \n25,000 commercial retail lube oil outlets that could be impacted by the \nincreasing frequency of lubricant franchise cancellations.\n  Refiners have not suffered by complying with PMPA in motor fuels.\n  Consequently, it is hard to believe it would be much of an imposition \nto include the much smaller segment of lubricant franchisees.\n  I introduce this bill today because it protects small businesses, \nbenefits consumers and ensures fair competition in the marketplace.\n  In short, this bill is the right thing to do and I hope my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROTECTION OF FRANCHISED DISTRIBUTORS OF \n                   LUBRICATING OIL.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 101 of the Petroleum Marketing \n     Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 2801) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(B)--\n       (A) in clause (ii)(II), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (iv); and\n       (C) by inserting after clause (ii) the following:\n       ``(iii) any contract under which a refiner authorizes or \n     permits a distributor to use, in connection with the sale, \n     consignment, or distribution of lubricating oil, a trademark \n     that is owned or controlled by the refiner; and'';\n       (2) in paragraphs (2), (5), and (6), by inserting ``or \n     lubricating oil'' after ``motor fuel'' each place it appears;\n       (3) by striking paragraphs (3) and (4) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Franchisee.--The term `franchisee' means--\n       ``(A) a retailer or distributor that is authorized or \n     permitted, under a franchise, to use a trademark in \n     connection with the sale, consignment, or distribution of \n     motor fuel; or\n       ``(B) a distributor that is authorized or permitted, under \n     a franchise, to use a trademark in connection with the sale, \n     consignment, or distribution of lubricating oil.\n       ``(4) Franchisor.--The term `franchisor' means--\n       ``(A) a refiner or distributor that authorizes or permits, \n     under a franchise, a retailer or distributor to use a \n     trademark in connection with the sale, consignment, or \n     distribution of motor fuel; or\n       ``(B) a refiner that authorizes or permits, under a \n     franchise, a distributor to use a trademark in connection \n     with the sale, consignment, or distribution of motor fuel.''; \n     and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(20) Lubricating oil.--The term `lubricating oil' means \n     any grade of paraffinic or naphthenic lubricating oil stock \n     that is refined from crude oil or synthetic lubricants.''.\n       (b) Protection of Franchised Distributors of Lubricating \n     Oil.--Section 102(b)(2) of the Petroleum Marketing Practices \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 2802(b)(2)) is amended by inserting after \n     subparagraph (E) the following:\n       ``(F) Franchised distributors of lubricating oil.--In the \n     case of a franchise between a refiner or a distributor for \n     the sale, distribution, or consignment of trademarked \n     lubricating oil, a determination made by the franchisor in \n     good faith and in the normal course of business to withdraw \n     from the marketing of the lubricating oil in the relevant \n     geographic market in which the franchised lubricating oil is \n     distributed, if--\n       ``(i) the determination is made--\n\n       ``(I) after the date on which the franchise is entered into \n     or renewed; and\n       ``(II) on the basis of a change in relevant facts or \n     circumstances relating to the franchise that occurs after the \n     date specified in subclause (I); and\n\n       ``(ii) the termination or nonrenewal is not for the purpose \n     of converting any accounts subject to the franchise to the \n     account of the franchisor.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bond, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1640. A bill to provide an extension of highway programs funded \nout of the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment of a law reauthorizing \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President. I am introducing today the Transportation \nExtension Act of 2003 which will extend the expiring Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century an additional 5 months. Senators, \nJeffords, Bond, Warner, Voinovich, Crapo, Chafee, Cornyn, Murkowski, \nThomas, and Allard join me as original cosponsors on this short-term \nextension.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, we are now 7 days from the expiration \nof TEA-21. Despite the best efforts of Senator Bond and myself, we have \nbeen unable to secure the necessary floor time for consideration of a \ncomprehensive 6-year bill.\n  This bill provide 5 months worth of the $35.5 billion allowed under \nthe Budget Resolution and a corresponding amount of obligation \nlimitation. This is a significant, 7-percent increase in highway \nfunding over 2003, which will translate into over 100,000 new jobs.\n  Of course, the best thing we can do to create economic opportunity is \nenact a comprehensive, 6-year reauthorization. As we all know, highway \nbills are jobs bills. A highway bill drafted at $255 billion over 6 \nyears as proposed by the Environment and Public Works Committee will \ncreate about two million new American jobs. This combined with the tax \ncuts signed by President Bush is the best stimulus the economy can \nreceive.\n  Let me be very clear that my preference is that we would be \ncompleting a 6-year comprehensive bill, not working on a five-month \nextension, but reality is that the funding needed to do a comprehensive \n6-year bill at $255 billion has not yet been identified. Because of \nthat, I believe the best outcome for the long term program is to do a \n5-month extension and continue to work on a comprehensive 6-year bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to make some brief remarks about \nthe extension of the Transportation Equity Act, often referred to as \nTEA-21.\n  Chairman Inhofe and I, along with subcommittee Chairman Bond and \nranking member Harry Reid, have been working together on drafting a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan 6-year transportation reauthorization bill. \nUnfortunately, that reauthorization effort will not be completed before \nTEA-21 expires on September 30.\n  Thus, as with the previous reauthorization of ISTEA by TEA-21, we \nwill need to do a short extension of TEA-21. In the interest of time, \nand to avoid any concerns about potential disruptions, we have used \nmajor portions of the same short-extension language used for ISTEA in \n1997 for this extension.\n  It is important that I clarify some aspects of this short extension \nwith the chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe.\n  The purpose of this short extension is to continue the Federal \nsurface transportation programs and transportation investment patterns. \nFor that reason, we have provided considerable short-term spending \nflexibility to the States.\n  However, in a longer term extension, if any were needed, we should be \nconsistent with Congressional goals set forth in TEA-21. Thus, I want \nto ensure that if there is a need for another extension we more closely \nadhere to the flexibility provisions set forth in TEA-21. This would \nrequire, for example, changes to the text used in this short-term \nextension regarding section 133(d).\n  In a short-term extension there is little risk that investment \npatterns would be altered in a manner inconsistent with TEA-21 and thus \nthe proposed language is acceptable for the short term.\n  Senator Inhofe do you agree with my understanding that the bipartisan \nextension we have proposed works well in the short term but would \nrequire some modification to its flexibility provisions if it were to \napply for a longer period of time? In addition, will you agree to work \nwith me to make changes to the language if we have to do another \nextension to address the concerns I have raised?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I will work with the Senator on his concerns if we \nhave to do a longer term extension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/22/senate-section/article/S11757-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11757-S11758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 70--SUPPORTING NATIONAL FUNERAL SERVICE \n                             EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. Wyden (for himself and Mr. DeWine) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.
