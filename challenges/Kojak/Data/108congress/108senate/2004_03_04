Mr. President, later this week, President Bush will host \nMexican President Vicente Fox for 2 days of meetings in Texas.\n  Three years ago, in the months after President Fox's historic \nelection ended seven decades of one-party rule, we were all very \nhopeful that the United States and Mexico were prepared to move beyond \ndecades of mistrust and miscommunication.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, the Bush administration chose to relegate \nimproved relations with our neighbor to the bottom of its priority \nlist, unfortunately.\n  The meeting this week represents a long overdue but welcome step \ntoward regaining the lost momentum in United States-Mexico relations.\n  I hope the President will use the renewed public focus on Mexico this \nweek not just for a photo opportunity but also to revive the \nadministration's efforts to address many of the pressing challenges \nthroughout this hemisphere.\n  The need for such a revival is clear. Early last month Secretary \nPowell told a House committee that the United States ``had higher \npriorities'' than Latin America. The fact that the United States has \nimportant priorities in the rest of the world is indisputable.\n  Hundreds of thousands of our young men and women are deployed \nthroughout the Middle East. North Korea is adding to its nuclear \ncapability, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \npresents us with a chilling specter that terrorist groups could get \ntheir hands on the world's worst weapons.\n  But the sad truth is that we do not have the luxury of worrying only \nabout the crises of the day. If we fail to attend to emerging threats \ntoday, they will quickly become tomorrow's crises. Rather than relying \non diplomatic means, we will be forced into a situation so dire that \nonly the deployment of U.S. troops--already stretched far too thinly--\ncan stabilize the situation. For an example of this phenomenon, we need \nlook no further than recent events in our own hemisphere.\n  Statements from administration officials leave the impression that \nthe administration was caught off guard and unprepared to respond to \nthe evolving crisis in Haiti, just 600 miles off the coast of Florida.\n  On February 17, Secretary Powell had this to say about Haiti:\n\n       We cannot buy into a proposition that says the elected \n     president must be forced out of office by thugs and those who \n     do not respect law.\n\n  But just over a week later, the White House released a statement that \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\n\n       This long-simmering crisis is largely Mr. Aristide's \n     making. . . . We urge him to examine his position carefully, \n     to accept responsibility, and to act in the best interests of \n     the people of Haiti.\n\n  The administration's initial lack of attention and subsequent \nresponse left us with no policy levers to pull and no Haitian \ninstitutions to call upon to quell the crisis. In that situation--faced \nwith violence and instability that threatened to lead to a refugee \ncrisis--we deployed American Marines.\n\n  Emerging crises in the rest of the hemisphere are potentially as \ndire, but the administration still appears no more engaged.\n  Take, for example, Venezuela. Political turmoil and mismanagement \nhave had a serious and adverse impact on economic growth in that \ncountry. In 2003, real GDP shrank by nearly 10 percent--after \ncontracting 9 percent the year before--and inflation was the region's \nhighest at 27.1 percent. All of this in a country that has the largest \noil reserves outside the Middle East--providing the United States 14 \npercent of its oil--and increasingly sizable natural gas stores.\n  Moreover, slow economic growth may be the least of Venezuela's \nproblems. The country is caught in a political crisis over a recall \nreferendum that could bring the Chavez government to an abrupt end.\n  The situation was exacerbated by clear missteps on the part of the \nadministration in April of 2002, when the administration overturned \ndecades of American policy in the hemisphere by seeming to endorse, \nhowever briefly, an unconstitutional change of government. Former \nPresident Carter has done us proud by stepping in to pick up the pieces \nin order to ensure that the problems of this democracy can be resolved \ndemocratically.\n  But with deepening polarization and new developments in Venezuela \neach day, there is no substitute for official American leadership in \npushing for the respect of democratic institutions over personalities \nand power.\n  As in Haiti, if we wait for others to take the lead in Venezuela, we \nwill have waited too long.\n  There are other emerging threats to stability and democracy in the \nregion--from Peru to Bolivia to Argentina. Economic growth is down, \npoverty and drug trafficking are increasing, and corruption is rampant.\n  Perhaps most alarming are observations from recent public surveys \nthat anti-Americanism is approaching all-time highs while respect for \ndemocracy is reaching an all-time low.\n  Such a precarious time demands engagement and leadership from \nAmerica. Instead, the administration has decided to limit American \ninvestments in the region this year, arguing, as I noted, that we have \nother priorities.\n  As one leading expert pointed out:\n\n       Relations between the United States and Latin America have \n     acquired a rawness and a level of indecorum that recall \n     previous eras of inter-America strain and discord.\n\n  It is not too late, and I hope the meeting tomorrow in Texas marks \nthe administration's renewed interest in the hemisphere. If it does, we \nare prepared to work with the President and our friends in Mexico and \nin Argentina and in Venezuela and in Peru and in Bolivia, and in \nColombia to build the institutions needed for peace, prosperity, and \nstability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, it is now more than a month since I ended my quest for \nthe Democratic nomination for President. It was a thrilling, demanding, \npurposive journey across this great country. I am deeply grateful for \nthe opportunity I had. I learned a lot. In fact, I would recommend \nanyone who has the opportunity try it at least once in a lifetime. But \ntoday I want to share with my colleagues a few serious reflections from \nmy campaign experience about the current state of our politics and the \nway they may affect our work here in this election year on the great \nquestions of our economy and our security, particularly in Iraq.\n  It is now clear who the Presidential nominees of the major parties \nwill be: President Bush and Senator Kerry. Therefore, it is time for \nmembers of both parties to start thinking and talking about how we want \nthe national campaign to be conducted at this uniquely difficult and \ndangerous moment in American history.\n  For the United States, this is a very good time, but it is also a \nvery difficult time. We have the largest economy and the strongest \nmilitary in the world. Our core values of freedom and opportunity are \nascendent around the globe. In so many ways here at home we live better \nthan any people ever have because of the truly amazing advances in \nmedical science, telecommunications, information technology, and \ntransportation. However, these advances and the globalization they have \nfacilitated have also brought painful changes for millions of Americans \nin lost jobs, declining income, skyrocketing health care costs, and a \nfear of what the future may bring.\n\n  On top of that, we face an unprecedented new challenge to our \nsecurity and our freedom from fanatical Islamic terrorists who brutally \nattacked us and our homeland on September 11, 2001.\n  These two new realities have made the American people more anxious \nabout their future, as I met them during this last year, than I have \never seen them before. Our confidence and our optimism must be \nrestored. How best to do that and who can best do that is ultimately \nwhat this year's Presidential campaign is all about. Ideally, the \ncampaign will raise our hopes, not deepen our insecurities; it will \nunite us, not divide us; it will strengthen us, not weaken us; it will \ncreate an environment in which our Government, including this Congress, \nwill produce relief for some of what ails America, hopefully this year. \nBut I can't say I am optimistic that any of these ideals will be \nachieved because of the rigid and reflexive partisanship that has come \nto dominate so much of our politics.\n  Warnings about factionalism are, of course, as old as our Republic, \nbut they seem especially relevant and necessary today, when strategists \nfrom both major parties seem poised to seek electoral victory by \ninflaming their inner constituencies with ideological tinder and brutal \npersonal attacks on the other party's candidates. That will only divide \nus more deeply and make it more difficult for us to overcome the \nenormous threats to our security and our prosperity.\n  Our political parties and Presidential candidates must find ways to \ndiffer without being destructive, to debate\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nwithout demonizing, to put our national interests ahead of special \ninterests, to take the long view rather than the most politically \nexpedient short view, to rise above partisan politics, to put America \nfirst.\n  I know the conventional wisdom is that in an election year, the \nbreakthrough in our politics and Government I am calling for is \nunlikely to occur. But I also know there have been many times in our \nhistory when the proximity of an election has induced exactly the kind \nof leadership and consensus building that produce progress in our \ndemocracy. Congress passed and previous Presidents signed the Federal \nHighway Aid Act in 1956, the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Act in 1972, and welfare reform in 1996. These \nwere all landmark pieces of legislation that required and received \nbipartisan cooperation in an election year.\n  Let us hope we can produce similar progress this year. Let us work \ntogether to lower the crushing price of health care, to develop and \nimplement a plan to stop the bleeding of American manufacturing and \nservice jobs, to restore fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, \nto reduce the growing number of poor people in our country, to address \nthe real threat of global warming, and to reassure the American people \nthat we understand their anger at the contemporary culture which too \noften undercuts their traditional values of faith and family, of right \nand wrong. Let us hope we can work effectively toward those goals.\n  There is one area of challenge that demands more than hope, where we \nsimply cannot afford to allow campaign-year politics to take over until \nafter election day. That is the current crisis in Iraq.\n  We are at war. The lives of more than 100,000 American troops are on \nthe line in Iraq. So, too, is the fulcrum of our present and future \nnational security. Yes, there is violence and bloodshed, sadly, \nelsewhere in the world, but the impact Iraq will have on our future \nsecurity and our prospects for victory in the wider war against \nterrorism is of the greatest magnitude. It has no equal in the world \ntoday. Our politics must catch up with that reality.\n\n  I recognize the differences of opinion about why and how we went to \nwar in Iraq. I know they run deep and they run wide. As for myself, I \nremain a strong supporter of the war that removed Saddam Hussein. Yes, \nI have criticized the administration for some of its policies, both \nbefore and immediately after the war. But I believe deeply we cannot \nallow arguments about past policy to stop us from finding common ground \nto face the present threats in Iraq. We cannot refight the last war in \nIraq against Saddam with such ferocity that we falter in fighting the \nterrorist insurgents that threaten Iraq and us right now.\n  The days between now and our election day in November will be \ncritical days for Iraq, as sovereignty is returned to the Iraqi people \nand they prepare for what we hope will be their own historic election \nday in December. Unless the security situation in Iraq improves \ndramatically, that election day may not come. The fact is, as the \nnewspapers and media have told us in the last 2 days, there is danger \nin Iraq. One hundred and eighty-five people were killed on Tuesday by \nsuicide bombings. These are threats not just to the lives and security \nof the Iraqi people, but they present the staggering prospect of civil \nwar in Iraq. Together with the Iraqi people and our coalition partners, \nwe are going to need to make critical decisions and take strong, \ndifficult, tough actions in the upcoming weeks and months to maintain \nsecurity in that country.\n  To do so, we here at home must transcend the partisan reflex rancor \nthat has become the norm in American politics.\n  The consequences of failure in Iraq are staggering. The fact that the \nbattle has been joined in Iraq--the historic battle between security \nand terror, between freedom and tyranny.\n  Iraq is a critical battleground now in our larger war against \nterrorism because the fact is that members of the same Jihadist \nmovements that killed nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, are \nnow fighting alongside Saddam loyalists, systematically targeting and \nmurdering Americans and Iraqis for working so hard to build a secure, \nnew civil society in that country.\n  If we fail to stop these insurgents and lose the peace in Iraq, the \nIraqi people will be condemned to chaos and relentless violence. The \nMiddle East will be destabilized. The forces of worldwide terrorism \nwill gain new confidence, energy, and resources to attack us.\n  On the other hand, establishing a stable democratizing, modernizing \nIraq would be a major victory in our battle with the terrorists and our \nstruggle to bring hope to the majority of Muslims in the world, who \nclearly desire peace, not war. It will show them a better way to a \nbetter future than the hatred and death that the fanatics of al-Qaida \nand their ilk preach. It will bring about much greater stability and \nopportunity throughout the Middle East.\n  In the weeks ahead, I intend to speak in more detail about how \ntogether we can accomplish these critical American goals. But for \ntoday, I want to concentrate on how best we can separate the challenges \nto us in Iraq from this Presidential campaign.\n  There are significant differences of opinion, clearly, between the \nPresidential candidates, President Bush and Senator Kerry, about our \npast policies in Iraq. But I don't see significant differences between \nthem about the need to successfully finish what we have started there. \nBoth have asserted that we must not cut and run from Iraq. We cannot \nallow the politics of this campaign to obscure or block that agreement, \nthat commitment to finish our mission.\n  We must recapture the spirit of bipartisanship and national purpose \nwe achieved following the September 11 attacks. It is that important. \nFor Democrats, that doesn't mean that all debate about the war must \nstop. But I believe it does mean we must focus on how best to win the \nwar we are engaged in now against terrorist insurgents. Only \nquestioning how and why we got into the last war against Saddam is \nsimply not enough. Doing only that is not acceptable anymore.\n  For the President, his party, it means not politicizing the conduct \nof the war in any way. As Commander in Chief, the President has a \nspecial responsibility to focus on winning the war, even in this \nelection year--perhaps most particularly at this time.\n  In the months ahead, the President must make tough decisions \nnecessary to bring security to Iraq and a better life to Iraqis, \nregardless of the political consequences at home because that is what \nwill best serve America's values and security.\n  The fact is, both parties and our leaders must reach out to each \nother--difficult as that is in an election year, but it is necessary at \nthis moment--to find a common ground that will secure our common \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, it is reassuring to look back across American history \nand find that at some of our most difficult times our predecessors in \npositions of power in the American Government have made sure that \npartisan politics ended at our Nation's borders.\n\n  Following the Second World War, for example, leaders in Congress and \nthe White House forged a bipartisan foreign policy to combat communism. \nIt lasted half a century and brought us to victory in the cold war. \nDuring that time, the best of our elected officials no longer saw \nthemselves just as Democrats or Republicans. They saw themselves as \nAmericans fighting a common enemy.\n  Our times demand from us that same spirit of surpassing \nbipartisanship in the war against terrorism, for obviously the \nterrorists do not distinguish among us based on our party affiliations. \nEach of us is their enemy because we are all Americans, so we Democrats \nand Republicans must, therefore, in this campaign year, see beyond the \nred States and the blue States to a larger cause that is as critical to \nthe red, white, and blue as any America has ever fought for.\n  It is the cause of defeating Jihadist terrorists who hate us and our \nfree and tolerant ways of life more than they love life itself, and who \nwould, if we allow them, plunge this modern world into a primitive \nglobal religious war. For the sake of our children's futures, for the \nsake of America's core values, for the sake of world peace, we cannot \nallow that to happen.\n  I am a proud member of the Democratic Party and, as such, I will work \nfor a Democratic victory in the elections this fall. I know my \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\ncolleagues in this Chamber will work just as hard for a Republican \nvictory. But during this time of war, we each must make certain that \nour party loyalties do not prevail over our national responsibilities.\n  As important as a partisan victory is to each of us, it cannot be \nmore important than a victory over terrorism for all of us, a victory \nthat will enable the American people to feel secure again at home, that \nwill enable our soldiers to return from Iraq, that will enable the \nIraqi people to enjoy the blessings of liberty, which it is America's \nhistoric mission to advance and defend.\n  A final word. On November 2 of last year, PFC Anthony D'Agostino of \nWaterbury, CT, was killed in Iraq. A few weeks later, I received a note \nfrom Anthony's father, Steven. I read this paragraph from it:\n\n       Please continue to support all our men and women in \n     uniform. Please support our Commander in Chief in his resolve \n     to obtain his objectives. Please keep America the true leader \n     of peace in the world. Tony was our only son, our only \n     legacy. Although this was a great loss to our family, we wish \n     you godspeed in making the world a safer place.\n\n  The quiet, selfless strength and patriotism of the D'Agostino family \nhave been echoed for me in other voices I have met throughout America \nduring the last year. We must hear those voices through the sound and \nfury of the coming national campaign. We must assure them by our words \nand our deeds that we have our priorities right, that we will come \ntogether in this election year across party lines to protect their sons \nand daughters, to make certain that America will remain the true leader \nof peace and freedom in the world, and to achieve a better life for all \nof our people at home.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The armed rebellion, led by former \nmembers of the Haitian army, which I point out to colleagues was \ndisbanded by President Aristide in 1994, and members of the \nparamilitary rightwing group called FRAPH, made it impossible for the \nAristide government to maintain law and order.\n  Unfortunately, President Aristide had little choice but to leave \noffice, as the U.S. and international community made it very clear to \nhim they would do nothing to protect him from the armed thugs and \nconvicted murderers who had taken over most of the major cities in \nHaiti and terrorized and killed many people.\n  I point out to my colleagues that President Aristide's departure is \nhardly a voluntary decision to leave. I had several communications with \nPresident Aristide, high-ranking members of our administration, and \nother Members of Congress over the weekend.\n  On Monday, I had a very lengthy conversation with President Aristide, \nwho had called me from the Central African Republic. I was very \ndisturbed about reports that were circulating that he had been forcibly \nremoved from the President's palace, put on an aircraft, and flown out \nof Haiti. Some of this now has been talked about in terms of whether or \nnot he was at gunpoint or how was he forced out.\n  The administration is taking the position that he voluntarily \nresigned and got on the aircraft and they flew him out of the country. \nThere are others who are saying that perhaps he was forced out at \ngunpoint.\n  After my long conversation with President Aristide on Monday \nafternoon, I am convinced of at least three things. One, President \nAristide was not put in handcuffs. He was not marched at the end of a \nrifle and told to get on the airplane or they would shoot him. No, that \ndid not occur. So in that contextual framework he was not ``forced,'' \n``abducted,'' or ``kidnapped'' out of the country.\n  On the other hand, during the late afternoon of Saturday, after I had \nspoken with him, in the evening hours of that same Saturday, he was \ncontacted by our ambassador in Haiti who, according to Mr. Aristide, \ntold him he had basically three options: He could stay in Haiti and be \nkilled and thus precipitate a bloodshed that might cost thousands of \nlives because we would do nothing to protect him from the armed thugs \nand the killers; secondly, he could leave with bloodshed, that is, he \ncould leave after precipitating a crisis that might cost thousands of \nlives; or he could leave without bloodshed.\n  Confronted with those options, if a President such as Aristide, who \nis democratically elected, leaves, is that voluntary? As Congressman \nRangel said yesterday in a hearing: Under a threat to his life, Mr. \nAristide had little choice but to sign a resignation letter. I would \nhave signed one, too, Congressman Rangel said.\n  That is the essence of what happened. Our Government basically left \nMr. Aristide, a democratically elected President, with no options. \nEither leave with bloodshed or leave without bloodshed, but in either \ncase he was leaving.\n  As President Aristide told me, he had an obligation to the Haitian \npeople. He did not want to see bloodshed. He did not want to see \nthousands of innocent people killed. So, therefore, under that kind of \nduress he was forced to leave.\n  I was asked why the United States did not honor the Santiago treaty \nin 1991 signed by the United States, which clearly states that any \ngovernment democratically elected in the Western Hemisphere that seeks \nthe support of other Organization of American States member nations, \nwhen threatened with an overthrow, will be assisted? That agreement was \nsigned by the first President Bush in 1991.\n  I point out a couple of things. When President Aristide was first \nelected in 1990, he served for a total of about 8 months, from about \nJanuary through August of 1991, and then was overthrown by a military \ncoup.\n  What did the first President Bush administration do? Absolutely \nnothing. They let the military take over and throw out a democratically \nelected President, at the same time that the first President Bush was \nsigning the Santiago Resolution saying we would come to the assistance \nof a democratically elected government in our hemisphere if they were \nthreatened with an overthrow.\n\n  Then President Clinton came to office the following year and we \nrestored President Aristide to office. He had about 1 year left, \nbecause he agreed that the 3 years he spent in exile would count toward \nhis 5-year tenure. Under the Constitution of Haiti, a President cannot \nsucceed himself. Mr. Aristide agreed that he would abide by the \nconstitution.\n  So when he came back to Haiti, he served about 1 more year and then \nelections were held in 1995 and he did not run, of course, because the \nConstitution would not let him do so. During the year he was back in \nHaiti, he did one significant thing. He disbanded the Haitian Army, the \narmy that had been used for probably as much as 100 years to repress \nand suppress the people of Haiti. The Army had been used by one \ndictator after another to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the \nHaitian people.\n  After he had done that, he called me up. I remember that phone call \nvery well when President Aristide called and said he was soon to leave \noffice and had decided to disband the Haitian Army. I remember him \ntelling me he did it for a couple of reasons.\n  President Aristide told me that Haiti did not need a military. The \nmilitary had been used to repress the people. No one is going to invade \nus. He said they wanted to be like Costa Rica, that did not have an \narmy and they did not need one.\n  Secondly, he said the military in Haiti did nothing but repress \npeople. The military had been using up about half of the GDP of Haiti \nto pay for these military thugs.\n  Well, guess who is leading the insurgency against Aristide now? \nFormer leaders of the old Haitian military, many of whom had left the \ncountry, at least one of whom had been Chamblain. He had been convicted \nin absentia because he fled the country. He had been\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\nconvicted of at least two murders, one of Guy Malary, who was a Justice \nMinister assassinated on the steps of the justice building in broad \ndaylight by Mr. Chamblain and his thugs.\n  Mr. Chamblain, who was convicted in absentia of murder, is now one of \nthe rebel leaders in Haiti. Guy Philippe who we keep seeing on \ntelevision, is also a rebel leader. Amnesty International said he had \nturned a blind eye to many extrajudicial killings and murders committed \nby police under his command.\n  Well, I hope and trust that we do not support these people. I noticed \nin the hearing the other day in the House, Mr. Noriega, the Assistant \nSecretary of State for Western Hemisphere, said we did not support the \nviolent overthrow of that man, referring to Mr. Aristide.\n  Well, I am sorry, Mr. Noriega, you are wrong. The United States aided \nand abetted, in more ways than one, the overthrow of a democratically \nelected government. We need some investigations.\n  What happened to all of the arms that we sent to the Dominican \nRepublic in the last couple of years to patrol the border between the \nDominican Republic and Haiti for drug smuggling? Reports are coming out \nthat many of these arms we sent down there are now in Haiti in the \nhands of these killers and thugs: flack jackets, helmets, rifles, night \nvision goggles.\n  I don't know if it is true or not, but I am saying there are many \nreports that these arms we sent down there are in the hands of the \narmed insurgents, former members of the former Haitian military. How \ndid they get their hands on these arms?\n  As Richard Holbrooke, our former Ambassador to the United Nations, \nsaid on a Sunday morning talk show, these individuals have a long \nhistory of murder and terror when they were members of the Haitian \nmilitary. He said they have a long history of involvement with our \nintelligence services in the United States.\n  This needs to be investigated.\n  The New York Times today reported that the political crisis in Haiti \nis deepening. Prime Minister Neptune has declared a state of emergency \nand has suspended many of the rights to the Haitian people guaranteed \nby their constitution.\n  The Bush administration withdrew its support from the Aristide \ngovernment because it said it was a ``government of failed \nleadership.''\n  I guess we get to decide whether a democractically elected government \nis failing or not. And if we don't like them, we have the right to go \nahead and let armed thugs take over that government.\n  I tell you, the Bush administration has a lot to answer for, and will \nhave a lot to answer for because of what has happened and what is \nhappening in Haiti today.\n  President Aristide is gone, forced out of office, and the Bush \nadministration continues to sit on the sidelines and wring its hands \nwhile innocent people in Haiti continue to be killed.\n  I call on the administration to truly make a commitment to stabilize \nthe security situation in Haiti by first instructing the Multinational \nInterim Force to collect the weapons used by the rebels who said they \nwould disarm. If this vital step is not taken now, we are only setting \nourselves and the Haitian people up for another disaster. The mandate \nis clear. The Multinational Interim Force should immediately disarm and \narrest these thugs.\n  The failure to disarm the disbanded Haitian military and the \nparamilitary forces called FRAPH in 1994 after President Aristide had \ncome back to office has been one of the root causes of ongoing \npolitical violence in Haiti.\n  We know who these thugs are and we have the mandate to arrest and \nturn them over to the Haitian authorities. We have arrested Baathists \nmembers of Saddam Hussein's party. We have arrested them and turned \nthem over to the Iraqi courts. We also did this in the Balkans. Why \ncan't we do it in Haiti? We cannot go out and arrest Mr. Chamblain, \nconvicted of two murders? Why don't we go out and arrest him and turn \nhim over to the Haitian courts to stand trial?\n  Let us show the Haitian people we are committed to ensuring that the \ndemocratic process works--not just in Iraq, not just in the Balkans, \nbut also in Haiti as well.\n  The Bush administration can no longer sit on the sidelines. It is my \nhope the Bush administration shows the same dedication and commitment \nto supporting the new interim government as it did to stand by and \nactively destroy President Aristide's duly elected democratic \ngovernment.\n\n  What has happened in Haiti should be a blight on the American \nconscience--the poorest country in this hemisphere, the poorest of the \npoor, struggling decade after decade under brutal dictatorships, \nrepressive military regimes, finally becoming free in 1990, only to \nhave its President overthrown in a coup. What signal are we sending to \nthe Haitians? I guess if you are poor and you don't have oil and you \nare not strategically important, we don't care what happens to you. We \nwill let the thugs take over. We will let the few wealthy elite rearm \nthe military to protect them and to keep them in power.\n  I saw a newspaper article late last week which pointed out that this \nCongress had appropriated $18 billion for reconstruction in Iraq. It \nwent on to say how $4 billion of the money that was appropriated for \nIraq was for clean water and sanitation--$4 billion of our taxpayers' \nmoney going to one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Iraq. Iraq \nis not a poor country. This is a very rich country with oil reserves. \nIt is either the first or second in the world in oil reserves. Yet we \nare taking $4 billion in taxpayer money to build a water and sanitation \nsystem. Why can't we build clean water and sanitation systems, roads, \nhospitals and schools in Haiti? To me, that is the moral imperative of \nwhat we should be doing in our hemisphere--not trying to destroy \ndemocratically elected governments.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2181-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2181-S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUTSOURCING U.S. JOBS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, yesterday we began our discussion on \noutsourcing--a subject well worth discussing because it is of great \nconcern.\n  I am sorry I didn't have a chance to hear all of the discussions \nbecause I think we need to address all of the issues related to the \nneedless outsourcing of U.S. jobs abroad. It is a problem in my State \nas it is in many others. I imagine I am not the only Member of this \nbody who has been confronted with workers who have lost their jobs, and \nmany more who feel that the loss of their job is likely. They raise \nthese concerns about outsourcing and jobs going abroad.\n  Yesterday I heard a lot of strong rhetoric about how bad it was, but \nI didn't hear a discussion of the many complicated issues that go into \noutsourcing. I did not hear a thorough discussion of how effectively we \ncan remedy the problem.\n  As a matter of fact, the chairman of the Finance Committee raised the \nquestion that perhaps one of the remedies being proposed might put us \nin violation of the World Trade Organization rules with the possible \nimposition of much broader penalties on other U.S. workers not directly \naffected.\n  I think it is time we begin a discussion of this complicated issue. I \nhope we have hearings on it. I hope we have discussions on it because I \nthink the people of America need to understand what it is like as we \nlive in a true world economy.\n  I want to look first at what I consider to be a real problem of \noutsourcing; that is, governmentally enforced outsourcing. You say, \nWhat? The Federal Government and State governments are threatening to \ndrive jobs out of the United States? Do we realize that?\n\n  In this body last year, I led a debate in which there were strong \nopinions on both sides. I don't think I need to remind my colleagues of \nthe debate over the regulation proposed by the California Air Resources \nBoard that proposed to require all small engines--the engines we have \nin weed trimmers, in lawnmowers, leaf blowers and chainsaws--would have \nto have catalytic converters. This was a very contentious debate. I \nthank my colleagues who supported me and who helped us prevent the \nimposition of this rule nationally outside of California.\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\n  We talked about some of the dangers--the danger that 1,100-degree \ncatalytic converters would start fires. Grass burns at 500 degrees. The \ndanger of a small engine with a 1,100-degree catalytic converter is \ngreat. But there was a more direct danger. If that California \nregulation had gone nationwide, then the companies set up to \nmanufacture small engines would not have been able to manufacture them \nin their existing facilities. They told us--and outside experts \nagreed--that they would have to rebuild these facilities. Where would \nthey rebuild the facilities? They would rebuild the facilities in China \nbecause they could do it so much more cheaply and use less expensive \nlabor in China to turn out the engines. Some of them are now produced \nin China, and they would have moved all of the small engine production \nto China.\n  I was in Poplar Bluff, MO, last Saturday night. I was thanked by the \n1,100 employees of Briggs & Stratton in Poplar Bluff. I was thanked, \nand my colleagues in this body and in the House were thanked, because \nwe took steps to stop the California Air Resources Board from sending a \nregulation nationwide that would have cost them their jobs. Not just \n1,100 jobs at Poplar Bluff in Missouri, a total of 5,000 jobs in \nMissouri would have moved offshore. They would have been outsourced.\n\n  Nationally, more jobs in Wisconsin, almost as many jobs in Kentucky, \njobs in Alabama, jobs all across the Midwest, a total of 22,000 \nAmerican jobs would have been outsourced by that governmental \nregulation if this body, at my request, and the other body at the \nrequest of Congresswoman Emerson, had not been able to say you are not \ngoing to impose those restrictions outside the State of California. I \nthank my colleagues on behalf of the workers in Missouri and around the \nNation whose jobs were not outsourced.\n  But then we have another problem. Do you know what is driving jobs \noffshore now? A shortage of natural gas. Natural gas prices have run \nway up because of governmentally enforced provisions. The natural gas \ncrisis we have in the United States is a governmentally enforced \nshortage, a governmentally enforced hike. Many low-income families find \ntheir natural gas bills going through the ceiling. All of us who heat \nwith natural gas see our natural gas bills going up.\n  Worse, men and women who work in industries that use natural gas--\nchemical and related industries--are seeing their jobs move offshore \nbecause the producers of those goods have to go to other countries \nwhere they have abundant natural gas supplies, where the natural gas \nsupply has not been constrained by governmental action and not been \nenhanced by governmental mandate. We have been sitting around here and \nwe cannot get an energy bill through that would tap the absolutely \nessential natural gas resources in the Presiding Officer's State of \nAlaska--and, I might add, ANWR, too.\n  We have natural gas, but we cannot use it. Why? Because governmental \nregulations say we cannot drill here or there; we have not been able to \nbuild a pipeline.\n  Why have natural gas prices gone up? We have mandated electric \nutilities not to use abundant coal but to use natural gas. Natural gas \nshould not be used to fire electric generating boilers. It has too many \nother uses.\n  There was an article last week in the Wall Street Journal by Russell \nGold talking about how natural gas costs hurt United States firms:\n\n       The root of higher natural-gas prices is a federal policy \n     that promotes use of the relatively cleaner-burning fuel \n     without providing incentives or means for natural-gas \n     companies to increase production. So while demand soared in \n     recent years, especially from a raft of new gas-fired power \n     plants, producers have struggled with supply. Most North \n     American gas fields are years past their prime, and \n     environmental restrictions prevent drilling on many of the \n     most promising areas.\n\n  He has summed it up well. We have a crisis in natural gas prices and \nnatural gas supply and in outsourcing of natural gas-using industries \nbecause of government policy. The farmers in my State have to use \nfertilizer. The ``n'' in the three-numbered fertilizer most farmers use \nor the anhydrous ammonia comes from natural gas, and they see \ntremendously high prices. I believe in a little bit of 13/13/13 and the \nprices jumped in that small sack I buy. When you are buying tons and \ntons of this, it cuts into farmers' profits and raises their costs.\n  Do you know what I think. We have all these impact statements, \nenvironmental impact statements, but maybe what we need is a jobs \nimpact statement. Before we pass one of these good ideas or before some \nagency of government comes up with a new regulation, maybe they ought \nto have to do an impact on the jobs it would cost or create.\n  I would like to have some of my colleagues who have been so vocal and \npersuasive and vociferous in arguing against outsourcing to have a \nchance to vote on whether we ought to have a jobs impact statement. \nThat seems to make a lot of sense to me. Maybe we can do something. I \nwill be working on that. I may offer that for this body's \nconsideration.\n  But I tell you something else that is causing outsourcing and that we \nhave not done anything about. We cannot move forward on asbestos \nlitigation reform. There are 3,000 or 4,000 people who are tragically \nsick because of asbestos, but the asbestos trial lawyers have filed \nclass action suits with 700,000 plaintiffs.\n  That struck home for me because I live in northeast Missouri. My \nhometown of Mexico, MO, used to call itself the saddle horse and fire \nclay center of the world. Saddle horses are three- and five-gaited \nhorses. Rex McDonald, trained by Tom Bass, is one of the leaders. \nUnfortunately, we are no longer the fire clay or refractory center of \nthe Nation. We had thousands and thousands of people employed in making \nhigh-temperature and abrasive-resistant bricks that line steel furnaces \nand petroleum-cracking furnaces that line the Navy boilers. That used \nto be the major industry.\n  But it turns out that some time ago there was some asbestos used in \nthe mortar that held the refractory's products together. So all of \nthose companies have 700,000 lawsuits filed against them. Most, if not \nall of them, have been forced into bankruptcy because of asbestos \nlitigation. Their buyers have come in and picked up the customer lists \nand the recipes and moved the production to Canada to supply our basic \nindustry needs. The most basic industry, basic for steel, for aluminum, \nfor petroleum products, has been driven largely to Canada to get away \nfrom asbestos litigation.\n  We are not taking the steps we need to allow us to bring back into \nthe United States the production of one of the most basic elements of \nheavy industry. That is one thing maybe we can work on. Maybe we can \npass an asbestos bill--we should have done so a long time ago--to care \nfor those who are really sick, but also to cut off frivolous claims \nthat do nothing but line trial lawyers' pockets. Tort reform is another \nthing we need to address to keep businesses productive so they can hire \nworkers.\n  I tell you one other thing. I have a particular interest because the \nSenator from Maryland and I chair the appropriations subcommittee that \nappropriates funds for the National Science Foundation. We are seeing a \ntremendous shortage of scientists and engineers. We are just not \nfinding enough United States students who want to follow a science or \nengineering curriculum. With the increasing developments in science and \ntechnology and engineering, we have to be turning out more scientists. \nWe need more money. I make a plea for more money for the National \nScience Foundation budget so we can increase the incentives the \nNational Science Foundation is using, along with science centers and \neducational institutions through the country, to train more scientists \nand engineers and technicians.\n  Yes, we need to train more people in community colleges. That is very \nimportant because if we do not train them, other countries, such as \nIndia, with tremendous reservoirs of engineers are turning out top \nquality engineers. If we do not have the engineers to do the work that \nis needed, that work is going to go to India. We need to do something \nabout it. And we ought to begin moving.\n  In a growing competitive and interdependent global economy, as any \neconomist will explain, there are increasingly greater flows of trade, \ncapital, and labor.\n  Outsourcing apparently has been occurring wherever freedom has \nexisted\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\nbecause private businesses will seek to increase efficiency and provide \nbetter products at a lower cost by focusing resources on what they do \nbetter than everyone else. This has occurred in the United States in \nthe previous half century, as the United States employment grew from 45 \nmillion to 130 million jobs.\n  I was one who thought I would always buy an American car. I thought I \nhad been doing so. But do you know something. More and more American \ncars have foreign-made parts and foreign-made components. At the same \ntime, more foreign companies are coming into the United States. You \nhave to do a lot of research to find out which car has more and which \ncar has less U.S. components.\n  The auto industries are employing people at good wages in the United \nStates at high-tech jobs, while lower-tech jobs are done overseas. But \nthe American consuming public has demanded the best quality \nautomobiles. So it is difficult, when you go out and try to buy \nAmerican, to find out what is truly American. Those eggs have been \nscrambled, and it is difficult to unscramble them.\n  But as much a problem as outsourcing and foreign trade is, I want to \ngive you some good news. There are some in this body who voted for the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement and have now roundly condemned it. \nBut on Monday of this week, the Governor of Missouri proudly \nannounced--and I congratulate the State--that Missouri exports grew by \n6.5 percent in 2003. From his release, it says Canada and Mexico were \ntop importers of Missouri products. Canada imported $3 billion of \nproducts; Mexico imported $748 million of products. Not bad. Those are \ntwo countries I believe are in NAFTA.\n  But more interestingly, the Governor goes on to say:\n\n       More than 75,000 jobs in the state were directly tied to \n     industries that export to other countries. . . . Also, the \n     top 10 exporting industries paid higher average annual wages, \n     at $41,894, than the statewide average wage of $33,600.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that release be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Missouri Exports Grow 6.5 Percent in 2003\n\n       Missouri's exports increased by 6.5 percent in 2003, \n     reaching $7.23 billion, the state's Department of Economic \n     Development said.\n       Missouri's exports totaled $6.79 billion in 2002. \n     Transportation equipment was Missouri's top export in 2003 \n     with nearly $2.2 billion in sales. Other strong exports were \n     chemicals, plastics and rubber, leather products and \n     electrical equipment, appliances and components, and food and \n     similar products.\n       Canada and Mexico were the top importers of Missouri \n     products. Canada imported $3.08 billion of products, and \n     Mexico imported $748 million of products. The other top \n     importers of Missouri products were Japan, the United \n     Kingdom, China, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, Belgium and \n     Australia.\n       Nationally, Missouri ranked No. 26 for export sales, but \n     its international sales grew faster than the nation's, which \n     grew an average of 4.4 percent.\n       More than 75,000 jobs in the state were directly tied to \n     industries that export to other countries, the department \n     said in a written release. Also, the top 10 exporting \n     industries paid higher average annual wages, at $41,894, than \n     the statewide average wage of $33,600.\n       Kelvin Simmons, director of the department, said Missouri's \n     exports seem to be returning to the level they were at before \n     the recession.\n       ``Increased sales of Missouri products abroad is another \n     important indicator that Missouri's economy has turned the \n     corner on the national recession,'' Simmons said in the \n     release.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, as businesses and our economy \nrestructure--a natural occurrence of the business cycle--workers in our \ncountry have done better overall. ``Overall,'' however, does not mean \neveryone has done better. Many have not, and those are the people for \nwhom the overall benefits of restructuring or even the so-called \ntemporary nature of the unemployment is of little comfort because they \nwant to work and provide for their families but they do not have a job.\n  Yesterday afternoon, the Senator from New Jersey was very loudly and \nstrongly decrying the outsourcing of jobs, and he made, I believe--I \ndid not hear all of his statement--a very compelling case. At the same \ntime, the firm he was associated with announced last fall it intended \nto establish an Indian unit with 250 employees working on operations in \ntechnology. Now, how does that square with not outsourcing? That is \nsomething perhaps we should discuss in a hearing or further debates.\n  But I just came across an interesting article from Tom Friedman, \ncertainly not with a Republican base, but I think a very good New York \nTimes international analyst. He was talking about interviews he had \nwith an Indian who was a founder of 24/7's customer call center. He \nsaid:\n\n       How can it be good for America to have all these Indians \n     doing our white-collar jobs?\n\n  The reply was:\n\n       All the computers are from Compaq. The basic software is \n     from Microsoft. The phones are from Lucent. The air-\n     conditioning is by Carrier, and even the bottled water is by \n     Coke, because when it comes to drinking water in India, \n     people want a trusted brand. On top of all this . . . 90 \n     percent of the shares . . . are owned by U.S. investors \n     [including U.S. pension funds]. This explains why, although \n     the U.S. has lost some service jobs to India, total exports \n     from U.S. companies to India have grown from $2.5 billion in \n     1990 to $4.1 billion in 2002. What goes around comes around, \n     and also benefits Americans.\n\n  Mr. Friedman concludes his article quoting the Indian gentleman \nsaying:\n\n       It's unfair that you want all your products marketed \n     globally, but you don't want any jobs to go.\n\n  And Mr. Friedman replies:\n\n       He's right. Which is why we must design the right public \n     policies to keep America competitive in an increasingly \n     networked world, where every company--Indian or American--\n     will seek to assemble the best skills from around the globe. \n     And we must cushion those Americans hurt by the outsourcing \n     of their jobs. But let's not be stupid and just start \n     throwing up protectionist walls, in reaction to what seems to \n     be happening on the surface. Because beneath the surface, \n     what's going around is also coming around. Even an Indian \n     cartoon company isn't just taking American jobs, it's also \n     making them.\n\n  Those are Mr. Friedman's comments.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 2004]\n\n                         What Goes Around . . .\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       BANGALORE, India--I've been in India for only a few days \n     and I am already thinking about reincarnation. In my next \n     life, I want to be a demagogue\n       Yes, I want to be able to huff and puff about complex \n     issues--like outsourcing of jobs to India--without any \n     reference to reality. Unfortunately, in this life, I'm stuck \n     in the body of a reporter/columnist. So when I came to the \n     24/7 Customer call center in Bangalore to observe hundreds of \n     Indian young people doing service jobs via long distance--\n     answering the phones for U.S. firms, providing technical \n     support for U.S. computer giants or selling credit cards for \n     global banks--I was prepared to denounce the whole thing. \n     ``How can it be good for America to have all these Indians \n     doing our white-collar jobs?'' I asked 24/7's founder, S. \n     Nagarajan.\n       Well, he answered patiently, ``look around this office.'' \n     All the computers are from Compaq. The basic software is from \n     Microsoft. The phones are from Lucent. The air-conditioning \n     is by Carrier, and even the bottled water is by Coke, because \n     when it comes to drinking water in India, people want a \n     trusted brand. On top of all this, says Mr. Nagarajan, 90 \n     percent of the shares in 24/7 are owned by U.S. investors. \n     This explains why, although the U.S. has lost some service \n     jobs to India, total exports from U.S. companies to India \n     have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.1 billion in 2002. \n     What goes around comes around, and also benefits Americans.\n       Consider one of the newest products to be outsourced to \n     India: animation. Yes, a lot of your Saturday morning \n     cartoons are drawn by Indian animators like Jadoo Works, \n     founded three years ago here in Bangalore. India, though, did \n     not take these basic animation jobs from Americans. For 20 \n     years they had been outsourced by U.S. movie companies, first \n     to Japan and then to the Philippines, Korea, Hong Kong and \n     Taiwan. The sophisticated, and more lucrative, preproduction, \n     finishing and marketing of the animated films, though, always \n     remained in America. Indian animation companies took the \n     business away from the other Asians by proving to be more \n     adept at both the hand-drawing of characters and the digital \n     painting of each frame by computer--at a lower price.\n       Indian artists had two advantages, explained Ashish \n     Kulkarni, C.O.O. of Jadoo Works. ``They spoke English, so \n     they could take instruction from the American directors \n     easily, and they were comfortable doing coloring digitally.'' \n     India has an abundance of traditional artists, who were able \n     to make the transition easily to computerized digital \n     painting. Most of these artists are the children of Hindu \n     temple sculptors and painters.\n       Explained Mr. Kulkarni: ``We train them to transform their \n     traditional skills to animation in a digital format.'' But to \n     keep up\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     their traditional Indian painting skills, Jadoo Works has a \n     room set aside--because the two skills reinforce each other. \n     In short, thanks to globalization, a whole new generation of \n     Indian traditional artists can keep up their craft rather \n     than drive taxis to earn a living.\n       But here's where the story really gets interesting. Jadoo \n     Works has decided to produce its own animated epic about the \n     childhood of Krishna. To write the script, though, it wanted \n     the best storyteller it could find and outsourced the project \n     to an Emmy Award-winning U.S. animation writer, Jeffrey \n     Scott--for an Indian epic!\n       ``We are also doing all the voices with American actors in \n     Los Angeles,'' says Mr. Kulkarni. And the music is being \n     written in London. Jadoo Works also creates computer games \n     for the global market but outsources all the design concepts \n     to U.S. and British game designers. All the computers and \n     animation software at Jadoo Works have also been imported \n     from America (H.P. and I.B.M.) or Canada, and half the staff \n     walk around In American-branded clothing.\n       ``It's unfair that you want all your products marketed \n     globally,'' argues Mr. Kulkarni, ``but you don't want any \n     jobs to go.''\n       He's right. Which is why we must design the right public \n     policies to keep America competitive in an increasingly \n     networked world, where every company--Indian or American--\n     will seek to assemble the best skills from around the globe. \n     And we must cushion those Americans hurt by the outsourcing \n     of their jobs. But let's not be stupid and just start \n     throwing up protectionist walls, in reaction to what seems to \n     be happening on the surface. Because beneath the surface, \n     what's going around is also coming around. Even an Indian \n     cartoon company isn't just taking American jobs, it's also \n     making them.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there are many ways to address the \nneedless outsourcing of jobs. One of the things we could do is to have \nthe Government impose even more restrictions on the private sector. \nHowever, in many cases that is not the solution; it is the problem. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, there is a \nrelationship between high employment restrictions and high \nunemployment. CRS says:\n\n       . . . the four largest countries with the most protection \n     (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain) had the highest \n     unemployment rates of any country.\n\n  CRS cites the ``unintended effect of making firms reluctant to take \non new workers'' is the result of the protectionist policies.\n  Interesting comments on this came from former Labor Secretary Robert \nReich, who was President Clinton's Secretary of Labor. On November 2, \n2003, in the Washington Post, he said, in a headline: ``High-Tech Jobs \nAre Going Abroad! But That's Okay.'' What is he talking about? How did \nhe say that? Man, that sounds bad. That sounds as bad as some of the \nstatements we have heard out of economists in this administration. I \nwill submit the whole thing for the Record, but at the end of it he \nsaid:\n\n       So why don't I believe the outsourcing of high-tech work is \n     something to lose sleep over?\n\n  He says:\n\n       First, the number of high-tech jobs outsourced abroad still \n     accounts for a tiny proportion of America's 10-million-strong \n     IT workforce. . . .\n       Second, even as the number of outsourced jobs increases, \n     the overall percent of high-tech jobs going abroad is likely \n     to remain relatively small.\n\n  Next:\n\n       Outsourcing also poses quality-control problems.\n\n  Next:\n\n       As smart U.S. companies outsource their more standard high-\n     tech work, they're simultaneously shifting their in-house IT \n     employees to more innovative, higher value-added functions, \n     such as invention, creation, integration, key R and basic \n     architecture. . . .\n       There's no necessary limit to the number of high-tech jobs \n     around the world. . . .\n\n  In conclusion, this former Secretary of Labor says:\n\n       . . . it makes no sense for us to try to protect or \n     preserve high-tech jobs in America or block efforts by \n     American companies to outsource. Our economic future is \n     wedded to technological change, and most of the jobs of the \n     future are still ours to invent.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Robert \nReich be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 2, 2003]\n\n            High-Tech Jobs Are Going Abroad! But That's Okay\n\n                          (By Robert B. Reich)\n\n       There's good news and not-so-good news in the American \n     workplace. The good news is that the economy is growing and \n     businesses are spending once again, on high technology. The \n     Commerce Department reported last Thursday a sharp pickup in \n     spending on equipment and software in the third quarter. Not \n     so good is the news that high-tech jobs have not come back, \n     at least not so far.\n       Jobs in America's sprawling information-technology (or IT, \n     as is known in the info world) sector--including everything \n     from software research, design and development to computer \n     engineering--are down 20 percent from late 2000. Salaries are \n     down, too. In 2000, senior software engineers earned \n     $130,000. The same job now pays no more than $100,000. \n     Meanwhile, a lot of high-tech jobs are moving offshore. Is \n     that a cause for concern?\n       When I was labor secretary, I fought to preserve U.S. jobs. \n     So you might assume that I would see the number of high-tech \n     jobs moving offshore as a troubling trend. And yet, I do not. \n     I'll explain why in a moment.\n       But lots of people are worried about it. Indeed, those \n     anxieties seem to be increasing:\n       On Sept. 30, Congress let the cap on H-1B visas issued to \n     foreign high-tech workers to shrink from 195,000 to its old \n     level of 65,000. The ostensible reason: to make sure more \n     high-tech jobs go to Americans.\n       Bills are pending in several state legislatures barring \n     state government projects from using offshore high-tech \n     workers.\n       High-tech workers are organizing against foreign \n     outsourcing. One group of them--the Organization for the \n     Rights of American Workers--has demonstrated outside \n     conferences on ``strategic outsourcing'' in New York and \n     Boston.\n       The fear is understandable.\n       More than half of all Fortune 500 companies say they're \n     outsourcing software development or expanding their own \n     development centers outside the United States. Sixty-eight \n     percent of more than 100 IT executives who responded to a \n     survey last spring by CIO magazine said their offshore \n     contracts will increase this year. By the end of 2004, 10 \n     percent of all information-technology jobs at American IT \n     companies and 5 percent in non-IT companies will move \n     offshore, according to Gartner Co., a research and analysis \n     firm that specializes in high-technology trends. And by 2015, \n     according to a study by Forrester Research in Cambridge, an \n     estimated 3.3 million more American white-collar jobs will \n     shift to low-cost countries, mostly to India.\n       The trend isn't surprising. American companies are under \n     intense pressure to reduce costs, and foreigners can do a lot \n     of high-tech jobs more cheaply than they can be done here. \n     Already India has more than half a million IT professionals. \n     It's adding 2 million college graduates a year, many of whom \n     are attracted to the burgeoning IT sector. The starting \n     salary of a software engineer in India is around $5,000. \n     Experienced engineers get between $10,000 to $15,000. Top IT \n     professionals there might earn up to $20,000.\n       Meanwhile, it's become far easier to coordinate such work \n     from headquarters back in America. Overseas cable costs have \n     fallen as much as 80 percent since 1999. With digitization \n     and high-speed data networks, an Indian office park can seem \n     right next door. Matthew Slaughter, associate professor of \n     business administration at Dartmouth College, says \n     information-technology work ``will move faster [than \n     manufacturing] because it's easier to ship work across phone \n     lines and put consultants on airplanes than it is to ship \n     bulky raw materials across borders and build factories and \n     deal with tariffs and transportation.''\n       With such ease of communicating, the squeeze on H1-B visas \n     will do little to keep IT jobs out of the hands of non-\n     Americans. ``It doesn't make a difference for firms whose \n     business model has people largely working offshore,'' Moksha \n     Technologies Chairman Pawan Kumar told the Press Trust of \n     India. ``It . . . will make firms drive business where the \n     technology workers are.'' Guatam Sinha, head of the Indian \n     human-resource firm TVA Infotech, agrees. ``In fact, lots of \n     techies are coming back to India.'' India exported $9.6 \n     billion worth of software last year. Such exports are \n     expected to grow 26 percent this fiscal year.\n       So why don't I believe the outsourcing of high-tech work is \n     something to lose sleep over?\n       First, the number of high-tech jobs outsourced abroad still \n     accounts for a tiny proportion of America's 10-million-strong \n     IT workforce. When the U.S. economy fully bounces back from \n     recession (as it almost surely will within the next 18 \n     months), a large portion of high-tech jobs that were lost \n     after 2000 will come back in some form.\n       Second, even as the number of outsourced jobs increases, \n     the overall percent of high-tech jobs going abroad is likely \n     to remain relatively small. That's because outsourcing \n     increases the possibilities of loss or theft of intellectual \n     property, as well as sabotage, cyberterrorism, abuse by \n     hackers, and organized crime. Granted, not much of this has \n     happened yet. But as more IT is shipped abroad, the risks \n     escalate. Smart companies will continue to keep their core IT \n     functions in-house, and at home.\n       Outsourcing also poses quality-control problems. The more \n     complex the job order and specs, the more difficult it is to \n     get it exactly right over large distances with subcontractors \n     from a different culture. In a Gartner survey of 900 big U.S. \n     companies that outsource IT work offshore, a majority\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n     complained of difficulty in communicating and meeting \n     deadlines. So it's unlikely that very complex engineering and \n     design can be done more efficiently abroad.\n       As smart U.S. companies outsource their more standard high-\n     tech work, they're simultaneously shifting their in-house IT \n     employees to more innovative, higher value-added functions, \n     such as invention, creation, integration, key R and basic \n     architecture. These core creative activities are at the heart \n     of these companies' competitive futures. They know they \n     have to nourish them.\n       The third and most basic reason why high-tech work won't \n     shift abroad is that high technology isn't a sector like \n     manufacturing or an industry like telecommunications. High-\n     tech work entails the process of innovating. It's about \n     discovering and solving problems. There's no necessary limit \n     to the number of high-tech jobs around the world because \n     there's no finite limit to the ingenuity of the human mind. \n     And there's no limit to human needs that can be satisfied.\n       Hence, even as the supply of workers around the world \n     capable of high-tech innovation increases, the demand for \n     innovative people is increasing at an even faster pace. \n     Recessions temporarily slow such demand, of course, but the \n     long-term trend is toward greater rewards to people who are \n     at or near the frontiers of information technology--as well \n     as biotechnology, nanotechnology and new-materials \n     technologies. Bigger pay packages are also in store for the \n     professionals (lawyers, bankers, venture capitalists, \n     advertisers, marketers and managers) who cluster around high-\n     tech workers and who support innovative enterprises.\n       In the future, some of America's high-tech workers will be \n     found in laboratories but many more will act like management \n     consultants, strategists and troubleshooters. They'll have \n     intimate understandings of particular businesses so they can \n     devise new solutions that meet those businesses' needs. \n     They'll help decide which high-tech work can most efficiently \n     be outsourced, and they'll coordinate work that goes offshore \n     with work done in-house.\n       Don't get me wrong. None of this is an argument for \n     complacency. It's crucial that America continues to be the \n     world's leader in innovation. Our universities are the best \n     in the world, but they can't remain that way when so many are \n     starved for cash. Federal and state support for higher \n     education must keep up with rising demand for people who are \n     creative and adaptive.\n       Federal government investments in basic research and \n     development are also vital. We need to guard against what is \n     already a drift away from basic research toward applied \n     research and development--that is, from the creation of new \n     knowledge that can be put to many different uses versus R \n     that's related to the commercialization of specific products, \n     especially military-related aerospace, telecommunications and \n     weapons.\n       And just as with laid-off manufacturing workers, we need to \n     ensure that high-tech workers are adaptive and flexible. They \n     should be able to move quickly and get the retraining they \n     need. Pensions and health insurance should be more portable \n     across jobs. High-tech workers who want to polish their \n     skills or gain new ones should have access to tax credits \n     that make it easy for them to go back to college for a time.\n       But it makes no sense for us to try to protect or preserve \n     high-tech jobs in America or block efforts by American \n     companies to outsource. Our economic future is wedded to \n     technological changes, and most of the jobs of the future are \n     still ours to invent.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, as we have this debate, it is impossible \nto observe one nearly ignored reality. Despite whether we often or \nalways disapprove of corporate decisionmakers, it is impossible to be \nfor employees while being against employers. We cannot be unrestrained \nin our desire to impose additional costs on employers and expect there \nnot to be harmful consequences to employees.\n  One would not know it by listening to some of the Presidential \nwannabes, but when you put more burdens on employers, they respond. \nThey respond to punitive taxation, regulation, and litigation. They \nwill outsource. They will move away. They will respond positively to \nincentives. We hope the incentives of the underlying subject of the \nbill before us today to provide tax relief for exports will help us get \nmore jobs in this country.\n  In my State, governmental regulations, State and Federal, are being \nused by some to try to prevent a foreign firm from investing $400 \nmillion in a plant that will employ 200 high-paid workers in a poor \narea.\n  They are trying to stop insourcing. We are in year 3 of environmental \nassessments to see if the plant can meet all the EPA, Corps of \nEngineers, and State standards. If we keep piling on burdens, this firm \ncan conduct operations in Thailand. I am afraid that option may be \nbecoming more attractive every day.\n  As I said, the trial lawyers have litigated the refractory business \nout of Missouri. According to the National Association of \nManufacturers, we have the most expensive legal system in the world, \nyet filibuster after filibuster keeps us from reforming the system. \nTort taxes, for which America is famous, are estimated to have been \nover $230 billion in 2002, 13 percent higher even than the costs in \n2001. Who pays for these skyrocketing costs? The tort lawyers pocket \ntheir 40 percent, but employers, employees, and consumers contend with \nthose costs.\n  We are not upgrading the locks and dams on the Mississippi River that \nare the vital lifeline to make sure we can use the farm productivity of \nthe Midwest to ship grain to export markets around the world, export \nmarkets that are bringing up prices and restoring economic well-being \nto the agricultural sector. We need to invest in our infrastructure.\n  Let me add highways. Highways are very important to growing jobs. I \nwouldn't want to leave the Chamber without saying that. There is much \nwork to be done.\n  Some apparently think that highways are too expensive: ignoring the \ngreater expense of decay and inefficiency. A good highway bill has \npassed the Senate, but is bogged down and may not emerge from the \nHouse.\n  We spend $60 million over 12 years studying whether our 70-year-old \ndilapidated locks on the Mississippi River should be modernized--a \nstudy that has resulted in nothing but red tape, congestion, and delay, \nwithout resolution. While failing to respond to the obsolescence of our \nNation's most important inland waterway and artery to the world's \nmarkets, we are at risk of outsourcing corn and bean production to \nother countries.\n  This quagmire has been excellent news for South American farmers who \nare winning market share as fast as we are losing it.\n  On the Missouri River, another key waterway, the U.S. Department of \nInterior proposed in 2000 to end water transportation and increase \nflood risk for downstream businesses and landowners so they could \nexperiment with pallid sturgeon habitat. Our farmers and other shippers \nwho are struggling to compete look to government for more efficient \ntransportation options. Instead, government uses it regulatory power to \nconsign farmers and other employers to the mercy of a higher-cost \ntransportation monopoly. More good news for foreign farmers courtesy of \nthe U.S. Federal Government.\n  Farmers and businesses in my State routinely raise issues related to \nhigh energy costs. We need to be encouraging domestic production of \nenergy. Instead we discourage it. Rather than safely developing \nrenewable resources at home and oil in Alaska, we import oil from the \nMiddle East. We had an energy bill that promoted all forms of domestic \nenergy production but could not overcome a filibuster. So we are \noutsourcing midwestern farm jobs and Alaskan energy jobs to Saudi \nArabia by Congressional obstruction. The Wall Street Journal featured \nan article recently noting how some firms were ``off-shoring'' in \nresponse to dramatic increases in natural gas necessary to fuel their \noperations.\n  Then there is the tax burden on U.S. businesses. According to some \nestimates, the U.S. has the second highest corporate tax burden in the \nworld--second only to Japan. Most small businesses are taxed as \nindividuals and are subject to the top marginal rates. Consequently, \naccording to election-year Democrat rhetoric, these small businesses \nand corporations are ``the rich'' and next week we will see numerous \nattempts to raise their taxes.\n  Again, Congress can't stick it to the employers and claim to be \ndeeply concerned about employees. We don't always like what \ncorporations do--and I troubled by what seems like a herd mentality \nwhen it comes to outsourcing of many jobs--but businesses exist because \nAmericans voluntarily purchase their products, Americans own them, \nAmericans run them, Americans work for them.\n  No one advocates a business environment free of regulation, but we \ncannot continue to be oblivious to the costs that we, little-by-little, \nheap upon our employers.\n  If we want them to hire people and do so in the U.S.--and I certainly \ndo--why don't we prove it. Why don't we resist raising their taxes next \nweek? Why don't we end the filibuster on legal reform or ``tort tax'' \nreform? Why don't we end the filibuster on an energy bill? Why don't we \nmodernize our infrastructure? Why don't we recognize that by working \nwith businesses, we can reduce pollution rather than reduce American \njobs.\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today is March 4. Five years ago today something called \nthe American Legacy Foundation was created. Over the past 5 years, \nLegacy Foundation has helped us to make great strides in the \nimprovement of health for all kinds of Americans, not only today but in \nthe years to come. They have helped us to begin building a world where \nyoung people reject tobacco and where just about anyone can quit \nsmoking. But as we celebrate the work of the foundation today, a lot \nmore work needs to be done.\n  The foundation was established in March of 1999 as a result of \nsomething called the Master Settlement Agreement between a coalition of \nattorneys general in 46 States and 5 U.S. territories and the tobacco \nindustry. The foundation remains primarily today funded by payments \ndesignated by the settlement.\n  The foundation develops national programs that address the health \neffects of tobacco use. They do it through grants, technical training \nand assistance, and youth activism, strategic partnerships, \ncountermarketing and grassroots marketing campaigns, public relations, \nand community outreach to populations disproportionately affected by \nthe toll of tobacco.\n  The foundation has two goals that guide its work toward creating \ntobacco-free generations. One of those is to arm all young people with \nthe knowledge and tools to reject tobacco. The other is to eliminate \nthe disparities in access to tobacco prevention and cessation services.\n  The truth campaign is one effort to curb tobacco use among teens. \nTruth is the foundation's comprehensive countermarketing campaign to \nprevent and reduce youth smoking. The truth campaign was credited by \nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse as one of the major programs which \ncontributed to the steady reduction in teen cigarette smoking.\n\n  In addition to celebrating this achievement today, I also want to \nshare with my colleagues the very real threats faced by the American \nLegacy Foundation. This year the foundation received its last payment \nfrom the Master Settlement Agreement. Because of this drastic reduction \nin resources, all of the successes that have been achieved to date are \nsuddenly jeopardized. I don't believe we can afford to lose any of the \nground we have gained on tobacco control.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider these facts: Tobacco is the leading \ncause of preventable death in this country. Tobacco kills some 440,000 \npeople per year--more than alcohol, AIDS, car accidents, illegal drugs, \nmurders, and suicides combined. Twenty-four percent of high school \nstudents in my State still smoke. That is down from where it was a \ncouple years ago, but still almost one out of four. Every day some \n2,000 teenagers begin smoking. Their average age is actually about 13. \nOf those who become hooked on smoking, one of three will end up dying \nfrom their use of tobacco.\n  Each year in my State of Delaware, some 1,100 adults die from \ncigarette smoking. I am told over 900 kids in my State have lost at \nleast one parent through smoking-caused death. I would also say smoking \nis having a financial impact. Annual health care expenditures in my \nState caused by tobacco use total $221 million and over $62 million in \nState Medicaid payments are related to tobacco use.\n  I had the privilege of being the founding cochairman of the American \nLegacy Foundation. Our founding chairman was Chris Gregoire, the \nAttorney General of Washington State. I was succeeded and joined on the \nfoundation board by former Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah, now head of \nEPA, and by Parris Glendenning, former Governor of Maryland. I am proud \nof the association I had with the foundation at its beginning and the \ngreat work we did, especially with young people who themselves helped \nto design, to craft, and to deliver the truth campaign. In no small \npart because of their efforts, especially the young people, the \nincidence of smoking has dropped significantly over the last half dozen \nyears, and it is important that that work and that trend continue.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and I thank my colleague from Nevada \nand my colleague from Minnesota for allowing me to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2186-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2186-S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I would like to spend the little time remaining to talk \nabout the economy. I was mayor of St. Paul, MN, for 8 years, and I \nlearned as mayor that the best welfare program is a job; the best \nhousing program is a job. Access to health care quite often came \nthrough a job. I also learned nobody jumps on a sinking ship; that hope \nand confidence yield investment.\n  As we look at the data, look at what is happening in the economy, it \nis very clear the economy is moving forward. This Nation has come a \nlong way from the terrible day of September 11 and the impact that had \nboth on the infrastructure in New York and in Washington, but also on \nthe psyche of the American public, the confidence.\n  Look at the scandals on Wall Street, the WorldComs and the Enrons. \nUndermining the trust and confidence in the American system, the way we \ndo business, that has an impact. The reality is we have come so far. In \nthe third quarter of last year we had the greatest GDP growth in nearly \n2 decades. The fourth quarter exceeded expectations contributing to 6.1 \npercent annual growth rate in the last half of the year, the strongest \n6 months gain since 1984. It is expected the 2004 economic growth will \nbe between 4.6 and 4.8 percent.\n  We sound like statisticians here. I am not sure the average man or \nwoman worried about their economic future and feeding their family \nunderstands the impact of that, but that is the fastest annual growth \nin this country since 1984.\n  When you try to turn around an economy that has suffered so much, \nwhen we try to do the things with the President's leadership--to cut \ntaxes, put more money in the pockets of moms and dads, to allow \nbusiness to increase expensing that, to generate bonus depreciation--it \nthen results in more economic investment, which results in more jobs, \nmore jobs.\n  Those are the things we have done, and the result is that the economy \nis moving forward. The statistics show that.\n  I understand that capital expenditures are on the rise. The \nDepartment of Commerce reported earlier this week that capital goods \norders are rising and are 3.6 percent higher in January than in the \nfinal quarter of 2003. We have nearly 660,000 less unemployment claims \nthan we had at our peak figure last summer and, I think, over 336,000 \nnew jobs according to the payroll survey, the most narrow reading--and \nthe household survey shows much more of an increase. If you do \nsomething out of your home, if you are individually employed, it \ndoesn't count that. I learned from my 17-year-old that people do \nbusiness out of eBay, and they are not listed in the payroll survey. \nBut the household survey is significant.\n  Millions of jobs have been created in this country. So we are moving \nforward. In my State, the last report of the State budget showed very \ngood news. The terrible deficits and gaps we were facing, the fiscal \ncrisis, may be over. The National Conference of State Legislatures \nrecently said that. So we\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nhave a lot of good news. Over the last 6 months, in the course of a \nPresidential campaign, all you heard is the negative, telling people \nagain and again how bad it is. Ultimately, common sense tells you if \nyou tell somebody something often enough and put enough money behind \nit, they may actually believe it. The problem is, if they believe it, \nit impacts their confidence and we all suffer. That is a bad thing. \nInstead of criticizing, we need to work together to get things done to \nmove this economy forward at a faster pace.\n  The Senator from Missouri recently talked about a highway bill, a \njobs bill, a transportation bill that would create 1.7 million jobs \nwhile improving the Nation's infrastructure. We need to invest in \nimproving locks and dams so farmers can get products to market and \ncontinue to grow a farm economy that is doing a lot better. We need to \npass an energy bill to create between 500,000 and 700,000 new jobs--a \nbill that has been subject to a filibuster. That has to end and we need \nto stop criticizing and pledge to work together to get something done.\n  We need legal reform. We came within a vote of class action reform. \nTalk to the folks who create jobs in this country, to the \nmanufacturers. They will tell you the biggest impediments they have are \nthe cost of class actions, the cost of litigation, the cost of \nregulation and taxation--those things that we impose and that we can \nfix if we simply came together with a positive vision and commitment to \nwork in a bipartisan way to get something done.\n  If you really care about moms and dads and their ability to put food \non the table and to work, then figure out a way to pass an energy bill, \na highway bill, class action reform, and deal with asbestos reform, \nwhich is a critical issue--pay for those who are hurt, but make sure \nthe lack of reform doesn't drive companies under and hurt jobs, hurt \nthe ability for mom and dad to take care of their family. I found out \nwhen I was a mayor that the best thing I could do for kids was to do \nthose things to make sure mom and dad had a job. What we are working on \ntoday is another jobs bill. It is going to take working in a bipartisan \nway, putting aside some of the negative, why we cannot do it, how \nterrible things are. Let's focus on those things we can do to improve--\nand they are very clear--the opportunity for mom and dad to get a job. \nThe way to change an economy this size is not like a race car ripping \naround the corner. It is more like one of those big boats that travel \non Lake Superior. You just get it moving in the right direction.\n  I suggest that we are moving in the right direction. There is more \nwork to be done. Let's get about the business of doing that.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2187-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2187-S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MISCELLANEOUS TRADE AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 43, S. 671.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 671) to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of \n     the United States to modify temporarily certain rates of \n     duty, to make other technical amendments to the trade laws, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to comment on a bill that \nhas traveled a long and difficult journey to get to the floor today; S. \n671, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003, \ncommonly called the miscellaneous tariff bill.\n  In fact, this bill's journey began nearly 2 years ago. The Senate \nhistorically passes a miscellaneous tariff bill at the end of every \nCongress. The bill under consideration today was supposed to have been \npassed at the end of the 107th Congress. However, a markup scheduled \nfor September 26, 2002 was cancelled, leaving the bill as unfinished \nbusiness for the current Congress. Upon resuming the chairmanship of \nthe Finance Committee, my intention was to complete unfinished business \nfrom the 107th Congress as quickly as possible. To that end we passed \nthe bill out of the Senate Finance Committee by voice vote on February \n27, 2003. It was hoped that early passage of this bill would pave the \nway for consideration of another miscellaneous tariff bill in the 108th \nCongress. But that was not meant to be.\n  Traditionally, miscellaneous tariffs bills are non-controversial and \npass the Senate by unanimous consent. Sometimes there are attempts to \nload the bill down with costly and controversial items, which is why we \ndidn't produce a bill in the 107th Congress. That's also the reason \nthis bill was delayed this Congress. Contrary to traditional practice, \na few Senators insisted on adding unrelated and controversial \nprovisions. Unless we agreed to add these controversial provisions, \nthese Senators would not allow the full Senate to consider the bill. In \neffect, a few Senators have held this legislation hostage for months \nfor their own parochial purposes. And that is truly sad and \ndisappointing. I hope these members know that they have all but \nguaranteed the end to this process.\n  This package contains many trade provisions, primarily duty \nsuspensions, reductions and extensions, for products that are not \nproduced domestically. This bill supports American factories and \nworkers by allowing manufacturers to save money when they import these \nproducts. At this stage in America's economic recovery, we must give \nevery opportunity to our manufacturers to reduce costs and pass the \nsavings on to consumers.\n  A product generally must meet three tests to be eligible for \ninclusion in a miscellaneous trade bill: first, it must be non-\ncontroversial and non-competitive, that is there can be no domestic \nproducer who objects to inclusion of the provisions. Second, the \nproduct should be intended to benefit U.S. downstream producers, that \nis someone who utilizes the product in manufacturing. Third, the volume \nof imports and corresponding revenue loss should be relatively small. \nTo ensure that the provisions in this bill met that this test, each \nprovision went through an extensive vetting process including a public \nnotice and comment period to ensure that they were eligible for \ninclusion in the bill. This process began during the first session of \nthe 107th Congress.\n  The bill also contains a number of liquidations or reliquidations for \ncertain entries. The general rule for inclusion here is that the \nproduct entered the country under an incorrect duty rate due to Customs \nor other administrative error. These provisions allow those entries to \nenter the country at the correct duty rate.\n  We also included in this bill a provision that extends preferences \nunder the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to allow duty-free \ntreatment for hand-knotted and hand-woven carpets. This provision is \ndesigned primarily to help the citizens of Afghanistan and Pakistan. I \nbelieve that allowing these products to be considered as eligible \narticles under GSP, will help beneficiary countries that have joined \nthe United States in the fight against global terrorism. With respect \nto Afghanistan, which is rebuilding and looking for opportunities for \nits people, this provision is needed now more than ever.\n  Another important provision in this bill corrects a mistake in the \nTrade Act of 2002, P.L. 107-210, that inadvertently and temporarily \nraised duties on Andean originating handbags, luggage, flat goods, work \ngloves and leather wearing apparel under the Andean Trade and \nPreferences and Drug Eradication Act, ATPDEA. This provision \nretroactively reinstates the reduced duty treatment for eligible \nproducts that entered the United States from August 6, 2002, the date \nATPDEA was signed, and the time in which these products met the import \nsensitivity test, several months later. It provides for continued duty-\nfree treatment for these eligible products, which was the intent of the \nTrade Act.\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes the Emergency Protection for \nIraqi Cultural Antiquities Act of 2003. I introduced the EPIC \nAntiquities Act of 2003 to authorize the President to impose immediate \nemergency import restrictions on the archaeological and ethnological \nmaterials of Iraq. The purpose of this bill is simple--to close a legal \nloophole which could allow looted Iraqi antiquities to be brought into \nthe United States.\n  If Congress does not act to provide the means for establishing an \ninterim ban on trade, the door may be opened to imports of looted Iraqi \nantiquities into the United States. Already the press has reported \nallegations that European auction houses have traded in looted Iraqi \nantiquities. The last thing that we in Congress want to do is to fail \nto act to prevent trade in looted artifacts here in the United States.\n  Also included in the package is a provision that simplifies the U.S. \nCustoms Service's ability to process commercial importations, thereby \nresulting in increased efficiency and productivity for both Customs and \nthe trade community.\n  I want to point out that the provisions I have covered are not the \nonly important provisions contained in this bill. This bill makes a \nnumber of other technical yet meaningful changes to our trade laws.\n  While I am very disappointed some members have delayed the passage of \nthis bill, and even tried to kill this bill with controversial \nprovisions, I would like to thank my colleagues who respected the \ntraditional rules governing this important legislation. I appreciate \ntheir support.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nGrassley-Baucus amendment at the desk be agreed to and that the bill, \nas amended, be read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10:30 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1637, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1637) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to comply with the World Trade Organization rulings on the \n     FSC/ETI benefit in a manner that preserves jobs and \n     production activities in the United States, to reform and \n     simplify the international taxation rules of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dodd amendment No. 2660, to protect United States workers \n     from competition of foreign workforces for performance of \n     Federal and State contracts.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2660\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I thank the Finance Committee and \nthe leadership for getting this measure before us. This is important \nlegislation. What is extremely important is the Dodd amendment.\n  As we approach early March, we have to ask ourselves in this body \nwhat we are doing about the general challenges we are facing all across \nthis country, with very few exceptions. I will come back later to the \nstate of our economy.\n  This legislation provides some resolution to some of the challenges \nwe are facing. I think the Dodd amendment is enormously important and \none that I strongly support and hope the Senate will take action on. I \nknow there is consideration that we go off this bill and on to the \nbudget, but it does seem to me, in terms of the timetable because of \nthe strict limitations of time on the budget, we ought to continue the \ndebate on the issues of jobs and the economy which is of central \nimportance and consequence to people all over this Nation.\n  This debate should go on. I certainly join with those who believe the \ninstitution is ill served if we refuse to give the Dodd amendment the \nopportunity for a clear vote in the Senate. What the American people \nare looking for is action. They want accountability. They want \nresponsibility. This amendment is a thoughtful amendment. It will be \none that will make a difference in terms of the state of our economy in \na very key area of economic policy, and that is the utilization of \ntaxpayers' resources to effectively subsidize jobs going overseas.\n  We ought to be able to make a judgment about that in the Senate. So I \napplaud the Senator from Connecticut for this amendment.\n  I will take a moment or two to try to put it into some kind of \nperspective because, as he and others have pointed out, we are facing a \nserious economic challenge across this Nation. It is virtually uniform. \nIn 48 out of the 50 States, new jobs pay 21 percent less than the old \njobs they replace, with the exceptions of Nevada and Nebraska.\n  In the State I have had a chance to visit over the period of the last \nweek, the State of New York, the new jobs are paying 38 percent less \nthan the jobs they replaced. That is happening across this Nation, and \nI will get into the greater detail of it.\n  That is a national challenge and a national problem, and yet our \nRepublican leadership refuses to permit us to deal with some of these \nissues. We can deal with a number of the issues. We can deal with the \nissue of the increase in the minimum wage where a majority of the \nMembers of this body favor an increase. It would take about half an \nhour to debate that issue. We all know what that is about.\n  We could extend the unemployment compensation. Fifty-eight Members of \nthe Senate want to extend unemployment compensation but our Republican \nleadership says no and this President says no. We could also defeat the \nBush proposal to deny overtime from some 8 million of our workers in \nthis country. This is the first time since the Fair Labor Standards Act \nhas been enacted in this country, which recognizes a 40-hour workweek, \nthat we have an administration proposing the elimination of overtime, \nand we will come back to that. This all starts down in the White House, \nmake no mistake about it.\n  We have to have a President who wakes up every morning and says, we \nhave a challenge and we can do something about it. Presidential \nleadership makes an important difference in terms of the state of our \neconomy. We saw it in the early 1960s where we had the longest period \nof economic growth and price stability up until the time of the \ndramatic expansion of the Vietnam War, all during which we had \nDemocratic leadership. We saw it with President Clinton, when \nRepublicans refused to give us a single vote for an economic policy \nthat produced 22 million jobs.\n  I remember my good friend on the other side, Phil Gramm, who said: \nThis proposal makes no sense. Interest rates will go as high as the \nceiling of the Senate and we will have the unemployed who will circle \nthe Capitol.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  I remember those words. How wrong he was, and how wrong this \nadministration is and this President is about the state of our economy.\n  We have to have a President who wakes up in the morning and \nunderstands that the economy needs focus and attention. This President \ndoes not, and I will demonstrate why he does not.\n  I have the State of the Union speech: The pace of economic growth was \nthe fastest in nearly 20 years. This is the state of the Union. This is \nthe President's view of where we are nationwide, when 48 States out of \n50 find new jobs are paying 21 percent less than the old jobs.\n  This is what he says: The pace of economic growth in the third \nquarter was the fastest in 20 years. Productivity is high and jobs are \non the rise. This is the state of the Union.\n\n  Just a few days later he is speaking about the state of the Union \nwhen the President meets with the workers on his travels to \nSpringfield, MO: We have overcome a lot. That is because we are \ngrowing. The growth is good. New jobs are being created. Interest rates \nare low. A lot of it had to do with the fact we cut your taxes. The \neconomy is growing, growing, growing.\n  The President of the United States says that about the state of the \neconomy.\n  Here he is just a week ago at the National Governors Association: The \neconomy and jobs are on my mind. I am pleased the economy is growing.\n  Tell that to the more than 2 million Americans who have lost their \njobs under this administration, who are waiting for jobs. Tell them the \neconomy is just going hunky-dory.\n  Now what is happening? This is the projection the President has made \nabout job growth since the time he became President of the United \nStates. The difference between his projection and the reality is 5.2 \nmillion jobs short of his promise when he became President of the \nUnited States. That is the reality.\n  Take a look at what he said each year and where these promises have \ncome out. When we take a look at the year 2002 promise by the purple \nline, these are the projections of growth. Well, then he comes back to \n2003. That is not going to happen. We are going to come back to 2003. \nThis is the millions of jobs that are going to grow in the United \nStates. It is going to be that green line. No, no, that is not right; \n2002 was not right. I am going to tell you what is going to happen in \n2003. It is going to be this level.\n  The fact is, this is the red line and it is constantly down. Why does \nthe President constantly misrepresent what is happening in terms of \njobs across this country? The fact is, people are hurting.\n  We can look at the restored economy. The President refers to the \nstate of the economy and how the recession is over. Look at the state \nof comparing the current recovery to the recoveries over the period of \nthe last 40 or 50 years. Let's look at job growth recoveries even \nbefore 1991. The recoveries from 1991 to 1993 under the Democratic \nadministration, look at the job growth going up. Look at where the jobs \nare occurring under the current recovery, and this President says \neverything is hunky-dory?\n  Talk about jobs, look at the record. The record speaks for itself. \nLook at what is happening to the average wage of jobs lost in 2001 and \nthe average wage of jobs created today. This is the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. The average wage in 2001 of jobs lost was $44,570. The \naverage wage of jobs gained is $35,000. That is a 21-percent reduction \nin the average wage between 2001 and today.\n  This President says in the State of the Union that everything is \nfine. Economic growth is at the fastest rate in 20 years, jobs are on \nthe rise.\n  This is what is happening out in real America. This is happening out \nacross this country. It is happening not only in the Northeast, it is \nhappening in South Carolina, which has lost more manufacturing jobs per \npopulation than any other State in the country, let alone what is \nhappening in the Midwest and the Southwest.\n  Look at this chart, which is an indicator of what happens to wages \nwhen coming out of a recession. The President said we had inherited a \nrecession but now everything is going well.\n  We have had these series of recessions from the 1990s all the way up \nto 2000. In the fourth quarter, that is what the uniform measurement is \nto indicate, whether one is coming out of a recession.\n  Look at the increase in wages from $16 to $18, all during the 1990s, \nup to the year 2000. Look at the current recovery from 2001 to 2003: \nold jobs $16, new ones $15. There it is again. This Bush economy \ncreates new low-paying jobs, and it is reflecting itself across this \ncountry.\n  This chart shows the States with jobs shifting to lower paying \nindustries. The darker green are all the States where that has \nhappened. There are two States, Nebraska and Nevada, in the country \nwhere the new jobs are paying more than the old jobs. They are the only \ntwo States. In the other 48 States, new jobs are paying an average 21 \npercent less.\n  That is happening. Not only are we over 2 million jobs below where we \nwere when this President took office, but even the new jobs that are \nbeing created under this administration are tragically low paying.\n  In terms of what they are doing to the families, the result of this \nis very clear. This is just a very quick picture of what is happening \nto families under this administration. You have 13 million children, \nnow, who are going hungry. You have 8 million Americans who are \nunemployed, and 8 million Americans who fear they are going to lose \novertime. This isn't bad enough about what is happening to wages, but \nnow the administration says it is going to take overtime pay away from \nworkers. We might have a lot of economic problems in this country, but \nthe idea that firefighters, policemen, and nurses are getting paid too \nmuch doesn't appear to me to be one of them. It does to the \nadministration.\n  Look what has happened. We have 7 million workers waiting 7 years for \na raise in the minimum wage. Where are the Members in the Republican \nleadership? When is this President going to say 7 years at $5.15 is too \nlittle in this country? We have a majority of the Members of this body \nwho will vote for an increase in the minimum wage. Why are you stifling \nthat? Why do you block it, year after year after year? That is the \nrecord, 7 million.\n  The recipients of the minimum wage are mostly women, 62 percent \nwomen. It is a women's issue. It is a children's issue because one-\nthird of the women have children. It is a children's issue and a \nwomen's issue. We don't want to hear from the other side about family \nvalues anymore. These are families, single women, trying to bring up \ntheir children. It is a civil rights issue. Most of those who earn the \nminimum wage are men and women of color. And it is a fairness issue. \nAll Americans understand fairness. They say if you work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, you should not live in poverty.\n  But, no, we can't even get a vote. We can't even get accountability. \nEverything is going fine. That is what the President said in the State \nof the Union. That is what he just told the Nation's Governors. \nEverything is fine. Everything is good.\n  Now the Senator from Connecticut has a concrete proposal to do \nsomething about it, and he is denied the opportunity to get a vote up \nor down. What is with this Republican leadership?\n  These are some of the challenges we are facing. I will just give an \nexample of what has happened in recent times, in terms of our recovery. \nWe hear how well things are going on Wall Street. We have heard that \ntime in and time out. Look at this chart. This is ``The Corporate \nProfits Ballooned Compared to Workers' Wages.''\n  Look at what happens, the difference between wages and corporate \nprofits for the economic recoveries during the 1990s: 60 percent of the \nexpansion of the economy went to wages; 39 percent went to corporate \nprofits. Now, in the year 2002, look at today's recovery: 86 percent is \ngoing to profits and 13 percent to wages.\n  You wonder why workers aren't getting paid as much? There it is, it \nis as clear as can be. There may be a chart here you might be able to \nexplain, but you can't explain them all. You can't explain the number \nof children in poverty, the number of children who are hungry. You \ncan't explain the allocation of wages and what is happening in\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nreal wages. You can't explain the fact that 48 out of the 50 States are \nlosing good-paying jobs that are being replaced with jobs that don't \npay as much. This economy needs focus, it needs attention, and it needs \naction.\n\n  The proposal of the Senator from Connecticut is action. We have \ndebated it, discussed it, but somehow we have a sense we get a slow \nwalk around here, a slow walk. We are being denied the opportunity to \nget a chance to address some of these issues. Why aren't we getting a \nchance to address some of these issues on unemployment? We have 58 \nMembers of this body, Republican and Democrat alike, who want to extend \nthe unemployment compensation to workers who have worked hard and paid \ninto that fund. The fund is $15 billion in surplus which these workers \npaid in. The total cost of the proposal of the Senator from Washington \nis $5.5 billion. It will still be in surplus.\n  We have 90,000 workers a week--listen to this. Mr. President, 90,000 \nworkers a week across this country are losing their unemployment \ncompensation; 90,000 a week. That is per week. That is happening all \nacross this country. These are men and women who have paid into the \nunemployment compensation fund. Generally, when we have had these kinds \nof economic crisis, we have extended the unemployment compensation to \nworkers when we have a decline in the economy. Does anyone in the world \nbelieve that workers in 48 out of 50 States who are losing their jobs, \nwho are seeing a decline in their income, that it is their fault? Of \ncourse it is not their fault. It is the failed economic policies.\n  You know, it would be one thing if we had an administration and \nPresident who said: Oh, yes, that is right. But here we just have \nstatements after statements about how well it is all going for workers \nacross this country, and that just is not so. That is of central \nconcern to families all across this Nation.\n  We have an opportunity this morning to make a small downpayment with \nthe Dodd amendment. It demands action. It makes sense. It will do \nsomething--not everything, but it will be a strong indication to \nworkers in this country that we are taking their plight seriously and \nthat we want action on their behalf. That is what the Dodd amendment \nis. It would be absolutely irresponsible if this body refused to give \nus a chance to get a vote on this kind of amendment. It is so important \nfor workers, for families in this country. It would send such a message \nto families across this country that this institution hears what is \nhappening to their children, to the young people, to the families who \ncan no longer afford the college tuition that has been exploding; to \nthe families who can't afford the prescription drugs because the costs \nescalated so dramatically over this period of time.\n  To all of those families and the families who are losing their \nunemployment compensation, who are going to have difficulty paying the \nmortgage and putting food on the table and looking out for their \nchildren, this is a family issue, a fairness issue, and the Dodd \namendment moves us in the right direction.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I raise an issue, because it has been raised in the last 24 \nhours or so, that one of the things the administration is doing is \nputting resources into vocational education, education and job \ntraining. I know my colleague, from his extensive work in this area, \nand knowing the committees we serve on together deal with some of these \nissues, but you might just recount what the proposals are in vocational \neducation, job training, all of these programs that would put more \nresources out there to make it possible when people lose their jobs to \nfind additional work. Isn't it a fact we are cutting back in these \nbudgets?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. The Senator probably \nremembers the State of the Union speech where the President announced a \nnew program in association with community colleges--$250 million. Then \nhe went out the next couple of days and went to community colleges and \nworked with local workforce groups about this issue.\n  At the same time, they have cut $800 million from the identical \ntraining programs in the last two budgets. That is the record. We can \ngo back. I haven't got the appropriations here, but I know it. I am \nfamiliar with it because we resisted it and we had amendments here. \nAgain, there was an amendment from the Senator from the State of \nWashington to restore the training programs. Nonetheless, those \nprograms were cut.\n  You talk one way one day and another way another day. We saw the \nclassic example of it in the State of the Union. We were talking about: \nOh, yes, we are going to have a workforce community-based community \ncollege program to upgrade the skills. But in the previous year, and \nthe year before, cutting those work training programs. People aren't \nstupid on this. They know it. I am sure they know it in Connecticut. I \nknow they know in my State, on these workforce investment boards, what \nis happening and its devastating impact.\n  We had a strong bipartisan effort, when Senator Kassebaum and Senator \nJeffords chaired, as the Senator from Connecticut remembers. First we \nhad the JTPA, a program we worked out in a bipartisan way in the \ncommittee that was chaired by Senator Dan Quayle. People differ about \nSenator Quayle. He was a stalwart on job training. It was the only \nsocial program that passed, as the Senator remembers, during the first \n4 years of President Reagan and it took a lot of courage for Dan \nQuayle.\n  Then we went beyond that. Because we had over 125 different job \ntraining programs in 12 different agencies, we wanted to get these \npulled together, so we had a Kassebaum-Kennedy commitment to get \nworkforce training in one place. It was bipartisan. We began to fund it \nand then what happens? As soon as we begin to get life in that, this \nadministration effectively guts this program.\n  Mr. DODD. I remind my colleague, and I am sure he knows these \nnumbers, this year's budget proposal reduces worker investment programs \nby $400 million. So here you have 2.8 million jobs being lost in \nmanufacturing. Those people who cannot find work are getting jobs at \nfar less wages and salaries than they had in their previous job. Yet we \nfind when it comes to worker education and investment issues the budget \nactually reduces the amount we are going to commit to those programs by \nalmost a half a billion dollars. I wonder if my colleague has something \nto say about that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  I answer the Senator in this way. The Senator's amendment is so \ntimely. We have three--I believe we have seven, and I have others back \nat my office--national or international magazines. This is February 21, \nThe Economist, ``New Job Migration.'' Here is BusinessWeek, ``Will \nOutsourcing Hurt America's Supremacy?'' Here is Time magazine, March 1, \n``Are Too Many Jobs Going Abroad?''\n  These are national publications--national magazines. That is what the \ndebate is about. The Senator from Connecticut has an amendment dealing \nwith these very issues. Nothing could be more current.\n  Why aren't we getting an opportunity to debate these issues which \njust about every publication in the country understands is a major \nissue, and certainly every working family in this country understands. \nThe Senator has proposed an approach on this that can make a major \ndifference. I am troubled, as he must be, that he is not able to get a \nclear-cut judgment decision.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I was prepared to vote. We offered \nthe amendment at about 3:30 yesterday afternoon. This is a very simple \nproposal.\n  There are those who are for outsourcing. The administration has \nindicated that it is a good thing for the economy to outsource jobs. I \npresume there are people in the Chamber who share that view. Why not \nvote up or down instead of going through the gyration of trying to find \nsome cute way of avoiding having to vote on this issue or coming up \nwith some phony alternative believing that outsourcing is good for the \neconomy? I think shipping jobs away, destroying the manufacturing base \nand human capital investment that makes it possible in the 21st century \nfor us to be competitive in a global economy is the wrong way to \nproceed.\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n  I understand there are those who disagree with me on that. If they \ndo, come down and vote no. It is that simple, and the Senate can speak \non this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has put the case well. The other part goes \nbeyond the question about whether you favor that or not--the tax \nprovisions which have been included in the proposal which are basically \nsubsidizing. You have workers who are basically subsidizing the export \nof other jobs, which is being addressed by the Senator. You ask, What \nin the world? This is a matter of public policy. Does that make sense? \nSeveral enormously important public policy issues and questions are \nincluded in the Dodd amendment. They deserve debate and they deserve \naction on the floor of the Senate.\n  I conclude and remind our colleagues about what is happening across \nthe world. That is on this chart. American workers are working longer. \nAmerican workers are working harder. American workers saw their incomes \ngo down over the period of the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  These are all of the other industrialized nations in the world.\n  It isn't only these workers. Women in our society, women are working \nlonger and harder.\n  Our challenge isn't about American workers, it is about the policies. \nThe Dodd amendment gets to those policies. The American workers are \nentitled to accountability on it.\n  He has an excellent amendment, one that I support and which hopefully \nwe will have an opportunity to get to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have sat here and listened to my two \ndistinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I have to \nadmit I believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is one of \nour most colorful Senators in the Senate. He is a person I respect, and \nwith whom I have a personal friendship. But that doesn't mean we agree \non a lot of the things he says. In fact, we don't.\n  I don't think President Bush has been saying the economy is hunky-\ndory, to paraphrase what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \ncharacterized the President as saying. I think the President realizes \nthere have been lots of problems that have arisen, as each President \nhas had to face problems. He has faced them in large measure in a whole \nvariety of ways, but in large measure by cutting taxes, which now \nhappens to be paying off because we have gotten great benefits from the \ncuts in taxes. Frankly, 125,000 jobs a month are coming back. That is \nnot something to sneer at.\n  I might also mention we get nothing but screams on the other side of \nthe aisle that unemployment compensation isn't being continued. But I \nremember back in the Clinton administration when unemployment was, I \nbelieve, at 9 percent--certainly higher than it is today--and they \ndiscontinued unemployment compensation, and they controlled the Senate \nfloor. Today, we have a 5.6-percent unemployment rate, which is one of \nthe lowest we have had in years. If you look at it from the other \nsurvey, which I think is probably more accurate, it is probably lower \nthan that.\n  For anybody to say we don't have problems in this society today would \nbe wrong. But we had problems in our society through all of the Clinton \nyears as well.\n  By the way, when President Clinton came into office, we were \ndefinitely coming out of a recession, and he reaped the benefits of \nmany of the things that President Bush 1 actually did. He had a number \nof very good years. I don't believe it was because they increased taxes \nthe way they did. It was because we were already starting to come out \nof the recession and one of those cyclical periods.\n  Let me just say this: When President Clinton left office, I don't \nthink anybody could deny that in the last year of his term in office we \nwere starting into a recession again, which President Bush inherited.\n  To stand there and blame President Bush for everything that has gone \non is wrong, and it shouldn't be done. And to indicate that President \nBush says everything is hunky-dory, that there are no problems in our \nsociety, is to ignore many of the statements President Bush has made \nand that his administration has made.\n  If we had listened to our friends on the other side, over the last \nyear alone we would have spent $1 trillion more. Our budget would have \nbeen so out of whack we would never get it back.\n  Yet they are trying to tell the American people they are the fiscally \nresponsible party? We can't bring up a spending bill that they don't \nwant to double. They think that is good for the economy.\n  On the minimum wage, look, I suspect minimum wage will be increased \nthis year. I remember only one time when the Senate voted down the \nminimum wage, and that was because the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and others tried to overdo it just a short time after the \nlast raise.\n  We are talking about jobs, too. Just remember that every time the \nminimum wage rate goes up, all kinds of kids--mainly young African-\nAmerican kids who can't get those starter jobs--wind up being on the \nunemployment rolls, many of them for the rest of their lives. Some \nestimate it as high as 600,000 of them every time the minimum wage is \nincreased.\n  I think it is a great argument to argue about the minimum wage and \nhow we want to get people more money, and then turn around and say we \nare losing jobs in North Carolina and South Carolina without \nacknowledging the fact that the reason we are is because China is \npaying people 39 cents an hour for textile work.\n  We are either going to have to have the Federal Government pay to \nresolve these problems in every way, which would cost billions and \nbillions of dollars more, boosting up one aspect of our economy that \nbasically we have lost because of competition--or, we will all have to \nbegin to understand competition. This country is the most competitive \ncountry in the world. We are the most productive country in the world. \nHowever, we need to recognize and focus on our strengths.\n\n  In all honesty, if our friends on the other side are really sincere \nabout creating jobs, why did they refuse to go to conference on the \nWorkforce Investment Act? That bill has been put back light years \nbecause of the refusal to go to conference and resolve this matter. \nThis has offended the House and now we may or may not get that bill. \nThat would be a helpful bill with regard to jobs.\n  We should be wary of retaliation. I respect my friend from \nConnecticut, as well. But sometimes we do not think it through when we \ndo these broad, oversweeping things like preventing government \noutsourcing. We should be wary of retaliation against United States \ncompanies that get awarded foreign government contracts. Let me give a \nfew examples.\n  Entrust is a perfect example. Internet security company Entrust Inc. \nwas awarded a $17.6 million contract by BCE Nexxia for enhanced \nInternet security software and services for the Canadian Government's \nSecure Channel project.\n  By the way, you could name dozens of companies that are doing the \nsame.\n  ``The contract is the largest in Entrust's history and reflects how \nwe are collaborating with service providers to deliver solutions \ntailored to the government, financial and Global 100 enterprise market \nsectors we announced in early June,'' CEO Bill Conner said in a \nstatement.\n  BCE Nexxia, leading a consortium including BCE Emergis and CGI, was \nawarded a $37.6 million contract to build and manage a technology \ninfrastructure for the Canadian Government. The company, a division of \nBell Canada, provides communications services and operates an IP-\nbroadband network. Bell Canada is 80-percent owned by BCE Inc. of \nMontreal and 20 percent by SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio.\n  I could go on and on about this.\n  Computer Sciences Corp. of El Segundo, CA, won a contract to replace \nHuman Resources Development, Canada's network operating system, with \nnew hardware and software, the company announced November 15.\n  Human Resources Development Canada provides Canadians with employment \ninsurance, income security, employment programs, corporate services, \nand homelessness and labor services using several means, including \nwalk-in services, automated telephone systems, and self-service kiosks. \nAbout 26,000 agency employees use the network. The contract includes IT \narchitecture,\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nsoftware license arrangements, server hardware, and services for \ntransition, migration, implementation, support, and maintenance.\n  My gosh, one reason we are trying to do the FSC/ETI-JOBS bill is to \njump-start our economy and because we are being assessed $4 billion in \ntrade sanctions if we do not resolve some of these conflicts in our \nrelationship with the E.U.\n  Want to lose jobs? Don't support this bill or keep gumming it up. And \nwe are gumming it up with legislation that literally will cause even \nmore angst and will probably cost us $4 billion in the end. And that \nmeans jobs.\n  ``This is an important contract for CSC in the Canadian federal \ngovernment information technology market and further expands our \npresence in Ottawa region,'' said Tony Canning, president of CSC's \nCanadian operations. ``We look forward to serving HRDC in implementing \nand supporting the state-of-the-art networking system.''\n\n  In support of CSC, Compaq Canada Inc., Richmond Hill, Ontario, \nsubsidiary of Houston-based Compaq Computer Corporation, will provide \nserver technology and CDI Corporate Education Services Corporation of \nToronto will offer training services.\n  Digimarc ID Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Portland-based \nDigimarc Corporation, has extended an agreement with the Brazilian \nGovernment.\n  The Bedford, MA, based--that is a Massachusetts company, by the way--\nbased subsidiary announced Tuesday the Brazil Federal Police has \ncontracted with Digimarc ID Systems to continue producing the country's \nalien ID cards. Since 1997, the Brazil Federal Police has issued more \nthan 1.5 million of the cards to people who live in Brazil under work \nor immigration visas. Digimarc ID Systems provides hardware, software, \nmaintenance, and operations support to the Brazil Federal Police.\n  What are we going to do, have countries all over the world retaliate \nagainst us because we are going to have a bill here that is filled up \nwith this type of stuff?\n  Harris Corporation, an international communications equipment \ncompany, and RAYLEX S.A, Harris's representative in Chile, announced \ntoday the signing of a contract valued at $11 million with the Chilean \nGovernment. The contract includes the complete supply and buildout of \nthe world's largest microwave network. The network will cover a total \nof 4,500 kilometers, interconnecting phone services, data, video \nconferencing, and other multimedia services for the customer. Extending \nfrom Arica in northern Chile to Puerto Mont in the southern part of the \ncountry, the network is expected to benefit both cities' metropolitan \nregions as well as all major cities between Arica and Puerto Mont.\n  We are all concerned about preserving American jobs, but we need to \nmake sure the cure is not worse than the disease.\n  I am getting tired of cheap shots being made against President Bush. \nI got tired of some that were made against President Clinton and \nagainst President Carter, because I was here. It is time to work \ntogether and this bill is one of the most important bills in recent \nhistory because it will create jobs. It will jump-start the economy. It \nwill save us $4 billion in trade sanctions. It will help us.\n  We should not be debating this for days and days. We ought to pass \nthis bill. We ought to pass this bill and get it going. We have to \nresolve the conflicts between the House and the Senate. That is always \ndifficult, but we have been able to do it in some of the major bills of \nthe past.\n  It is misleading for people to come to this floor and just chop up \nthe President, who is doing the best he can, and who is a great sponsor \nand supporter of this particular piece of legislation, which is one of \nthe most important pieces of legislation with regard to jump-starting \nthis economy and jump-starting jobs in this economy.\n  It is time to work together and quit trying to make political points \nand get something done. I suggest we do a little less screaming on the \nfloor and a little more work and get this bill passed as soon as we \npossibly can.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2680 to Amendment No. 2660\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On behalf of myself and Senator Frist, I send a \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] for himself and \n     Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered 2680 to amendment \n     2660.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To protect the jobs of American workers)\n\n       On page 7, strike lines 10 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect 30 days after the Secretary of Commerce certifies that \n     the amendments made by this title will not result in the loss \n     of more jobs than it will protect and will not cause harm to \n     the U.S. economy. Such certification must be renewed on or \n     before January 1 of each year in order for the amendments \n     made by this title to be in effect for that year.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I rise today to offer on behalf of the majority leader \nand myself a second-degree amendment on behalf of the 6.4 million \nAmericans who earn their livelihood in our country while working for \nforeign corporations.\n  This amendment is very simple. It delays the effective date of the \noutsourcing provisions until the Secretary of Commerce certifies the \namendment made by this title will not result in the loss of more jobs \nthan it will protect and will not cause harm to the United States \neconomy. In short, it is a do-no-harm provision. Remember, 6.4 million \nAmericans have their jobs in the United States as a result of foreign \ncompanies doing business here.\n  Senator Dodd's fundamental goal of encouraging and protecting \nAmerican jobs is certainly a sound one. No one can argue with that. \nHowever, it may jeopardize many more jobs in the process of trying to \nachieve a laudable goal. These 6.4 million Americans depend on salaries \nfrom foreign corporations to feed their children, provide them shelter, \neducation, and health care.\n  If America erects a global jobs barrier, nations around this world \nmay retaliate in kind. This would put at risk those 6.4 million jobs I \nhave been talking about. These are real numbers, real jobs, and real \nfamilies put at risk.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Connecticut stated he was told over the \nnext decade over 3 million American jobs may be outsourced. \nUnfortunately, with American jobs at stake we cannot risk what is or \nwhat may be. What is, right now, is the existence of 6.4 million \nAmerican jobs, not over the next decade but right now, real numbers \ncalculated by the Census Bureau.\n  Let's just take Kentucky, for example. We have 104,100 people in my \nState employed by foreign companies or their affiliates. That is a lot \nof jobs in a State of 4 million people. It is a huge number of jobs.\n\n  In Connecticut, 116,000--even more than in Kentucky--jobs are held by \ncitizens of Connecticut who are working for foreign corporations doing \nbusiness in Connecticut. These pale in comparison to what is at stake \nin the State of Massachusetts--223,300 jobs--Massachusetts citizens \nworking in Massachusetts for foreign corporations--an astonishing \nnumber, indeed. Again, in Massachusetts, nearly a quarter of a million \nworkers, their families and their children, are put at risk potentially \nby the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut--real jobs and real \nfamilies facing real unemployment and real hardship.\n  For the sake of these jobs, I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt \nthe amendment I have just offered. The underlying legislation is the \nJOBS bill. That is what this underlying bill is all about: American \njobs.\n  It is counter to this legislation and our duties here as Members of \nthis body to take action which puts 6.4 million American workers' jobs \nat risk. That is not what we ought to be doing on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Finally, let's just drive the point home by looking on a State-by-\nState basis at how many jobs are in the United States as a result of \nforeign corporations doing business in our various States.\n  Let's start at the top of the alphabet: Alabama,76,800 jobs; Alaska, \n11,600 jobs;\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nArizona, 75,200 jobs; Arkansas, 40,400 jobs; California, 737,600 jobs--\nthe number of people in California in jobs as a result of foreign \ncorporations doing work in California; in Colorado, 101,000 jobs; in \nConnecticut, as I mentioned earlier, 116,000 jobs; in Delaware, 33,400 \njobs; in the District of Columbia, 17,100 jobs; in Florida, 306,900 \njobs--Floridians working for foreign corporations; in Georgia, 223,900 \njobs; in Hawaii, 43,300 jobs; in Idaho, 14,200 jobs; in Illinois, \n317,100 jobs; in Indiana, 165,900 jobs; in Iowa, 40,300 jobs; in \nKansas, 60,600 jobs; as I mentioned earlier, in the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, 104,100 jobs; in Louisiana, 61,100 jobs; in Maine, 33,400 \njobs; in Maryland, 110,400 jobs; as I mentioned earlier, in \nMassachusetts, 223,300 jobs; in Michigan, 246,500 jobs; in Minnesota, \n103,100 jobs; in Mississippi, 23,900 jobs; in Missouri, 105,100 jobs; \nin Montana, 6,800 jobs; in Nebraska, 21,800 jobs; in Nevada, 35,700 \njobs; in New Hampshire, 45,900 jobs; in New Jersey, 269,100 jobs; in \nNew Mexico, 16,300 jobs; in New York, 471,600 jobs; in North Carolina, \n261,600 jobs; in North Dakota, 8,600 jobs; in Ohio, 259,400 jobs; in \nOklahoma, 41,800 jobs; in Oregon, 62,300 jobs; in Pennsylvania, 280,800 \njobs; in Rhode Island, 24,400 jobs; in South Carolina, 137,600 jobs; in \nSouth Dakota, 6,900 jobs; in Tennessee, 148,600 jobs; in Texas almost a \nhalf million--437,900--jobs; in Utah, 37,400 jobs; in Vermont, 11,600 \njobs; in Virginia, 179,200 jobs; in Washington, 104,200 jobs; in West \nVirginia, 27,600 jobs; in Wisconsin, 106,800 jobs; in Wyoming, 7,800 \njobs.\n  There is an enormous number of Americans--6.4 million Americans--\nworking in America, working in our country, employed by foreign \ncorporations. We do not want to gamble with that. Outsourcing is a \nmatter of concern, but we are proud of the insourcing that is going on, \ntoo, and the fact there is an enormous number of foreign corporations \nthat have come into our country because they think it has a \ngood business environment, because they want to employ Americans to \nproduce products here in our country.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment on behalf of the majority leader \nand myself will be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator has made an extraordinarily strong \npoint. I noticed when he got to New Hampshire, he said 45,000 jobs in \nNew Hampshire are tied to businesses which are non-American owned. Is \nthe Senator aware the largest employer in the State of New Hampshire is \nnot an American company?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I did not know that, and I think that is a very \ninteresting point to be made.\n  Mr. GREGG. Literally thousands of people's lives would be affected if \nthat country, which happens to be England--our closest ally, closest \nfriend, one of our largest trading partners, after Canada--if that \ncountry were to take the view that is being taken by the Senator from \nConnecticut, that they should deny their companies creating jobs in the \nUnited States. That company would be closed down in Nashua, NH, our \nsecond largest city and our largest employer. Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was not aware of that, but it certainly illustrates \nthe point the Senator from Kentucky was trying to make.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield on that very point just made?\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not have the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have the floor. I yielded to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. DODD. I would just like to point out----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If we could have one at a time, Mr. President. I \nyielded to the Senator from New Hampshire for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was wondering if this does not also flow \ninto the issue of our ability to access other markets. If we are in the \nbusiness of trade, where 30 percent of the jobs in New Hampshire are \ntied not to being owned by a foreign country but being able to sell \nproducts to a foreign country--30 percent of our jobs; for one in three \nworkers in the State of New Hampshire, their job is directly related to \nthe fact that the product they make is sold overseas--is it not logical \nthat if we begin to close down our borders, we are basically opening a \ntrade war, and that we could potentially close down those jobs, too, \nbecause some nation may retaliate in some other way other than not \nallowing outsourcing?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, that is \nprecisely the point. I think retaliation would be the order of the day. \nI will give you an example in my State. The Japanese corporation Toyota \nchose to outsource from Japan to the United States over 8,000 jobs to \nGeorgetown, KY, to build the Toyota Camry. Eight thousand Kentuckians \nare employed at that particular site as a result of the outsourcing \nfrom Japan of those jobs into my State. They are high-paying jobs. We \nare extremely pleased they are there, and we would not want to do \nanything to jeopardize the existence of Toyota or the 50 or 60 supplier \nplants that have come into my State as a result of the Toyota company \nbeing there to send parts to the Toyota plant. Under their ``just in \ntime'' supplier strategy, they send parts up there every day to be \ninstalled in those cars, employing a dramatic number of Kentuckians in \naddition to the 8,000 who are there at that site.\n\n  So the Senator from New Hampshire is exactly on point. I thank him \nfor his contribution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator pointing those out \nin specific terms as to what the potential effect of this language \nmight be. It is using a club to address an issue which is an issue, a \nconcern, which is, obviously, our competitiveness as a society. But \nisn't the key to our competitiveness not to shut down markets, but to \nopen markets, and to allow products which we make better than other \ncountries to be sold into those countries?\n  Wouldn't this amendment in the end probably lead to a loss of jobs in \nthe United States, not only from nations such as Japan saying they were \nnot going to outsource their jobs, but our people who are employed in \nselling products overseas potentially losing their jobs?\n  Wouldn't it fundamentally undermine the whole concept of opening \nbarriers for trade, creating more opportunities for trade and, as a \nresult, lead to potentially a chilling environment which would have a \nhuge impact on our economy, the largest in the world?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator from New Hampshire is precisely \ncorrect. It has been the policy of the leaders of both political \nparties in recent decades to break down barriers overseas, to expand \ntrade, to move us into the global economy in a more and more dramatic \nfashion, the feeling being that America in the global economy can be a \nwinner and is a winner.\n\n  I think the Senator from New Hampshire is precisely on target, and I \nthank him for his question.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask an additional question, this is such a \ncrucial issue. We hear now, from the patter of the national campaign on \nthe other side of the aisle, that maybe we should move back toward \nprotectionism. This amendment to me is a stalking dog for that sort of \nan attitude. It is colored by fairness and reasonableness. But as a \npractical matter, its effect will be to create retaliation, as we have \ndiscussed.\n  I guess my question is this: Are we a nation that believes we can \ncompete in the world or aren't we? Are we a nation that believes our \npeople are smarter, brighter, and more productive than anybody else in \nthe world or aren't we?\n  I look at New Hampshire and I know our people are smarter, brighter, \nand more competitive. I look at Connecticut, a neighboring State which \nI know quite well. Every time I drive through Connecticut I am \nimpressed. I know it is built on smart, bright people. I suspect that \nis the case in Kentucky, too.\n  My question is, Are we so fearful of our capacity to compete as a \nnation that we must put forward this new concept which we hear \npattering from the other side of the aisle toward us of protectionism \nor should we follow what the great leaders of our Nation--Truman, \nRoosevelt, Franklin by the way, not Theodore, Kennedy, Johnson, \nClinton--stood for, which is that we are a nation that competes and \ncompetes well?\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We absolutely should stand for competition and be \nconfident that our own people have the intelligence and the ingenuity \nand the energy to compete in the global economy.\n  I don't think we should be afraid of this at all. I think the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is precisely on target. This is why the voting \nrecord of, say, for example, the Democratic nominee for President \nreflects a belief in free trade, a consistent pattern of voting for \nfree trade agreements.\n  I hope this bipartisan support we have had for breaking down barriers \nand competing in the word market and moving in the direction of free \ntrade will not be jeopardized in this Presidential election year.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, these Senators speaking remind me that \n``made in America'' has always been a badge of honor, a badge of \ndistinction--``made in America.'' It shows that America can compete. \nAmerica has competed and America has won over the long, long haul.\n  We have been hearing from the defeatist wing of the Democratic Party, \nnot from the wing of the Democratic Party that says the United States \ncan compete and win and can even do it from a position of leadership. I \nam not prepared to be a defeatist in international trade. I intend to \nwear that badge ``made in America'' with honor, as it has been for \ndecades and decades.\n  I think we need to remind the Senate now, after 24 hours on this \nlegislation, what we are facing. It looks as if we have from here until \nhell freezes over to get this legislation passed. Already we are in a \nsituation where the United States is suffering as a result of inaction \nby Congress. People need to remember that Senator Baucus and I worked \nvery carefully to put together a bill that would go through this body \nvery easily, and now we are seeing it stalled with things that may be \nlegitimate issues. But while people are complaining about jobs going \noverseas, this bill that was voted out of committee 19 to 2 is being \nstalled.\n  In the process of stalling, U.S. manufacturing is already facing a 5-\npercent surcharge by Europe, to the point where it is not a case of \njust paying 5 percent more.\n  It is probably the case with a lot of our products that our products \nmight not even be competitive and we are not selling. When you can't \nsell, people are laid off. So I think instead of worrying about \nsituations that you want to help for the future, we have an opportunity \nto keep jobs that we know exist today, will continue to exist, and are \nonly in jeopardy because of sanctions being put on our products by \nEurope.\n  We might be facing an amendment on overtime coming up shortly. It is \none thing to worry about people getting overtime, but if you don't have \na job, you can't even get overtime. So we have to get back to the \nbasics. The basics are what this legislation is all about--maintaining \nthe competitiveness of our industry, not going backwards.\n  While this bill is being stalled by other issues that are very \nlegitimate--and I have talked to the Senator from Connecticut about the \nlegitimacy of his issue and also about some modifications he made to \nget this through--it is holding up a bill that came out of committee 19 \nto 2. Those two votes were not cast by Democrats against the bill. They \nwere cast by Republicans.\n  This bill should go forward to get rid of that 5-percent surcharge \nthat we have on our products. In April it is going to be 6 percent, and \nin May it is going to be 7 percent. By the election it is going to be \n12 percent. That is the basic issue before us.\n  I also wish to address some of the things that Senator Kennedy said. \nI don't want to address them from my point of view. I wish to address \nthem from the point of view of the intellectual wing of the Democratic \nParty. We heard from the political wing of the Democratic Party by \nSenator Kennedy. So I would like to refer to an article written by \nRobert B. Reich, Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, a \nSecretary of Labor concerned about the rights of labor, concerned about \njobs. He also is an adviser to the Democratic candidate for President. \nHe ought to be listened to. This is what former Secretary Reich had to \nsay in an article, printed December 26:\n\n       It's hard to listen to a politician or pundit these days \n     without hearing that America is ``losing jobs'' to poorer \n     nations--manufacturing jobs to China, back-office work to \n     India, just about every job to Latin America. This lament \n     distracts our attention from the larger challenge of \n     preparing more Americans for better jobs.\n\n  It seems to me that what Secretary Reich is saying to the political \nwing of the Democratic Party from the intellectual wing of the \nDemocratic Party is we ought to be looking to the future, there are big \nchallenges out there, and you should not spend all of your time \nharanguing about stuff that maybe you can't do a whole lot about.\n  ``Most jobs losses over the last 3 years,'' Professor Reich says, \n``haven't been due to American jobs moving anywhere.''\n  I will start that over again:\n\n       Most jobs losses over the last 3 years haven't been due to \n     American jobs moving anywhere. They have resulted from an \n     unusually long job recession. Hopefully, that is coming to an \n     end.\n\n  It is, and that is my parenthetical comment.\n\n       We can debate whether the Bush administration has done a \n     good job, or the right things to accelerate a job recovery, \n     but job growth eventually will resume--\n\n  Parenthetically, we know it is resuming--\n\n     as aggregate demand bounces back.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       It is true that U.S. manufacturing employment has been \n     dropping for many years, but that's not primarily due to \n     foreigners taking these jobs.\n\n  Let me stop there. Senator Kennedy, do you realize the intellectual \nwing of your party says manufacturing employment dropping hasn't been \nprimarily due to foreigners taking these jobs? Then I quote:\n\n       Factory jobs are vanishing all over the world. Economists \n     at Alliance Capital Management took a look at employment \n     trends in 20 large economies and found that between 1995 and \n     2002, 22 million factory jobs had disappeared. The United \n     States wasn't even the biggest loser. We lost about 11 \n     percent of our manufacturing jobs in that period--\n\n  Wasn't most of that 5 years during the Clinton administration?\n\n       [B]ut the Japanese lost 16 percent of theirs. Even \n     developing nations lost factory jobs: Brazil suffered a 20 \n     percent decline, China a 15 percent drop. What happened to \n     factory jobs? In two words, higher productivity.\n\n  Parenthetically, that is exactly what we have seen in the U.S.--\nhigher productivity over the last year and a half. Last month was the \nhighest productivity in 50 years. You have to go back to July 1950 to \nhave the productivity gains that we have had.\n  Professor Reich goes on to say:\n\n       I recently toured a U.S. factory containing two employees \n     and 400 computerized robots. The two live people sat in front \n     of computer screens and instructed the robots. In a few \n     years, this factory won't have a single employee on site, \n     except for an occasional visiting technician who repairs and \n     upgrades the robots, like the gas man changing your meter.\n\n  I suppose I could quote the whole long article, but there is one \nother thing I ought to say. The intellectual wing of the Democratic \nParty is advising everybody, but it is good advice for the political \nwing of the Democratic Party as well:\n\n       We should stop pining after the days when millions of \n     Americans stood along assembly lines and continuously bolted, \n     fit, soldered, or clamped whatever went by. Those days are \n     over. And stop blaming poor nations whose workers get very \n     low wages.\n\n  Professor Reich asks the question: ``Want to blame something?''\n  If the political wing of the Democratic Party wants to blame \nsomething for loss of these assembly line jobs, he says: ``Blame new \nknowledge.''\n  Well, isn't that something we expect in the evolving world--new \nknowledge and making use of new knowledge?\n  He says here:\n\n       The Internet has taken over the routine tasks of travel \n     agents, real estate brokers, stockbrokers, and accountants. \n     With digitization, high-speed data networks and improved \n     global band width, a lot of back-office work can now be done \n     more cheaply abroad. Last year, companies headquartered in \n     the U.S. paid workers in India, China and the Philippines \n     almost $10 billion to handle customer service and paperwork.\n\n  Well, this article is probably summed up in a subheadline in the \nmiddle of the article, which says: ``Remember the elevator operator? \nJobs become extinct.''\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\n  Isn't that true? But in the Senate we still have elevator operators \nrunning automatic elevators, pushing buttons that somehow a Senator \ndoesn't have time to push or something.\n  What does the political wing of the Democratic Party want? Do they \nstill want people making buggy whips when we don't have buggies \nanymore? Times change, but the defeatist wing of the Democratic Party \nhas lost confidence in America. They don't think ``made in America'' is \na badge of distinction anymore.\n  There is one other reference I would like to make. When this issue \nwas talked about on ABC News on February 22, we had these exchanges \nbetween George Stephanopolous, Senator John Edwards, and Senator John \nKerry. I don't hear this complaining that I hear from the political \nwing of the Democratic Party from these three Democrats. I don't hear \ntheir suggestions for solving this problem having anything to do with \nthe amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. So I am going to quote \nGeorge Stephanopolous, as he has a short interview with these two \ncandidates:\n\n       Another big jobs issue has come up in the last couple of \n     weeks, the issue of outsourcing.\n\n  The very issue of this amendment.\n\n       The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for \n     President Bush got into a lot of trouble when he said that \n     outsourcing is a plus for the American economy.\n\n  We have been over that 100 times.\n\n       But when you look at this issue--\n\n  He is asking Senator Edwards--\n\n     what can you do about it?\n\n  Senator Edwards:\n\n       This is a very complicated issue.\n\n  OK, can we agree that it is a very complicated issue? If it is a \ncomplicated issue, I doubt if just President Bush is responsible for it \nor just President Bush is going to do anything about it. Anyway, he \nsays:\n\n       This is a very complicated issue. It has caused a whole \n     group of things. One is--the thing that actually concerns me \n     the most is that I worry that we are starting to lose our \n     edge in science, math, and technology. China graduated about \n     half a million engineers last year. We graduated 60,000 to \n     65,000. And since we are going to have the standard of living \n     we have in this country, in fact we want to improve it, not \n     make it worse. We always--it is going to be critical for the \n     American worker to be more productive than other workers \n     around the world.\n\n  Then he goes on, after a short comment by George Stephanopolous, to \nsay:\n\n       We--training, education. We need better and stronger \n     science and math curriculums, particularly in our early \n     grades. We need to strengthen our graduate programs in this \n     area. The other thing that we can--where we can have a real \n     image is we ought to build broadband high-speed Internet out \n     in every community in the next four years, because there are \n     lots of parts of America where it is easier for these \n     companies to do business in India and China because they have \n     access, and they don't have that access in rural communities \n     in a lot of America.\n\n  Every one of us ought to be able to buy into that, but it seems that \nSenator Edwards is speaking for the intellectual wing of the Democratic \nParty, looking to the long view, education and training, not some short \nsolution that probably won't work and might even do more harm than \ngood.\n  And then George Stephanopolous asks this question to John Kerry:\n\n       Senator Edwards says the most important thing to do is to \n     improve math and science education. Do you agree with that?\n\n  Senator Kerry:\n\n       It's one of the most important things to do. If you don't \n     give the American worker a fair playing field to compete on, \n     we're going to continue to be disadvantaged. I'll give you an \n     example. China manipulates the currency. China does not \n     enforce intellectual property laws. China and other countries \n     have not allowed us to have fair access to the marketplace.\n\n  Skipping down:\n\n       Education, I mean that's not new. Education was the \n     centerpiece of Bill Clinton's Presidency. It's the \n     centerpiece of my proposals. There are a whole series of \n     things that we can do.\n\n  Here again the person who is following the advice of Robert Reich \nrepresenting the intellectual wing of the Democratic Party is looking \nahead. I do not see these people offering any of the political sound-\nbite type solutions that have to be used if we are going to solve this \nproblem, which I would put in the category of the political wing of the \nDemocratic Party that we have heard from this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in Illinois, and I would say in Iowa, in \nNorth Dakota, in Connecticut, in Nevada--you pick the town, you pick \nthe spot on Main Street, and you pick the first person walking by and \nask them the following question: Is it a good thing for America that \ngood-paying jobs are now going overseas, that businesses are \noutsourcing their jobs to foreign countries and taking jobs away from \nAmericans?\n  You pick it, and I will stand by the results of that informal poll \nanywhere in America. You know the answer.\n  True or false: Is it good or bad for American companies to be \neliminating jobs in the United States and outsourcing them overseas? \nThat is what is before us. That is the question.\n  If you think the answer is obvious, it is not obvious to the \nPresident, nor to his economic advisers because the President's \neconomic adviser, Mr. Mankiw, reported to Congress on his behalf a few \nweeks ago that it was, indeed, a good thing we are now outsourcing jobs \nto other countries.\n  I am sure you are saying: I expect to hear that from Durbin because \nhe sits on the other side of the aisle, and he is bound to misrepresent \nwhat the President's Council of Economic Advisers says to Congress, so \nallow me to read:\n\n       One facet of increased service trade is the increased use \n     of offshore outsourcing in which a company relocates labor \n     intensive service industry functions to another country.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The basic economic forces behind the transactions are the \n     same, however, when a good or service is produced \n     more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than \n     to make or provide it domestically.\n\n  The commonsense answer to the question about whether American jobs \noutsourced overseas are good for America that you are going to get on \nthe streets in any city of America is not the same conclusion reached \nby the Bush administration in their economic report.\n  What was the reaction on Capitol Hill to Mr. Mankiw's statement that \noutsourcing jobs to foreign producers would be a good thing?\n  The Republican leaders, including the Republican Speaker of the \nHouse, ran from this report like a scalded cat. They disavowed it and \nsaid he was wrong. He put out 2 or 3 days' worth of corrections about \nit.\n  But the bottom line is, if you look at what has happened in America, \nSenator Dodd's amendment addresses the reality. More and more service \njobs--good-paying service jobs--are going overseas.\n  In my apartment in Chicago Saturday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the phone \nrings. It happened to me twice, two different Saturdays. I do not know \nwhy 4 o'clock is the right time, but maybe as I tell the story you will \nunderstand why it is.\n  Mr. Durbin?\n  Yes.\n  This is Nancy. I wanted to call and tell you that your Discover card \nis on the way.\n  Nancy, I didn't order a Discover card.\n  Well, we are going to send you one anyway.\n  Nancy, where are you calling from?\n  And Nancy says to me: I'm calling from Delaware.\n  Really, what city in Delaware, Nancy?\n  Pause.\n  I said New Delhi.\n  She said: No, Bangalore.\n  She was calling from India. She honestly acknowledged that, as did a \ncaller a few weeks later. So major credit card companies, such as Visa \nand Discover, are starting to use callers in India and other countries \nin Asia to call into the United States. Those are jobs lost in America.\n  I visited India 2 weeks ago. I ran into a delightful woman in New \nDelhi who said she had a Ph.D. in mathematics, and she was working for \nan American brokerage company, Fidelity. I know Fidelity. I do business \nthere. She handles their information technology in India. Is this good? \nIs it good for us to lose computer programmers, software engineers, \ngood-paying high-tech jobs to India and China? I don't think it is such \na good thing. But, frankly, the President's economic adviser says it is \na healthy thing.\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n  Senator Dodd comes in and with a very modest amendment says: Perhaps \nwhen it comes to our own Government work, we should draw the line on \nwhether or not the Federal Government will give money to an entity \nwhich turns around and outsources jobs overseas. He makes exceptions. \nSenator Dodd, in his amendment, says if it is necessary for national \nsecurity, then we will waive it, or if the service to be performed is \nnot capable of being performed in the United States, we will waive it. \nI believe there is also a waiver if the country where the jobs are \ngoing to be placed allows the United States to contract for services \nthere so there is some reciprocity.\n  This is an extremely reasonable and sensible amendment. But if you \nwill listen to my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, they \nare scared to death of this amendment. They do not want to vote on it. \nIn their heart of hearts, they obviously agree with Mr. Mankiw. They \nthink the outsourcing of jobs overseas is a healthy thing. I do not. \nBut I would defy any of my colleagues to go home to Main Street--you \npick the town--and defend it. Say to the people that the 4,000 jobs \nthat leave IBM and go to India is a good thing for America. I don't \nbelieve it is.\n\n  Senator Dodd has made a modest proposal that says let's stop the \nbleeding. Let's start talking about jobs in America. Let's try to go \nbeyond the obvious, and that is this economy is in recession and \nstruggling to recover, and start talking about focusing on jobs in \nAmerica.\n  I voted for free trade. I believe in trade. I believe globalization \nis as inevitable as gravity. It is happening. It is going to happen. \nBut I continue to be concerned that when it comes to these trade \nagreements, the first thing our negotiators do, after we pass them into \nlaw, is to wave the white flag and say: We surrender; come take \nadvantage of the United States. And people do.\n  It has happened to us time and again. It has happened to us in the \nmanufacturing of durable goods. Steel is a good illustration. Japan, \nBrazil, and Russia dumped steel in the United States for years and ran \ncompanies out of business. It cost thousands of steelworker jobs. And \nthe Clinton administration at that time sadly did little or nothing \nabout it. The Bush administration imposed a tariff for a short time and \nrecently removed it.\n  Frankly, our steel industry is, once again, not only weak but \nvulnerable because we are not taking a tough position in enforcing the \ntrade agreements for which we voted.\n  I am for expanding trade but under rules that will be enforced so \nwhen people engage in unfair trade practices against the United States, \nwe stand up immediately for the workers and businesses that are \ndisadvantaged.\n  Look at the situation in China. My friend and colleague, Senator \nSchumer of New York, is coming forward with a bill, which I support, \nand I know the Presiding Officer is involved in it as well, which says \nthe Chinese currency valuation gives them a 15- to 40-percent advantage \nover American manufacturers. What does it mean?\n  Companies in China are running American manufacturers out of business \nbecause they manipulate their currency. That is an unfair trade \npractice, and they are killing us with it.\n  They now enjoy a huge surplus of trade with the United States. The \nSenator from North Dakota said there was over $100 billion in Chinese \ntrade surplus with the United States?\n  Mr. DORGAN. One hundred thirty billion dollars.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One hundred thirty billion dollars. Let me give a \nfootnote to this conversation. Ten percent of all of the Chinese \nexports to the United States, $13 billion worth of Chinese goods, go to \none company in the United States: Wal-Mart. So when a person goes into \nWal-Mart and they see ``made in China,'' do not be surprised. This is \nno longer a U.S.-flag-waving company. This is a company which sells \nChinese goods that are cheap because they manipulate currency to the \ndisadvantage of American producers.\n  Senator Dodd makes a proposal. He says when it comes to spending \nGovernment money, taxpayer money, we are going to ask a question: If \nsomeone is receiving this money, are they going to create jobs in the \nUnited States with it or jobs overseas? If they are going to create \njobs overseas, no thanks, unless they meet one of the exceptions: \nNational security, Presidential waiver, that sort of thing.\n  I say to the Senator from Connecticut, I will take this proposition \nto any town in Illinois, and I know what the answer is going to be. \nThey are going to say to me: Senator, it is my taxpayer dollars, and it \nis not unreasonable for you to say that American workers should be \nemployed with those dollars. That, I think, is a reasonable approach.\n  What did the Republican side and the administration come back with? \nPicture this: They have an amendment which says--and Senator Dodd can \ncorrect me if I do not represent this correctly--that the Secretary of \nCommerce, Mr. Evans, a member of the President's Cabinet, will have the \npower to certify whether such an amendment, as Senator Dodd's \namendment, will harm the American economy. If he so certifies that it \n``will harm the American economy,'' it will not go into effect.\n  Frankly, the amendment does not even say when he makes the \ncertification. So the amendment guts the Dodd proposal. The President's \nCabinet will certify exactly what they told us. They believe in \noutsourcing. They think it is healthy to have outsourcing of jobs \noverseas. So do my colleagues expect the President and the Secretary of \nthe Commerce to defy his economic advisers? No way. They are going to \nsay that the Dodd amendment is a bad thing, that it keeps jobs in \nAmerica that should be going overseas where the companies would have to \npay a lot less for the same services and goods.\n  I want to vote on the Dodd amendment. I want to defeat this attempt \nto give the Secretary of Commerce the power to gut it. I want to vote \non it. I want my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and \nbe counted, and I want them to go home and explain their vote. If they \nthink it is unreasonable, as the Senator from Connecticut suggests, \nthat taxpayer dollars be spent to encourage American jobs in America, I \nthink they are going to find that the reception at home is not very \npositive. We have lost too many jobs in America, more jobs under this \nadministration than any President since Herbert Hoover. I do not think \nthat is a positive thing. I think it is a negative thing.\n  Senator Dodd makes a small but valiant and important effort to make \ncertain that our jobs in America and our workers have a fighting \nchance, and I stand in support of his amendment.\n\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Illinois for his eloquent comments. He made an opening comment and \nproposed that we go to any Main Street anywhere in the country and ask \nthe simple question: Should your tax dollars be used to subsidize the \nexportation of an American job? To equate the outsourcing of a person's \njob with that of a service or a product--as if somehow someone losing a \njob and knowing what that means, that that individual and their family \nwill have an inability to have the kind of health care coverage, if \nthey had it, that they need, and it is going to be difficult to find \nanother job, we now know--and I am sure my colleague can comment on \nthis--that that person who loses their job as a result of outsourcing \nand then seeks another job, except for two States, in Nebraska and \nNevada, the salaries or wages they are getting are on average some 25-\npercent less than the job they lost.\n  What we are asking to do is what any self-respecting government would \ndo, and that is to stand up and defend people's jobs in this country. I \nthink the question the Senator posed is an excellent one. I would point \nout, the Senator has the amendment correct.\n  I find the second-degree amendment rather amusing. It says the \nadministration--none of this language will go into effect unless the \nSecretary of Commerce certifies that there is some harm occurring to \nthe economy. So if he never certifies anything, this entire amendment \nfalls. It is kind of a phony amendment when talking about what to do.\n  I appreciate immensely the Senator's comments. I wonder if he might \nshare some additional thoughts on just what happens when people look \nfor second jobs and how difficult that is.\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, we have trade \nadjustment assistance, which was enacted years ago, which says if a \nperson loses their manufacturing job, a job that produces goods, to \ntrade overseas, they will have an extra advantage in that we provide \nunemployment benefits and give an opportunity for retraining.\n  We are in a new world now, and the new world includes not just losing \njobs producing goods but jobs involving services, and trade adjustment \nassistance does not apply. So the 4,000 computer programmers at IBM who \ngave their jobs to India and China cannot qualify for trade adjustment \nassistance. The Senator from Connecticut is right; they then get into \nfierce competition for the limited jobs available in America.\n  I have met with the men and women who are in the ranks of the \nunemployed, and they are finding it extremely difficult to find any job \nthat pays nearly what they made before. The first casualty of \nunemployment is their health insurance, and then, of course, their home \nand their savings. All of these things are casualties as Congress not \nonly is insensitive to this loss of jobs overseas, this outsourcing of \njobs, but even fails to include unemployment insurance for these \nworkers.\n  I say to the Senator from Connecticut--I will yield the floor because \nI see another colleague--if the election in November is a referendum on \nthis report as to whether or not it is healthy for America to see jobs \noutsourced and sent overseas, bring it on.\n  If my colleagues think they can rationalize the sending of these jobs \noverseas because Mr. Mankiw and President Bush's Council of Economic \nAdvisers happen to have some theoretical model behind them, they ought \nto take these wonderful Wall Street models to Main Street in America.\n  I hope before the end of the day we will count noses in the Senate on \nthe Dodd amendment. Let us find out how many people buy the Mankiw \nvision of the world and how many people buy the reality of this world.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Illinois very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleagues from \nIllinois and Connecticut discuss this issue. It is interesting to me \nthat the amendment that is offered by the Senator from Connecticut is \nportrayed by some as some very substantial, potentially devastating \npiece of public policy that could bring down the roof and undermine \nthis economy. It is, of course, nothing of the sort. It is a relatively \nmodest amendment, as a matter of fact.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, said he wants a vote on \nit. I want a vote on this amendment. They can second-degree it until \nthe cows come home, but in the end we will get a vote on this \namendment. If we have this kind of bill on the Senate floor, we have a \nright to vote on this amendment.\n  The central question that is asked by my colleague from Connecticut \nis this: Should tax dollars be used to send jobs overseas? I am going \nto have this followed up with another amendment asking, should we \nprovide tax breaks to send jobs overseas?\n  My colleague, Senator Dodd, says--and I agree with him \nwholeheartedly--we ought not to have the American people pay tax \ndollars into our Government and then have various functions of \nGovernment decide where we are going to do the essential functions that \nwe have to perform and then make a decision: let's do them in \nBangladesh; let's do them in Indonesia; let's do them in India. That is \nnot something we want to have happen with the dollars the American \ntaxpayers pay into their Government. Senator Dodd says let's stop that, \nwith some exemptions and some exceptions.\n  It makes good sense to me. It is absolutely the right thing to do.\n  I am going to offer an amendment which I will describe briefly. \nSenator Dodd talks about the use of tax dollars. Let me describe my \namendment, which is the use of tax breaks. If one is an American \ncompany doing business in this country and they decide they want to set \nup a wholly owned foreign subsidiary and they move their American jobs \nto this foreign subsidiary, make the same product and then ship the \nproduct back into this marketplace, they lose what is called tax \ndeferral.\n  We actually now provide a tax benefit if you do that. We say if you \ndo--shut down your American plant, produce the same product overseas \nand ship it back into this country--we will give you a tax break. You \ndon't have to repatriate your income. You don't have to pay taxes on \nthat income.\n  So here are two companies. Both produce garage door openers, both are \nlocated in the same American city. One moves to Asia. Guess what. The \none that moves has a tax advantage over the one that stayed. I am going \nto offer an amendment that shuts that down for products that are \nshipped back into this marketplace by companies that move their \nAmerican jobs overseas. We ought not provide a tax break for that. That \nis another amendment we will vote on.\n  Again, when we bring this bill to the floor, which is a tax bill, we \nhave every right to offer these amendments and expect we will vote on \nthem.\n  The second degree that has been offered just moments ago represents a \ndesire to prevent a vote on the amendment. Certification--this is an \nopportunity for an escape hatch, to allow governments, in this case in \nthe Dodd amendment, to keep doing what they have done in some cases, \nand that is to outsource jobs overseas.\n  This obviously plays right to the question of the larger issue. \nSenator Durbin said we have globalized. Indeed we have. Globalization \nhas moved very quickly, very rapidly. I don't suggest we can in some \nway bring it back. This economy is now a global economy.\n  What I do suggest is this: The rules for this global economy have not \nkept pace with the pace of globalization. We fought for 100 years over \nsome very important issues. Should workers have a right to organize? \nShould they have the right to expect they are working in a safe \nworkplace? Should they have a right to expect someone is not going to \nhire 12-year-olds to engage in labor that will be undercutting workers \nin this country? Do they have a right to expect they are not working in \na plant that is dumping chemicals into the air and the water?\n  We fought for 100 years over these issues and resolved them. Now, if \na company, or a government can pole-vault over all of those issues and \nsay: You know something, let's just do our business in Bangladesh or \nIndonesia or India; we don't have to worry about all that; we can hire \n12-year-olds and work them 12 hours a day 7 days a week and pay them 12 \ncents an hour and ship the product to Fargo or Los Angeles or Chicago, \nin my judgment there has to be some basic admission price to the \nAmerican economy, to the marketplace in this country. The rules of \ntrade have not kept pace with globalization, and that is what is at the \nfoundation of this great debate of ours about moving jobs overseas.\n  I understand why people move jobs overseas, why corporations move \njobs overseas, why some governments do. I don't like it. I want to stop \nit. But I understand why they do it.\n  It is about money. Huffy bicycles is the best example I know. They \nwere 20 percent of the American marketplace. You could buy them at \nSears, K-Mart, Wal-Mart. Huffy bicycles were made by proud people in \nthis country making $11 an hour in plants in Ohio. They used to have \nbetween the handlebars and the fender a little decal that was the \nAmerican flag.\n  Now that is gone. The last job performed in Ohio by the workers at \nthe Huffy bicycle plant was to take that decal off and replace it with \na decal of the globe. The American flag is gone, the globe is there. \nWhy? Because Huffy bicycle is now made in China. Not for $11 an hour. \nThose folks lost their jobs in Ohio because they were too expensive. \nThose jobs don't exist here anymore. Those workers were fired. Now \nHuffy bicycles are made in China by people working 12 to 14 hours a \nday, 7 days a week for 33 cents an hour. They come to this country, not \nwith an American flag on the front but with a picture of the globe. In \nmy judgment, this is an appropriate way to describe what has happened \nhere.\n\n  Huffy bicycles, if they had human qualities, would have to have \ncitizenship, and they would be American. But\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nsomehow they decided they didn't want to be American anymore; they \nwanted to be Chinese. But they want to be sold in America because there \nis no marketplace quite like this on the face of the Earth.\n  This is a big issue. This is a really big issue and a set of big \nquestions with which this Congress needs to grapple. We grapple with \npart of it in the context of international trade agreements. We have a \nmess. We have the biggest trade deficit in the history of humankind. \nThis is not about Republicans or Democrats; it is about bad trade \nagreements for long periods of time that undercut the productive \ncapability of this country to decimate our manufacturing base. The \nreason I care about that is no country will long remain a world \neconomic power without a good manufacturing base.\n  Just one piece of this the Senator from Connecticut attempts to deal \nwith is the increasing likelihood, these days, of companies such as \nEarthLink--they announced: We are moving our outsourcing overseas. Our \nservicing is gone. We are going overseas. Companies such as IBM: We are \ngoing to outsource and do our servicing overseas. And we also know that \ngovernments in some cases have done the same thing.\n  The Senator from Connecticut takes that small piece and says let's \nstop that. Let's at least stop that as we work on the rest of it. If we \ncan't do this, we are not serious about any of this. Don't come ever to \nthe floor of the Senate and talk about jobs if you are not willing to \ndo this.\n  I don't know of one politician who has ever lost his or her job \nbecause they were outsourced--not one. For that matter, no economists \nhave ever lost their job because they were outsourced. It is not \nnecessarily the case they would recognize it if it happened, but no \npoliticians or economists have lost their jobs because they were \noutsourced. If that were to happen, you would hear a different mantra \ncoming out of economists. If that were happening, what you would have \nis this Chamber full of people wanting to speak in support not just of \nthis amendment but of the bigger bites that are necessary to fix what \nis wrong with our strategy with respect to trade and the outsourcing of \nAmerican jobs.\n  Senator Durbin indicated that the President's chief economic adviser \nsaid to us: This is good. Outsourcing is good. I am assuming this comes \nfrom the doctrine of comparative advantage, the old Ricardo strategy of \nsaying you do what you do best, then trade with someone who does what \nthey do best, and that is the way the world works best.\n  Of course, Ricardo has been long dead and he described a world that \ndoesn't exist. He described trade between countries, not corporations. \nWhat is happening is the comparative advantage, as a doctrine, is not \nany longer comparative advantage with respect to natural resources. \nIt is a comparative advantage with respect to politics, and the \npolitics is this: If you happen to be in a country in which your \ngovernment says, ``Oh, by the way, if you try to organize as a worker \nyou are fired or you are put in prison,'' that is a political decision \nby a country that says we won't allow people to organize.\n\n  It is a political decision for a country to say we don't care about \npollution; we are going to pollute the air and the water. It is a \npolitical decision for a government to decide we are going to hire 12-\nyear-old kids in our plants, and we are going to let them work 12 hours \na day and pay them 12 cents an hour. That is not the doctrine of \ncomparative advantage Ricardo described. These are political issues and \ngovernments decide the conditions of production in their country.\n  Then we have economists who somehow say: Gosh, Ricardo described this \ncomparative advantage, so why shouldn't we access lower cost labor? A \ncountry that pollutes the air and hires kids and puts them in unsafe \nplants and pays them pennies an hour? That doesn't need an answer. We \nall understand the answer to that question. That should not continue.\n  I am going to conclude because I am going in a broader discussion \nthan Senator Dodd's amendment. But my point is this: If we can't even \ndo this small piece, how on Earth can we deal with the broader issues? \nI held a hearing recently about some young women who were working in \nmanufacturing plants in Honduras.\n  They were actually making clothing for Puff Daddy, whose name, I \nbelieve, now is P. Diddy. I get confused now sometimes when people \nchange their names, but Puff Daddy changed to P. Diddy. Apparently, he \nhas a clothing line and that clothing is made in some plant in \nHonduras.\n  A couple of young women in that plant came to talk to us about the \nconditions in that plant. It was exactly as you would expect. There \nwere circumstances where they had no capability to affect their \ndestiny. You are put in that plant; you work in that plant; and if you \ntry to organize, you are fired; you are out. The conditions were \nterribly unsatisfactory. Since that hearing, I understand that there \nhave been improvements in the Honduras factory I described. But that is \njust one factory out of many. Conditions there are bleak.\n  Is that what we want? Is that really the global economy that \nadvantages the American people? Or jobs that move from here to there \nand then we say but that is all right because, if you have young kids \nproducing this product being paid 20 cents an hour, think of how cheap \nit is going to be for us on the shelf.\n  I am sorry, with what income will the Americans who lost their jobs \npurchase those products? With what income will they purchase those \nproducts when their jobs are gone?\n  One of the interesting things about this U.S. economic engine is that \nit is the only economic engine on Earth that is as strong. But like \nevery engine, it requires some maintenance. What we have is people \nhanging around who don't want to maintain this engine.\n  Jobs are at the root of success in this country. There is no social \nprogram that is as important as a good job that pays well--none. Jobs \nare important.\n  When we have the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers--the \nPresident's chief economist--saying it is just fine that jobs go \noverseas, it is fine and you don't understand, that it will all work \nout--John Manard Keynes said: In the long run we are all dead. If it \nall works out, 100 years from now--as we struggle through and this all \nworks out--I guess none of us will experience that.\n  I am right now very interested in making sure that the rules of trade \nkeep pace with the pace of globalization. They have not. It is our job \nto bring them to present day policies and to debate them and discuss \nthem. That is what Senator Dodd is doing with one small piece.\n  Should your tax dollar pay for sending jobs overseas through \ngovernment contracts? The answer is, of course, not. Are you kidding. \nThis isn't rocket science. I suggest that my colleagues go to Main \nStreet someplace and ask the question, Is it good that your \nmanufacturing plants in your town should be required to compete and \nyour workers should be required to compete with someone in Shrilanka \nwhere they are going to be paid pennies and they do not conform to \nenvironmental laws and fire people if they try to organize workers? We \nknow the answer to that. This doesn't take a lot of depth in thought.\n  This amendment is a first. Senator Mikulski and I have one that deals \ndirectly on taxation. We are anxious to offer it. I suspect we will not \nbe able to do that until after the budget debate on the floor. This is \nthe first step of addressing the question about jobs. Anybody who \ndismisses this question of jobs fundamentally misunderstands the role \nof jobs in this economy. It is the enabler that enables everything else \nto happen. It enables people to provide for their families and to do \nthe other things.\n  One final point, if I might: I have mentioned this before, but I \nthink it bears repeating. It is just one example of so many towns, so \nmany workers, and so many manufacturing plants. When those folks came \nhome from their plant one night and said to their spouse and to their \nchildren, ``I lost my job today,'' that is a hard thing to do. The \nfamily wonders if they weren't good workers. Was there something wrong \nwith what dad or mom did while they worked during the day? Couldn't \nthey keep up?\n  It wasn't that at all. They have to come home and say, ``I lost my \njob\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\ntoday,'' not because I was making $11 an hour trying to provide for my \nfamily but that someone else was willing to work for 33 cents an hour, \nand that job has now gone 10,000 miles from here. The rules don't exist \nby which we describe whether there is fair trade, whether that is fair \nfor this country and why that is in this country's interest.\n  When the chief economic adviser to the President says this movement \nof jobs overseas is really a good thing because in the long run it all \nworks out, I say no, it is not a good thing if you lost your job. I \nthink if economists and politicians lost a few jobs from outsourcing \nthey might understand that a bit.\n  I will vote for the Dodd amendment. I want to cosponsor the \namendment. I am just one voice, but I hope Senator Dodd will say it as \nwell. If they try to second-degree this to death thinking that somehow \nthey will avoid a vote on the underlying amendment, as long as this \nbill is on the Senate floor, this is coming back and back and back. We \ndeserve a vote on the underlying amendment. Let us find out where \npeople stand. Stand up and vote on this rather than try to vote on some \ndiversionary second-degree amendment.\n  I know my colleague is waiting for the floor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I simply, first, wanted to thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota, and to stand in support of everything he \nhas said. Tomorrow, our friend from North Dakota will be chairing an \nimportant hearing. I will have two individuals from Michigan from a \nsmall town called Greenville. I appreciate the fact that we have \nsomeone who will be sharing their story tomorrow.\n  But just to reinforce what they said, this is a town of 9,000 people \nin rural west Michigan. They make refrigerators. They make Frigidaire \nrefrigerators, and they work for Electrolux. Of the 9,000 people in \ntown, 2,700 people work making refrigerators. They have added a third \nshift. They make a profit. Electrolux indicated that they make a profit \nin the United States. But they decided they could make a bigger profit \nif they moved to Mexico and paid $2.50 an hour with no health benefits. \nSo that is what they have decided to do.\n  We see a community now that is losing 2,700 jobs. When you count the \nbusinesses in the surrounding area that are affected, it is 8,000 jobs.\n  I agree with the Senator's conclusion. I said to the folks at \nElectrolux: At $2.50 an hour with no health benefits, who is going to \nafford to buy your refrigerators making $2.50 an hour?\n  Mr. DORGAN. As the Senator from Michigan indicated, at 10 o'clock \ntomorrow morning the Democratic Policy Committee is going to hold a \nhearing on the outsourcing of jobs to other countries. I appreciate \nthat the Senator from Michigan will be there and will be a significant \npart of that with constituents from Michigan.\n  It occurred to me as the Senator talked about refrigerators, the next \ntime you go to eat at a Mexican restaurant, remember that Fig Newtons \nare now made in Mexico. Why? They used to be made in the United States. \nBut Fig Newtons jobs have left and gone to Mexico. Why? Lower wages, I \nam guessing. Levis, Fruit of the Loom underwear, you name it. We could \nhave a hearing that would last for years if we wanted to talk to the \npeople who had good jobs in this country but whose jobs are now gone \nbecause even Fig Newtons went to Mexico.\n  I am anxious for the hearing tomorrow, and I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Michigan mentioning it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I think it is the least we can do on this issue. We \nneed to set an example. If we can't as a Federal Government set an \nexample for our own country through our own contracts and our own \noutsourcing policies, then how can we ask others to do the same thing?\n  As I indicated, we have one community losing 2,700 jobs to Mexico. We \nlost more jobs last year than any other State. We have lost over \n167,000 jobs in Michigan in the last 3 years. As I look at the paper \nevery day--literally I can go to papers throughout Michigan, from the \nUpper Peninsula to Detroit to west Michigan to southern Michigan--there \nwill be stories of plant closings, of job outsourcing or exporting of \njobs, and layoffs.\n  This is the most critical issue facing the people of our country. \nTherefore, it needs to be the most serious issue facing us in the \nSenate. We need to spend whatever time is necessary, take whatever \nactions are necessary and put in place a set of policies that stops the \nexporting of jobs, that creates a level playing field for our \nbusinesses and our workers. If we give them a level playing field, they \nwill compete and they will win. But we don't have that now.\n  We don't have that when it comes to the issue of manipulating \ncurrency, which China and Japan are doing. When it costs a Michigan \nbusiness up to a 40-percent tax to sell into China, and when Chinese \nproducts come back and are sold at artificially lower prices, and our \ngovernment doesn't do anything about it when we could, there is \nsomething wrong.\n  Why does China do that? They want us to move the plants to China. \nThey want to make it as difficult as possible to sell goods in China \nbecause they want the plants there. We don't want the plants there. We \nwant to be able to take advantage of smart trade policies and sell \ngoods and services to China, Mexico, Japan, and all around the world. \nThat is what trade is all about, and that is how we make it positive \nfor us. But right now we have a situation where instead of having smart \ntrade policies, instead of addressing those issues to create a level \nplaying field, we are seeing a set of policies that actually encourages \na race to the bottom by saying to folks in Greenville, MI: The only way \nwe are going to stay here is if you make $2.50 an hour with no health \nbenefits.\n  What does that say for the future of our country? What does that say, \nif any business could say that? The Federal Government could say that. \nWe will not have a middle class and we will not have middle-income \nfamilies. We will not have what has made us great as a country in terms \nof opportunity and small business growth, if we don't stop this.\n  That is why I am very pleased to be supporting the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut. We need to lead by example, and that is what \nthis amendment does. It says while we are asking that businesses in the \nprivate sector change policies, and we are asking others not to export, \nwe ought not to be exporting jobs either. We need policies that will \nstop that and invest in our own workers and in our own people.\n  I hope that rather than secondary amendments and other possibilities \nof slowing this amendment down or killing this amendment, we would be \njoining together--all 100 Members--in saying we do not support the \nreport of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. We do not \nsupport Mr. Mankiw's comments that exporting jobs is good for our \nfamilies, for our businesses. We reject that.\n\n  We come together saying the Federal Government needs to lead by \nexample. If we do the right thing and put the right incentives in \nplace, we can then turn to others and ask them to do the same thing. \nThis is about jobs. It is about the future of our country and our \nquality of life. I hope we will join in supporting the Dodd amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for her \nsupport of this amendment and also commend her for her comments and her \neloquent testimony about the 2,700 people in the small town of western \nMichigan of 9,000 people who are about to watch the economic vitality \nand livelihood of their community move on.\n  This has gone on, of course, across the country and is one of the \nproblems we face every single day, too often in too many communities \nacross our Nation. One of the aspects is the outsourcing that is going \non.\n  Again, we can offer tax incentives to try to discourage people from \nmaking those decisions, but in the final analysis they can reject the \ntax incentive and decide they will outsource jobs.\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n  We are saying with this amendment--and I appreciate the Senator's \nstrong endorsement--you may be able to do that with your own money, but \nthe question is, Should you be able to do it with taxpayers' money? We \ndon't think so.\n  We have created all sorts of waivers and exceptions for national \nsecurity. If there is no other source that would allow this work to be \ndone except by outsourcing, I have made provisions throughout the \namendment where the head of an agency--it does not require the \nPresident of the United States--can check the box. I assume someone \nwill say this will undercut our national security because we outsource \na lot of jobs in the defense contract area. Just check the box. If the \nJoint Strike Fighter is in trouble, check the box.\n  I don't want you to begin the day by saying it does not make any \ndifference if I outsource. It does make a difference. That is what my \ncolleague from Michigan is saying. It makes a difference. If there is a \nreason and rationale for purposes of national security, or because you \ncannot get the product anyplace else other than through outsourcing, we \naccept that.\n\n  We are not being difficult about this but at least draw that \nconclusion, not just the bottom line conclusion, that I can make a \nbigger profit off it because I outsource the job.\n  I am deeply grateful to the Senator for her comments about the \nunderlying motivations.\n  I can offer incentives and disincentives which someone can take or \nnot take, but when it comes to the taxpayers' dime, the money the \ntaxpayers, out of their hard-earned dollars, send to this city to \nsupport various activities, the fact we are using taxpayer money to \nship someone's job overseas, that I object to. I don't think that is an \noutrageous request at a time when we are watching the acceleration of \noutsourcing going on day after day after day. That is what my colleague \nand I object to.\n  I have been on the floor with my amendment for 24 hours and all I \nwant is a vote. If you think outsourcing is a good thing, and many \npeople do; the administration clearly does--their month-old economic \nreport, which the Senator from Illinois again referenced a few minutes \nago; I talked about it yesterday; here it is; it is not my comments, \nnot the comments of the Senator from Michigan; this is their authority \nin which they conclude that outsourcing of jobs is good for the \neconomy--then vote against my amendment.\n  I am not trying to be difficult. If I am defeated, I am defeated. I \nhave offered amendments and lost before. I am not shocked when I bring \nup an amendment and lose, but if you think I am on the right track, \nvote for it. But vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would the Senator agree on its face that it would \nappear his amendment is about whether folks support that report and if, \nin fact, they believe, as the Senator said, that exporting jobs is a \ngood idea, folks can vote against your amendment. This is really a time \nto stand up and say yes or no.\n  Mr. DODD. That is exactly the case.\n  Let me address the amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, \nMr. McConnell, and some comments made at the time of the introduction \nof that amendment which are worthy of note.\n  First, my friend from Kentucky went on and recited the 6 million jobs \nthat exist in this country where people work for foreign corporations \nthat are located in the United States and he went down each State and \nidentified the jobs. About 90 or 95 percent of those corporations come \nfrom the 27 or 28 nations that are exempted under this amendment.\n  My friend from New Hampshire talked about a large employer in New \nHampshire from the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is not covered by \nthis amendment. Someone else talked about Japan. Japan is not covered \nby this amendment. As a result of an inquiry made by my friend from \nMontana to make sure we exempted those countries with which we have \njoint procurement policies under the World Trade Organization, the \nlanguage of this amendment excludes those nations.\n  The idea somehow that these jobs in America will be in jeopardy is \nnot based on any fact whatever. I will be happy to list them for my \ncolleagues: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, European Community, \nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, \nKorea, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Aruba, Norway, Portugal, \nSingapore, Spain, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. \nThere may be others. That is about 90 to 95 percent, as best we can \ntell, of the so-called jobs that might be in jeopardy.\n\n  I suggest if we cannot have equal access to government procurement in \nvarious other countries, then we do have a problem. Of those countries \nwhere there is not a level playing field, for those that are for fair \nand free trade, as I listened to my colleague from Iowa talk about it \nearlier, the United States cannot compete for government procurement \ncontracts in India. We cannot compete in China. We cannot compete in \nthose other countries. If they are willing to say we can compete for \ntheir government procurement contracts, this Senator has a different \npoint of view. But we are being told we cannot do it. Do not tell me \nthat is fair or free trade. It is not--by any estimation.\n  I will not take a backseat to anyone when it comes to trading \npolicies. I supported many. I believe that is where we must be if we \nwill succeed in the 21st century.\n  I have waivers in here on national security. I understand there is \noutsourcing that goes on when national security issues are involved.\n  I have written a specific provision, just check the box. You tell me \nthis will jeopardize national security, the Secretary of Defense checks \nthe box. That is it. You can go ahead and outsource.\n  I am not trying to make it difficult for anyone. I don't want to make \nit more bureaucratic. But when I hear the Pentagon talk about \nbureaucracy and I look at some of the requirements for even purchasing \na personal computer, 38 pages, the idea is there of making a \ndetermination that something is in the national security interests and \ntherefore you do not have to do it.\n  Let me offer to my colleague from Kentucky an alternative to his \namendment which, if he is willing to accept, I am willing to take. I \nwant to get answers out of these issues.\n  Instead of his amendment as it reads, virtually nothing has to \nhappen, and nothing happens with this bill because he says the title of \nthis amendment shall take effect 30 days after the Secretary of \nCommerce certifies that the provisions of this title will not result in \nthe loss of more jobs or be harmful to the U.S. economy. If the \nSecretary never certifies then, of course, none of the provisions go \ninto law. This amendment, if adopted, would virtually gut everything we \nhave tried to talk about over these last 24 hours. That amendment is \nunacceptable.\n  If you are willing to say the initial certification shall be made by \nthe Secretary of Commerce no later than 30 days after the enactment of \nthis act, then I am willing to consider that because that requires an \naffirmative action for saying that outsourcing is what we want to \ncontinue doing.\n\n  I do not like amending my amendment with this kind of a provision. \nBut if you want to go that route, I am willing to listen, even though \nthe Secretary of Commerce is the President's campaign manager and so \nforth, and the administration is already on record saying they think it \nis a good thing.\n  I am willing to admit there are many good people who think \noutsourcing is a good thing. I am not disparaging people who believe \nthat. All I am saying is, there are a lot of us who do not think we \nought to be promoting it with U.S. taxpayer money. For those of us who \ndo not think it is a great idea--I suspect a lot of our fellow \nAmericans agree with that conclusion--we would like to vote up or down. \nIf you think it is a bad idea, as apparently the Senator from Kentucky \ndoes and the Senator from New Hampshire--and I respect them immensely--\nthen, very simply, vote against the amendment and shoot it down. Then \nwe will move on to the next subject matter.\n  But to clutter it up with amendments, suggesting somehow that you \nagree with what I am suggesting, or at least implicitly do, because you \nare not challenging the underlying amendment but, rather, offering \nsomething that, if\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nadopted, would make it impossible--unless the Secretary of Commerce \ndecided to change political parties and contradict his President and \ndecided he was going to certify something--this amendment requires \nnothing, no action on his part at all and, thus, obviously the entire \nprovision dealing with outsourcing would fall.\n  It is kind of a cute way of not having to vote on my amendment but, \nin effect, killing it with the adoption of the second-degree amendment.\n  So I have sent over, through staff, some alternative language which I \nam asking them to consider as a way, instead, of wrapping this up. As I \nsay, I was prepared to vote on this at 4:30 yesterday afternoon, or at \n5:30, whenever people wanted to, but there is obviously another game \ngoing on. There is the old New England expression: I was born at night \nbut not last night.\n  I think I understand the game. We are not going to deal with this \nissue. We are not going to vote on this, or at least we are going to \ntry to avoid voting on it through every possible maneuver. I regret \nthat, but I guess that is the way things are. I think it is \nunfortunate. I think we should be speaking. The American people care \nabout this issue. They care about trade. I think most people believe \ntrade is in the best interest of the United States. I agree with them \non that.\n  I also think it is in our interest not to squander our human capital. \nI think we need to do everything possible to see to it that we are in a \nposition to continue to defend ourselves by trying to do what we can to \npreserve the jobs that are necessary and the underlying industries for \nwhich they work so we will have the capacity to be able to build the \ninfrastructures that we need both for our domestic products as well as \nour national security structure.\n  I have 5,400 small manufacturers in my State. They are worried they \nare going to be cut out because there is always a better deal someplace \nelse. I think the short-term quarterly analysis that fails to take into \nconsideration the long-term implications for our country are dangerous. \nThat is one Senator's point of view. That is one of the reasons I \noffered this amendment, again, not because I am a protectionist, an \nisolationist--my 24 years here deny that kind of a label \ncategorically--but because I honestly believe this is something we \nbetter address now. If we do not, I think we will look back and deeply \nregret that we did not.\n  Let me stop. I know the Senator from Arizona has some thoughts he \nwould like to share. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I would like to begin my remarks \nwith my respect and appreciation for the knowledge and expertise that \nthe Senator from Connecticut has on foreign policy and national \nsecurity issues. I believe he is unequaled or he has few peers in this \nbody as to his knowledge and experience on foreign policy issues. For \nmany years, the Senator and I have worked together on issues that are \nof importance to our Nation as far as the conduct of policy and \nnational security is concerned. I have the highest regard and respect \nfor him.\n  I hope I can work with the Senator from Connecticut to remove some \nunintended consequences of the Dodd amendment; that is, the Dodd \namendment as it relates to defense/national security.\n  The Senator from Connecticut knows, as well or better than I do, the \ninterrelationships of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \ncommonality of equipment, the fact that many times we build an \naircraft, the F-16, a country buys it, and a lot of that aircraft is \nbuilt in the country that purchases it. That is part of the deal that \ngoes on. For example, significant parts of the F-16 aircraft that are \nbought by European countries are constructed there. That is also true \nwith a broad array of defense equipment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is also aware there is a huge imbalance \nas far as the purchasing of military equipment. In other words, our \nEuropean friends--and I will freely admit, because they do not spend \nthe money on research and development that the United States does, the \nUnited States builds superior equipment--buy a tremendous amount--by a \nfactor of 15 or 20 in dollars--of U.S. equipment versus equipment that \nthe United States buys from our European allies. We build the best \ndefense equipment there is. We continue to maintain that lead, and we \nare all proud of it.\n  What I worry about, in the Dodd amendment, is that this would upset \nthe relationship I just described.\n  Second, there are many times, many occasions when our troops \noverseas, our ships overseas, our deployments have to purchase from the \nlocal economy equipment, food, supplies, whatever it is.\n  So I could not certify that it is a national security requirement \nwhen the USS Enterprise pulls into a port and has to buy some equipment \nor machinery from the local economy which is manufactured there but \nfits their needs because there is a tremendous amount of \ninteroperability amongst ourselves and our European allies.\n  I am sure the Senator from Connecticut is well aware of everything I \nam saying, and I do not mean to insult his intelligence by saying so.\n  What I am trying to do--look, straight talk. I do not support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut. But what I would \nhope we could do is work out some language which would ensure, one, \nthat at no time would our military be prevented from purchasing goods, \nservices, or equipment on a needed basis, and, second, to preserve the \nrelationship we have amongst our allies as far as the purchase of \ndefense equipment is concerned, maintaining interoperability, and, very \nfrankly, the jobs which are the object of his amendment, the jobs which \nare maintained in the United States of America because of the \nproduction of a great deal of defense equipment which is bought by \nother nations.\n  Now, the reason why I say that is important is because, if we do not \nallow the purchase of foreign-manufactured defense equipment, then \nsooner or later they will retaliate by not purchasing ours. That could \nhave significant effect.\n  I have a rather interesting letter from Mr. Wynne, who is the Acting \nUnder Secretary of Defense, saying ``this provision''--talking about \nthe Dodd amendment--``would impact our ability to sustain our troops \nstationed overseas and the refueling and re-stocking of our naval \nvessels as they carry out their missions. Often times, the support of \nthese activities comes from foreign sources. . . .'' It goes on.\n  I know my friend from Connecticut does not want to impair this. It is \nclearly not the object of his amendment. So I have an amendment which \nwould make clear that there are exemptions for national security.\n  Perhaps better than forcing a vote on it, perhaps the Senator from \nConnecticut and I can work out an agreement to amend his amendment or \nchange the language of his amendment so it does meet these concerns, \nwhich I know he shares. If not, then I would be proposing an amendment, \nafter the McConnell amendment is disposed of, to try to ensure that.\n  I am talking now about national defense and national security. I have \nconcerns about the impact of the Dodd amendment which has been debated \nad nauseam. But I hope we can work out an agreement at least on the \nnational security/national defense side of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, who has been working on an amendment with me, \nand I will be his principal cosponsor on the amendment.\n  Senator McCain and I and other members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, in the course of last year's authorization bill, had \nextensive deliberations on the core issue with regard to how such \nlegislation, as proposed by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nwould impair our ability to work with so many of our allies on defense \ncontracts, and the high dependence today that we have on that working \nrelationship between a number of individual allies.\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\n  For example, the Joint Strike Fighter, which is to hopefully be the \nplane that will be utilized in the cause of fighting freedom by so many \nnations that are working on it, nine different nations are on that \nparticular contract. Great Britain has already put down $2 billion \ntoward that contract. At some point, I will put in the Record a printed \nletter written by the Ambassador of Great Britain in the context of the \ndebate we had on last year's authorization bill, which is directly \napropos of the matter before us.\n\n  Furthermore, I am going to hand to the Senator from Arizona a letter \nthat arrived from the Under Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, as he mentioned, and I worked hard last year, with the \nPresident and Secretary of Defense, to exclude some very onerous ``buy \nAmerican'' measures. It took an entire year before the authorizing bill \nwas passed, which is always very unfortunate. I want to ask the \ndistinguished chairman about another aspect of this.\n  Last time I checked, we have allied forces in Bosnia, Kosovo, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq from as many as 30 countries who have contributed \ntroops to our efforts in all of those countries, including the fact \nthat a number of those allied countries have sacrificed the lives of \ntheir young soldiers in the cause of freedom, particularly in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In fact, in Afghanistan we have a significantly expanded \nNATO operation. I say this with the greatest respect to our friend from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd. My question is--suppose we tell the \ngovernment of a tiny country that lost soldiers in Iraq that we want \nyour young men and women there, and we want them to be ready to \nsacrifice and die but, by the way, we are not going to buy anything \nfrom you. If you produce something that is a quality product, we are \nnot going to buy it from you because we are going to protect American \njobs in the United States of America.\n  My question to the distinguished chairman is, What effect does that \nhave on their willingness and desire to help us bring peace and freedom \nto the people of Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague, a \ndistinguished military professional in his own right, knows the answer \nfull well. It was given to us this morning by General Jones, the NATO \ncommander. The Senator was sitting next to me. It was given to us by \nGeneral Abizaid, Director of Central Command, which has jurisdiction \nover Afghanistan and Iraq. They are fighting in both of those areas \nwith coalition forces--again, troops being lost, life and limb--of \nnations that would be affected by this amendment as presently drawn.\n  I just observed where the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and \nyourself had a colloquy, which I followed off the floor. I think you \nare making progress toward the amendment that the Senator has, to which \nI have affixed my cosponsorship, which will resolve this problem. But \nit is important that we come to the floor--the Senator from Arizona and \nmyself, and perhaps others--to alert colleagues. You have men and women \nin the Armed Forces from each of your States engaged in the very \nconflicts that the Senator from Arizona has recounted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have one more question. The Senator and I, both in our \ndeclining years, have spent a lot of time traveling around the world. \nOne of the things that took me a long time to appreciate is the effect \nof what we do in the world. It is astonishing----\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Right here in the Senate on this floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. We have passed sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that \nneither you nor I have paid any attention to, and all of a sudden it is \nheadlines in the country it has affected.\n  My question to the Senator from Virginia is this: All of those \ncountries that have contributed troops--Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, \nand Iraq--they see a headline tomorrow that says the Congress of the \nUnited States bars purchase of any military equipment from the \nmanufacturers in these countries. How do you think that affects an \nalready fragile public opinion in these countries?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is quite observant in his long \nexperience. It is a very negative effect. I also bring to the Senator's \nattention that we heard this morning that we are thinking of reducing \nsome of our very large bases in Europe and putting a smaller U.S. \npresence in a number of countries--I mean, actually going in, spending \nMILCON, and putting our troops in more forward positions in this most \nuncertain war on terrorism. So it affects that, as well as the ability \nof that country to engage with us in military alliances.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dodd amendment \nand support of the McCain second degree amendment. The Dodd amendment \nwould prohibit any portion of work covered under a Federal contract for \ngoods or services from being performed at locations outside the United \nStates. This will do incalculable damage to our national security, \nundermine our relationship with our allies, and violate many of our \ntrade agreements with respect to defense procurement. The Dodd \namendment will spark a trade war in aerospace and defense trade--one of \nthe few remaining areas that the United States has a manufacturing \ntrade surplus. It will lead to the destruction of the U.S. aerospace \nindustry and the loss of thousands of jobs that will migrate overseas.\n  How can I be so sure of the impact of this legislation? It is \nbecause, last year, the Senate Armed Services Committee fought off on a \nbipartisan basis similar legislation from the House of Representatives. \nFor 6 months, this issue was debated in the National Defense \nAuthorization Conference. In the end, we narrowly averted a national \ncatastrophe that would have put every soldier, sailor, airman and \nMarine in harms way. This legislation, like the legislation from the \nHouse on last year's defense bill, marks a return to the days of Smoot-\nHawley and the Buy American Act of 1933, which were passed at the \nheight of the depression and extended the misery for so many Americans \nduring that decade.\n  The Dodd legislation would significantly change the Defense \nDepartment's industrial base policy and have a devastating effect on \nthe health of the U.S. aerospace industry. The Dodd amendment, if \npassed, would erase decades of procurement reforms designed to \nintegrate the civilian and military industrial bases that support DOD, \ndestroy our global aviation trade surplus, increase program costs, and \nsubstantially delay the transformation our forces.\n  One might ask how would such a well meaning amendment do such harm? \nFirst, one has to understand what has happened in the defense market in \nthe last 15 years. After the first Gulf War, it was realized that DOD \nno longer dominated many of the most dynamic industries such as the \ncomputer and telecommunications industries. To maintain and transform \nthe force, DOD needed to tap into this commercial market, but none of \nthese industries wanted to sell to DOD because of the extraordinary red \ntape involved with Government contracting. The Clinton administration \nand the Congress passed far-reaching acquisition reform measures to \nallow DOD to tap into the commercial marketplace. The Dodd amendment \nplaces this progress in jeopardy.\n  Under the Dodd amendment, the Defense Department would no longer \nrealize the efficiencies of using commercial buying practices, as many \ncommercial companies with a relatively small portion of their business \nbase devoted to defense would stop selling to the Defense Department. \nWhy? Because commercial companies will be required to identify every \nmicrochip, every part, all of its raw materials to ensure that they \nwere produced in the United States. As was the case before the 1994 and \n1996 acquisition reforms very few commercial companies will want to do \nthis.\n  As a result, the Defense Department will have to pay more for its \nproducts and will not have access to the most advanced electronics and \ninformation technologies from the commercial marketplace. Every weapon \nsystem in the U.S. inventory uses information technologies and \nelectronics systems no\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nlonger being made in the United States. DOD will have to recreate a DOD \nspecific supply chain with contractors that only support the Defense \nDepartment at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  To conform with the Dodd amendment, the Defense Department would need \nto require companies to comply with a substantial data gathering \nexercise, merely for the right to bid on a program. It is likely that \nDOD would have to impose burdensome compliance and certification \nrequirements which would expose bidders to significant liabilities, \neven in cases where a contract is awarded to another bidder. A \ncommercial contractor who may do less than 1 percent of its business \nwith the DOD is not going to expend this kind of effort for so little \nreturn.\n  To comply with the Dodd amendment, defense and nondefense business \nsegments would have to be separated, slowing the development of next-\ngeneration war fighting systems and increasing program costs. For \nexample, the aircraft engine business supports both civilian and \nmilitary requirements and is only competitive because of the economies \nof scale inherent in producing for both markets. To conform with this \nlanguage, U.S. engine manufactures would have to establish two sources \nof supply and two different production lines--one for the military and \none for the civilian marketplace. Military and civilian engines costs \nwould skyrocket and, most likely, the commercial engine market will be \nlost to overseas competitors because it will be cheaper to buy European \nengines. Thus, these jobs will be ``off-shored,'' something that the \nauthors of this legislation are trying to prevent.\n\n  The international considerations of the Dodd amendment are immense. \nthis isolationist, go-it-alone approach will have serious consequences \non our relationship with our allies. Currently, our allies purchase \nover 26 percent of their defense needs from the United States compared \nto less than 1 percent that the United States buys from our allies. We \ndon't need protectionist measures to protect our aerospace industry. \nHowever, if we pass this legislation, our allies will retaliate and the \nability to sell U.S. equipment as a means to greater interoperability \nwith NATO and non-NATO allies would be seriously undercut. Critical \ninternational programs, such as the Joint Strike Fighter and missile \ndefense, would likely be terminated as our allies reassess our defense \ncooperative trading relationship.\n  As a result, U.S. aerospace trade and the jobs and benefits that it \nbrings to the U.S. economy will be jeopardized. Aerospace exports 40 \npercent of its products. In 2002, the U.S. aerospace industry delivered \na $30 billion export surplus, the largest of any sector of the U.S. \neconomy.\n  What will the Dodd amendment mean for the budget? The cost of defense \nprograms would skyrocket putting even greater pressure on domestic \nprograms. Since companies would have to separate their defense and \ncommercial businesses, overhead and program costs will increase. \nBecause the number of companies willing to sell to the Government would \nalso decrease, there would be less competition, less innovation, and \nfewer new technologies in defense products. With international programs \njeopardized, there would be little or no cost-sharing by our allies \nsuch as the $4 billion invested by our allies in the Joint Strike \nFighter program, further adding to the costs that the U.S. taxpayer \nwill have to bear.\n  Overall program cost increases would force a scaling back of \nprocurement and R programs. Operational costs would rise as older \nlegacy systems would remain in use for longer periods. The safety of \nour men and women in the Armed Forces will be put at risk with this \nolder equipment.\n  Defense transformation and the acquisition of new technologies would \nbe drastically slowed or curtailed. The electronics and information \ntechnology building blocks would no longer be available from American \ncommercial sources for our weapon systems. This would disrupt existing \nprograms such as the Virginia class submarine, the Future Combat System \nand the F-22. An inefficient technology base serving only defense will \nhave to be constituted at great expense in funding and time. The long-\nterm result would be less equipment and technology in the hands of our \nwarfighters.\n  Finally, the aerospace and defense industry competes with other \nindustry sectors for investment based on a number of economic factors \nsuch as projected rate of return. The investment community would likely \nbe concerned about investing in an industry that would be cut off from \ncommercial sources of advanced technology, forcibly disengaged from the \nglobal marketplace and forced to rely on a single customer's \nrequirements.\n  Now the supporters of this amendment will state that they have \nprovided for a national security exemption. Unfortunately, this \nexemption is unworkable as it needs to be made at either the \nPresidential or the Secretary of defense level for each contract. The \nDepartment of Defense has over 500,000 contracts and many more \nindividual task orders on these contracts. This is an impossible and \nunnecessary waiver to implement.\n  Mr. President, again, supporters will also state that the \nrequirements of the Dodd amendment do not apply to procurement covered \nby the WTO's agreement on Government procurement. That is helpful for \nthe rest of Government, but most defense contracts are not covered by \nthe WTO, World Trade Organization. DOD has separate trade agreements \nthat cover defense cooperation. These include so-called memorandums of \nunderstanding with 21 of our closest allies, additional agreements with \nCanada, and seven declarations of principal countries, over 60 \nacquisition and cross-servicing agreements, and additional provisions \nin NAFTA and those that apply to the Caribbean Basin countries. All of \nthese agreements would be overridden by the proposed Dodd amendment.\n  The sponsors of the amendment have tried to limit the damage by only \napplying those restrictions to ``new'' contracts. This would be of \nlimited help, for example, on the Joint Strike Fighter. In essence, the \nsponsors would welcome foreign nations' participation and money on the \ncurrent development contract, but these nations would not be allowed to \nparticipate on any follow-on production contract. Under these \nconditions, the Joint Strike Fighter partner countries will leave the \nprogram and JSF will be terminated. It is simply that. And we \ndesperately need it in this country. We may have to foot the entire \nbill of the JSF out of our own military budget if this type of \nlegislation were to pass.\n  So my conclusion is that this amendment is not in the best interest \nof the security efforts of our Nation. It would jeopardize, as the \nSenator from Arizona has said, the efforts of our men and women in the \nArmed Forces as they work, fighting along with coalition partners in \nmany parts of the world. So I strongly join with Senator McCain on the \nsecond-degree amendment to exempt DOD contracts from the restrictions \ncontained in the Dodd amendment.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues. Please contact your own defense \ncontractors if there is any doubt in your mind. You each have them.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are at a stage where we are hoping to \nget some action on some amendments. This is an extremely important \nbill. This bill will provide a very significant break to all companies \nmanufacturing products in America. It is about a 9-percent deduction on \nthe costs of manufacturing products in States. That translates to about \na 3-percentage point reduction in their income tax returns. To a \ncorporation paying the top rate of 35 percent, that means they are \ngoing to have a tax rate on that production of 32 percent. It is a very \nimportant bill.\n  There are lots of different ideas about how this bill can be \nimproved. We have already adopted an amendment by the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, cosponsored by myself. In fact, this is a bill that \nSenator Hatch and I have introduced for many years. It will increase \nthe research and development tax credit for at least 18 months and also \nmodify it in a way to make it more attractive to more companies.\n  We all know the real pursuit is how do we get more jobs in America, \nhow do we create more jobs in America, how do we keep those jobs in \nAmerica, and\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nhow do we train people who lose jobs in America.\n  We are a wonderful and wealthy country. We are very lucky to be \nAmericans. People from all over the world want to live in America. I \nwill not say they all do but there are certainly an awful lot of people \nwho want to live in the United States. That is why we have so many \nimmigrants coming to our country.\n  We do not see very many people heading for the door. Not very many \npeople living in America want to go live in other countries. There is a \nreal reason for that. I think the basic reason is because we are a \ncountry of great opportunity. We are a country of great mobility. We \nare a country where a person can pretty much do what he or she wants to \ndo.\n  Sure, there are some limitations that some people face, depending \nupon where they are born or where they grew up in America, but still, \ncompared with any other country in the world, there are opportunities \nin the United States of America that are just wonderful. We are \nincredibly lucky to be Americans.\n  We are now faced with a question, though, of jobs and job loss in \nAmerica, particularly manufacturing job loss, and even some service \nindustry job loss. We have lost close to 3 million jobs in the last \nseveral years. Those are manufacturing jobs. Those are good-paying \njobs.\n  It is also true that virtually every other country in the world is \nlosing jobs, too. We are not the only country that is losing \nmanufacturing jobs. I will not be callous about it, but those are \nproblems that those countries face, and we wish them very well. We wish \nmore people in the world had better incomes; that people who are not \nthe most wealthy would be doing pretty well by themselves. But our goal \nis here in the United States. How are we going to get more job creation \nin the United States? How are we going to get more job retention in the \nUnited States? How are we going to retrain people? There is no silver \nbullet, no panacea, no magic answers that are going to solve this \nproblem.\n\n  There are lots of reasons why we are facing this, if we are totally \nhonest with ourselves, and clearly we must be if we are going to solve \nit. One reason, frankly, is just the dramatic increase, to use a fancy \nword the economists use, in productivity in the last several years. \nThat is, with ingenuity and with research and development and \ntechnology improvements, companies are able now to produce more \nwidgets, more products, more cars, whatever it is, with fewer people. \nIt is easier, then, for that company to sell products and make money, \nbut unfortunately a byproduct of that is it is with fewer people, fewer \njobs, so people are laid off. It is a huge problem. It is not only the \nshock of a person who loses his job, it is lost benefits, lost wages.\n  But some of this is due to productivity increases. It is a fact. We \njust have to recognize it. But having recognized it doesn't mean we \nshould look the other way. It means we should find some other way to \ndeal with it.\n  The job displacement that has occurred in America over the last \nseveral years has happened all over the world, in all developed \ncountries, not just the United States. It is because of the general \nnature of economies moving a little more to services compared with \nmanufacturing. Service industry jobs just don't pay as much.\n  This movement to services--it is like health care services. It is \nprofessional services. It is doctors, lawyers, accountants. They are \nall great professions, and they are services. But by and large, service \njobs don't pay quite as much as manufacturing jobs. Again, that is a \nworldwide phenomenon.\n  I might say, too, one of the reasons for job loss is foreign \ncompetition. It is true in many countries that because of the lower \nwages it is cheaper to make a product than it is in the United States. \nThere is no doubt about that. Benefits are a lot lower in other \ncountries. There is no doubt about that either. It is true, American \ncompanies, as the case with companies in other countries, have to be \ncompetitive. They have to be competitive; otherwise, they go out of \nbusiness.\n  Having said that, there are other reasons, too, for the phenomenon we \nare facing. We have to find answers and, as I said, honest answers, not \njust glib answers.\n  Frankly, I believe we have to focus on three major areas and be very \npositive. One is, How do we create new jobs. I would put a lot more \neffort into research and development than we now do. We should have \nmore basic research in universities and companies than we now have. We \nhave to figure out ways to develop new products. This is a bit corny \nand a bit dramatic, but it wasn't too many years ago--in the year 1900 \nnobody even dreamed of automobiles or airplanes. Yet somebody developed \nan automobile, somebody developed an airplane, and lately it is the \nInternet, it is broadband, it is fiber optics, it is a lot of new \ntechnologies nobody knew about.\n  A lot of that is because of the dollars devoted to research and \ndevelopment. It is ingenuity and opportunity. Persons knew if they \nspent time developing those products they could sell them in the United \nStates and overseas and they could make a go of it. They could make \nsomething happen. Just think of the joy of maybe inventing something \nand making it work and selling it. That is one way. We have to figure \nout ways to create new jobs.\n\n  Another way is we have to keep the jobs we have. That is complex. \nPart of it is the much more vigorous enforcement of our trade laws. I \nhave said it before and I will say it again: we hear of all these call \ncenters going to India, Bangalore, other places in India. You pick up a \ntelephone and try to order something, a credit card company or \nsomething, and find the call center is in India or someplace else. But \nwe don't hear of American companies selling products to India. You \ndon't hear of sales to India. Why is that? It is because India is a \nclosed country. It is a very closed country. It is very hard for United \nStates business people to sell their goods and their services and their \nproducts to India because India is a closed country.\n  They also pirate intellectual property. Billions of dollars of \nintellectual property created by Americans is pirated by people \noverseas. Various countries either do not have intellectual property \nlegislation or they don't enforce it. It is very difficult. So a way to \nkeep jobs in America is to be much more vigorous as we enforce our \ntrade laws, and this country is not enforcing our trade laws. We are \nnot opening up markets overseas the way we should. It is more laissez \nfaire, let things happen. If some country wants to close its market, \nfine. That is basically the attitude of this administration as I see \nit. I have spent a lot of years in trade policy and I cannot remember a \ntime when an administration was so laissez faire, so ``who cares'' when \nit comes to whether a country opens up its market to American products.\n  India is a good example. China is another example. There are so many \nexamples. Rather, what does this administration do? I am not being \ncritical here; I am just calling it as I see it. I am being objective \nin how I see this administration's trade policy to be operating.\n  Still, we reach trade agreements with minuscule economies: Bahrain, \nMorocco. Those are wonderful countries. But why are we spending the \nlimited resources we have in the United States Trade Representative \nOffice reaching free trade agreements with countries that would have \nvirtually no or very little commercial value to the United States? Why? \nBecause it is easy.\n  We should be taking the extra effort and going to countries, as I \nmentioned earlier, that are closed and have huge potential markets. We \nsell to India, a country of 1 billion people, half of what we Americans \nsell to Switzerland, a country of 7 million people.\n  Wait a minute. I know the per-capita income in India is lower than it \nis in Switzerland, but not that much lower, not by such huge orders of \nmagnitude. One way to keep jobs, again, is to enforce our trade laws.\n  We have to tackle health care costs in the United States, which are \nmuch higher than they are in other countries. There are lots of efforts \nwe could undertake.\n  I will now focus on one aspect of this bill I think is very \nimportant. I think most Members of the Senate agree with me. It is \nfurther reason why we should move expeditiously and bring up amendments \nso we can pass this legislation. We will be doing a great disservice to \nthe people of our country if we don't quickly pass this legislation.\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\n  Already the World Trade Organization penalties levied on the United \nStates amount to 5 percent of the $4 billion the WTO has said can be \nlevied against the United States now because the United States has not \nrepealed certain legislation which is the underlying part of this bill. \nWTO said that is illegal so we have to repeal a lot of it. That is $4 \nbillion in penalties levied against the United States products we are \ntrying to export to Europe. That is $200 million in this month alone, \nMarch, and there is going to be a 1-percent increase in each of the \nsucceeding months. Why in the world aren't we passing legislation so we \ndon't have to pay those penalties, so we don't have to penalize \nAmerican companies, and therefore penalize American workers?\n  One way to send jobs overseas is to not pass this bill. Every day we \ndon't pass this bill means additional costs of doing business in \nAmerica on products manufactured in America and exported to Europe. If \nwe repeal this penalty, then that cost to American businesspeople will \nbe much less, and that would help them keep producing and keep their \nemployees.\n  In drafting this bill which provides for a 9-percent deduction on \ndomestic manufacturing, we believed it made good sense for that 9-\npercent deduction to apply not just to C corporations--that is the \nstandard garden variety corporation--but also to virtually every other \ncompany in the United States, small partnerships, proprietorships, \npassthrough entities, and smaller companies that do not pay a corporate \nincome tax.\n  I would like to show a couple of charts to give us a little sense of \nhow U.S. companies organize themselves and why that is important to \nthis legislation.\n  As this chart to my left demonstrates, about a quarter of American \ncompanies are C corporations. The other three-quarters of American \ncompanies are partnerships, sole proprietorships, somebody in business \nfor themselves. Another entity called S corporations essentially means \nthat the owners of the corporation are liable themselves and pay taxes \nthemselves on the income of the organization.\n  About one-quarter are corporations. They are the big guys.\n  Going to the next chart, I point out that 99 percent of U.S. firms \nare actually small businesses. If you look at all the companies in \nAmerica and you organize them according to whether they are a big or a \nsmall business, 99 percent are small businesses. By small business, we \nmean 500 or fewer employees. Virtually every company in the U.S. is not \na big corporation but, rather, a small business.\n  That is important because the legislation we were repealing gives a \ntax break only to big C corporations. We believed that if we repealed \nthat--and we have to repeal it because WTO says we must--we must be \nsure we replace it with something much more broad-based. So not only \nthe larger C corporations but the other, smaller, American companies \nalso get the benefit of the provisions of this bill.\n  I mentioned earlier that about a quarter of American companies are \nlarge companies, so-called C corporations. They have at lot of people \nworking for them. About half of the employees in America work for small \nbusiness; about half work for big business. It is an interesting \nstatistic. Ninety-nine percent of all companies are small businesses. \nStill a full half of all employees in America work for small \nbusinesses.\n  Why do I say that? Because basically most new jobs are created by \nsmall business.\n  This chart shows that. Small businesses create jobs much more than \nbig businesses. Even though half of all employees are in the category \nof small business, still three-quarters of the new jobs--this is a \nhistorical fact over the years with small business. Small business is \nmore flexible; they can move more quickly; they see more opportunity \nright away; they can hire more, whereas big business takes time with \nall the decisions that have to be made going through all the various \nlevels of hierarchy. But small business is where the job creation is.\n  That is relevant because if you look at private sector jobs in \nAmerica, you will see the United States since 1994 has had a huge \ncreation of jobs, until the year roughly 2000. Since the year 2000, \nabout 3 million jobs have been lost in America. That is a net figure. \nThat is not gross.\n  I mentioned earlier that half of those are small businesses. I \nmentioned earlier that job creation is generally through small \nbusiness, not big business.\n  I also mentioned before, to repeat myself, this bill says: OK. We \ndon't care whether you are a big or small business; you can still get \nthat 9-percent deduction.\n  That is why I think this is a very good bill. I say that in part \nbecause there are other versions of this legislation in Washington that \ndo not extend the same treatment to small business but essentially only \nto larger businesses.\n  I hope when we move on this bill and pass it and take it to the next \nstages that we keep in mind the importance of small business and keep \nin mind that we must retain the small business provisions in this bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Dodd be recognized to modify his amendment; provided further \nthat the McConnell second-degree amendment be modified further with the \nchanges that are at the desk, and it then be agreed to; provided \nfurther that I be recognized in order to call up a further second-\ndegree amendment on behalf of Senator McCain, and that following the \nreporting of the amendment it be agreed to.\n  I further ask consent that the time until 4 today be equally divided \nfor debate; that at 4 the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of \nthe Dodd amendment, as amended, without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, a lot of work has gone into this \narrangement that we are now going to approve shortly. Everyone is to be \ncommended. Senator Dodd spent the last 24 hours or more on this \nfloor. Senator Baucus has been very patient, waiting to have this bill \nmove forward. He and Senator Grassley feel so strongly about and I \nthink the majority of the Senate feel strongly about this.\n\n  I don't mean to burden the acting majority leader but I do want to \nsay very simply, we have tried to be as upfront as we can be with what \nwe want to accomplish with this most important legislation. We have an \namendment that we want to get to. We agreed on the Dodd amendment to \ntake 1 hour evenly divided. We understand the next amendment to be the \namendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nMichigan, Senators Bunning and Stabenow. Senator Stabenow--it was her \namendment and it has not changed at all; it is just who has their name \non it first--was willing to take an hour evenly divided. We could \nfinish this vote at 4:20, go to that, finish at 5:20, and go to our \nnext amendment in order, which, as everyone knows, is the overtime \namendment which the Democratic leader will offer for Senator Harkin, or \nSenator Harkin will offer for himself.\n  I don't understand why so much effort is being made to avoid a vote \non that amendment. We have been told on the Bunning amendment what will \nhappen. Rather than filling the tree with amendments that are good and \nwill improve this legislation, tax extenders and things of that nature, \nthere is going to be an amendment offered by the majority to fill the \ntree so there can be no amendments offered, or, in fact, the Harkin \namendment could be offered to speed this up.\n  I think we need to get this matter finished. We, on our side, believe \nthis is very important legislation. Yes, we want to talk about \noutsourcing, and we have done that. Yes, we want to talk about \novertime. We have not been able to have a vote on that because of the \nparliamentary barriers thrown up by the majority.\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n  I hope we can get past that, move on, and get this most important \nlegislation passed. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2660, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. I send a modification to the Dodd amendment to the desk and \nask it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2660), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n   TITLE V--PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES WORKERS FROM COMPETITION OF \n                           FOREIGN WORKFORCES\n\n     SEC. 501.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 2685 To Amendment No. 2660, As Modified And Amended\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 2685 \n     to amendment No. 2660, as modified and amended.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect United States workers from competition of foreign \n       workforces for performance of Federal and State contracts)\n\n       On page 5, insert after line 16 the following:\n       (e) National Security Exemption.--Subsection (b) shall not \n     apply to any procurement for national security purposes \n     entered into by:\n       (1) the Department of Defense or any agency or entity \n     thereof;\n       (2) the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, \n     the Department of the Air Force, or any agency or entity of \n     any of the military departments;\n       (3) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (4) the Department of Energy or any agency or entity \n     thereof, with respect to the national security programs of \n     that Department; or\n       (5) any element of the intelligence community.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2685) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, what is the order now?\n  Mr. THOMAS. The time will be equally divided now, as I understand.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. How much time do we have?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Until 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is evenly divided until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me take a couple of minutes and, first, explain what \nhas transpired in the last number of seconds. It is rather a quick \naction on a number of hours of discussion.\n  First, let me thank Senator McCain and Senator McConnell for their \nwillingness to work on some language. I thank the leader, Senator \nDaschle. Senator Baucus, of course, has worked tirelessly, and Senator \nGrassley, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and many others have \nbeen involved in their comments.\n  This is a significant breakthrough occurring with the adoption, I \nhope we will have now, of my amendment. It says you should not be using \nFederal taxpayer money to subsidize the outsourcing of jobs.\n  The McCain amendment is something we fundamentally agreed to in the \nunderlying amendment, but it reinforces the notion that certainly, when \nnational security issues are involved and there is a conclusion that \nwe, in effect, have a waiver or have an exception with that being \ninvolved, certainly we are not suggesting there should not be the \noutsourcing of a job if national security is in jeopardy. That was not \nthe intention. The adoption of the McCain amendment reinforces that \nidea. We incorporated it anyway.\n  I am grateful to Senator McCain and Senator Warner who talked about \nthat issue. There was no disagreement, even with the initial proposal I \nmade on that issue. So we accept. It strengthens the issue for those \nwho were concerned this may have been a vulnerability. We welcome that \naddition.\n  The language with Senator McConnell, which we worked on as well, \ninvites the Secretary of Commerce, within 90 days of the passage of the \nlegislation, to certify that in fact there are no job losses in the \ncountry occurring as a result of outsourcing.\n  So we look forward to their involvement in furthering discussion.\n  But we have for the first time established at least one principle and \nthat is we believe, generally speaking with some exceptions, we ought \nnot, with Federal taxpayer money, be subsidizing the outsourcing of \njobs that could be done here at home. This is a significant \naccomplishment if it is adopted in the coming minutes before the \nconclusion of this debate.\n  I welcome the participation of all. I think all of us are concerned. \nWe read about a continuing flow, accelerated flow of jobs going \noffshore, particularly nations that do not recognize our right to \ncompete for government procurement. We exempted 28 countries with which \nwe have reciprocal arrangements. So when the argument was made earlier \nin the day by one of our colleagues that this amendment was somehow \ngoing to jeopardize American jobs in the United States for people who \nare working for foreign corporations located here, the fact is, most of \nthose foreign corporations, the overwhelming majority of them, come \nfrom the 28 countries, many of which are among the European nations and \nPacific rim countries, to the exclusion of Japan, with which we have \nreciprocal arrangements on procurement. So those nations were excluded.\n  We are focusing our attention on where some of the major outsourcing \nis going where you don't have those kinds of protections, where the \nlevel playing field does not exist in our country for our ability to \ncompete for jobs.\n  For those of us who support fair and free trade, we want those \noptions to exist. They don't today in too many places. This legislation \nis designed to try to address part of that.\n  There are other issues we need to talk about, but this is one \nsignificant piece, we think, of that puzzle. With that in mind, I am \nhappy to yield the floor and listen to others who may want to discuss \nthis before we actually vote on the Dodd amendment in a few minutes.\n  But I, again, thank all of those involved who made it possible for us \nto achieve what I think is a good result and one that will invite \nfurther involvement. Needless to say, in the months ahead if we find \nout there has been a lot more erosion in this area, we may have other \nideas to address this issue, but for the time being we think this is a \nmajor step forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, let me say, first, I am pleased we are \nable to move forward. We are working on a bill that has to do with \ntrade, one in which we are under the pressure from the WTO to get \nfinished in a certain length of time or it is going to be very \nexpensive. So I am glad we are moving forward. I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for working to find an agreement to get this moving \nforward.\n  We all care about lost jobs. Certainly the administration cares \ndeeply about jobs, despite some of the remarks that have been made on \nthe floor. Losing a job is painful. It is an awful experience. Jobs are \nthe foundation of the American dream. Jobs give people dignity and the \nhope of a better tomorrow.\n  It is true jobs are how people provide for their families and for \ntheir children, for education, and the well-being of their loved ones. \nThis President cares deeply about jobs.\n  Economic growth is, of course, the answer. The question is, How do we \ncreate more jobs? The answer is clear. We need a growing economy. A \ngrowing and expanding economy is the key to more jobs. That is why the \nPresident's tax cuts are so important. They have made the American \neconomy much stronger. The economy is now growing and expanding. We \nhave had a GDP growth rate of 8.2 in the third quarter of last year, \n4.1 in the fourth quarter, and 3.1 for 2003.\n  Job training and job skills are key. We are living in a dynamic \neconomy, and that is good. It creates higher wages and higher standards \nof living. But it also requires us to make sure people have the \nopportunity to learn new skills and upgrade existing skills.\n  The key to a good job is training and skill. The President is focused \non that. He understands the linkage between job training, job skills, \nand jobs of the future. That is why he has proposed his jobs for the \n21st century initiative and focused so much attention on community \ncolleges and education in general, because training and skill \ndevelopment are the pathway to jobs in the future.\n  That is also why the President supported the expansion of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance in 2002; the trade act tripled the levels of \nbefore.\n  Americans can compete with anyone when we have a level playing field. \nDespite what some of our critics are saying, economic isolation is not \nthe answer. Only 5 percent of the global population lives in the U.S. \nThat means that 95 percent of our potential market is outside the U.S.\n  We need to stay engaged with the rest of the world. We need those \nmarkets opened to our farmers, our service industry and our \nmanufacturers. We have the best workforce in the world, the most \ninnovative businesses and the most competitive companies. We can \ncompete with anybody when markets are opened and we have a level \nplaying field. In the service industry alone, more than 108 million \nAmericans have good-paying jobs. The service industry's share of GDP \nhas grown to about 64 percent. The service sector employs 80 percent of \nAmericans, and, over the past two decades, has added almost 40 million \nemployees across the full range of services. On average, these service \njobs pay wages on par with those in the manufacturing sector, and wages \nfor service jobs have increased at a faster rate than wages for \nmanufacturing jobs. Many of those services are exported. We have a big \nservices trade surplus. We sell to the world our movies, our music, our \nsoftware, the products of our architects and our engineers, our \nconsulting services, our insurance products, our teachers and trainers, \nand our telecommunications services.\n  We will only grow our economy by expanding the opportunities of our \nworld-class service workers to sell their services to the world. We \nmust say ``no'' to economic isolation.\n  What goes around comes around. We should be concerned about \nretaliation. Foreign investors employed 6.4 million Americans in 2001, \nincluding one in eight U.S. manufacturing workers. Thousands of auto \nworkers in Ohio and South Carolina, or financial services workers in \nNew York or California, or the guy repairing your car at the BP Amoco \nstation, have jobs that depend on our market being open to foreign \ninvestors. Most of these workers earn considerably above the average \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nmanufacturing wage. We need to be deeply concerned about those \nAmericans who lose a job, any job. But if our answer is to put up walls \naround America, we run the risk that tens of millions of Americans will \nbe hurt.\n  We are moving forward by strengthening this amendment and \nstrengthening this bill. It is one that we need to finish. We need to \nunderstand there is a movement of billions of dollars a day around this \nworld. Sometimes it is difficult, but it is the way it is. We can \ncompete. We have the most effective economy in the world. We have the \nmost efficient workers in the world.\n  I am pleased we can now go forward and get on with this task that is \nbefore us so we can begin to do the things we need to do in terms of \nfair trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                          Asbestos Litigation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I applaud the Senator from Wyoming for \nrecognizing what we need to do for jobs in this country. That is the \nvery thing that turns this economy around.\n  I say to my good friend from Connecticut that it was not a Republican \nidea; it was a Democratic idea when John Kennedy said the way to \nincrease revenues is to reduce marginal tax rates. That works. That is \nwhat is happening now. With this President having inherited a recession \nwhich started back in March of 2000, we are now pulling out of it, and \nwe are going to see a dramatic improvement.\n  I have been listening to this talk on job loss and sending jobs \noverseas. I know my colleagues, Senators Hatch and Bond have spoken \nabout the impact of asbestos litigation on our economy and the need to \npass S. 1125 this year.\n  I want to reiterate the enormous loss of jobs our country will suffer \nand the impact on economic growth if something is not done to resolve \nthis problem.\n  I also want to note a press release from the EPA that says on \nFebruary 25, several members of Topor Contracting, a demolition and \nasbestos abatement business in Buffalo, NY, along with the owner of \nPayco, a pre-demolition asbestos firm in New York, pled guilty to State \ncharges after their firms were involved in the demolition of two \nbuildings in Buffalo, NY. They were charged with falsely stating that \nasbestos had been removed from the work area.\n  If asbestos is not removed before demolition begins, those working in \nthe area are susceptible to asbestos exposure. We know, when inhaled, \nasbestos can cause such fatal illnesses as lung cancer and \nmesothelioma.\n  In another, related civil case, the owners of Topor and Payco were \npermanently barred from conducting asbestos abatement work in New York \nState.\n  The New York Area Office of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, \nthe State of New York and the FBI are appropriately investigating this \ncase.\n  This example shows that asbestos can be controlled appropriately \nunder reasonable law and legal procedures--making excessive lawsuits \nall the more outrageous.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has called asbestos litigation an \n``elephantine mass . . . that defies customary judicial administration \nand calls for national legislation.''\n  Senior U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein has cautioned:\n\n       If the acceleration of asbestos lawsuits continues \n     unaddressed, it is not impossible that every company with \n     even a remote connection to asbestos may be driven into \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  Many newspapers and publications have also commented on this crisis \nand its affects.\n  The Hartford Courant has said:\n\n       Congress must not let this opportunity pass. The \n     alternative is more chaos, in which additional companies are \n     driven into bankruptcy, thousands of workers lose their jobs \n     and those who suffer from asbestos-related illnesses often \n     wait many years for payments.\n\n  Georgia Pacific is a company headquartered in Atlanta, and is one of \nthe world's leading manufacturers of tissue, packaging, paper, building \nproducts, pulp, and related chemicals. It sells more than $23 billion \nin products annually and employs about 61,000 people at 400 locations \nin North America and Europe. It operates three facilities in Oklahoma, \nincluding a building products distribution center in Tulsa and a tissue \nand a paper production plant in Muskogee. It employs more than 1,600 \npeople in Oklahoma. Its operations generate about $76 million in \ntaxable wages each year in Oklahoma alone.\n  Before 1977, the company manufactured gypsum products, which \ncontained asbestos fibers. Since that year, it has not used asbestos in \nany of its products.\n  Over time, the company as a whole has paid about $629 million to \nsettle over 313,000 asbestos claims. A large portion of these payouts \ngoes to attorneys and to many who aren't actually sick. In fact, about \n60 percent of its asbestos claims have been paid to lawyers. Another 20 \npercent has been paid to people who were not sick. The remaining 20 \npercent was actually paid to sick people. At the end of 2003, it had \nover 64,000 pending claims nationally and its payments extended into \n2013.\n  Just yesterday I met with another nationwide company, McDermott \nInternational, whose power generation division, Babcock and Wilcox has \nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In the end, the company and its \ninsurers will pay over $1.6 billion to claimants and lawyers.\n  Other companies filing for bankruptcy include Weyerhauser--a national \npaper product manufacturing company with facilities in Oklahoma, \nBethlehem Steel, Harbison Walker, North American Refractories, Owens \nCorning, W.R. Grace & Co., U.S. Gypsum Co., Kaiser Aluminum, and \nHalliburton's DII Industries unit.\n  Overall, asbestos litigation has already forced at least 70 companies \ninto bankruptcy--causing the loss of many jobs. According to a report \nby Joseph Stiglitz in 2002, as many as 60,000 jobs have been lost due \nto asbestos-related bankruptcies. Employees of these bankrupt companies \nhave seen their 401k's drop by an average of 25 percent.\n  According to a 2002 report from the RAND Institute for Civil \nJustice--a bipartisan group--in 1982, litigation cost American \nbusinesses $1 billion; in 2000, the total cost of litigation rose to \n$54 billion; in 2002, litigation costs jumped to over $70 billion.\n  Forty-seven States--Hawaii, Rhode Island and North Dakota are the \nonly States that do not have a facility affected by asbestos \nbankruptcy--have at least one facility affected by asbestos bankruptcy.\n  Workers displaced by asbestos bankruptcies have lost $25,000 to \n$50,000 in wages.\n  For every 10 jobs lost in asbestos bankruptcy, a community will lose \nas many as eight additional jobs. If we do not enact legislation this \nyear, economic growth could be reduced by $2.4 billion per year which \ncould prevent 800,000 jobs from being created and a loss of $64 billion \nin economic growth over a 27-year period. It could cost businesses up \nto $210 billion to respond to 500,000 to 2.4 million asbestos claims.\n  This legislation will guarantee a fair and generous compensation for \nvictims--those are the ones who are really hurt--and will replace the \nunpredictable court costs with certainty for victims and businesses. It \nwill provide contingent money if the fund runs short or provide money \nupfront to get the fund running. It protects the claims if the fund \nruns dry, and it uses no taxpayers' money.\n  I am not optimistic we will get it passed. There will have to be a \nwake-up call. Look at what happened a week or so ago. We had the Health \nfor Mothers and Babies Access to Care Act. It was supposed to help get \nthe money to the mothers and babies who need it so much. Trial lawyers \nwon that in the Senate. They got amendments in there that totally \ndestroyed what we were trying to do.\n  The gun liability bill last week. Standing right next to me was the \nSenator from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, who has been a hero in this \narea trying to do something to protect the second amendment rights and \nto have some type of legislation that would have an effect on reducing \nthe magnitude of lawsuits against gun manufacturers or distributors and \nin many other areas. With the amendments the trial lawyers were able to \nget in to protect trial lawyers, it ended up being killed by the very \npeople who introduced it.\n  I am hoping there has been a wake-up call and this will not happen in \nthe\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\ncase of S. 1125 and we will be able to get this thing passed this year. \nEvery month that goes by, every week that goes by, there are more and \nmore lawsuits. Keep in mind, 60 percent of the money has gone to \nlawyers and 20 percent has gone to people who have not sustained any \ntypes of injuries themselves.\n  With that, I encourage my colleagues to pass S. 1125 as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I comment briefly again on the pending \nmatter while he is still in the Senate. I say to the Senator from \nOklahoma regarding the asbestos legislation, something I have been \ninvolved in for a number of years, as late as last evening I met with \nasbestos study group people. The insurance industry is deeply involved, \nas is organized labor, relating to a large extent to some of the \nvictims of exposure to asbestos. I am very hopeful, still hopeful we \ncan reach a conclusion.\n  There are some 700,000 pending cases. I don't know if the Senator \nmentioned that number specifically, but it is a staggering number of \ncases. Some 60,000 or 70,000 new cases are being filed each year of \npeople claiming harm and injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. \nThere have been at least 70 bankruptcies declared by businesses \ndirectly related to the exposure of people who have been exposed to \nasbestos, and claims filed against them. There is a danger of many more \noccurring.\n  This is a matter that does cry out for solution. We think we have a \npotential solution, not that anything is perfect, but there have been a \nlot of people working on this over the last number of months, most \nintensely the last year or so. I thank Senator Frist, the majority \nleader of the Senate, and his staff, for working very hard along with \nSenator Hatch. Senator Leahy has been terrific. Tom Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, has made strong commitments and is interested in \nseeing a bill we can support.\n  It is almost like a three-legged stool. We will have to reach an \nagreement between the manufacturers, the insurance industry, which will \nend up paying the lion's share of this, and the victims themselves or \ngroups that represent them. No one wants a situation where we try to \ncome up with a solution that would take the matter out of the courts, \nhaving medical criteria established so people who are really sick will \nget the help, and those who are not sick obviously would not be able to \ntake advantage of this. But we do not want, at the end of the day, a \nJohns Manville situation, a resolution of people who have been exposed \nto products of Johns Manville Corporation where ultimately the amount \nof money set aside results in 5 cents on the dollar for victims. No one \nwants to see that happen at the end of the day.\n  The medical criteria question has been resolved. Thanks to Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania and work he has done, the administration of how \nthis would work has largely been agreed to by all the major three \ngroups, the people involved. We are still some distance apart on what \nthe final amount of money ought to be to put in a fund that would \nadequately provide for those who would meet the medical criteria laid \nout in the legislation.\n  If people are committed to this, we can get this done. While there \nmay be a lot of bills around here people want to take credit for, as \nbeing major accomplishments, I cannot think of anything more important \nas an economic message than to come up with a good resolution of the \nasbestos problem.\n  I commend my colleague from Oklahoma for coming to the Senate and \ntalking about this.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond briefly. I did mention the Hartford \nCourier newspaper that has been aggressive. I knew the Senator was \naware of this and actively concerned because his State of Connecticut, \nwhich probably is suffering, is in the top three or four States in the \nUnited States with problems.\n\n  I suggest there is a fourth leg of the stool and that is for trial \nlawyers to get this work out.\n  Mr. DODD. Obviously, they have a strong interest in this.\n  We will try to take something out of the court system and come up \nwith an answer that would not involve--although we would not \nnecessarily eliminate that, at the end of the day if the fund was \ninadequate, you could go back. But the idea would be to get \ncompensation to victims, give some finality and certainty to everyone.\n  The danger for businesses and the industry is they want certainty. \nTell me what I owe, what we have to do so we can move on.\n  My hope is in the coming weeks we can solve that matter.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2660\n\n  If I can come back to the matter before us, I thank Senator Daschle, \nthe Democratic leader, on the asbestos issue, and Senator Leahy, among \nothers, along with Senator Frist and Senator Hatch, who really have \nbeen doing a tremendous job in keeping everyone at the table to work at \nthat issue. I thank several other people for their work on this \nproposal dealing with the outsourcing of American jobs.\n  Again, this is a major achievement. We never have done something like \nthis before, but this Congress and this body is stepping to the plate \nand saying this continuing erosion of jobs in this country is something \nthe Federal Government, anyway, will be far more diligent about than we \nhave been.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, the floor leaders of the \nFinance Committee, which has jurisdiction of the underlying bill. I \nparticularly thank Senator Baucus for his support of the underlying \nDodd amendment yesterday. I am very grateful to him for expressing that \nsupport and Senator Grassley indicating, as well, his support. I thank \nSenator Coleman, who wanted to be a cosponsor of the bill very early. I \nthank him for that. I thank Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who is \ntireless in his participation on these matters all the time. He has \nbeen very helpful over the last several days, along with his staff, in \ngetting this resolved. Senator Corzine of New Jersey spoke yesterday \nabout this bill; Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, who spoke with such \ngreat passion about the issue of jobs and what is happening to American \nworkers and their families; Senator Durbin of Illinois, who is always \neloquent on these matters; Senator Stabenow, from Michigan, who spoke \nvery directly about conditions in her own State and what happens with \njob loss. Senator Boxer of California spent some time here yesterday \ntalking about conditions in California and specifically in the \nagricultural sector which she cares deeply about, in watching Federal \ntax dollars being used to purchase agricultural products outside of the \nUnited States, thus causing job loss. She made that point very strongly \nyesterday and I commend her for it; Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, as \nwell, for his remarks in support of this proposal; others who were \ncosponsors, including Senator Mikulski, who supported the legislation. \nI thank her for backing this proposal, as well.\n  Again, this was a very positive step. I am hoping the bill will be \nadopted. We will have a vote on it.\n  For those who think outsourcing is a good thing, then you ought to \nvote against this amendment. I would like your vote, but if you think \noutsourcing jobs in the United States with Federal taxpayer money is \nsomething we ought to continue to pursue, then you will have an \nopportunity to vote against this amendment. If that is an honest \nreflection of your views, then you ought to express them accordingly. \nIf you feel as I and others do that we ought to be sending a message \nusing ourselves as an example and a model and saying we ought to be \ntrying to do better, and that is when it comes to Federal dollars here, \nwe ought to be doing everything we can to encourage the employment of \npeople in the United States, for a lot of reasons, not the least of \nwhich is that you cannot continually erode the human capital in this \ncountry and expect to reconstitute it during moments of crisis or need.\n\n  If we continually erode the human capital elements and destroy, in \nthe process, a manufacturing base, which is occurring at an incredible \nrate of speed--as I pointed out earlier yesterday and today, some 2.8 \nmillion jobs have been lost in the last 36 months in the manufacturing \nsector alone--as those jobs leave, the ability to come back and \nreconstitute them in a way that we may find absolutely necessary, not \nonly for the production of domestic products for sale at home and \nglobally, but also in the manufacture of critical components of our \ndefense structures--\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nvery shortly we could find ourselves in this century ill-prepared to \nmeet new challenges.\n  So there are a lot of good reasons we ought to be concerned, not the \nleast of which is what happens to these families when they painfully \ndiscover their job has been lost, and someone, at a fraction of their \nwage or salary, has been hired merely because it looks better, because \nit increases profitability on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We ought to \nbe thinking in the longer term. In my view, we ought to be thinking \nabout the coming generation and what kind of country we will leave.\n  So while I respect the business decisions that are made to \noutsource--although I disagree with many of them, I understand them--I \nhope business understands, for those of us in the public sector who \nhave a broader responsibility--not just to those who are engaged in the \nbusiness and their bottom line but to those who work for them as well--\nthat we are going to try to do what we can to discourage the \noutsourcing of jobs where it is not necessary either for the national \nsecurity needs of the Nation or because you cannot acquire these \nproducts anywhere in the United States. Certainly, we provide for \nexceptions in the legislation to cover those circumstances.\n  So, again, I think this is a major step forward. And I will be \nlooking forward to how the administration reacts.\n  Let me also point out I will come back to another item in a minute as \nto a comment made by Senator Inhofe, but I hope the Dodd amendment will \nbe voted on favorably.\n  Madam President, I do not know if the yeas and nays have been asked \nfor on the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let me just say, if I may--and I will be glad to \nyield the floor after this--according to the official arbiters of the \neconomy, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession that \nwe are still in, to some extent--although we seem to be coming out of \nit--began in March of 2001, not in the first quarter of 2000. And I \nknow my friend from Oklahoma made the point that the recession began in \nthe last year of the Clinton administration, when, in fact, the \nobjective observers about when the recession actually began say it was \nin March of 2001, a year later.\n  With that, Madam President, I am happy to yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2660, as modified, as amended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Breaux), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like the Senate to join my good \nfriend from Hawaii in celebrating this day. Today is Senator Inouye's \n15,036th day in the Senate. That makes him the fifth longest serving \nSenator in the history of the United States. He has passed the record \nset by Senator John Stennis, who was previously the fifth longest \nserving Senator.\n  Senator Inouye was sworn in as a U.S. Senator on January 3, 1963. \nSince that time he has cast 13,844 votes. Only four Members in history \nhave cast more votes.\n  During his Senate career, he has served with 355 of the 1,875 \nSenators who have been Members of this body. This means he has served \nwith approximately 20 percent of all Senators in U.S. history. I count \nmyself lucky to be one of the many Senators who continue to have the \nprivilege to work alongside my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  Congratulations, Senator.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I join my colleague from Alaska and all \nof our colleagues in congratulating our special colleague, Senator \nInouye. It is not just the quantity of days he has served that makes \nhim unique and special; it is the quality of the days he has served.\n  Over these years, he has provided remarkable leadership not only for \nhis State but for his country. He has inspired us and he has provided \nremarkable demonstrations of commitment to his country and commitments \nto his people in Hawaii.\n  I was in ninth grade when Senator Inouye was elected to the Senate. I \nlook back at all of those years since being in ninth grade, and I can \nonly imagine what it must seem to him having served this number of \nyears in the Senate. We wish him many more.\n  I always admire Senators with longevity, but it is no secret why \nSenator Inouye has experienced his longevity. It is his respect, \namazing dedication, and the extraordinary and remarkable way with which \nhe conducts himself in public life that has earned him respect on both \nsides of the aisle. Senator Inouye, we congratulate you, we thank you, \nand we are honored to serve with you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I wish to join my colleagues in offering \nmy congratulations to my friend and colleague, Hawaii's senior Senator \nand statesman, Dan Inouye, as he marks his 15,036th day of service in \nthe Senate and becomes the fifth longest serving Senator in the history \nof our Republic.\n  I am proud to serve alongside a true patriot and American hero, and \nto offer a few words recognizing his many contributions and commitment \nto public service. The people of Hawaii and our great Nation appreciate \nthe leadership and direction he has provided, leadership which has \nbettered and strengthened our country. The scope of his contributions \nis matched only by his continued strong and effective leadership\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\non behalf of our State, on behalf of our men and women in uniform, on \nbehalf of Native Americans, and on so many other matters, in the \nSenate.\n  I am certain I speak for all the people of Hawaii when I say thank \nyou, Dan Inouye, son of Hawaii, for over four decades of exemplary \nservice and commitment to our State and our Nation. We are very proud \nof our senior Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, on January 3, 1963, Daniel Inouye became a \nU.S. Senator. Today, 15,036 days later, he has become the fifth longest \nserving Senator in American history.\n  This is yet another accomplishment in the life and career of a \nremarkable man and outstanding American.\n  I must point out, however, that his has not been an easy or \ncomfortable life. It has involved overcoming the trials and \ntribulations of immigration and discrimination.\n  Still, his has been a life of service to our country. During World \nWar II, he served our country in the famed 442d Infantry Regimental \nCombat Team of World War II, the most decorated Army unit in U.S. \nhistory. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Bronze \nStar, the Purple Heart, and the Congressional Medal of Honor, making \nhim one of only seven Senators to have been awarded our Nation's \nhighest military honor. His war-time heroics have now been documented \nin the film, ``Daniel K. Inouye: An American Story.''\n  His service to our country continued in the U.S. Senate where he \nbecame the first Japanese American ever to serve in the U.S. Congress, \nand served on the Senate Watergate Committee, the Congressional Iran \nContra Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, and as Secretary \nof the Democratic Conference. I am pleased to point out that Senator \nInouye will soon cast his 14,000th vote.\n  Personally, I have always appreciated and respected his deep loyalty \nto the Senate and everything for which it stands. I will never forget \nhis loyalty to me when I was the Senate Democratic leader. Whenever I \nneeded his assistance, he was there. Whenever I needed his vote, he was \nthere. Whenever I needed his friendship, he was there. In an address to \nthe Senate last July, I referred to Senator Inouye as ``my hero in the \nSenate.'' I am confident that he always will be.\n  Senator Inouye is a dear colleague and a remarkable man. Therefore, I \ntake great delight in congratulating him on achieving this momentous \noccasion.\n  I congratulate the Senator. His colleagues are proud of him as are \nthe people of Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I shall long remember this day. I just \nhope my constituents will not consider me too old to be running for \nreelection. I thank my brother from Alaska and my leader from South \nDakota. Those words will be cherished.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To accelerate the phasein of the deduction relating to income \n            attributable to domestic production activities)\n\n       On page 71, strike lines 17 through 21, and the matter \n     before line 22, and insert the following:\n       ``(2) Phasein.--In the case of taxable years beginning in \n     2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, or 2008, paragraph (1) shall be \n     applied by substituting for the percentage contained therein \n     the transition percentage determined under the following \n     table:\n\n``Taxable years                                          The transition\nbeginning in:                                            percentage is:\n2004, 2005, or 2006.................................................  5\n2007................................................................  6\n2008................................................................ 7.\n\n                Amendment No. 2687 to Amendment No. 2686\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the extension of certain expiring provisions, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2687 to amendment No. \n     2686.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  (The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment.)\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, be recognized to speak for up to 7 minutes before we return to \nSenator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I wanted to alert \nfellow Senators what is going on. It is obvious that the Republican \nside of the aisle does not want to vote on the overtime bill. For some \nreason, they are afraid to confront this issue. I don't want to take a \nlot of time. I would agree to a half hour evenly divided. We have \ndebated this issue before. But make no mistake about it, the Department \nof Labor is about to issue regulations that will strip overtime pay \nprotections from 8 million workers in this country.\n  This Senate, last year, on a bipartisan vote, passed my amendment to \ndisallow those regulations. The House of Representatives also, on a \nbipartisan vote, voted to uphold what we did in the Senate. And the \nadministration stripped it out on the Omnibus appropriations conference \nreport.\n  They say this is a jobs bill. How about the jobs of people who are \nworking overtime in America? How about the men and women who have given \nup their premium time with their families and with their kids, after \nwork, on weekends, to work overtime? What about them? These are jobs, \nalso. How about the people unemployed right now who would be employed \nbut, if employers can work people over 40 hours a week and not pay them \na cent more, why would they hire anybody else?\n  Last, as I said the other day and I pointed out, this is a dagger \npointed at our veterans. You can look in the old regulations. There is \nnothing in there about training in the military causing you to be \nexempt from overtime pay protection.\n  Here, I blew it up on this chart. I am not going to read the whole \nthing, but basically it puts in these words: ``training in the Armed \nForces.'' What does that mean? It means if you get specialized training \nas a veteran and you come out and go to work, you can be exempt from \novertime pay protection simply because you got that training in the \nArmed Forces. You aren't called a ``learned professional'' without a \nfour-year specialized degree otherwise. But not if you are a veteran. \nThe regulations would substitute veterans'\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\ntraining for university education, at least to take their overtime \naway.\n  What it does is it makes a veteran who got specialized training in \nthe Armed Forces less eligible for overtime pay than his or her \ncounterpart who never served in the military who otherwise has the same \neducation. That is why we feel so strongly about disallowing the \nproposed regulations of the Bush administration that will strip these \novertime pay protections from 8 million workers.\n  Make no mistake about it, the Department of Labor is about to issue \nthese regulations. They say they are going to issue them this month. \nPerhaps that is why the Republican side doesn't want to vote on them. \nThey want the Department to issue the regulations, get them in force \nand effect. Then they know it is harder to overturn them, once those \nrules and regulations are out there.\n  I hope the working men and women around America are paying attention \nto what is happening on the floor of the Senate right now. The other \nside has known full well; they were told earlier on if they were going \nto call this a jobs bill, we ought to be allowed to offer our amendment \nfor an up-or-down vote on whether the administration ought to be \nallowed to issue these regulations stripping overtime pay, regulations \non which they have never had one public hearing, not one. Yet the other \nside is not letting us even vote on it. Not even vote on it. That is \nthe charade. That is the game that is going on around here.\n  Are we stopping this bill? We are not stopping this bill. I heard \nsomeone say if the Harkin amendment on overtime pay is adopted it will \nkill the bill. Why, I ask, would it kill the bill? This is a jobs bill. \nWe are trying to protect jobs in America.\n  At some point we will vote on this amendment. Maybe not on this bill, \nbecause I can see the writing on the wall now. They are going to keep \nsecond-degreeing this amendment to death. Then they are going to go off \nthe bill and go onto the budget.\n  But I will be back. I don't want to quote the Governor of California, \nbut, ``I'll be back.'' I will be back and I will be back and I will be \nback. Whenever there is an opportunity for this Senator to offer this \namendment to stop the taking away, the stripping of the rights of our \nworking people in this country to overtime pay, I will be here. If \nthere is an opportunity on this bill, I will do it, but I can see what \nis happening. The other side does not want this brought up for a vote, \nand they will do everything they can to preclude me from bringing it \nup.\n  I say to the other side: I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent, without the Senator from \nKentucky losing his right to the floor, if I could have 60 seconds to \nsay where we are right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The obvious thing going on here is that my colleague \nfrom Iowa wants to go out of turn and jump ahead of the line. We have \nan agreement lining up amendments. We did this yesterday morning. The \novertime amendment is in that line, and it is just a matter of waiting \nuntil that sequence comes and that opportunity is going to be there. \nThat is the fair way of doing business around here. As the manager of \nthe bill, I am going to make sure we do this in a fair way.\n  I did offer an amendment to the Bunning amendment. That one part of \nthe amendment that was just read is something that is very important to \nIowa. We are going to have the largest wind energy generating project \nin mid-America in Iowa, if we can get the wind energy tax credit \nextended.\n  This is an amendment that extends a lot of the provisions that have \nrun out. Wind energy is one of those. This gives an extension to all of \nthese extenders that have run out. One of those is for wind energy, \nwhich affects the entire country, of course. But one of the largest \nwind energy projects ever is going to be in Iowa. If we can get this \nwind energy tax credit extended----\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will my colleague from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If it is OK with the Senator from Kentucky, yes, I will \nyield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to ask if the other side would be willing to \nhave a time agreement on the Bunning amendment and the Grassley \namendment that was added thereto. Then maybe we can get to the overtime \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Those are things that are being discussed. I think it \nis fair to say it ought to be OK if I don't have an answer to that \nright now for the simple reason that yesterday, and even earlier today, \nwe tried to get agreements from the other side on some votes, and we \nweren't able to get them. But those are things that are eventually \nnegotiated, as the vote we just had, and the same thing may happen on \nother amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment which is cosponsored by the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n  I first want to compliment my chairman and ranking member for putting \ntogether the very good bill that we have before us today.\n  While no piece of legislation is ever perfect, the current situation \nin which we find ourselves as a result of the WTO decisions in the FSC \nand ETI cases presents this Congress with quite a challenge.\n  I supported this bill in the Finance Committee, and I think it does \nan admirable job in balancing the variety of interests at hand. \nHowever, I think the amendment at hand makes a good bill better.\n  Job creation and the economy is the top priority for Americans today. \nI think we have turned the corner and the economy is recovering, but we \nstill lag in creating jobs.\n  We have an opportunity today to get behind manufacturing and make \nsure that high-paying American jobs stay in America for American \nworkers. We can make ``Made in the USA'' mean something again.\n  Because we are forced to repeal the ETI, we are taking away an \nimportant export incentive from our country's manufacturers. The effect \nis to raise their taxes just as our recovery is gathering steam.\n  We have a responsibility to protect our domestic manufacturers and \ngive them the ability to compete in the global marketplace. The \nmanufacturing tax deduction contained in the bill before us today is \ndesigned to foster job creation and reverse the declines in the \nmanufacturing sector employment levels.\n\n  It will reduce the tax burden on all domestic manufacturers, small \nand large.\n  As currently drafted, the bill before us phases in this important \nmanufacturing tax provision over a number of years so that companies do \nnot receive the full tax break--the equivalent of a 3-percent tax rate \nreduction on income generated by manufacturing inside the United States \nuntil 2009.\n  This amendment will phase in this rate reduction at an accelerated \npace. As a result of the amendment by myself and the Senator from \nMichigan, U.S. manufacturers will have a tax rate decrease of 1\\1/2\\ \npercent in 2004, compared to the one-third of 1 percent provided in the \nunderlying bill for 2004.\n  Due to the repeal of the ETI, American manufacturers are being asked \nto shoulder a tax burden that could stifle the recent job growth we \nhave seen.\n  Our manufacturers shouldn't be saving for a tax increase. They should \nbe hiring American workers and expanding their business.\n  In my State alone, manufacturing contributes $31 billion to the State \neconomy, and manufacturing firms employ 293,000 Kentuckians.\n  The workers of our States demand our support. This amendment and this \nbill are aimed at strengthening this important sector of our economy.\n  My amendment reaffirms our commitment to American manufacturing and \nwill attract jobs to the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  I yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to join \nmy colleague from Kentucky on a very important amendment. I also \nappreciate Chairman Grassley and our ranking member, Senator Baucus, as \nwell, for their leadership and their support in working with us on this \nimportant amendment.\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\n  Our amendment, as my colleague indicated, speeds up the tax cut for \nall U.S. manufacturers to address the current manufacturing crisis.\n  This particular amendment would increase the tax relief in 2004--five \ntimes more than in the underlying bill--and, in fact, would provide \nabout $6.5 billion in relief to manufacturers and small businesses over \nthe next 5 years.\n  My colleague has gone into the specifics of a lot of this amendment. \nWhat I would like to do is spend my time talking about why this is so \ncritical.\n  We have a crisis in manufacturing in this country. Nowhere is that \nmore evident than in my home State of Michigan where last year we had \nthe largest number of jobs lost in the country and the highest \nunemployment rate. This is an issue that is my top priority.\n  When we look at what has happened in terms of manufacturing jobs over \nthe last number of decades, we see that we are back now to the lowest \npoint since the Depression and when Herbert Hoover was President of the \nUnited States.\n  We have seen huge drops in jobs. My great concern is that even though \nwe are seeing an increase as it relates to the stock market and \npositive indications, we have not yet seen that translate into jobs. I \nbelieve that is for many factors that relate to the pressures on \nmanufacturers in a global economy.\n  When we look at the fact that the United States has lost over 2.8 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in the last 3 years, this is a crisis.\n  Let me speak specifically to a couple of examples I have talked \nabout.\n  When we look at this number in Michigan compared to other States, \nthere is a 19-percent job loss. We have seen literally, every single \nday, headlines in the papers about people losing their jobs, plants \nclosing and going to other countries, the exporting of jobs, and \nlayoffs occurring all around Michigan; not only in manufacturing, I \nmight add, but when we look at the outsourcing issue, we are looking to \nwhite-collar jobs, technology jobs, engineers, health care workers, a \nwide variety of jobs. But we know in our country--and I believe very \nstrongly coming from Michigan--that we have to have a foundation, a \nmanufacturing base to have a strong economy and a strong middle class.\n  In Michigan, I am very proud of the fact that we make products and we \ngrow products. That is the basis of our economy. Frankly, it has been \nthe basis of the U.S. economy since the beginning of our country.\n  We are seeing a huge drop--on down to 2003--in what has happened in \nterms of jobs in Michigan.\n  One example I talked about earlier today is a plant called Electrolux \nin Greenville, MI, a community of 9,000 people in the western rural \npart of the State, where 2,700 people are employed to make \nrefrigerators, Frigidaire, in fact, through Electrolux. They have added \na third shift and the company says they are making a profit. But they \nhave also indicated they could make a bigger profit if they moved to \nMexico and paid $2.50 an hour and no health benefits. So they are \nclosing. We have Michigan residents here today to speak at a hearing \ntomorrow about the devastation this loss of jobs will create.\n\n  We have to do everything possible to provide incentives and support \nfor manufacturers to remain in the United States and keep our jobs \nhere.\n  There are a lot of factors, when we look at what is happening with \nElectrolux and when we look at what is happening in Steelcase in Grand \nRapids, MI, cutting 77 of its skilled workers.\n  Wohlert, in Lansing, MI, has laid off 245 workers because of the bad \neconomy and overseas competition; Easton, in Marshall, MI, indicates \nthey would be cutting 185 of their 285 jobs and moving plants to \nMexico; Federal Mogul in St. Johns and Greenville, MI, Lear Corporation \nin Traverse City, Gidding & Lewis in Menominee, Straits Steel in \nLudington. The stories go on and on.\n  There are many reasons for that. We know we need to be smart about \ntrade policies where we are encouraging the creation of a middle class \nand raising the standards around the world, raising standards in Mexico \nand in China and other places, where we are competing and finding our \njobs are moving, and by raising that standard of living. Instead of \nlosing or exporting our jobs, we can export our product and they will \nhave a middle class so they can buy our products.\n  I indicated to the folks that Electrolux may be able to move the \nplant to Mexico and pay $2.50 an hour with no health benefits, but the \nquestion I had was, who was going to buy the refrigerators? Certainly \nnot citizens if they make $2.50 an hour with no health benefits.\n  We have to be doing everything possible to create a race up instead \nof a race down. This amendment is a very important part of the equation \nto do that. We need to make sure we are providing incentives and tax \nrelief for manufacturers which create jobs in the United States. This \namendment, in fact, will do that.\n  We also know we need to tackle issues such as currency manipulation, \nwhere China, Japan, and other countries basically create a tax for our \nmanufacturers. When a Michigan manufacturer sells a product into China \nthey have to sell it at a higher price. It can be up to 40 percent \nequivalent of a tax into China. When Chinese businesses sell in the \nUnited States, they can artificially lower their prices. Why do they do \nthat? They want us to move the plant to China instead of selling our \ngoods to China. We need to tackle that. If the Secretary of the \nTreasury would simply certify that, in fact, currency manipulation is \noccurring, there are actions we can take to level the playing field. \nThat needs to happen as well.\n  Senator Schumer has a bill--in fact, I am a cosponsor--and I hope in \naddition to the amendment today and the legislation before the Senate, \nwe would pass that very important legislation to level the playing \nfield for our businesses and our workers in America.\n  We also need to address health care costs. We need to do it in a way \nthat addresses the fact that our manufacturers have health care costs \ntied to employment in this country as part of doing business and in \nother countries they do not. We need to tackle that in a way that does \nnot cost our workers in terms of their health care coverage or increase \ntheir costs. We can do that.\n\n  We also need to be addressing a number of issues that deal with \ntrade.\n  The reality is, the place to start right now is with this bill. This \namendment provides $6.5 billion more in tax relief and assistance to \nmanufacturers who create American jobs.\n  I have another amendment I will offer that will add to what I believe \nis a very important part of the picture. That is, this tax deduction \nphases out over the next 10 years and is then available to all \nmanufacturers, not just domestic manufacturers. I believe that is a \nmistake and we ought to make sure it remains only for those creating \njobs in America. I look forward to debating that even further.\n  I am pleased today to be sponsoring this amendment with my colleague. \nI should also indicate I have legislation I had introduced last fall \nwith my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham, on this very \nsubject that included both the manufacturing tax credit and eliminated \nthe phaseout so that those dollars and the tax credit would be focused \non our domestic manufacturers.\n  What we see today is not only an issue that affects major employers. \nIt is important to say this is a small business issue as well. The \nmajority of manufacturing establishments are small businesses. The vast \nmajority of them have 20 employees or less. This is not only an issue \nfor our major manufacturers--and certainly in Michigan we are very \nproud of our large manufacturers; they are part of our auto industry \nand our high-tech industry, and we are very proud of our furniture \nindustry and all of the other industries we have in Michigan--but this \nis very much a small business issue, as well.\n  Let me finally say as we help manufacturers, we are also helping our \neconomy and our families in terms of standard of living. When we look \nat the average service-sector salary and a manufacturing-sector salary, \nwe see a major difference. Within our families, our workers are able to \nhave a good manufacturing job, they are able to have dollars in their \npocket to care for their families, to buy that house, to send the kids \nto college, to be able, in Michigan, to buy that snowmobile or the \ncottage\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nup north and able to have the quality of life we all want for ourselves \nand our families.\n  The way to stimulate this economy, the way to keep consumer \nconfidence moving and to keep all of the economic indicators moving in \nthe right direction is to support our manufacturing sector in our \ncountry. That is what the bill does; that is what this amendment does.\n  I hope my colleagues will join together in a bipartisan way to \nsupport this particular amendment which will add significant support \nfor our manufacturers. It will do it immediately this year because they \nneed help now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I give my compliments to the yeoman \nefforts of the Senator from Michigan. She has done a wonderful job. She \nhas many times come to me and asked: Max, can't we do more? I have an \namendment to accelerate the deduction and many times it will be \nexplained how important it is, particularly for her people in the State \nof Michigan.\n  I compliment the Senator very much for her terrific work. Those in \nMichigan ought to know, she is persistent and steady in coming to this \nSenator and saying we have to do more; let's do this. And the same with \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Senator Bunning. I have heard from him. But \nI must be honest and seek a full disclosure and say the Senator from \nMichigan has been very consistent and done a superb job. I also \ncompliment her on the charts. They are good charts, explaining the \nsituation very well.\n  I thank the Senator for her statement. She is on target. Most Members \nin the Senate will vote for this amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky and the Senator from Michigan. It is very important to do what \nwe can to create and to retain jobs in America.\n  The underlying bill goes a long way to accomplish that objective, but \nthis amendment goes further; and that is, I think it costs about $6-\npoint-some billion and accelerates the deduction, meaning that \ncompanies can get that deduction earlier. They can plan earlier. And it \nis for all size companies, not just big business, but all size \nbusiness.\n  We all know, as the Senator from Michigan pointed out, half of all \nemployees in America work for small businesses, and three-quarters of \nall new jobs in America are created by small businesses.\n  We often say small business is the backbone of America. Why do we say \nthat? Because it is true. Small business is the backbone of America. A \nlot of these big companies can go offshore--and it is one of the \nproblems we are trying to address--but the small business cannot go \noffshore in the main. If a big business goes offshore and takes \ncontracts away, often small business bears the brunt of it. So it is \nvery important we do what we can to keep jobs in America.\n  This clearly is a complex problem; that is, offshoring, outsourcing. \nIt requires a very dedicated, concentrated effort to solve it. It is \nquite complex. There are various ramifications, various parts of this. \nThe Senator from Michigan mentioned a good number of them, including \nthe high cost of health care in this country.\n  One of the problems we are facing, too, is currency manipulation by \nvarious countries, including China and Japan, countries with huge \nreserves in currencies and having a great effect on the American \neconomy; and it is not always good.\n  In addition to that, it is trade policy. We are reaching trade \nagreements with minuscule economies--Morocco, Bahrain. Well, that is \nfine. Morocco is a great country, as is Bahrain, but the point being, \nthose are small economies. Rather, there are huge economies where we \nare not enforcing trade agreements already reached. One is China, this \nWTO, another is India.\n  We hear all the time about call centers moving to India. We do not \nhear about American companies selling to India, for a very good reason. \nIndia is a very closed country. It is very difficult to sell in India.\n  If we, as a country, were to use much more of our efforts to enforce \ntrade agreements and open up huge markets--that is India and China--\nrather than using our efforts to reach trade agreements with smaller \ncountries, we would be doing a much better job to help keep jobs in \nAmerica. That is just one of the various things we can and should be \ndoing.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to yield. I yield the floor, Madam President, \nso my good colleague can have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I want to take a moment, first, to \nthank my colleague for his kind words and for his leadership. Secondly, \nI do want to indicate cosponsors on our side of the aisle to the \namendment: Senators Levin, Feinstein, Kohl, and Rockefeller. I very \nmuch appreciate their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am just saying, we have a huge \nchallenge here to help create jobs and to keep jobs in America and to \nretrain people who lose jobs.\n  This phenomenon of job loss is huge. As the chart by the Senator from \nMichigan shows, we have lost about 3 million jobs since 2001; that is \nnet loss. Those are manufacturing jobs; a net loss of 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs in America. We have also lost a good number of \nservice jobs, but on a net basis, not near as many service jobs lost as \nmanufacturing jobs. Manufacturing just pays significantly more than \nservice.\n  I might also say, this is not just an American phenomenon. It is \nhappening in countries worldwide. It is happening in virtually every \ncountry. The one country where it is not happening as much is Japan, \ninterestingly. But it is happening in every other country. Why? I \ndaresay part of the reason is due to just natural phenomena--not \nnatural, but phenomena that are occurring worldwide, due largely to \nglobalization, advances in technologies, communications technologies, \nwhich are forcing countries worldwide to compete even more \naggressively, to cut their costs as much as they can, and producing \nwherever they can to get the best rate of return they possibly can.\n  That is why it is happening worldwide, not just in America. It is \nhappening worldwide. Part of that is because of increases in \nproductivity. Obviously, as productivity increases, more products are \nproduced with fewer employees per product.\n  Just to state the problem does not mean we stop right there. We have \nto start finding answers to the problem; that is, how to get more \nemployees, more workers, more Americans working in more good-paying \njobs. One way is with this bill. This bill will help reduce the cost of \nproduction; that is, by deduction. This bill actually creates a 9-\npercent deduction for the cost of domestic manufacturing. That is \nimportant.\n  For example, take a small business whose income tax would be $200,000 \non domestic manufacturing, the 9-percent deduction calculates to \nroughly about a 3-percent reduction in the rate, so that is a $6,000 \nreduction in that company's income taxes. That helps. That is not a \nsmall matter to reduce one's income taxes by that amount. So that is \none partial solution to job loss in America this bill addresses.\n  Second, we adopted an amendment to this bill already. It is the \nHatch-Murray amendment. Senator Murray very much knows, as does Senator \nHatch from Utah, that Washington State is a State that a few years ago \nwas called the ``Silicone Forest'' with all the sort of higher-tech \ncompanies developing in Washington State. The Washington Seattle Port \ntrades a lot. Salt Lake City is not a huge seaport, by any stretch of \nthe imagination, although they have the great salt lake--it is not \nsmall--but the point is, Senator Hatch from Utah also knows the \nimportance of extending the research and development tax credit. It is \na measure, frankly, he and I have introduced jointly many times over \nthe years. But that provision now is also adopted as an amendment in \nthis bill.\n  The more we can encourage research and development, the more we are \ngoing to create jobs and keep jobs. We know, too, that where the \nresearch is, is where the jobs tend to be; that is, where the products \ndevelop is where the jobs tend to be. This is a research tax credit for \nAmerican research and\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\ndevelopment. It is not overseas, but it is in America. So that, too, is \ngoing to help.\n\n  Now we come with this amendment, the amendment offered by the \nSenators from Kentucky and Michigan. It is an additional stimulus \nbecause it accelerates the deduction very significantly. That is going \nto help. It is going to go a long way.\n  There are lots of other things we need to do. I am not going to spend \nall night talking about them, but one is to adopt the second-degree \namendment offered by the chairman of the committee; that is, the \nextenders provision. That is very important.\n  Madam President, you know, as well as anyone in this body about the \nimportance of predictability, the importance of certainty, as much as \npossible, that any businessperson may have or may not have--or, to \nstate it differently, the uncertainty they may have. Every \nbusinessperson abhors uncertainty. You almost don't care what the \nproblem is so long as the problem is pretty certain. If you know what \nthe problem is, you can work around it. If the problem is always \nchanging, it is pretty hard to work around it.\n  We have had something called tax extenders, and they have been for \nvery good purposes, as the Senator from Maine well knows. I think the \nSenator from Maine, as I recall, has one on education for teachers. It \nis to help teachers get their deduction for the supplies they purchase \nto help their students. That has expired.\n  Well, if I am a teacher with very low pay--it would be a great job, \nactually, in many respects; that is, to be a teacher--I would want to \nknow if that deduction is still available or not. So far, it is not \navailable. It has expired. But in the extenders package we are adopting \nhere, we are going to extend that deduction so teachers will know, at \nleast until the end of 2005--18 months roughly; they are going to have \nthat.\n  There are a lot of other extenders, too. Senator Bayh, for example, \nis interested in the work opportunity tax credit and other similar tax \ncredits which enable employers to get people off of welfare and hire \npeople so they are doing work, so they can earn a living for themselves \nand their families. That tax credit has expired. Senator Santorum is \nalso interested in extending that tax credit. We have that here in the \nextenders.\n\n  There are a good number of others. For example, Senators Clinton and \nSchumer are very concerned about the liberty bonds for the development \nof New York City. That has expired. That is jobs. The more we can \ncontinue these extenders and get them back in the law, the more it \nenables those people in New York and others related to it to know \nwhether or not they can depend upon those bonds and continue the \nreconstruction from the damage caused by 9/11.\n  In addition, there are some provisions that help the District of \nColumbia. We don't have any Senators here representing the District of \nColumbia. We all are, in a certain sense. But those, too, are going to \nbe available.\n  I mentioned the one the Presiding Officer is interested in. What \nabout computers in schools? We have a provision for companies to donate \ncomputers to schools. That has expired. I would think we would want to \nextend that. That is going to help kids, help companies. It is going to \nhelp America. It provides jobs.\n  After that, there are a few others. I won't go into great detail. \nThere are incentives for jobs, for health care, to clean up pollution \nand more.\n  Essentially, we have a responsibility to pass these extenders. We \nhave been derelict over the years. Everybody likes these provisions. \nEverybody wants them. They last maybe a year, a year and a half, then \nthey expire. We let them lapse sometimes for 6 months, sometimes 7, \nsometimes 8. Sometimes we go back and reenact them retroactively. \nSometimes we don't. It is just nuts. They are yo-yo extenders. How in \nthe world are people going to be able to plan if we are yo-yos?\n  We as Senators should put them permanently in the law because we \nalways reenact them. My hope is over the not too distant future we will \nbe able to do that.\n  Another temporary extension is in the bill. That is going to help \naddress some of the job loss this country is facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to support \nthe Bunning-Stabenow-Feinstein amendment which will immediately \nimplement a manufacturing tax deduction that offers much needed \nassistance to our ever diminishing manufacturing base in this Nation.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senators Bunning and Stabenow in reaching \nout to a bipartisan group of Senators and urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Simply, this amendment would adjust the underlying bill to require an \nimmediate implementation of the new manufacturing deduction and would \nresult in an immediate benefit to our Nation's manufacturers by \nbeginning the process of cutting their tax rate by 3 percentage points.\n  So if you produce manufactured goods in the United States, you will \nsee a phased-in reduction of your tax rate from 35 percent to 32 \npercent by 2009.\n  This provides a competitive incentive for manufacturers to produce \njobs by reducing their tax burden immediately.\n  Critically, this amendment not only includes heavy manufacturing, \nwhich is so important to our State and national economies, but also the \nproduction of software, film, video, and sound recordings. I do not \nhave to tell anyone in this Chamber how important this is for \nCalifornia and the Nation.\n  The movie, television and home video industries, which are based in \nCalifornia, are a tremendous economic engine of growth. The industry \naccounts for nearly 5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product and is \none of the largest employers in the country, having doubled its \nworkforce over the last 25 years to a total workforce today of over 4.7 \nmillion workers.\n  I am working with Senators Grassley and Baucus to make sure that \nthese industries are able to take full advantage of the tax benefits \nthat we are proposing here and I am confident that we will come to an \nagreement to do that.\n  But why single out manufacturing? Why not offer a tax cut to all \nbusinesses equally? The answer is clear. We have seen a dramatic \ndecrease in our Nation's manufacturing base and a stimulus directed at \nthis sector of our economy is long overdue.\n  Since January 2001 this Nation has lost 2.8 million manufacturing \njobs. My home State of California, has lost more than 300,000 \nmanufacturing jobs over that same period. That is a 16 percent decrease \nin California's manufacturing employment base in just 3 years.\n  It is time to stop the bleeding and this amendment will give \nmanufacturers important tax relief so they may grow jobs here at home.\n  As has been pointed out by the National Association of Manufacturing: \nmanufacturing accounts for nearly one fifth of the Nation's GDP; \nprovides 15 million high paying jobs; supports another eight million \njobs in other sectors; and is the seedbed of innovation in our economy, \naccounting for 62 percent of all research and development.\n  It is far and away our pacesetter in productivity gains, and accounts \nfor the bulk of U.S. exports.\n  Manufacturing in the State of California contributed more than 26 \npercent to our State's domestic product--more than one quarter of my \nState's economic base.\n  But, the overhead costs of taxes, health and pension benefits, and \nrising energy prices add 22 percent to the price of U.S. production \nrelative to our foreign competitors.\n  The erosion of high paying manufacturing jobs has continued unabated \nfor years and we now see the phenomenon exacerbated by so many other \nfactors, including outsourcing.\n  This amendment will help on both counts. It will reduce taxes on \nmanufacturers and foster an environment for job growth in this \nimportant sector.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and bring an immediate \npro-growth stimulus to an important part of our economy.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \ndeductibility of private and government mortgage insurance premiums. \nLast year, my Finance Committee Colleague Senator Lincoln and I \nintroduced the Mortgage Insurance Fairness Act, S. 846. Today 19 of my \nSenate colleagues join me in supporting this proposal. We are \nintroducing this important legislation as an amendment to the JOBS\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nAct, S. 1637. More than 12 million homeowners currently pay private or \ngovernment mortgage insurance. This amendment will allow these \nhomeowners an immediate tax savings and will allow an estimated 300,000 \nadditional families per year to more easily qualify to buy a home. The \nvast majority of these new homeowners will be lower-income, minority \nand veteran households who need mortgage insurance the most.\n  The JOB Act is the perfect opportunity to allow hundreds of thousands \nof low-income Americans to qualify for homeownership. Mortgage \ninsurance allows moderate income households to buy homes often with a \ndown payment of as little as 3 percent. In 2001, mortgage insurance and \nguaranty programs covered 57 percent of mortgage purchase loans made to \nAfrican-American and Hispanic borrowers as well as 54 percent of the \nmortgage purchase loans made to borrowers with incomes below the \nmedian. Unfortunately, unlike many other costs associated with \nhomeownership, mortgage insurance premiums currently are not tax \ndeductible. We want to permanently change this fact for taxpayers \nearning less than $100,000 per year.\n  If we are successful in adding this amendment, we will have seized a \nunique opportunity to help millions of families receive immediate tax \nrelief and hundreds of thousands more realize the American dream of \nhomeownership. With supporters like the American Federation of \nTeachers, Americans for Tax Reform, the Mortgage Bankers Association \nand the National Urban League, this amendment brings diverse groups \ntogether in the common cause of homeownership.\n  I am proud to sponsor this amendment and I urge my colleagues to join \nthis bipartisan effort to make the American dream of homeownership come \ntrue.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President. I rise today to express my support for \namendment No. 2647 that, just yesterday, passed the U.S. Senate \nunanimously. I also thank every one of my colleagues for their support \nfor what I believe is one of the greatest mechanisms for job creation \nand industry innovation. The amendment, of course, extends the research \nand development tax credit for 2 years.\n  The research tax credit, I believe, has demonstrated that it is a \npowerful incentive for companies to increase research spending. The tax \ncredit lowers the cost of doing research in the United States, so it \nencourages companies to continue to make investments in critical R \nAnd the bottom-line benefit is that research and development creates \nnew jobs in the United States--something that is so vital right now for \nour Nation and for my State.\n  The current R tax credit is set to expire on June 30, 2004. Many of \nmy colleagues, here, know we play this annual game of saying the R \ntax credit is important, but then not renewing it on a permanent basis, \nthereby denying companies and organizations the certainty they need to \nmake these investments. The major investments in nanotechnology and \nbiotechnology, in software, and in the computer sciences take several \nyears of investments. Without a planning horizon of at lest several \nyears, companies just won't put the money into R\n  I am fully aware of the budget situation we are confronting, as \nSenator Hatch described yesterday. But, as my friend from Utah, stated, \n``[i]ronically . . . a permanent credit costs no more than one that is \nregularly extended.'' And while I am a cosponsor of this amendment with \na short term, 2-year extension because I fundamentally believe that the \nR tax credit is so imperative, I must also say that permanency of the \ntax credit remains a high priority for me. It is only in the permanency \nof the R tax credit that businesses can truly create a strategic \nbusiness plan. As it stands, companies have to take into account the \nfact that Congress could allow the credit to lapse for a few months. \nThat causes companies to hedge their bets, spending a little less on \nR, and our economy suffers as a result. By contract, permanency helps \nplanning; and the sooner we make this permanent, the sooner companies \ncan begin to enlarge and expand their research and development units, \nand the sooner their innovations will strengthen economic growth.\n  Who has created jobs in the last decade? Who has stimulated our \neconomy to move forward? It is a lot of companies that have invested in \nR It is the Microsofts. It is the Amazons. It is the variety of \nbiotechnology companies from my state and others making investments \nthat have increased the productivity of their workforce, allowing them \nto hire new people as new products and services are delivered.\n  The research credit creates jobs. More than 90 percent of the costs \neligible for the credit are salaries and wages paid to researchers. The \nonly way for a company to increase its credit is to increase its R \npayroll in the U.S.\n  First authorized in 1982, the credit has been reauthorized eight \ntimes, with a gap from June 1995 to June 1996. As I mentioned, the \ncurrent credit expires in June 2004. However, its effectiveness is \nlimited because businesses cannot rely on it in their long-term \nplanning, and most R projects are long-term. In order to provide \nstability and broaden the reach of this proven incentive, Congress \nneeds to make the credit permanent.\n  I cannot stress enough how important private investment in R is. \nR is the engine that brings us new medicines, new medical \ntechnologies, cleaner manufacturing technologies, advanced weapon \nsystems and other tools in the war on terror. Furthermore, growth in \nour high tech economy depends on solid R, and there is no good reason \nto delay making the credit permanent. A permanent tax credit will go a \nlong way to providing the planners and investors the certainty that \nthey need.\n  This amendment, having passed unanimously, shows the Senate's strong \nsupport for R We have taken this one step forward; but let us not \nforce these companies that serve as the engine for job creation to come \nback year after year for an extension of the R credit. Toward that \nend, I ask that we take this amendment one step further and make the \nresearch and development tax credit permanent.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, today I voted against the Dodd \namendment for two important reasons. First, it is the wrong policy for \ngrowing jobs. And second, it tramples on the principle of federalism.\n  Nearly 150,000 Tennesseans are employed by foreign companies \nconducting business in Tennessee. As Governor, I helped attract some of \nthose jobs and companies to our State--companies such as Nissan, Sharp, \nBridgestone, Panasonic, and many others. The Dodd amendment could have \ndenied them the ability to compete for government contracts. That's not \nright. If the Dodd amendment becomes law, it will discourage these \nforeign companies from investing in our country. In these times when we \nare trying so hard to grow new, high-paying jobs, the Dodd amendment is \nexactly the wrong policy.\n  Further, the Dodd amendment ignores the principle of federalism by \nlimiting the States' options on granting contracts using Federal funds. \nThe whole point in sending money to the States is that they know better \nthan the Federal Government how to spend it to meet the needs of their \ncitizens. As a former Governor, I know how frustrating it is to have \nthe Federal Government tell you how you can or can't spend your money. \nNeither Tennessee nor any other State should have new burdens placed on \nhow it spends federally granted funds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I will offer an amendment to extend \nfor 2 years the work opportunity and welfare to work tax credits, and \nto make certain improvements to these programs that will make them even \nmore effective in helping Americans' transition from welfare to work \nalong with other tax extenders. These credits clearly belong in a bill \nwhose name is JOBS; I can think of few programs that have created jobs \nand provided basic workplace skills to a segment of the population that \nis badly in need of these resources with the efficiency and low cost of \nWOTC and W-t-W. I can also think of few jobs programs that have as \npositive an impact as these have on scarce state welfare resources. I \nam also pleased that Senator Bayh is joining me as a cosponsor of this \nbipartisan amendment. I would also like to thank Chairman Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for their support of this important initiative.\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\n  WOTC and W-t-W are also key elements of welfare reform. Employers in \nthe retail, health care, hotel, financial services, and food industries \nhave incorporated this program into their hiring practices and through \nthese programs, more than 2,700,000 previously dependent persons have \nfound work.\n  A recent report issued by the New York State Department of Labor \nbears this out in economic terms. Comparing the cost of WOTC credits \ntaken by New York State employers during the period 1996-2003, for a \ntotal of $192.59 million, with savings achieved through closed welfare \ncases and reductions in vocational rehabilitation programs and jail \nspending, for a total of $199.89 million, the State of New York \nconcluded that WOTC provided net benefits to the taxpayers even without \ntaking into account the additional economic benefits resulting from the \naddition of new wage to the GDP or reductions in other social spending \nsuch as Medicaid.\n  In that regard, the New York State analysis concluded that the \nroughly $90 million in wages paid to WOTC workers since 1996 generated \nroughly $225 million in increased economic activity. Perhaps even more \nimportantly, the study found that roughly 58 percent of the TANF \nrecipients who entered private sector employment with the assistance of \nWOTC stayed off welfare.\n  I mentioned the New York State study because it is the first of its \nkind; however, I am certain that similar conclusions would be reached \nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of the other 48 states and \nthe District of Columbia. These programs work and do so at a net \nsavings to taxpayers. In fact, over a 7-year period there were more \nthan 110,000 certifications for both WOTC and W-t-W in Pennsylvania \nalone enabling many to leave welfare and find private sector work. The \nlegislation is supported by hundreds of employers throughout \nPennsylvania and around the country.\n  WOTC and W-t-W have received high praise as well from the Federal \nGovernment. A 2001 GAO study concluded that employers have \nsignificantly changed their hiring practice because of WOTC by \nproviding job mentors, longer training periods, and significant \nrecruiting outreach efforts.\n\n  Mr. President, WOTC and W-t-W are not traditional government jobs \nprograms. Instead, they are precisely the type of program that we \nshould champion in a time when we need to be fiscally responsible. \nThese are efficient and low cost public-private partnerships that have \nas their goal to provide a means by which individuals can transition \nfrom welfare to a lifetime of work and dignity.\n  Under present law, WOTC provides a 40 percent tax credit on the first \n$6,000 of wages for those working at least 400 hours, or a partial \ncredit of 25 percent for those working 120-399 hours. W-t-W provides a \n35 percent tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages for those working \n400 hours in the first year. In the second year, the W-t-W credit is 50 \npercent of the first $10,000 of wages earned. WOTC and W-t-W are key \nelements of welfare reform. A growing number of employers use these \nprograms in the retail, health care, hotel, financial services, food, \nand other industries. These programs have helped over 2,200,000 \npreviously dependent persons to find jobs.\n  Eligibility for WOTC is currently limited to: (1) recipients of \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, in 9 of the 18 months \nending on the hiring date; (2) individuals receiving Supplemental \nSecurity Income (SSI) benefits; (3) disabled individuals with \nvocational rehabilitation referrals; (4) veterans on food stamps; (5) \nindividuals aged 18-24 in households receiving food stamp benefits; (6) \nqualified summer youth employees; (7) low-income ex-felons; and (8) \nindividuals ages 18-24 living in empowerment zones or renewal \ncommunities. Eligibility for W-t-W is limited to individuals receiving \nwelfare benefits for 18 consecutive months ending on the hiring date. \nMore than 80 percent of WOTC and W-t-W hires were previously depending \non public assistance programs. These credits are both a hiring \nincentive, offsetting some of the higher costs of recruiting, hiring, \nand retaining public assistance recipients and other low-skilled \nindividuals, and retention incentive, providing a higher reward for \nthose who stay longer on the job.\n  Program Renewal and Improvement. Despite the considerable success of \nWOTC and W-t-W many vulnerable individuals still need a boost in \nfinding employment. This is particularly true during periods of high \nunemployment. There are several legislative changes that would \nstrengthen these programs, expand employment opportunities for needy \nindividuals, and make the programs more attractive to employers. These \nchanges are reflected in legislation which I introduced along with \nSenator Baucus, S. 1180, and these changes are as follows: one combine \nWOTC and W-t-W. The administration's budget proposes to simplify these \nimportant employment incentives by combining them into one credit and \nmaking the rules for computing the combined credits simpler. The \ncredits would be combined by creating a new welfare-to-work target \ngroup under WOTC. The minimum employment periods and credit rates for \nthe first year of employment under the present work opportunity tax \ncredit would apply to W-t-W employees. The maximum amount of eligible \nwages would continue to be $10,000 for W-t-W employees and $6,000 for \nother target groups $3,000 for summer youth. I addition, the second \nyear 50-percent credit under W-t-W would continue to be available for \nW-t-W employees under the modified WOTC; two, eliminate requirement to \ndetermine family income for ex-felons. Under current law, only those \nex-felons whose annual family income is 70 percent or less than the \nBureau of Labor Statistics lower living standard during the six months \npreceding the hiring date are eligible for WOTC. The administration's \nbudget also proposes to eliminate the family income attribution rule; \nthree, raise the WOTC age eligibility ceiling from 24 to 39 years of \nage for members of food stamp households and ``high-risk youth'' living \nin enterprise zones for renewal communities. Current WOTC eligibility \nrules heavily favor the hiring of women because single mothers are much \nmore likely to be on welfare or food stamps. Women constitute about 80 \npercent of those hired under the WOTC program, but men from welfare \nhouseholds face the same or even greater barriers to finding work. \nIncreasing the age ceiling in the ``food stamp category'' would greatly \nimprove the job prospects for many absentee fathers and other ``at \nrisk'' males. This change would be completely consistent with program \nobjectives because many food stamp households include adults who are \nnot working, and more than 90 percent of those on food stamps live \nbelow the poverty line.\n\n  I am very pleased that President Bush proposed a 2-year extension for \nthese programs in his budget, as well as some useful modifications and \nimprovements. The administration along with all of us in Congress are \neager to continue our efforts to create jobs in America. The amendment \nwould provide for a 1-year extension of current law to facilitate a \ntransition period and then in the second year implement these important \nchanges. I would prefer a permanent extension which would provide these \nimportant programs with greater stability, thereby encouraging more \nemployers to participate, make investments in expanding outreach to \nidentify potential workers from the targeted groups, and avoid the \nwasteful disruption of termination and renewal. A permanent extension \nwould also encourage the state job services to invest the resources \nneeded to make the certification process more efficient and employer-\nfriendly. Yet the cost is a significant consideration in the current \nbudget environment even though this is an excellent use of tax \nincentives which ultimately saves government resources while expanding \nopportunity for Americans.\n  Finally, I would urge the Senate to act quickly on this amendment and \non the underlying vehicle. WOTC and W-t-W expired at the end of last \nyear, and even though the extension we propose is retroactive, these \nprograms will not be fully effective until they become law. The \nindividuals who enter the workforce under these programs, and our \nstates, that benefit greatly from the reduction in welfare that these \nprograms generate, deserve quick action by the Senate on this \namendment. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2218-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached eulogy be printed in the Record today. Dr. James H. \nBillington, Librarian of Congress, delivered this eulogy on Tuesday, \nMarch 2, 2004 at the funeral of Daniel Boorstin, who served as \nLibrarian of Congress from 1975 to 1987. It also appeared in Rollcall \nyesterday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Hon. James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress--Eulogy for Librarian \n         of Congress Emeritus Daniel J. Boorstin, March 2, 2004\n\n       Dan Boorstin was a great American: the inspirational head \n     of two important national institutions; a key figure--along \n     with his friends Dillon Ripley and Roger Stevens--in the \n     cultural coming of age of our Nation's Capital; and a \n     matchless chronicler of the uniqueness, the innovative spirit \n     and the everyday practicality of our shared American \n     experience.\n       He was an exuberant humanist who brought high literary \n     style to a wide popular audience. He put things together when \n     others were taking them apart. He kept history alive by \n     telling it as his story at a time when many were dehumanizing \n     it, first with ideological prejudice and then with \n     methodological pomposity. He was an optimist but also a \n     critic--providing us an early warning of the difference \n     between real and pseudo events, between people who actually \n     do things and manufactured celebrities who are simply well-\n     known for being well-known.\n       He created in his two great trilogies an original American \n     version of the tradition of sweeping, multivolume histories \n     that flourished in England from Gibbon to Toynbee. His \n     longtime friend and colleague Jaroslav Pelikan told me \n     yesterday that Dan had given him crucial early advice and \n     encouragement as Jary was embarking on his own monumental \n     multivolume history.\n       It was fun to be with Dan in person and through his \n     writings. He mixed erudition with epigrammatic wit and \n     colorful vignettes. He could be contentious and even \n     temperamental, but almost always in defense of someone or \n     some institution to which he was loyal at a time when it was \n     being unfairly maligned.\n       As Librarian of Congress he exemplified as well as \n     encouraged the highest scholarly standards. At the same time, \n     he threw open the big bronze doors to let in the widest \n     possible readership. From the time of my own arrival in \n     Washington to run the Wilson Center until the time I was \n     chosen to succeed him at the Library, he was a very special \n     example, helpmate and friend.\n       Plato said that immortality lies in one's children and \n     one's books. Dan and his incomparable wife and effervescent \n     editorial collaborator, Ruth, have opened both of those \n     pathways to an undying legacy. His outstanding children have \n     spoken today; and a great extended family of readers yet \n     unborn will be benefitting from his books in the years to \n     come.\n       He was a man of the book, a gift to America from the people \n     of the book. His bibliography itself fills a book. He founded \n     and was a benefactor to the Center for the Book within the \n     world's greatest collection of books at the Library of \n     Congress; and it now has--thanks to John Cole, whom he \n     appointed to head it--affiliated Centers for the Book in all \n     50 states and the District of Columbia. Dan was concerned not \n     just about illiteracy but also about alliteracy--a term he \n     coined to describe those people who can read but have lost \n     the will to do so. And he launched the plan and gained the \n     congressional support to restore the Thomas Jefferson \n     Building to its true glory as America's temple of the book.\n       When he was sworn in in November 1975 as the 12th Librarian \n     of Congress in the Great Hall of that magnificent building, \n     he spoke these prophetic words: ``The computer can help us \n     find what we know is there. But the book remains our symbol \n     and our resource for the unimagined question and the \n     unwelcome answer.''\n       In his last years he crafted a second trilogy of books \n     largely out of what he was fond of calling the ``multimedia \n     encyclopedia'' that was and is the Library of Congress. He \n     ended up in his personal note to readers in the last volume, \n     The Seekers, asking a question that lay beyond all the \n     unwelcome answers. Has Western man, he asked, emptied meaning \n     from life by moving from seeking purposes to seeking causes--\n     from deeply wondering why to simply asking how? Books and \n     family gave meaning and purpose to the rich life of this \n     man--as they do to the American culture that he loved and \n     ennobled.\n       Marjorie and I--like so many of his fond admirers--will \n     miss him and the infectious enthusiasm for learning that he \n     miraculously sustained for nearly nine decades. We will \n     always be grateful for the friendship and support that he and \n     Ruth so generously and warmly extended to us and to the \n     amazing institution in which we have been privileged to \n     succeed him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2218-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Adam Mooney and Patrick Dorff\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

First Lieutenant Mooney was 28 years \nold.\n  Adam Mooney was a native of Cambridge, MD, assigned to the 3rd \nSquadron, 17th Cavalry, 10th Mountain Division of the U.S. Army, \nstationed at Fort Drum, NY. After graduating from high school in \nDorchester County, MD, in 1993, Adam attended the University of \nMaryland Eastern Shore. He left college to enlist in the Army, but \nreturned to the university soon after to complete his degree in \naviation management science. Adam was a lifelong enthusiast of aviation \nand flying--in fact, he earned his pilot's license at about the same \ntime he earned his driver's license. In the Army, Adam was able to \nfurther pursue the challenges of aviation while flying the OH-58 Kiowa \nWarrior helicopter. His unit was deployed to Iraq late last year, where \nAdam flew helicopter missions to provide support, security, and \nintelligence to ground troops.\n  On January 25, 1LT Adam Mooney was flying a rescue mission near \nMosul, Iraq, in search of soldiers whose boat had capsized on the \nTigris River. According to witnesses, Mooney's helicopter hit a power \nline and plummeted into the river. The bodies of both Mooney and his \nco-pilot, CWO Patrick Dorff, were missing in the aftermath of the \ncrash--Dorff's body was found 4 days later, and Mooney's 3 weeks later. \nWe extend our deepest sympathies to their families, who certainly \nsuffered under great strain and emotional stress while they awaited \nnews of their loved ones' welfare.\n  Adam Mooney's wife, Katie, lives with her parents in Conway, AR, \nwhere she moved to work on her nursing degree while her husband was \nserving overseas. Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to her, as \nwell as to Adam's parents, friends, and loved ones, in this time of \ngreat loss for their family. Adam was a courageous young man, lost to \nus far too soon, but we remain confident that his sacrifice was in a \nnoble and honorable cause.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2218-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  A terrible crime occurred in Upland, CA, in December 1999. There, a \nman died after being hit in the head with a pool cue by an attacker who \naccused him of being gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2218-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2218-S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, over the past week, we have all watched \nthe images of killings, chaos, and looting in Haiti. I am sad for the \nHaitian people. Once again, their leaders and the international \ncommunity have failed them, and the poorest and the most vulnerable are \nenduring the greatest suffering.\n  I am also deeply disappointed with the Bush administration. Over the \npast several years, this administration ignored the simmering problems \nin Haiti and hoped they would somehow resolve themselves. That approach \nobviously backfired. Things have spiraled out of control. We now have a \nfull-blown crisis on our hands, accusations that the administration \nhelped to engineer a\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\ncoup of President Aristide, and the deployment of thousands of U.S. \nMarines into a difficult situation. Bringing change to Haiti will now \nbe a far more dangerous and costly undertaking. Moreover, the U.N. or \nsome other impartial organization will have to conduct an investigation \nto answer nagging questions about Aristide's departure.\n   I recognize that many administration officials did not support \nPresident Aristide. I can understand that view, as I also lost \nconfidence in him. There is no question that serious allegations of \ncorruption and abuse surround President Aristide and his associates and \nthat these issues should have been dealt with. President Aristide and \nother Haitian leaders should be held accountable for their actions. \nHaving said that, we should not forget the courage that President \nAristide displayed when he first spoke out against the excesses of the \nbrutal and corrupt dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier.\n  But this administration did not want to make the effort to help clean \nup the Haitian Government, build a reform-minded opposition, and \nrestructure the economy.\n  Instead, the Bush administration simply disengaged. During his first \nyear in office, President Bush reduced aid to Haiti by about 25 \npercent. Concerned with the growing problems in Haiti, Senator Dodd and \nI sent a letter to USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios in February 2002, \nurging an overhaul of our foreign aid program to Haiti. The response to \nour letter was essentially: ``Thanks for writing. We have a limited \nbudget, but we will remain `flexible' in our approach.'' The results of \nthis flexible approach speak for themselves.\n  To be fair, USAID was under heady pressure to absorb activities that \nthe State Department should have funded. USAID does not deserve the \nblame for an administration-wide policy failure.\n  During the last month, United States policy toward Haiti crystallized \naround the goal of getting rid of President Aristide. For all the \nadministration's tough talk aimed at President Aristide, this White \nHouse has embraced corrupt leaders with far less democratic credentials \nthan President Aristide when it has suited its purpose. This episode is \nyet another reminder of how the contradictory policies and rhetoric of \nthis administration are damaging U.S. credibility around the world.\n  In some respects, President Aristide's departure begins a new chapter \nfor Haiti. In other ways, it is not clear just how new it is. For the \nthird time in 20 years, a Haitian leader has been forced into exile, \nand at least for the third time in 90 years, the U.S. military has \nintervened in Haiti.\n  What is to show for years of interventions and hundreds of millions \nof dollars in U.S. assistance? Haiti remains one of the poorest and \nmost corrupt countries on Earth, facing a myriad of complex problems. \nRemoving President Aristide will not solve these entrenched problems, \nbut it may provide a way forward.\n  The United States has compelling reasons to help. Haiti is just a few \nhundred miles away from our shores, and the social turmoil there could \neasily spread to the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, and elsewhere in \nour neighborhood. The United States has a long relationship with Haiti \nand many Haitian Americans live in the United States. Perhaps most \nimportantly, we have a moral responsibility to help a nation where so \nmany have been suffering for so long.\n  The United States, France, and others must work with the United \nNations, the Organization of American States to help fill the power \nvacuum in Port-au-Prince. The international community must also come up \nwith a substantial aid package to help the Haitian people get back on \ntheir feet.\n  This will be a long, slow process. If we are to succeed in meeting \nthe challenge of recovery and rebuilding in Haiti, the United States \nand the international community must stay engaged. Most of all, the \nHaitians themselves must take responsibility, especially the religious \nand political leaders. But we must take care not to overlook a key \ngroup that must be involved in this process--middle-class Haitians who \nhave left the country over the past few decades.\n  As Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor in chief of the Haitian Times, points \nout in Monday's Wall Street Journal, involving Haiti's middle class is \nessential. He writes:\n\n       The international community has to bring the country's \n     middle class not merely to the table, but back to Haiti. This \n     middle class has been fleeing Haiti for the U.S., where it \n     has consolidated itself, for the last 30 years. We should \n     look to that group, the Haitian diaspora, educated at the \n     best schools in the U.S. and Canada, to help lead the country \n     out of its perpetual cycle of violence and misery.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Pierre-Pierre, and believe that the administration \nshould heed his advice.\n  We have missed one opportunity after another in Haiti. It is time for \nus to make the most of this unfortunate situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Andrew Natsios,\n     Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Natsios: We are deeply concerned with the \n     deteriorating humanitarian situation in Haiti. The political \n     impasse between the Haitian Government and the political \n     opposition has only made a serious situation more dire. As a \n     matter of U.S. policy Haiti is being denied access to monies \n     from the multilateral development banks until the government \n     and opposition resolve their differences. For that reason, \n     the humanitarian needs of Haiti must be met solely from \n     bilateral donations through non-governmental organizations \n     such as CARE, Catholic Relief Services and World Vision.\n       Violence, poverty, and disease are rampant throughout \n     Haiti. Since the United States is opposing access for Haiti \n     to multilateral monies to address these problems, we believe \n     the U.S. has a moral obligation to ensure, to the maximum \n     extent feasible, that U.S. bilateral humanitarian assistance \n     allocations be maintained at adequate levels. However, that \n     does not appear to be the case. As you know annual USAID/\n     Haiti allocations have been cut in half since FY1999 to $50 \n     million for the current fiscal year. Moreover, the \n     Administration's FY 2003 request is only $45 million. At \n     these levels we are very skeptical that USAID will be able to \n     continue many critical programs, including school feeding \n     programs, public health programs for Haitian children ages 0 \n     to 5, and AIDS treatment and prevention programs.\n       We strongly urge you to review the overall FY 2003 USAID \n     budget to determine whether additional funds can be found for \n     USAID FY 2003 programs in Haiti. Moreover, we do not support \n     efforts to obligate FY 2002 Haiti monies for purposes other \n     than humanitarian assistance programs.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns. We look \n     forward to working with you in addressing the humanitarian \n     needs of Haiti's seven million people.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n       U.S. Senators.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   U.S. Agency for\n\n\n                                    International Development,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Mr. Natsios has asked me to respond to \n     your letter of February 15, 2002, concerning the current \n     situation in Haiti and declining U.S. assistance levels. We \n     regret the delay in responding.\n       We share your concern about deteriorating conditions in \n     Haiti, and are doing our best to help ease the situation \n     within the constraints of current budget realities. Since \n     September 11, 2001, worldwide pressures on overall resources \n     limit our ability to maintain prior year levels for Haiti. We \n     have made up most of the difference using Development \n     Assistance and the Child Survival and Health Programs fund; \n     however, these accounts are heavily subscribed.\n       Our programs will continue to have a meaningful impact in \n     Haiti through the provision of primarily humanitarian \n     assistance. Approximately 80 percent of the FY 2002 budget \n     and FY 2003 request will go toward health, food aid, and \n     education activities. These programs will still provide \n     health and family planning services to approximately 2.7 \n     million Haitians--mostly women and children--including HIV/\n     AIDS prevention. They will also target food resources in \n     Haiti to children under five and pregnant/lactating women, \n     and will continue to make marked improvements in math and \n     reading achievement test scores for 150,000 Haitian children.\n       In closing, we are watching the situation very closely and \n     remain flexible on funding options for FY 2002. We welcome a \n     continuing dialogue with Congress on appropriate assistance \n     levels for Haiti as events unfold.\n       Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Please \n     let us know when this office can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                J. Edward Fox,\n\n                                          Assistant Administrator,\n                        Bureau for Legislative and Public Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2220-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n                ARKANSAS BLACK ON BLACK CRIME COALITION\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group \nof Arkansas who are demonstrating true leadership and commitment in \nfacing down one of the gravest problems facing African-American \ncommunities today--black on black crime.\n  Many people are unaware of the extent of black on black crime. \nConsider: African-Americans constitute 12 percent of the U.S. \npopulation. But in 2002, 45 percent of all murder victims nationwide \nwere black. Of those murders, fully 91 percent were incidents of black \non black crime. For young black men, homicide is the leading cause of \ndeath; for young black women, the second leading cause of death.\n  It's clear that we need to address this epidemic. The good news is \nthat, in Arkansas, we're trying to do just that. Last year, a group of \ncommunity leaders, business leaders, government officials, and \nreligious leaders banded together to form the ``Black On Black Crime \nCoalition,'' dedicated to raising public awareness of this important \nissue and developing solutions to mitigate this epidemic of crime and \nviolence that is destroying lives, families, and communities every day. \nThe coalition is just over one year old, and I'm proud to say that they \nare making great progress in developing new solutions, programs and \nplans to reduce the incidence of violent crime in the black community. \nThese range from community workshops to neighborhood associations, from \nyouth programs to public awareness campaigns.\n  The coalition is working with government leaders and law enforcement \nofficials to develop fresh, innovative solutions to the problem of \nblack on black crime. I've worked with the coalition as a partner, and \nI've been impressed with the energy, seriousness, and dedication that \nmembers of the coalition display. Given the commitment I've seen so \nfar, I'm confident that we will see outstanding results from this vital \norganization. Even if we can't completely eliminate black on black \ncrime, we can significantly reduce their frequency. That will be good \nnews for all of our communities.\n  We recently observed ``Black On Black Crime Prevention Month'' to \nmark the coalition's founding in Arkansas and to continue raising \npublic awareness about this epidemic of violent crime. I thank them for \ntheir commitment, and I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing \ntheir leadership. It's been a great year, and I look forward to working \nwith the Black On Black Crime Coalition for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2220-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK--MARCH 1-7, 2004\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, this week is National Peace Corps Week. \nIt is with great pleasure that I send my congratulations to the Peace \nCorps volunteers serving throughout the world as we celebrate the Peace \nCorps' 43 years of service.\n  Forty-three years ago, President John F. Kennedy mobilized a \ngeneration to work in emerging nations around the world in education, \ncommunity development, agriculture, health care, and public works.\n  Since 1961, over 170,000 Americans have volunteered their expertise, \ntime, and energy to foster development and progress in 136 countries. \nThere is no greater symbol of America's generosity than American \nvolunteers living and working in partnership with the people of \ndeveloping nations to encourage education and opportunity.\n  Currently, over 7,500 volunteers are serving in 71 countries around \nthe world--the highest number of volunteers in the field in 28 years--\nand applications have risen by 10 percent. Last year, Peace Corps \nentered or re-entered Albania, Azerbaijan, Chad, and Fiji, and many \nother countries have expressed interest in establishing a partnership \nwith Peace Corps. I strongly support Peace Corps entry into Mexico for \nthe first time.\n  It is my deepest hope that we continue to recognize and support the \nPeace Corps' important work. By honoring the Peace Corps, we reaffirm \nour Nation's commitment to strengthen freedom and create opportunities \naround the world.\n  President Bush has announced a goal of doubling the number of Peace \nCorps volunteers over 5 years. I support this effort and the \nPresident's budget request for the Peace Corps. As chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs, \nit is my objective to help the Peace Corps become not only bigger, but \nalso better and safer. The well-being of the volunteer must remain the \ntop priority of the Corps. I believe the Peace Corps must have the \nresources it needs to ensure volunteer safety. I also believe the Peace \nCorps should continue efforts to diversify its volunteers. We need to \nbring into the Corps more older volunteers, and more minorities. Only \nthen can be the Peace Corps truly represent the face of America's \nmelting pot.\n  The Peace Corps is part of Minnesota's heritage--over 5,000 \nMinnesotans have served as volunteers. And while the Peace Corps has \nbeen rightly associated with John F. Kennedy, it was Minnesota Senator \nHubert Humphrey who proposed the idea in the 1950s.\n  I am very happy to join with Peace Corps volunteers, past and \npresent, to celebrate National Peace Corps Week--March 1-7, 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2220-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN HENRY ``HANK'' W. PUTEK, SR., USNR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, today at Arlington National Cemetery we \nlaid to rest a great patriot to whom I am proud to pay tribute. Captain \nHenry ``Hank'' W. Putek, Sr., USN, was a naval aviator whose lifelong \nlove of flying led to a 27 year Navy career that spanned the cold war \nand included service in Korea and Vietnam. It is my solemn honor today \nto recall his selfless commitment to this great Nation.\n  A pilot from the age of 14, Captain Putek obtained a commission in \nthe U.S. Navy in 1953 through the Naval Aviation Cadet program. His \ndistinguished career in naval aviation began with flight training in \nPensacola, FL where he earned the coveted ``wings of gold'' of a naval \naviator. He went on to fly combat jets in Korea and Vietnam, including \nthe F-9 Fury, Douglas Skyraider, and F-4 Phantom. He served in numerous \naircraft carriers with such storied names as Lexington, Wasp, Yorktown, \nHornet, and Saratoga. In the race for space, Captain Putek was a \nproject engineer for various research and development efforts and \npiloted tracking aircraft during the Gemini program. Captain Putek was \na Navy test pilot who accumulated an astonishing 7,600 hours in 22 \ntypes of military aircraft throughout his career.\n  In 1977, Captain Putek retired from the United States Navy but \ncontinued to pursue his love for aviation as a training director with \nPiper Aircraft Corporation. He qualified in 22 Piper models and types. \nHe was well known in his hometown as the owner of a bright orange \n``Davis'' single engine aircraft, his pride and joy, which he built by \nhand.\n  Captain Putek is survived by his wife of 47 years, Mary Louis Putek, \nhis sons, Hank and Jon, his daughters, Gwen and Janet, his sister, \nDolores, and his brother, James. He was a loving husband and father, a \npassionate aviator, and a true gentleman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2220-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2220-S2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         MARCH ON FRANKFORT, KY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

LANDRUM R. BOLLING\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a few highlights from the remarkable lifetime of leadership \nand humanitarianism displayed by Dr. Landrum Bolling, former president \nof Earlham College.\n  From 1958 to 1973, Dr. Bolling led both the students and the faculty \nof Earlham College in numerous interdisciplinary programs grounded in \npeace, justice, equality, simplicity, and consensus decisionmaking. His \nvast personal experience with foreign cultures and religions \nfacilitates his teaching of international studies and humanitarianism.\n  Currently, at the age of 90, Dr. Bolling serves as director-at-large \nof Mercy Corps, a not-for-profit organization that exists to alleviate \nsuffering, poverty, and oppression by helping people build secure, \nproductive, and just communities. Through his active involvement with \nMercy Corps, he has once again joined forces with Earlham College to \nform the Landrum Bolling Fellowships in International Service program. \nThe Landrum Bolling Fellowships provide qualified Earlham graduates \nwith the opportunity to participate, on many levels, with Mercy Corps' \ntremendous humanitarian relief and development programs. It is \ncertainly an opportunity for the students to apply, internationally, \nthe concepts they have previously studied at Earlham College.\n  Dr. Bolling has dedicated his life to both academia and public \nservice, and I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate him \non his many worthwhile accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2221-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF PHILLIP THOMAS DEUTSCH\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I also transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the Protocol, and an \nunclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) \nconcerning the Protocol. (Consistent with section 123 of the Act, as \namended by title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified Annex to the NPAS, \nprepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director of \nCentral Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will \nbe submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy \nand a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nstating the views of the Commission are also enclosed.\n  I am advised that the proposed Protocol has been negotiated \nconsistent with the Act and other applicable law and that it meets all \nstatutory requirements. This Protocol will advance the nonproliferation \nand other foreign policy interests of the United States.\n  The Protocol amends the Agreement for Cooperation Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of Indonesia Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy in two \nrespects:\n  1. It extends the Agreement, which expired by its terms on December \n30, 2001, until December 30, 2031, with effect from the former date; \nand\n  2. It updates certain provisions of the Agreement relating to the \nphysical protection of nuclear material subject to the Agreement.\n  As amended by the proposed Protocol, the Agreement will continue to \nmeet all requirements of U.S. law.\n  Indonesia is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and has an agreement with the IAEA for the \napplication of full-scope safeguards to its nuclear program. It was \nalso among the early sponsors of, and is a current party to, the \nSoutheast Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone. The United States and \nIndonesia have had a long and positive history of cooperation in the \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, with our earliest agreement for this \npurpose dating back to 1960.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Protocol and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Protocol and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration \nis prepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and House International Relations Committee \nconsistent with section 123 b.

A bill to establish a national health program administered \nby the Office of Personnel Management to offer health benefits plans to \nindividuals who are not Federal employees, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along \nwith my colleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln, which will help small \nbusinesses struggling to make health insurance available to their \nemployees.\n  Health insurance premiums have risen as much as six times the rate of \ninflation in the past decade. Last year they rose by 13.9 percent, the \nfourth consecutive year of double-digit increases. Some small \nbusinesses in Illinois are facing increases as high as 40 percent \nannually.\n  According to a survey conducted by Mercer Consulting, worker health \ncare costs have overtaken taxes as the biggest concern among small \nbusiness owners; and two-thirds of them are shopping for a new health \nplan every year in an effort to save money.\n  The Conference Board, an executive research firm, conducts an annual \nsurvey of 120 CEOs. One of the questions they ask is how big an \nobstacle health care costs are in hiring new workers. This year, 78 \npercent said it was an obstacle, 35 percent said it was a major \nobstacle.\n  Health care costs are hurting small businesses, workers and the \neconomy; and fixing this problem should be a national priority.\n  There are two main problems for small businesses in obtaining \naffordable insurance. First, there aren't many insurers offering \naffordable products to small groups. Many small businesses only have \naccess to one insurer in their area, which make it hard to comparison \nshop. The second problem is that because of their limited size, small \nbusiness don't have the purchasing or negotiating power of a big \ncompany.\n  The Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act of 2004 (SEHBP) will \naddress both of these problems while maintaining insurance solvency and \nbenefit standards.\n  Our bill will create a program based on the successful Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program or ``FEHBP,'' which offers Federal \nemployees a range of private sector options at affordable prices. This \nnew program would draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group \npurchasing savings, comprehensive benefits, low administrative costs \nand nationwide availability.\n  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which has forty years of \nexperience running FEHBP, would set up a separate SEHBP national \npurchasing pool open to businesses with 100 employees or less. OPM \nwould annually negotiate benefit packages with private health insurers \ninterested in offering an insurance plan through the SEHBP program. OPM \nwould send out summaries of health plans available to all participating \nand interested employers during an annual open enrollment season. Plan \nguides would include a description of each plan offered and\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nthe associated costs, as well as results of a customer satisfaction \nsurvey of the plans.\n  Each employee would choose a plan right for them and enroll directly \nwith the health insurer. To help defray costs for the employers and \nencourage them to offer insurance to low-income employees, employers \nwould receive an annual refundable tax credit if they agree to pay at \nleast 60 percent of the insurance premium. The tax credit would be \nequal to 25 percent of the employer contribution for self-only \npolicies, 30 percent for policies covering married couples with no \ndependents, and 35 percent for family policies, for workers making up \nto $25,000 per year.\n  There would also be a refundable 10 percent bonus tax credit for \nthose employers who enroll in the first year and an additional bonus to \nemployers who cover more than 60 percent of the premium. The bonus \nwould be equivalent to a 5 percent add-on per additional 10 percent of \npremium covered. So, if an employer covers 70 percent, the employer \nwould receive an additional 5 percent tax credit. If they cover 80 \npercent of the premium, they would get an additional 10 percent tax \ncredit.\n  All self-employed persons and employees in small businesses of 100 \nemployees or less would be eligible to enroll in SEHBP health plans. \nOPM would have the authority to grant waivers to businesses with more \nthan 100 employees.\n  One of the few differences from FEHBP is that SEHBP plans would be \nallowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger enrollees would be \nmore likely to enroll. The more young healthy people join the program, \nthe lower the premiums will be for everyone.\n  SEHBP health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting \ncondition exclusions on new SEHBP enrollees who have at least one year \nof health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an \nSEHBP plan. However, to prevent people from waiting until they get sick \nto enroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for known \npreexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage \nimmediately prior to enrollment, while covering costs associated with \nnew conditions.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Tommy Thompson of the Department of Health \nand Human Services said yesterday that people without health insurance \nin this country get health care. I disagree. There are millions of \nAmericans forgoing care because they don't have access to affordable \nhealth care. Additionally, small businesses are forgoing hiring because \nof the cost of offering health care to new employees. These problems \ncan and should be solved and I believe this legislation could open the \ndoor for many Americans to obtain good health insurance coverage.\n  SEHBP would provide small employers a way to offer their workers an \narray of health insurance options at a group discounted rate. With a \nlimited administrative effort and a refundable tax credit, employers \nwould be able to participate in a health insurance program that offers \ngreater affordability, access and choice without compromising benefit \nand solvency standards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Durbin, to introduce the Small Employer Health Benefits Program \nAct of 2004.\n  This legislation seeks to address an enormous problem facing small \nbusinesses in Arkansas and all across the country: accessibility and \naffordability of health insurance. I have talked with many small \nbusiness owners in Arkansas who have been forced to drop or \ndramatically reduce health insurance for their employees even though \nthey desperately want to offer it. Small employers say that offering \nhealth insurance has a positive impact on recruitment, retention, \nemployee attitude, performance, health status, and the overall success \nof the business. What better way to get our economy going again than to \nhelp small businesses succeed?\n  Small businesses are the number one source for jobs in Arkansas. And \nthe smaller the businesses, the less likely they will offer health \ninsurance. Nationally, 58 percent of all private sector employers offer \nhealth insurance. Only three States fall below this average: my home \nState of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Montana. Arkansas, rate for private \ncoverage is 43 percent.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce legislation today that will offer \nsmall employers a real solution to the problem of accessing affordable, \ncomprehensive health insurance for their employees. Our legislation \ncalls for the creation of a new Small Employers Health Benefits Program \nwhich will offer small employers affordable choices among private \nhealth insurance plans by giving them access to a large purchasing pool \nand negotiated rates. Our bill combines the best of what government-run \nhealth care, but harnesses the power of market competition to bring \ndown health insurance costs by using a proven government negotiator.\n  Under our bill, small businesses across America would be able to pool \ntheir risk and purchasing power together to offer affordable health \ninsurance options for their employees. Based on the successful Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits program, which has provided quality benefit \nchoices to Federal employees for decades, our program would offer small \nbusinesses a range of benefit packages from a variety of insurance \ncompanies, ensuring them a choice of affordable products.\n  All small employers with under 100 employees could voluntarily \nparticipate in the new SEHBP. Why only 100 employees or less? We target \nhelp to those who need it the most. Take Arkansas as an example. 87 \npercent of the businesses in Arkansas with 100 to 200 employees do \noffer health insurance. However, most businesses in Arkansas, 76 \npercent to be exact, have less than 50 employees and less than one-\nthird of them are able to offer health insurance to their employees.\n  Also under our bill, if employers agree to pay a minimum percentage \nof the premium for workers making under $25,000, they would receive a \nrefundable tax credit in return. Why only low-wage workers? Studies \nshow that more than half of workers in firms under 100 people make less \nthan $25,000. And firms with a high proportion of low-wage workers are \nmuch less likely to offer insurance.\n  Further, current health tax-credits are not targeted to those who \nneed help the most. A recent study shows that only 28 percent of \ncurrent health benefit tax expenditures will go to families with \nincomes below $50,000 this year. This is bad considering that these \nfamilies account for more than half of all families in our country. In \ncontrast, families with incomes of $100,000 or more comprise 14 percent \nof the population but will account for 26 percent of all health benefit \ntax expenditures.\n  By giving small employers a refundable tax credit to defray part of \nthe employer contribution for low-income workers, we provide help to \nthose struggling families who need it the most.\n  One of the best aspects of our program is that every person working \nfor a small business anywhere in the country--rural or urban--would \nhave access to a choice of plans. And workers who move from one SEHBP-\nparticipating company to another anywhere in the Nation would be able \nto maintain their same health coverage.\n  For example, a florist working in Helena, AR, who is enrolled in an \nSEHBP nationwide plan could move to Carbondale, IL, without changing \nher health insurance. It's that easy.\n  Consumers are protected because plans in SEHBP will be subject to the \nsame strict regulatory and solvency standards applied to plans in \nFEHBP. And small employers would be relieved of the burden of comparing \ninsurers, benefit packages, costs and negotiating contracts.\n  I hope that our colleagues will take a careful look at our \nlegislation and present it to the small businesses in their States. I \nhope they will ask them about their struggle to find affordable health \ninsurance in today's market and see if they'd view this as a better \nalternative.\n  The number of uninsured in our country is alarming and should be a \nnational priority. It is apparent by the statements of HHS Secretary \nTommy Thompson yesterday that President Bush's administration doesn't \nrecognize the severity of this crisis. Secretary Thompson said: ``Even \nif you don't have health insurance in America, you get taken care of. \nThat could be defined as universal health care.''\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  With all due respect to Secretary Thompson, I don't know where he's \ngetting his information. Just look at the facts:\n  Twenty percent of the working-aged adults in Arkansas (who are \nbetween 19 and 64 years of age) are uninsured. Forty-four million \nAmericans nationwide don't have health insurance.\n  Uninsured families have less access to important screenings, state-\nof-the art technology, and prescription drugs. We just passed a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit because we know how important access \nto prescription drugs are in improving health.\n  Uninsured adults have a 25 percent greater mortality risk than adults \nwith coverage. About 18,000 deaths among people younger than 65 are \nattributed to lack of health insurance coverage every year.\n  Uninsured adults with chronic conditions like diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, HIV infection and mental illness have less \naccess to preventive care and have worse clinical outcomes than insured \npatients. They try to buy insurance, but it is virtually impossible to \nget in the individual market.\n  Uninsured adults negatively affect our health care providers and \nlocal economies too. A community's high rate of uninsurance can \nadversely affect the overall health status of the community, the \nfinancial stability of its health care institutions and providers, and \naccess to emergency departments and trauma centers. My hospitals in \nArkansas will tell you how expensive uncompensated care can be.\n  These facts make it clear: people without health insurance don't \n``get taken care of'' as Thompson said. Those who lack health insurance \ndon't get access to timely and appropriate health care. The facts are \nthat Americans without health insurance--children and adults--suffer \nworse health and die sooner than those who do have health insurance.\n  In Arkansas, the number one cause of bankruptcy is high medical \nbills. These working families need help with this problem.\n  The fact is that people who lack health insurance are sicker and die \nsooner. You ``don't get taken care of'' if you have no health \ninsurance. You fend for yourself.\n  That's why our small businesses employers--who make up most of the \nbusinesses in Arkansas--want to offer health insurance to their \nemployees. And that is why our bill that Senator Durbin and I are \nintroducing today is good for America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2164. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to authorize local educational agencies in rural areas to \nobtain a limited waiver of certain requirements relating to the \nemployment of highly qualified teachers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that I hope \nwill be a useful tool for America's rural schools. The ``Assisting \nAmerica's Rural Schools Act'' will address the concerns of rural Local \nEducation Agencies (LEAs) that are trying to comply with the teacher \nquality standards set by the ``No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.''\n  Every day, rural communities are confronted by a shortage of \nresources. It may surprise some people to know there are still small \ntowns in rural America where the citizens wait for a doctor to make his \nrounds, a mail truck to drop off the mail. These families have elected \nto stay in their communities despite all the obstacles, and they \ndeserve an opportunity to enjoy a good quality of life.\n  It should come as no shock that there aren't many teachers who want \nto move to the remotest areas of a State, and teach in the few \nscattered schools in those areas. Furthermore, rural school districts' \nsalaries and benefits are usually dwarfed by what urban school \ndistricts can offer, which presents another barrier to attracting \nteachers to rural areas.\n  Imagine the community's sigh of relief when a rural school does \nacquire a teacher. Now imagine the look on the teacher's face when she \nrealizes she is expected to be ``highly qualified'' to instruct in \nmultiple subjects.\n  The small town of Austin in Lander County, NV is one such community. \nAustin boasts a grand total of 63 students in grades K-12. For grades \n6-12, there are only three teachers for all subjects. Yes, only three \nteachers.\n  These teachers are considered ``highly qualified'' in the areas of \nscience, English, math, and physical education. In order for Austin to \nacquire a teacher who is ``highly qualified'' in the subject of \nhistory, the LEA must either find and recruit another teacher, or send \none of its three current teachers back to school to get accredited in \nhistory via distance learning. Unfortunately, Lander County doesn't \nhave the money to do either of these things.\n  Another quandary is presented in the event that one of these three \nteachers retires, quits, or leaves the school system. Again, it is \nincumbent upon the LEA to decide how to spend its limited funds.\n  Make no mistake about it: The issue is not whether teachers in rural \nareas should be qualified to teach multiple subjects--they should. \nHowever, requiring them to attain ``highly qualified'' status in all \nsubjects simultaneously is unreasonable.\n  The ``Assisting America's Rural Schools Act'' provides rural LEAs \nwith some flexibility in meeting the definition of a ``highly qualified \nteacher'' without diminishing the accountability standards for such \nteachers. Once the Department of Education deems a rural school \ndistrict eligible, it will be allowed to exempt for 1 year any teacher \nalready highly qualified in at least one core academic subject from the \nFederal requirement to be ``highly qualified'' in every subject taught. \nA highly qualified teacher who is working toward that certification in \nanother subject can still teach both subjects.\n  Nevada is not alone in facing this dilemma. While 13 out of 17 \ncounties in my state would qualify as rural LEA's under the bill, it \nwould also provide relief for rural school systems in 48 other states.\n  There is no question that every child deserves a quality education \nregardless of whether he or she lives in urban rural America. We have \nthe responsibility in Congress of making sure the door of opportunity \nis open to all our children.\n  The ``highly qualified'' teacher provision in the ``No Child Left \nBehind Act'' is having the unintended consequence of depleting the \nalready scarce supply of teachers in rural areas. To correct this \nsituation, Congress should pass the ``Assisting America's Rural \nTeachers Act'' in the near future.\n  This bill was authored by Representative Jim Gibbons of Nevada and \nhas been introduced in the House. I am proud to author the Senate \nCompanion and urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Assisting America's Rural \n     Schools Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RURAL WAIVER OF CERTAIN QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1119(a) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6319(a)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Availability of waiver for rural local educational \n     agencies.--\n       ``(A) New hires.--Upon application by a rural local \n     educational agency, the Secretary may grant the agency the \n     authority to defer, for a 1-year period beginning on the date \n     any teacher who is new to the profession first begins \n     employment with the agency as a middle or secondary school \n     teacher, the application to such teacher of the requirement \n     in section 9101(23)(B)(ii) regarding demonstration of a high \n     level of competency in each of the academic subjects in which \n     the teacher teaches.

A bill to specify the end strength for active duty personnel \nof the Army as of September 30, 2005; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we are on a very important piece of \nlegislation. We also, on a daily basis, are confronted with a very \nimportant situation internationally, and that is our continued struggle \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Today Senator Hagel and I have announced \nlegislation that would increase the end strength of the U.S. Army by \n30,000 soldiers to meet these responsibilities worldwide.\n  This legislation will address a serious shortcoming in our Nation's \ndefense policy, ensuring that we have sufficient forces to carry out \nall of our missions around the globe, in Iraq and in Afghanistan. This \nlegislation would increase and authorize the end strength of the U.S. \nArmy from its present total of 482,400, to a total of 512,400.\n  I am introducing this legislation today not only with Senator Hagel, \nbut also with Senator McCain, Senator Akaka, Senator Bill Nelson, and \nSenator Clinton.\n  End strength is the number of personnel permitted to serve in the \nmilitary. Retired GEN Gordon R. Sullivan once stated that the objective \nof end strength is:\n\n       To have enough soldiers to execute Army missions at the \n     right time and the right place, have enough in the total to \n     have both tactical and operational flexibility and to have \n     adequate depth in numbers to support leader development, \n     required force structure manning and the requisite balance \n     needed across the ranks.\n\n  Each year in the Defense authorization bill, Congress authorizes the \nend strength of each branch of the military service, including the \nNational Guard and Reserves.\n  The importance of the authorized end strength is that it is the \nnumber of soldiers the budget funds. On average, each soldier costs \n$329 a day or about $120,000 a year to fully house, pay, train, and \nequip.\n  Last October, when we were debating the emergency supplemental for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senator Hagel and I offered an \namendment to increase the active-duty end strength of the Army by \n10,000 soldiers and to pay for that increase out of the supplemental.\n  At that time, the administration vehemently opposed the amendment. \nThe Pentagon argued that an increase was not necessary, that it was too \nexpensive, and using funds from the supplemental would disrupt current \nplans to win the war in Iraq. The Army stated in its message, \n``Increasing end strength is a last resort to fix the challenge'' of \nbalancing forces properly to win the war in Iraq and the global war on \nterrorism.\n  Yet on January 28 of this year, a mere 3 months later, Army Chief of \nStaff General Peter Schoomaker announced he had received emergency \nauthority to add 30,000 soldiers over the next 4 years to help \n``rebalance the force.'' Moreover, the Army would pay for these \nadditional troops with funds from the fiscal year 2004 supplemental.\n  Needless to say, I am happy the Department of Defense has adopted the \nposition Senator Hagel and I had last October. Indeed, they have raised \nour request of 10,000 up to 30,000. But it is one thing to have the \nsoldiers--it is an important thing--but, unfortunately, the Department \nof Defense is using the supplemental process to avoid putting these \ntroops in the budget, and I think that is the appropriate way to pay \nfor it.\n  Our Army is the finest fighting force in the world, but it is in \ndanger of being overextended and, in the process of that overextension, \ndegraded in its quality and its effectiveness.\n  Despite the heroic efforts of soldiers every day--men and women--who \nsacrifice themselves for our benefit, without the assistance, the \nresources, the support they need, they will find it more and more \ndifficult to do the job.\n  In January 2004, the National Journal summed up the serious situation \nfacing our Army:\n\n       The occupation of Iraq, the largest single deployment since \n     the Vietnam war, is lasting longer than expected, and comes \n     on top of major deployments elsewhere around the globe. Tens \n     of thousands of reservists have been sent away on lengthy \n     tours that they never expected. Emergency ``stop loss'' \n     orders have prevented soldiers from leaving the services \n     once their enlistments are up. . . . [and] demoralized \n     families are demanding relief.\n\n  The legislation we propose will address the major portion of that \nrelief. On January 21 of this year, LT GEN John Riggs, the director of \nthe Objective Force Task Force, or the Army of the future, told the \nBaltimore Sun:\n\n       You probably are looking at substantially more than \n     10,000--\n\n  Meaning 10,000 personnel.\n\n       I have been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the \n     Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today. . . .It's \n     not my intent to be provocative but to be intellectually \n     honest with my feelings on the strategy and commitment of the \n     Army.\n\n  It is not Senator Hagel's and my intent to be provocative but to be \nintellectually honest.\n  In a November 23, 2003, article in the Wall Street Journal, retired \nGEN Barry McCaffrey stated:\n\n       The U.S. Army is stretched to the breaking point. We do not \n     need more U.S. troops in Iraq. We do need to increase active-\n     duty strength of the U.S. Army in order to sustain the \n     current effort in both Iraq and Afghanistan--while remaining \n     prepared to counter North Korea. Many of us are concerned \n     that we won't be able to carry out the strategy we've \n     embarked on in Iraq because we won't be able to sustain it. \n     Next summer, we could be saying that we're breaking the U.S. \n     Army, and that we can't do a third rotation.\n\n  I would disagree with General McCaffrey on the need for additional \ntroops in Iraq. This week's experience of almost 200 civilian \ncasualties and suicide attacks on Shi'a pilgrims suggests there is \nperhaps a need for more U.S. security, as well as better Iraqi \nsecurity.\n  The major point he makes is the point we are making: We have to \nincrease the overall size of the Army if we want to carry out the \nstrategy we embarked upon.\n  Jeffrey Record of the Army's Strategic Studies Institute stated in a \nreport published in December of 2003 that the ``groundforce \nrequirements in Iraq have forced the U.S. Army to the breaking point.'' \nHe goes on to say that:\n\n       The Army appeared incapable of sustaining a commitment of \n     16 of its 33 active-duty combat brigades in Iraq absent a \n     reduction in commitments elsewhere or an expansion of its \n     force structure.\n\n  Since 1989, the Army's military end strength has been cut by more \nthan 34 percent and civilian end strength by more than 45 percent while \nundergoing a 300-percent increase in mission rate. Their force \nstructure is going down both in terms of military and civilian \npersonnel, but their operations tempo has increased dramatically, and \nthey are being stretched and stretched to the breaking point.\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  Today the Army presently has 492,242 soldiers serving on active duty. \nThis has been the average rate for the past few weeks. This means that \non the average, the Army needs 8,000 more soldiers each day to \naccomplish its mission than Congress has authorized and budgeted for.\n  We already know there is a shortfall in troops, and unless we adopt \nincreases as we have proposed, this shortfall will become a huge chasm \nbetween the missions and capabilities to carry out those missions.\n  The situation in Iraq remains uncertain, but what is certain is the \nArmy is already planning to have a force of slightly more than 100,000 \ntroops in Iraq through 2006. This is not just a quick spike, a month or \ntwo that you can carry out through some emergency funding mechanisms, \nsomething temporary; this is several years. Indeed, I would suggest \nmany years to complete the missions.\n\n  In order to address the stresses caused by Iraq, the Army is intent \non rebalancing its force, or transforming it. The transformation is \nwhat General Schoomaker says requires the additional forces.\n  The Army is caught in a very difficult situation. They have to \nmodernize and transform themselves into a more agile, more \ntechnologically sophisticated units, but still they have \nresponsibilities of nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those \nresponsibilities are not amenable to high-tech solutions. They require \nthe old-fashioned solutions: troops on the ground, troops talking to \ncivilians in Iraq and Afghanistan, gathering intelligence, analyzing \nintelligence and having the force, both the perception of that force \nand the reality of that force, to ensure our adversaries are in check.\n  I am glad that today the Department of Defense now agrees with the \nproposal that was offered last fall by Senator Hagel and myself and 51 \nof our colleagues who supported us that the Army needs more soldiers. \nWhat we disagree on is the way in which we should pay for these forces.\n  As I stated previously, every U.S. soldier costs the taxpayers \napproximately $120,000 per year. Therefore, an additional 30,000 troops \nwould cost approximately $3.6 billion annually. There are two possible \nways to authorize and fund an increase in end strength with its \naccompanying costs. One way is to put the end strength increase in the \nbudget, raise the authorization levels in the Defense authorization \nbill, and find the funds in the $401 billion Defense budget to pay for \nthe troops. That is a method used in the bill we are introducing today.\n  The Defense Department, however, has chosen a different route. It \nintends to increase end strength by using the emergency authority \ngranted under 10 U.S. Code section 123a which waives the end strength \nrestrictions for a fiscal year if there is a war or national emergency.\n  When this authority is used, the $3.6 billion cost of additional \n30,000 troops is paid through supplemental or deficit funding.\n  This year, the extra troops will be paid for out of the fiscal year \n2004 supplemental, but that supplemental will be depleted on September \n30, 2004, if not earlier. So by my calculation, on October 1, 2004, \nthere will be no funding and those 30,000 additional soldiers, or a \nsignificant portion of those troops, will still be in the field as they \nare recruited, trained, and deployed. That means the Defense Department \nwill have to quickly request the Congress to provide another emergency \nfunding for these troops, troops they know full well will be in the \nservice or be recruited to the service or trained for the service by \nSeptember 30, 2004.\n  Moreover, if the Pentagon persists in using this waiver, then they \nwill repeat the scenario year after year. Pretend these troops do not \nexist when they send the regular budget up and then suddenly come to us \nwith a supplemental at a convenient time and ask for additional money. \nThat is not a way to budget for our forces.\n  I also point out that I am very concerned because I am hearing \nreports that the budget sent to us by the Budget Committee will include \ncuts to the overall defense line. How can the defense line overall be \ncut at the same time our military leaders are saying they need more \ntroops?\n  There are those who are talking about the situation of abandoning \nIraq. That is absolutely foolish. We are committed. Not only do we have \nto stay, we have to win. The only way to do that, in my view, is to \nmaintain and provide the real resources for the troops to do their job. \nIt is ironic to me, to say the least, that we would be contemplating a \nbudget that cuts defense spending right now when we literally have so \nmany unmet defense needs directly associated with Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  There is another problem with this supplemental approach. First, the \ndefinition of what is an emergency, the fiscal year 2000 budget \nresolution states that emergency funding must meet the following \ncriteria: necessity; second, sudden, quickly coming into being, and not \nbuilding up over time; third, urgent; four, unforeseen, unpredictable, \nand unanticipated; and five, temporary in nature.\n  These troops will not be temporary. The need is for several years. \nCertainly we know already what is coming before us. So this is not \nsomething quickly coming into being, something that is being built up \nsuddenly.\n  The cost of 30,000 additional troops is now predictable and \nanticipated for at least the next 4 years. It does not qualify as an \nemergency. This device is simply hiding the true cost of ongoing \noperations and transformation.\n  As I said before, there are some who say this is a spike. It is not a \nspike. It is a plateau, or at least an ascending hill and a very slow \ndecline.\n  This chart was presented to the Armed Services Committee staff by the \nArmy on February 12, 2004. It shows the transformation plan. It shows \nthe increase in the present end strength of 482,400 up to an end \nstrength of roughly 512,400, from about 33 brigades to about 48 \nbrigades. Then it shows the gradual decline.\n  I note this decline gets us back to current end strength around \nfiscal year 2010 or 2011. That is 7 years from now. That is not a \nspike. That is a tough hike up a steep hill and then a slow decline \nfrom that hill.\n  Also, this scenario assumes there are no other major contingencies \nsuch as North Korea; that there can be a successful transfer of \nmilitary duties to more civilians; that we can reduce the time our \nsoldiers are in training, in transit, in hospitals, and other \nnondeployed or nondeployable categories. These are all assumptions that \nmight not be met.\n\n  The most prudent action today is to increase the forces that we \nsuggest in our legislation. It is much easier to bring a force down \nthan to build it up. When it is brought down, it saves money. When it \nis brought down, stop-loss orders do not have to be relied upon. These \nare orders which basically tell soldiers they have reached their \nenlistment termination date but we are not letting them go. They are no \nlonger a volunteer, in some respects. They are with us until we tell \nthem they can go. So that is something of which we have to be very \nconscious.\n  We have to also be concerned that these 30,000 troops might not come \nonline at one moment. Obviously, it takes time to recruit and train. \nThe Army may not need or be able to handle all of these troops. That \ndoes not argue against authorizing this increased end strength. What it \ndoes is argue for flexibility in the way the Army brings the troops on, \nand that is something I am sure we can talk about in the conduct of our \ndiscussions this year on the defense authorization legislation.\n  We have a point now where our Army is stretched. It is under \ntremendous stress, and to a degree this also applies to the Marine \nCorps, our land forces. We can do the responsible thing, which is to \nstand up and in the clear light of day increase the end strength of our \nmilitary forces and pay for that end strength, or we can employ \nbudgetary gimmicks.\n  We can avoid the reality. Through smoke and mirrors we can try to \nsomehow persuade ourselves and maybe the American public that we do not \nhave to pay for these operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. That would be \nwrong in terms of our responsibility to the American public and our \nresponsibility, just as importantly, to the troops who are in the \nfield. They have to know we are not playing budget games with our \nmilitary forces. They have to know we support them, that we just cannot \ntalk about a generational\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nstruggle against terrorism if we have to fund that struggle.\n  We also have to be particularly cognizant that so many of our \nNational Guard and Reserve forces are engaged in this conflict. Of the \n100,000-plus troops who will be in Iraq in the next several weeks after \nthis rotation, 40 percent will be Reserve and National Guard forces, \nthe largest deployment of Reserve and National Guard forces since World \nWar II in a combat area of operations.\n  What is the message we are sending to them? If we do not increase the \nsize of our Active Forces, the message is simple: When you serve well--\nand they are--and honorably, and you return home, do not unpack your \nbags because you are going back before you know it.\n  We just do not have the Active Forces to carry out the missions.\n  I hope in the process of our deliberations on the Defense \nauthorization bill we can include the Hagel-Reed amendment. I thank my \ncolleagues who supported this amendment. Certainly, I think we want to \ndo all we can for our forces in the field.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nJack Reed in introducing legislation to increase the endstrength of the \nU.S. Army by 30,000 additional troops.\n  Last month, the Army Chief of Staff, General Peter Schoomaker \ninformed the Congress that the administration had approved an \nadditional 30,000 Army troops on a ``temporary'' basis for the next 4 \nyears.\n  Over the last year the Congress has been expressing grave concern \nthat our Armed Forces are too small to meet the extraordinary demands \nbeing placed on them today. Demands that will likely continue to be \nwith us well into the future.\n  The United States has over 125,000 troops in Iraq. Global commitments \nof our Armed Forces have soared since September 11, 2001. In order to \nprevent back-to-back deployments of our Active-Duty soldiers the Army \nNational Guard and Army Reserve will comprise about 40 percent of the \ncurrent troop rotation in Iraq.\n  In addition to dealing with the extraordinary demands being placed on \nthe U.S. Army, the Secretary of defense has tasked General Schoomaker \nto transform the Army.\n  By some accounts this transformation will be the most significant and \ncomplex undertaking to face the Army in half a century. It will not \nonly directly affect the Active-Duty Army, it will also change the \nnature of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve.\n  Secretary Ramsfeld stated before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat the Army must ``move away from the Napoleonic division structure \ndesigned for the 19th century, focusing instead on creating a 21st \ncentury `Modular Army' made up of self-contained, more self-sustaining \nbrigades that are available to work with any division commander.''\n  Transformation of the Armed Forces has been a mantra of the \nDepartment of Defense. To show unwavering commitment to transformation \nthe Secretary has created the Office of Force Transformation and a \nSupreme Allied Commander Transformation at NATO. Using the Quadrennial \nDefense Review as a compass Secretary Rumsfeld has been \n``transforming'' almost everything the Pentagon does . . . including \nsenior officer lunch rooms in the Pentagon.\n  The transformation of the Army's Total Force will affect about 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion people in uniform and a significant number of DOD civilians, \nemployers, and families.\n  So, why will the transformation of the U.S. Army be done off budget \nusing the emergency supplemental appropriations process? Why will some \nof the additional manpower that General Schoomaker needs to transform \nthe Army and rebalance the National Guard and Army Reserve come from \npreventing soldiers from leaving the Army at the end of their \nenlistments or delaying their retirement? An action referred to by the \nPentagon as ``stop loss.''\n  The Constitution tasks the Congress with significant responsibility \nregarding our national security.\n  Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress \nthe power ``to provide the common defense . . . to raise and support \nArmies . . . to provide and maintain a navy . . . and to make laws \nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying out the foregoing \npowers.''\n  In executing this responsibility Senator Reed and I are introducing \nlegislation to permanently increase the endstrength of the U.S. Army by \n30,000 troops. This legislation will give the Army Chief of Staff \nadditional help he needs to fight the war on terrorism, stabilize Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and meet the global demands being placed on the total \nforce today. Our legislation also gives General Schoomaker the manpower \n``headroom'' he has testified he needs to transform the total force . . \n. the Active-Duty Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard.\n  This legislation will set the U.S. Army's endstrength at 512,400, \n30,000 soldiers higher than it is currently set.\n  It is not our intention to put the Army in a position that to fund \nthe additional troops they must deplete critical recapitalization, \nmodernization, research, and MILCON accounts. The Department of Defense \nshould be required to better rationalize the department budget to make \nU.S. Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve transformation one of \nthe highest, fully funded, priorities of our Armed Forces.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2166. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to exempt \nabortions of pregnancies in cases of rape and incest from a limitation \non use of Department of Defense funds; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, over the past several months, we have \nheard about tragic incidents in which female cadets at the Air Force \nAcademy and military service women in Iraq have been the victims of \nrape and sexual assault. This is deplorable. There are 200,000 women in \nuniform, yet while they are protecting our Nation, our Nation is \nfailing to protect them from rape and sexual assault.\n  It is an even greater insult that we are telling our service women \nthat the Department of Defense will not pay if they choose to terminate \na pregnancy that is the result of rape.\n  Current law states that DoD funds may not be used to perform \nabortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered. It \ndoes not provide any exception for cases of rape and incest--such as is \nthe case in the Medicaid program. The Boxer-Snowe bill would add rape \nand incest to the life exception that is now law.\n  While current law allows service members to use military treatment \nfacilities for abortions resulting from rape and incest, the service \nwoman must pay for the procedure out of her own pocket. This is an \ninsult.\n  According to a study by the Iowa Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 30 \npercent of female U.S. military veterans report having been raped or \nhaving been the victim of an attempted rape during their military \nservice. This legislation will provide help for our female troops in \ncases of such horrific crimes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters of support for this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                        Population Connection,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2004.\n     Hon. Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing on behalf of 90,000 \n     members and supporters of Population Connection to express \n     our support for your bill providing that women who are \n     victims of rape or incest and serving in the U.S. military--\n     or are the dependents of members of the armed forces--have \n     access to government funded abortions. The legislation is a \n     critical first step in bringing to an end the appalling \n     policy that denies military women the basic freedom of choice \n     that all Americans are guaranteed.\n       Every individual has the fundamental right to freely decide \n     the number and spacing of her children and reproductive \n     choice is basic to the principle of individual liberty \n     cherished by all Americans and most people worldwide. Far too \n     many American women have been denied the full range of \n     reproductive choices for too long. We strongly support \n     efforts to expand choices for all those women denied them, \n     and that includes the\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n     women serving in our armed forces. Your bill is an important \n     first step in bringing constitutionally guaranteed health \n     services to women making huge sacrifices on behalf of all of \n     us.\n       We applaud your efforts to ensure reproductive freedom by \n     ending irrational and harmful barriers to the health and well \n     being of women. Please let us know what we can do to assist \n     you in your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian E. Dixon,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     NARAL Pro-Choice America,\n\n                                                    March 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I write to express NARAL Pro-Choice \n     America's strong support for your legislation to allow \n     federal funding for abortions in military facilities in cases \n     of rape or incest. This legislation is needed to support our \n     female troops and military dependents who have been the \n     victims of such unspeakable crimes.\n       Current law only allows federal funding for abortions at \n     military hospitals in cases of life endangerment. However, \n     recent reports of sexual assault from female service members \n     returning from duty in Iraq and other overseas stations \n     demonstrate, sadly, that this policy fails to acknowledge the \n     reality some servicewomen face. In addition, a 2003 study \n     conducted by Dr. Anne Sadler with the Iowa City Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center found that 30 percent of female U.S. \n     military veterans report having been raped or suffered a rape \n     attempt during their military service.\n       More than 100,000 women live on military bases overseas and \n     rely on military hospitals for their health care--not to \n     mention those posted stateside. The current-law ban on \n     publicly funded abortions in cases of rape and incest may \n     make some women reluctant to seek these medical services or \n     force them to delay the procedure for several weeks. For each \n     week an abortion is delayed, the risk to the woman's health \n     increases. This ban further harms the women and families who \n     have volunteered to serve their country, placing yet another \n     obstacle in front of those who have already suffered an \n     unspeakable assault and may wish to exercise their \n     constitutionally protected right to choose.\n       Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently directed the \n     department's undersecretary for personnel and readiness to \n     review the military's procedures for medical care for sexual-\n     assault victims. A policy of allowing federal funding for \n     abortion services in overseas military hospitals for victims \n     of rape and incest is an important and common-sense first \n     step.\n       We commend your courageous leadership on this important \n     issue, and hope to work with you closely toward your \n     legislation's enactment. It is vital that Congress pass \n     critical measures such as this to support our troops and \n     ensure that they are able to receive the health care the \n     need.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                   Kate Michelman,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2168. A bill to extend the same Federal benefits to law \nenforcement officers serving private institutions of higher education \nand rail carriers, that apply to law enforcement officers serving units \nof State and local government; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Equity in \nLaw Enforcement Act, to extend to sworn, licensed, or certified police \nofficers serving private institutions of higher education and rail \ncarriers, the same Federal benefits that apply to law enforcement \nofficers serving units of State and local government.\n  Each day, thousands of law enforcement officers put their lives on \nthe line to protect the public's safety on our Nation's university and \ncollege campuses and our railways.\n  The attacks of September 11, 2001, marked a significant change in the \nway the United States regarded the threat of terrorism against our \nhomeland. These events also highlighted the important role of the \nnation's law enforcement officers in the security of our country.\n  Sworn officers on private university campuses protect the public's \nsafety and secure assets similar to those that are found on public \nuniversity campuses, including nuclear laboratories and critical \nresearch and development infrastructure. Events such as last year's \nbombing at Yale University have highlighted the risks facing our \nnation's college and university campuses.\n  In addition, the protection of our transportation systems, such as \nour railways, is now more important than ever. Railroad police officers \nare charged with enforcing State and local laws in any jurisdiction in \nwhich the rail carrier owns property. They attend the same police \nacademies as State and local police in the state in which they are \ndomiciled, and most come from law enforcement backgrounds.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) Act of 1976 was enacted \nto aid in the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters, by providing a one-time financial benefit to the eligible \nsurvivors of public safety officers whose deaths are the direct result \nof traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty. Specifically, \nCongress enacted this legislation to address concerns that the hazards \ninherent in law enforcement and fire suppression, and the low level of \nState and local death benefits, might discourage qualified individuals \nfrom seeking careers in these fields.\n  The same risks also apply to police officers protecting our private \nuniversities and railways. Indeed, names of 59 railway officers are \ninscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in \nWashington, D.C. Of these 59 officers, 44 of them were shot to death, \nand the rest were killed in the line of duty. Since 1878, the Union \nPacific Railroad has suffered the loss of 16 police officers, 10 of \nthose killed by gunfire, and the Norfolk Southern Railroad has lost \nanother 14 officers in the line of duty. All but one of these 14 \nofficers were killed by gunfire. These sobering facts are evidence of \nthe dangers faced by these officers every day.\n  Similar dangers face many police officers serving private \ninstitutions of higher education. Take the case of Tulane University \nPolice Sergeant Gilbert J. Mast. On January 20, 1996, Sergeant Mast was \nkilled while on patrol, when he was struck by a hit-and-run vehicle. \nThe driver surrendered to officers of the New Orleans Police Department \nseveral days later. Although Sergeant Mast had bravely served as a law \nenforcement officer on Tulane's campus, and the Director of Public \nSafety at Tulane had filed the required paperwork for survivor \nbenefits, his family was denied because he was not employed by the \npublic sector.\n  Sergeant Mast is just one example of the many brave police officers \nwho protect our railways and college and university campuses every day, \nyet who are not covered under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, \nand are thus excluded from receiving the same Federal death benefits as \nlaw enforcement officers serving units of State and local governments.\n  I am pleased that Senators Leahy and Cornyn have joined me in \nintroducing the Equity in Law Enforcement Act, to help remedy this \ndiscrepancy in death benefit payments for law enforcement officers.\n  This bi-partisan legislation will extend Federal benefits to law \nenforcement officers who serve private institutions of higher education \nand rail carriers, including line-of-duty death benefits under the \nPublic Safety Officers' Benefits Program, and eligibility for \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grants through the Department of Justice. \nThe bill would ensure that these public safety officers have access to \nthe protective equipment they need, and that they and their families \nreceive benefits if an officer is killed or seriously injured.\n  The bill would apply only to sworn peace officers who receive State \ncertification or licensing, and is supported by the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the International \nAssociation of Campus Law enforcement Administrators (IACLEA).\n  Indeed, the benefits of this legislation far outweigh the costs. A \nrecent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office has found that there \nwould be no significant budget impact by its enactment.\n  The importance of police officers on our campuses and railways is \nmore apparent than ever. I believe that it is necessary that these \nbrave men and women are able to receive the same benefits as their \ncounterparts in State and local law enforcement units, and I am pleased \nthat this legislation has also been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Chris Bell, along with 3 bi-partisan \ncosponsors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, and Senators Leahy and Cornyn, in \nco-sponsoring and passing the Equity in Law enforcement Act, to ensure \nthat the brave officers that serve our private college and university \ncampuses and railways receive the benefits that they deserve. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify certain water resources projects for the \nApalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint Rivers, Georgia, Florida, and \nAlabama; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, the locals call it ``God's \ncountry.'' The Apalachicola River, beginning at the confluence of the \nChattachoochee and Flint River, near the borders of Alabama, Florida, \nand Georgia, was and remains an important waterway in the southeast. \nThe river's purpose as a waterway, however, has changed since its \ncolonial fame.\n  The Apalachicola is the largest river east of the Mississippi. In its \nheyday, the Apalachicola was an important tributary that served as the \nlargest port of the Gulf of Mexico--harboring ships carrying cotton to \nEurope and New England.\n  In the 21st century, while no longer an essential route of transport, \nthe Apalachicola River is an important environmental and commercial \nasset. The history of the Apalachicola River as an Army Corps of \nEngineers project began in 1945 and the Rivers and Harbors Act, which \nauthorized dredging of navigation channels. Over the past 59 years, \nmillions of taxpayer dollars have been swept down the river in an \neffort to dredge and maintain the 9-foot-deep channel.\n  The Corps has had difficulty maintaining the channel, and combines \ndredging with water releases in order to raise water levels and provide \nnavigation windows. This system is hopelessly flawed. Dredging is \nunmanageable and navigation windows are unreliable, making the process \na fiscal waste.\n  Add to this fact that over the last few years, commercial barge \ntraffic has slowed from an intermittent stream to a virtually non-\nexistent trickle. River traffic dropped dramatically in the late 1990s, \nwith fewer than 200 barges a year using the river system. By 2001, only \n30 barges used the entire tri-river system with the cost of dredging \nthe channel exceeding $30,000 per barge. Most recently, in 2004 the \nonly company that used barges to carry cargo on the upper reaches of \nthe river ceased operations.\n  Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \naverage cost per ton-mile from 1995-98 at 14.1 cents, almost 24 times \nmore than the cost of the Upper Mississippi River at .597 cents. In \nlight of these circumstances, continued dredging of Florida's largest \nriver is not just wasteful, it is foolish.\n  Ending the dredging is not just about how wasteful this project is--\nit is also about the environmental destruction that is being inflicted \non the Apalachicola River and Bay. There are beaches of sand where \nthere were once river banks. There are walls of dredged spoil--some \ntowering like buildings four stories high--where the river waters used \nto meander. To date, dredged sand has resulted in the destruction of \napproximately one-quarter of the banks of the Apalachicola. The large \namounts of sand have choked sloughs and cut off the water supply to \nsurrounding habitat, ultimately threatening the local economy.\n  Navigation windows remain a imperil threatened and endangered species \nlike the Gulf Sturgeon, the Fat Three-Ridge and the Purple Bank \nClimber. The April 2000 navigation window resulted in an almost \ncomplete failure of sportfish spawn along the entire Apalachicola River \nand reservoirs upstream. Sportfish population have been in rapid \ndecline along the river since 1990. This time frame corresponds with \nthe Corps' continued reliance on water releases to provide adequate \nwater for navigation.\n  The constant and gross interruptions of the natural system have \ndegraded the environment of the Apalachicola River and quality of life \nof those who depend upon it. It comes as no surprise that the \nApalachicola has repeatedly earned the designation by American Rivers \nas one of our Nation's Most Endangered Rivers. The Apalachicola has \nalso been included in the 2000 Troubled Waters Report and the 2001 and \n2002 Green Scissors Report.\n  Manipulation of the Apalachicola poses a serious risk to the local \neconomy. Important businesses, such as farmers who produce Tupelo honey \nand the fishermen who harvest oysters and shrimp in Apalachicola Bay, \nare dependent on the river's overall health. Additionally, commercial \nfishing operations along the Gulf Coast also rely on the Bay for their \nlivelihood.\n  The negative impacts of dredging and the low commercial use of the \nApalachicola River led former Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, \nJoe Westphal, to describe the project as not ``economically justified \nor environmentally defensible.''\n  Dredging the Apalachicola exacts too high a price from both taxpayers \nand the environment. Clearly it is time to rethink this expensive and \necologically devastating practice.\n  The bill I offer today, the Restore the Apalachicola River Ecosystem \n(RARE) Act, was originally introduced in 2002 and subsequently passed \nby the Committee on Environment and Public Works. It authorizes the \nactions necessary to reform the Apalachicola River project. It is my \nhope that this legislation will again be approved by the committee and \nthen by the full Senate.\n  The first thing my bill does is put an end to the navigational \ndredging on the river.\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\n  Second, it instructs the Corps to submit to Congress a comprehensive \nrestoration plan that corrects the past harms done to the Apalachicola.\n  The only way to restore the Apalachicola River to its former \ngreatness is to cease navigational dredging. The designation of the \nApalachicola as one of the nation's most endangered rivers should be a \nwake-up call to Congress and the Army Corps of Engineers to permanently \nend the dredging of the Apalachicola and allow the river to return to \nits natural state free of man's manipulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is both \nfiscally sound and environmentally responsible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Weather Modification Operations and \nResearch Board and outline its duties and responsibilities; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nrecognize the importance and need for increased weather modification \nresearch. Weather modification is the general term that refers to any \nhuman attempt to alter the weather. While we may not be able to stop \nMother Nature entirely, we can sometimes alter her course, changing the \nweather in small, yet significant ways. These efforts have been used in \nthe U.S. for more than 50 years to reduce crop and property damage, \noptimize useable precipitation during growing seasons and lessen the \nimpact of periodic, often severe droughts.\n  The weather modification projects in Texas and other States in the \nU.S. are much more than well considered responses to drought. They are \ntrying to use the latest technological developments in the science to \nchemically squeeze more precipitation out of clouds. Moisture that is \nneeded to replenish fresh-water supplies in aquifers and reservoirs. \nPolitical subdivisions like water conservation districts and county \ncommissions have embraced the technology of rain enhancement as one \nelement of a long-term, water-management strategy. This is critical to \nensure growing populations have enough water to meet future needs.\n  This bill will develop a comprehensive and coordinated national \nweather modification policy through federal and state research and \ndevelopment programs. It will also establish a Weather Modification \nAdvisory and Research Board within the Department of Commerce to \npromote and expand the practical knowledge of weather modification. \nFurther, it recognizes the significance of state and federal \ncollaboration in this endeavor.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation to bring attention to this \nimportant research and I would urge my colleagues to support the \nWeather Modification Research and Technology Transfer Authorization \nAct. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Weather Modification \n     Research and Technology Transfer Authorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a first responder and terrorism \npreparedness grant information hotline, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to introduce the First Responders Homeland \nDefense Act of 2004. This bill would help alleviate funding shortages \nthat our Nation's first responders are experiencing, and would help \nalleviate confusion about Federal grant programs.\n  The first provision of the First Responders Homeland Defense Act is a \ngrant assistance hotline. When the Department of Homeland Security was \ncreated, many local emergency responder agencies were hopeful that a \none-stop shop for homeland security resources would be available. \nUnfortunately, an easily accessible and understandable resource does \nnot yet exist.\n  In addition to grants from the Department of Homeland Security, there \nare many grant programs available to first responders from other \nfederal departments. For example, as part of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention \nassists state and local public health officials improve hospital \npreparedness. The Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Department of \nJustice distributes funding for law enforcement agencies to prepare for \nterrorist events.\n  For a local law enforcement agency or fire department, determining \neligibility for the wide range of grant programs in a number of \ndifferent Federal agencies--not to mention even knowing the full range \nof funding that is available--could be a confusing and daunting task. \nIn order to help make it easier for first responders, my bill would \nestablish a grant assistance hotline at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that would provide local first responders with information on \navailable grants and how to apply for them.\n  The First Responders Homeland Defense Act also creates a new grant \nprogram for tax-exempt non-profit organizations that provide first \nresponder training. Many public and private agencies are creating \nprojects and training programs that involve the business community in \ndefending the homeland. Organizations with non-profit, tax exempt \nstatus should be eligible for Federal grant funds when working on \ncommunity-wide terrorism preparedness. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity should fulfill the goal of community-wide preparation by \nproviding Federal assistance to non-profit organizations that operate \ntraining programs in conjunction with a local agency.\n  Finally, the First Responders Homeland Defense Act creates a grant \nprogram for another important purpose: interoperable communications \nsystems. Many homeland security experts recognize that while there are \nmany Federal funding opportunities for anti-terrorism activities, there \nis very little money dedicated to interoperable communications systems. \nThese are systems that allow different local and State agencies to \ncommunicate directly with one another--something that is vital to \nterrorism prevention and response. Yet these systems are all too rare. \nThis bill establishes a grant program at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for the specific purpose of assisting local agencies improve \nexisting communications systems or purchase new systems.\n  Making the Department of Homeland Security more accessible to local \ncommunities and making more resources available to first responders \nshould be a top priority. Many law enforcement officials and other \nfirst responders have reviewed this legislation, and I am pleased to \nintroduce the First Responders Homeland Defense Act in response to many \nof their concerns.\n  This bill is an important step in fulfilling the Federal \nresponsibility to protect the homeland. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2233-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2233-S2235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 310--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Allard) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 310\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 850,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas nearly 150 peace officers across the United States \n     were killed in the line of duty during 2003, well below the \n     decade-long average of 166 deaths annually;\n       Whereas a number of factors contributed to this reduction \n     in deaths, including better equipment and the increased use \n     of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison \n     terms for violent offenders, and advanced emergency medical \n     care;\n       Whereas every other day, 1 out of every 9 peace officers is \n     assaulted, 1 out of every 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 \n     out of every 6,000 peace officers is killed in the line of \n     duty somewhere in the United States; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2004, more than 20,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2004, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today I am joined by the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch and \nLeahy and Senator Allard in introducing this resolution to keep alive \nin the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those \nlaw enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their \ncommunities. Specifically, this resolution would designate May 15, \n2004, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face every day on the frontlines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who serve this \nNation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 6,000 officers is killed in the line of duty somewhere in \nAmerica every other day. There are few communities in this country that \nhave not been impacted by the words ``officer down.''\n  On September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died as a result of a \ncowardly act of terrorism. This single act of terrorism resulted in the \nhighest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in \nthe history of this country. Before this event, the greatest loss of \nlaw enforcement in a single incident occurred in 1917, when nine \nMilwaukee police officers were killed in a bomb blast at their police \nstation.\n  In 2003, nearly 150 Federal, State, tribal and local law enforcement \nofficers gave their lives in the line of duty, well below the decade-\nlong average of 166 deaths annually, and a major drop from 2001 when a \ntotal of 230 officers were killed. A number of factors contributed to \nthis reduction including better equipment and the increased use of \nbullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer prison terms for \nviolent offenders, and advanced emergency medical care. And, in total, \nmore than 16,000 men and women have made the supreme sacrifice.\n  The chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nCraig W. Floyd, reminds us that\n\n     a police officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in \n     America nearly every other day. More than 850,000 officers \n     put their lives at risk each and every day for our safety and \n     protection. National Police Week and Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day provide our Nation with an important opportunity to \n     recognize and honor that extraordinary service and sacrifice.\n\n  On May 15, 2004, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to \ngather in our Nation's Capital to join with the families of their \nfallen comrades who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their \nresponsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their \ncommunities. In doing so, these heroes have established for themselves \nan enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and \nsecurity of all citizens. This resolution is a fitting tribute for this \nspecial and solemn occasion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nimportant resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I proudly rise today to join my \ncolleagues Senators Campbell, Hatch and Allard to introduce a \nresolution to designate May 15, 2004, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. We submit this resolution to keep alive in the memory of \nall Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives serving their communities.\n  I commend Senator Campbell  for his leadership in this issue. This \nmarks the eighth year running, I believe, that he and I have joined \nforces to introduce the resolution to commemorate National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day. As a former deputy sheriff, Senator Campbell has \nexperienced first-hand the risks faced by law enforcement officers \nevery day while they protect our communities. His knowledge in this \narea is a true asset to the U.S. people.\n  I also want to thank each of our Nation's brave law enforcement \nofficers for their unwavering commitment to the safety and protection \nof their fellow citizens. They are real-life heroes, too many of whom \ntoo often give the ultimate sacrifice, and they remind us of how \nimportant it is to support and respect our State and local police.\n  Currently, more than 850,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Each year, 1 in 15 officers is assaulted, 1 in 46 \nofficers is injured,and 1 in 5,255 officers is killed in the line of \nduty in the United States every other day. After the hijacked planes \nhit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 \npeace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens \nin those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the \nhighest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in \nthe history of this country.\n  In 2003, 146 enforcement officers died while serving in the line of \nduty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a \nmajor drop from 2001 when a total of 237 officers were killed. A number \nof factors contributed to this reduction including better equipment and \nthe increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, longer \nprison terms for violent offenders, and advanced emergency medical \ncare. And, in total, more than 17,100 men and women have made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  During the 108th Congress, we have improved the Department of \nJustice's Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program by making law \nthe Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act (Public Law 108-182), which \nallows survivors of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart \nattacks or strokes while participating in nonroutine stressful or \nstrenuous physical activities to qualify for Federal survivor benefits. \nThe Senate also passed the Campbell-Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Act (S. 764), which will extend through FY 2007 the authorization \nof appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program \nthat helps State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests \nfor use by law enforcement officers. The House has yet to act on this \nimportant measure that will continue our efforts to ensure that every \npolice officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one. This week, the \nSenate added to the gun liability bill by a vote of 91-8 the Campbell-\nLeahy Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (S. 253). This measure would \nestablish national measures of uniformity and consistency to permit \ntrained and certified on-duty, off-duty or retired law enforcement \nofficers to carry concealed firearms in most situations so that they \nmay respond immediately to crimes across State and other jurisdictional \nlines, as well as to protect themselves and their families from \nvindictive criminals. The support for such bills that will keep our law \nenforcement officers is there, but we need to do more.\n  We Vermonters this National Peace Officers Memorial Day will remember \nour brave State Police Officer, SGT Michael Johnson, who was killed \nlast Father's Day while trying to stop a suspect leading two other \nState troopers on a high-speed chase. Sergeant Johnson was not even on \nduty, but he went out nonetheless to help his fellow troopers that \nSunday afternoon after hearing their trouble on his radio. He had just \ndeployed a set of tire spikes across the interstate when the suspect \nswerved to avoid the spikes and struck him. Johnson left behind a \nbeloved wife and three children, as well as hundreds of police officers \nwho called him ``brother.'' Words seem insufficient to acclaim the \nbrave sacrifice of the man\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nwho was so admired by his family, community and the Vermont State \nPolice force.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nUnited States with the opportunity to honor the extraordinary service \nand sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. More than \n15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with \nthe families of their fallen comrades who, by their last full measure \nof devotion to their responsibilities and the right and security of \ntheir fellow citizens, have rendered a dedicated service to our Nation. \nI look forward to passage of this important resolution, a fitting \ntribute for this special and solemn occasion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 311--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST \n REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM TO IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASE FATHER \n             THADEUS NGUYEN VAN LY, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas, in February 2001, Father Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly, a \n     Roman Catholic priest, was formally invited to testify before \n     the United States Commission on International Religious \n     Freedom but was denied permission to leave the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam and thus, instead, submitted written \n     testimony critical of the Government of Vietnam, which was \n     read into the Commission record on February 13, 2001;\n       Whereas Father Ly's testimony before the Commission \n     documents numerous specific actions of the Government of \n     Vietnam against religious freedom that he classified as \n     collectively being ``extremely cruel'' and requiring a ``non-\n     violent and persistent campaign'' to achieve full religious \n     freedom for all people in Vietnam;\n       Whereas Father Ly has been detained by the Government of \n     Vietnam since February 2001, when the Government placed him \n     under administrative detention, and, as a direct response to \n     his testimony, branded him a traitor for ``slandering'' the \n     Communist party and ``distorting'' the religious policy of \n     the government;\n       Whereas the Government of Vietnam issued a second decree \n     suspending Father Ly's ability to ``carry on any religious \n     responsibility and functions'' and later formally removed \n     Father Ly from his church, detained him, and denied him \n     access to legal counsel;\n       Whereas, on October 19 2001, the Thua Thien Hue Provincial \n     People's Court convicted Father Ly of all charges after a \n     one-day, closed trial without the benefit of counsel and \n     sentenced him to 2 years in prison for violating the terms of \n     his administrative detention, 13 years in prison for, \n     ``damaging the Government's unity policy,'' and 5 years of \n     administrative probation upon release from prison;\n       Whereas, after pleas from United States Government \n     officials and the world community, Father Ly's sentence was \n     reduced by 5 years;\n       Whereas, in June 2001, Father Ly's nephews Nguyen Vu Viet, \n     age 27, and Nguyen Truc Cuong, age 36, and his niece Nguyen \n     Thi Hoa, age 44, were arrested for allegedly being in contact \n     and receiving support from ``reactionary'' organizations in \n     the United States concerning the religious situation in \n     Vietnam and disseminating information concerning the \n     detention of Father Ly;\n       Whereas after their cases generated much concern in \n     Congress, Nguyen Thi Hoa, Nguyen Vu Viet, and Nguyen Truc \n     Cuong all have been released;\n       Whereas, on November 27, 2003, the United Nations Working \n     Group on Arbitrary Detention issued Opinion No. 20/2003 \n     stating that ``the Group is convinced that [Father Ly] has \n     been arrested and detained only for his opinions . . . [and] \n     the deprivation of the liberty of Father Thadeus Nguyen Van \n     Ly is arbitrary, as being in contravention of Article 19 of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of Article 19 \n     of the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights'';\n       Whereas Father Ly has been deprived of his basic human \n     rights by being denied his ability to exercise freedom of \n     opinion and expression; and\n       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment and the violation of the \n     human rights of citizens of Vietnam are sources of \n     continuing, grave concern to the Congress: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) condemns and deplores the arbitrary detention of Father \n     Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly by the Government of the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam and calls for his immediate and \n     unconditional release;\n       (B) condemns and deplores the violations of freedom of \n     speech, religion, movement, association, and the lack of due \n     process afforded to individuals in the Socialist Republic of \n     Vietnam;\n       (C) strongly urges the Government of Vietnam to consider \n     the implications of its actions for the broader relationship \n     between the United States and Vietnam; and\n       (D) strongly urges the Government of Vietnam to consider \n     the implications of its actions in the context of the United \n     States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement, under which Vietnam \n     currently receives Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status \n     subject to chapter 1 of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (commonly known as the ``Jackson-Vanik Amendment''); and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should--\n       (A) make the immediate release of Father Thadeus Nguyen Van \n     Ly a top concern;\n       (B) make it clear to the Government of Vietnam that it is \n     not in the Government's interest to detain Father Ly and \n     others like him for political or religious reasons or to \n     inflict human rights violations on such people or groups \n     because such actions create obstacles to improved bilateral \n     relations and cooperation with the United States; and\n       (C) reiterate the deep concern of the United States \n     regarding the continued imprisonment of Father Ly and other \n     persons whose human rights are being violated and discuss the \n     legal status and immediate humanitarian needs of such people \n     with the Government of Vietnam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2235-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2676.

Mr. VOINOVICH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 1637, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto comply with the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/ETI \nbenefit in a manner that preserves jobs and production activities in \nthe United States, to reform and simplify the international taxation \nrules of the United States, and for other purposes; which was ordered \nto lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Manufacturing is critical to the health of the United \n     States economy, generating high quality products, personal \n     opportunity, careers, wealth, high standards of living, and \n     economic growth.\n       (2) In July 2000 the manufacturing sector slipped into \n     recession and since has lost 2,700,000 high paying \n     manufacturing jobs, while the rest of the economy has added \n     623,000 jobs.\n       (3) The manufacturing sector faces intense global \n     competition, making it difficult for many firms to operate \n     profitably and earn a sufficient return on capital invested.\n       (4) The manufacturing sector in the United States seeks a \n     global level playing field for competition and markets.\n       (5) China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in \n     December 2001 and agreed to abide by the commitments ascribed \n     in its accession.\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\n       (6) United States investors and exporters recognize the \n     opportunity of doing business with China but have raised \n     serious concerns that many of the commitments China made upon \n     joining the WTO have not yet been implemented or \n     implementation has been inadequate.\n       (7) A clear example of injury committed by China to a \n     United States industry can be found in the United States \n     candle industry, where between 1997 and 2002, imports of wax \n     candles from China increased from 46,000,000 pounds to \n     174,000,000 pounds and where in 2002 alone, the United States \n     candle industry lost 128,000,000 pounds in sales to the \n     Chinese.\n       (8) Market barriers and unfair trade practices continue to \n     exist in China, including high tariffs, subsidies, technical \n     trade restrictions, counterfeiting, violations of \n     intellectual property rights, and nonmarket-based industrial, \n     economic, and financial policies that limit United States \n     exports.\n       (9) United States manufacturers will not be able to achieve \n     a fair and level playing field with their Chinese \n     counterparts because of the costs associated with the United \n     States regulatory framework, e.g., compliance with labor and \n     environmental regulations, as well as healthcare costs, which \n     are non-existent costs for Chinese companies.\n       (10) The currency of China, the yuan, has been fixed \n     relative to the United States dollar since 1994.\n       (11) A systemically misvalued currency by any large country \n     can have damaging trade-distorting effects on both that \n     country and its trading partners by decreasing the price of \n     exports of products of that country and increasing the price \n     of imports to that country.\n       (12) The market-based valuation of currencies is a key \n     component to resilient global trading systems by enabling \n     smoother transitions to reflect underlying economic \n     fundamentals in a country.\n       (13) The President's Chairman of the Council of Economic \n     Advisors recently described the outsourcing of American jobs \n     overseas ``as a good thing'' and said, ``outsourcing is just \n     a new way of doing international trade''.\n       (14) Job retention and creation are essential to the \n     economic stability of the United States and the \n     administration should pursue policies that serve as an engine \n     for economic growth, higher wage jobs, and increased \n     productivity.\n       (15) A salient example of the trade barriers faced by \n     United States manufacturers is the lack of adequate \n     intellectual property protection and enforcement in the \n     markets of some of America's major trading partners.\n       (16) For United States manufacturers, protection of \n     intellectual property is not an abstract concept. America's \n     competitive edge ensues directly from innovation and rising \n     productivity. Intellectual property protection is the best \n     means for ensuring that American manufacturers enjoy the \n     benefits of their investments in research and development and \n     of their efforts to raise productivity.\n       (17) To the extent that United States investment in \n     research and development provides a competitive edge in the \n     marketplace, the protection of the intellectual property \n     developed by United States manufacturers, which embodies the \n     product of that research, becomes critical to the future of \n     the manufacturing sector.\n       (18) It is estimated that counterfeits account for 15 to 20 \n     percent of all products made in China and accounts for about \n     8 percent of China's Gross Domestic Product.\n       (19) Industry analysts estimate that intellectual property \n     rights piracy in China cost United States firms \n     $1,850,000,000 in lost sales in 2002.\n       (20) Under the terms of China's WTO accession, China agreed \n     to immediately bring its intellectual property rights laws in \n     compliance with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Trade Representative should continue \n     to actively encourage China's compliance with its WTO \n     commitments, specifically with regard to intellectual \n     property rights violations;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury should encourage the \n     Chinese to make the significant structural reforms, \n     particularly in the banking sector, to ensure that China can \n     effectively adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime;\n       (3) the Senate urges the President, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and the United States Trade Representative to \n     continue their strong dialogue with China, and if these \n     discussions fail to produce immediate, meaningful results, \n     the Senate urges the United States Trade Representative to \n     commence a review under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974;\n       (4) the Senate should oppose any efforts to encourage the \n     outsourcing of American jobs overseas;\n       (5) the Senate should adopt legislation providing for a \n     manufacturing tax incentive to encourage job creation in the \n     United States and oppose efforts to make it cheaper to send \n     jobs overseas;\n       (6) the Secretary of Commerce should aggressively pursue \n     those foreign producers and importers who have violated \n     United States trade law and when violations have resulted in \n     the injury of United States industry, the Secretary of \n     Commerce should impose the maximum penalty within the \n     confines of our trade laws;\n       (7) the United States Trade Representative should promote \n     the protection of United States intellectual property abroad \n     by expanding cooperative efforts with developing country \n     trading partners to encourage the full implementation of \n     their obligations under the WTO's Agreement on Trade Related \n     Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS);\n       (8) the administration should pursue a policy of aggressive \n     investigation of allegations of theft of intellectual \n     property, particularly allegations in which American \n     manufacturers are compelled to divulge intellectual property \n     as a condition of market access or investment; and\n       (9) the administration should pursue a policy of aggressive \n     enforcement of our existing intellectual property laws, and \n     in so doing, shall continue to work hand in hand with \n     business and industry to identify and prosecute \n     counterfeiters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2680. Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Frist) proposed an \namendment to amendment SA 2660 proposed by Mr. Dodd (for himself, Mr. \nColeman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Feingold) to \nthe bill S. 1637, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to comply \nwith the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/ETI benefit in a \nmanner that preserves jobs and production activities in the United \nStates, to reform and simplify the international taxation rules of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 7, strike lines 10 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect 30 days after the Secretary of Commerce certifies that \n     the amendments made by this title will not result in the loss \n     of more jobs than it will protect and will not cause harm to \n     the U.S. economy. Such certification must be renewed on or \n     before January 1 of each year in order for the amendments \n     made by this title to be in effect for that year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2681. Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1637, to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to comply with the World Trade \nOrganization rulings on the FSC/ETI benefit in a manner that preserves \njobs and production activities in the United States, to reform and \nsimplify the international taxation rules of the United States, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NEGOTIATING, IN THE \n                   UNITED STATES-THAILAND FREE TRADE AGREEMENT, \n                   ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES AUTOMOBILE \n                   INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Trade Representative recently \n     announced an intention to negotiate a free trade agreement \n     (FTA) with Thailand.\n       (2) Properly structured FTAs may have important benefits \n     for the United States, and a bilateral free trade agreement \n     program pursued under a coherent policy and strategy may play \n     an important role in United States trade policy.\n       (3) The global automobile market is subject to inherently \n     multilateral problems that need to be addressed on a \n     multilateral basis, including numerous, widespread, and \n     complex nontariff barriers maintained by major producing \n     countries.\n       (4) Providing Thailand privileged access to critical \n     segments of the United States automobile market would \n     significantly erode United States leverage to negotiate \n     reductions to global automobile market distortions in \n     multilateral negotiations, because producers from third \n     countries would be able to benefit from the privileged access \n     of Thailand under the FTA.\n       (5) Thailand is the second largest source of pick-up truck \n     production in the world, with many major automobile \n     manufacturers from outside of Thailand producing pick-up \n     trucks there.\n       (6) Thailand's Board of Investment has actively been \n     recruiting automobile producers from outside of Thailand, \n     including Japan, South Korea, and India, to produce \n     automobiles in Thailand, and some of these producers have \n     cited Thailand's privileged access to foreign markets through \n     FTAs as a rationale for setting up production in Thailand.\n       (7) Many of these producers from outside of Thailand have \n     moved their pick-up truck production out of their home \n     countries and into Thailand in order to make Thailand their \n     global pick-up truck production and export bases.\n       (8) As a result of this activity by automobile producers \n     from outside of Thailand, pick-up truck production in \n     Thailand will soon approach 1,000,000 units annually, and \n     could grow even larger.\n       (9) Given these facts, if Thailand were given privileged \n     access to critical segments of the United States automobile \n     market in an FTA, it could be used by third-country \n     automobile producers as a backdoor into the\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\n     United States market; however, Japan, South Korea, India, and \n     other major producing countries would not be required to \n     reduce their tariff and nontariff barriers to United States \n     automobile producers, and in fact the tariff and nontariff \n     barriers maintained by those countries would continue to \n     distort global markets and restrict the access of United \n     States exports to markets in those countries.\n       (10) Given that these third-country producers would already \n     have privileged access to the United States market through \n     the United States-Thailand FTA, their home countries would \n     have less incentive to address the inherently multilateral \n     problems in the global automobile market through negotiations \n     on a multilateral basis.\n       (11) The United States automobile industry is a major \n     driver of the United States economy--accounting annually for \n     between 3 and 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) \n     of the United States, leading all United States industries in \n     annual research and development spending, directly employing \n     over 500,000 highly skilled and efficient workers in jobs \n     that pay on average 60 percent higher than the average United \n     States job, and supporting the jobs of over 7,000,000 other \n     workers--and it has played a critical role in efforts to \n     revive the United States economy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     negotiations on access to critical segments of the United \n     States automobile market should not take place on a piecemeal \n     basis, but only--\n       (1) as part of negotiations that include all major \n     automobile producing nations; and\n       (2) as part of comprehensive negotiations that address both \n     tariff and nontariff barriers specific to the automobile \n     industry, with progress on eliminating tariff barriers \n     explicitly linked to concrete progress on eliminating \n     nontariff barriers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2682.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been a difficult week from many \nperspectives. We had two contentious pieces of legislation, and we \ncertainly understand that on this side. As far as the legislation now \nbefore the Senate, it should not be such. I think there is no question \nthat the majority of the Senate by far wants to pass the legislation \nthat has been before the Senate today and yesterday.\n  The issue that is now holding up this legislation is whether the \nSenate is going to vote on an overtime amendment that is being offered \nby Senator Harkin. It is an issue that we feel strongly about on this \nside. We want to vote on whether the President should go forward with \nthese regulations. We want to vote. We will take a half hour evenly \ndivided, we will take 20 minutes evenly divided to get a vote on this \namendment. We are not stalling for time.\n  This is something that will have to be dealt with sometime during the \nnext month or so in this legislature. We are willing to work in any way \nto cooperate and get this bill done, but one of the things we can't do \nis not have a vote on this overtime issue. Senator Daschle and I have \ntalked with Senator Harkin on four occasions at my last count. We said: \nSenator Harkin, don't offer this amendment; this legislation is \nimportant; we are trying to get it passed. He has reluctantly agreed \nevery time not to move forward with this legislation.\n  That is no longer part of what we are able to do. We talked with \nSenator Harkin. He has been such a gentleman as to how we proceeded on \nthis. He will continue to be a gentleman, but he is not going to relent \noffering this legislation because we do not think he should anymore.\n  I say that with the full knowledge that on this very important piece \nof legislation we are willing to vote, we are willing to discuss the \namendments that Senators Grassley and Baucus have. They want to improve \nthe legislation. I think they can do that, and I think their amendments \nwill be supported.\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\n  The second-degree amendment now before the Senate is not a bad \namendment. I think the tax credit should be extended to sun and \ngeothermal, but this extends it to wind. That is certainly a small bite \nof the apple that needs to be done.\n  I know the obligations and the burdens of the majority are difficult. \nWe, not too long ago, were in the majority, and it is very hard to move \nlegislation through this body. We need a vote on this overtime issue, \nand we hope and we are going to press as hard as we can to get a vote \non it sometime in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no objection then?\n  Mr. REID. No objection whatsoever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Nevada, we \nfully understand the minority or, for that matter, any Member of the \nSenate has a right to offer a nongermane amendment to an underlying \npiece of legislation, but we had an unfortunate experience earlier this \nvery week in which the offering and the adoption of amendments \nunrelated to the underlying bill ended up killing the bill that both \nthe Senator from Nevada and myself had hoped would pass.\n  We already had one vote on the overtime issue late last year. I do \nnot know how many times the minority would like for us to repeat that \nvote.\n  It is the belief of this Senator that on a bipartisan basis Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus would like to pass the FSC/ETI bill without \nany unrelated amendments on it. There is some resistance on this side \nof the aisle to repeatedly voting over and over again on amendments \nupon which we have already had a vote.\n  That having been said, I fully understand what the Senator is saying, \nthat they would like to have a vote on the overtime issue. I don't \nthink that is necessarily the view of everyone on that side of the \naisle but may well be the view of the majority on that side of the \naisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2254-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the budget resolution. Senator Nickles and Senator \nConrad will be here on Monday morning to kick off the debate on that \nimportant matter and receive any amendments that may be offered on \nMonday.\n  It is the intention of the managers to have a full day of debate on \nthe resolution during Monday's session. At this time, I will say that \nrollcall votes are possible Monday evening. A vote or votes may occur \nin relation to amendments on the budget resolution or judicial \nnominations. We will alert Members when a vote becomes locked in for a \ncertain time.\n  I remind my colleagues that under budget procedures, there will be up \nto 50 hours of debate on the resolution, and we will complete action on \nthe budget prior to adjourning for the March recess. Therefore, our \ncolleagues should expect a very busy week next week with late night \nsessions and votes throughout the week. I encourage all Members to \narrange their schedules accordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/04/senate-section/article/S2254-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 8, 2004\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
