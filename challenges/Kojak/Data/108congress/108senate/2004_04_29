Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business for up to 90 minutes. The first 30 minutes will be \nunder the control of the Democratic leader or his designee, the second \n30 minutes will be controlled by this side of the aisle, and the final \n30 will be divided between Senators McConnell and Feinstein.\n  Following that morning business period, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 150, the Internet access tax measure. There will be \nan additional hour for debate prior to the first of the scheduled \ncloture votes. The first vote will be on invoking cloture on the \nDaschle ethanol amendment to the Internet bill. If cloture fails, we \nwill go immediately to a cloture vote on the Domenici energy package. \nFinally, if cloture has not been invoked to that point, the Senate will \nproceed to a cloture vote on the pending McCain substitute regarding \nthe Internet tax moratorium.\n  Having said that, it has been my goal from the start to finish this \nInternet legislation. This week has been set aside for consideration of \nthis matter. I hope we can stay late and finish the bill.\n  Mr. President, I briefly wish to comment on the first two cloture \nvotes, opening with the fact that I am a strong supporter of the \nethanol provision that the Democratic leader has pulled out of the \nEnergy bill and offered as an amendment to the original language of the \nInternet tax bill. In fact, I joined the minority leader in offering \nvery similar language to the Energy bill when it was considered on the \nSenate floor last summer.\n  While I do support the renewable fuels standard as a matter of \npolicy, there are many other important provisions included in the \nEnergy bill that at this point I am not prepared to abandon.\n  We in the United States need a comprehensive national energy policy. \nWe have gone on for way too long without that policy, and we see the \nconsequences of that every day. We see it in our rising dependence on \nforeign oil. We see it in last summer's blackout in the Northeast and \ntoday's record high gas prices, and in skyrocketing natural gas prices, \nwhich are hurting farmers and manufacturers and consumers alike.\n  The slimmed-down Energy bill that Chairman Domenici has offered as a \nsecond-degree amendment addresses each of these issues. It lays out a \nbalanced national energy policy that will lessen our reliance on \nforeign energy, thereby enhancing both our economic security as well as \nour national security. Senator Domenici's plan will help diversify our \nenergy supply and encourage the use of renewable energy sources such as \nwind and solar energy and ethanol, all of which decreases our reliance \non foreign oil and increases our own energy independence.\n  Moreover, it will facilitate the construction of the Alaska natural \ngas pipeline. This is perhaps the single most important thing we can do \nto increase our supply of natural gas, by\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\ntransporting it from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 States.\n  The Domenici amendment will also strengthen our electricity grid and \nmake it easier to build transmission lines. With these improvements we \nwill be better able to prevent blackouts such as the one last summer \nthat blanketed 50 million Americans from the Northeast to the Midwest.\n  The Domenici plan promotes clean coal technology, hydrogen fuel \ncells, clean nuclear energy, and domestic oil and gas production \nconsistent with protecting the environment. It also encourages \nconservation and energy efficiency.\n  We need all of these components in order to have an effective \nnational energy policy. While the ethanol mandate is vitally important, \nwe need a comprehensive plan that addresses all of our energy needs. \nThat is why I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the Daschle \namendment and to support cloture on the Domenici amendment. We should \nnot break apart the Energy bill and attempt to pass it piecemeal. \nAmerica needs an energy plan that increases our economic security, our \nenergy independence, and adequately meets the demands of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4626-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr President, an historic gathering took place in South \nDakota last week. For 2 days, Indians and non-Indians came together to \ndiscuss how they could improve the schools attended by Indian children \nin South Dakota.\n  The South Dakota Indian Education Summit was sponsored by our \nGovernor, Mike Rounds, and our state Education Department, working with \ntribal leaders and educators. It grew out of an extraordinary \nconference last October that I was proud to cosponsor. That Gathering \nand Healing of Nations conference brought Indians and non-Indians \ntogether to talk honestly about the issues that divide us, and the \nissues that unite us.\n  At the Indian Education Summit last week, most of the discussion \nfocused on how to make sure the No Child Left Behind Act improves the \nschools Indian children attend. As we all know, concerns about No Child \nLeft Behind are not limited to Indian Country. But they are especially \nacute in many parts of Indian Country, largely because of the Federal \nGovernment's long history of severely underfunding Indian education. I \nhave heard from many Indian educators who tell me they are deeply \nconcerned that the Federal Government will not provide Indian schools \nwith the resources they need to meet the higher standards in No Child \nLeft Behind. They are worried as well that the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand the Department of Education may be placing too much emphasis on \ntesting students and labeling schools--and not enough emphasis on \nhelping schools correct problems. They're concerned about preserving \nnative cultures and languages.\n  These are all legitimate concerns. We need to pay attention to them. \nThat is why I have asked the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to hold \nhearings on how the No Child Left Behind Act is being implemented in \nIndian Country. I have not received a reply yet from the committee \nchairman, but I am hopeful that there will be agreement on the \nimportance of holding such a hearing. I know he cares deeply about the \nneed for the Federal Government to honor its trust and treaty \nobligations regarding education.\n  President Bush has proposed three Federal budgets since he signed the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. All three have shortchanged No Child Left \nBehind. The President's proposed budget for next year--fiscal year \n2005--underfunds the new law by $9.4 billion. Schools serving Indian \nchildren are among the oldest, poorest, and most crowded schools in \nAmerica. They have been drastically underfunded for decades. The last \nthing children attending Indian schools need is to be denied the \nopportunities, resources, and good teachers the new law promises--and \nthen have their schools labeled as ``failing.''\n  That is why, during debate last month on the budget resolution for \nnext year, Democrats offered an amendment to fully fund No Child Left \nBehind for all schools, including BIA schools. Regrettably, Republicans \ndefeated our amendment. But we are not giving up. We will continue to \npress to make sure No Child Left Behind is funded adequately and \nimplemented sensibly in Indian Country, so that this Nation leaves no \nIndian child behind, either.\n  America also needs to face up to the massive school facilities \nproblem in Indian Country. There is an overwhelming backlog of facility \nrepair and construction projects for BIA schools, and the BIA estimates \nthe cost of completing those projects at nearly $1.2 billion.\n  In 2000, when he was running for President, then-Governor Bush met \nwith tribal leaders in New Mexico and promised to invest $1 billion to \nfix crumbling BIA schools. Yet the President's proposed budget for next \nyear cuts funding for Indian school, reconstruction for the second year \nin a row. That is wrong.\n  Crow Creek Tribal Schools in Stephan, SD are among the nearly 200 \nBIA-funded and BIA-operated schools in the United States. Their \nbuildings are typical of schools throughout Indian Country. They are \ncrowded, crumbling, and outdated. Some of them date to the 1930s. \nBetween 500 and 600 students attend classes in them. Two years ago, \nCrow Creek's middle school was condemned and replaced with modular \ntrailers. An elementary school also need to be replaced. The high \nschool gym is in such poor structural condition that it can only be \nused for limited purposes; the district has to rent gym space from \nother schools for basketball games. They don't know where they will \nhold their graduation this year.\n  Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Duane Big Eagle has been lobbying for \nmoney to fix the schools on the reservation for 25 years. Two months \nago, he drove 4,000 miles to try to find someone in the Federal \nGovernment who would help him. He drove first to the BIA facilities and \nconstruction office in Albuquerque. When he found no help there, he \ndrove to BIA headquarters in Washington, DC.\n  Senator Tim Johnson and I met with Chairman Big Eagle while he was in \nWashington, and I have since spoken with BIA officials about the Crow \nCreek schools. I am pleased to report that the BIA has agreed to \nprovide $2.5 million for a new 17,000-square-foot gymnasium.\n  But there are still schools all over Indian Country where conditions \nwould shock most Americans--schools with no heat and schools where the \ncold wind whips in through broken windows. Schools where trash cans are \npositioned in classrooms to catch the rain water that pours in through \nholes in the roofs.\n  The He Dog Tribal School in Rosebud is a two-story brick building \nbuilt in the 1930s. Its ``library'' is three shelves of books on one \nbookcase.\n  A while back, leaders from the Dakota Area Consortium of Treaty \nSchools proposed a smart way to address the backlog of school \nconstruction needs in Indian Country. Their proposal called for the \ncreation of a new Indian school-bonding authority that would use \nFederal dollars to leverage other funds.\n  We have been working with Senator Johnson to help create this \nauthority, and we now have bipartisan support. We ought to consider \nit--and any other innovative ideas people may have to deal with the \nschool-construction backlog--and then we must act.\n  It shouldn't take a tribal chairman driving thousands of miles for \nIndian children to be able to attend safe schools with adequate space \nand up-to-date books and computers. The right to attend a good school \nshould be the birthright of every child in America. But Native American \nchildren have a special claim on this right.\n  Our Government has given its word, in treaties and laws, to provide \neducation, health care, housing, and other basic necessities to Indian \ntribes and their members forever.\n  Education and other Federal programs serving Native Americans are not \nhandouts; they are treaty obligations. They are installment payments\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nthe United States Government owes for land the tribes surrendered \nreluctantly more than a century ago. America has never even come close \nto meeting those obligations. You can see the legacy of this neglect in \nthe harsh realities of life in Indian Country today: houses with no \nelectricity, plumbing, or telephones. On some reservations in South \nDakota, people live in homes with no running water; they have to haul \nwater from 15 or 20 miles away. It is not unusual on reservations in \nSouth Dakota for 20 members of an extended family to share one small, \nthree-bedroom home. Three hundred families on Pine Ridge are living in \nhomes that are contaminated with black mold. The Pine Ridge Reservation \nneeds 3,000 new houses just to meet the current demand.\n  During the depths of the Great Depression, 25 percent of Americans \nwere unemployed. Today, on many reservations in South Dakota and other \nStates, the unemployment rate is twice that high--or higher.\n  Native Americans live sicker and die younger than other Americans as \na result of inadequate health care. Their higher rates of diabetes, \nheart disease, sudden infant death syndrome, tuberculosis, alcoholism, \nand many other serious health problems are the direct result of our \nGovernment's long history of dramatically underfunding Indian health. \nOur Government spends twice as much per person on health care for \nfederal prisoners as it does on health care for Native Americans. I am \nstill baffled by that statistic. We spend twice as much per person on \nhealth care for Federal prisoners in this country--$3,800 per capita--\nas we do on the children on Indian reservations--$1,900 per capita this \nyear. The rationing of health care at Indian Health clinics and \nhospitals is so severe that sick and injured people who are not in \nimmediate danger of losing their life or a limb are routinely turned \naway and denied any care. This is immoral.\n  Tribal roads make up two-and-a-half percent of Federal roads in this \ncountry, yet tribes receive only one-half-of-one-percent of Federal \nroad funding. The poor condition of many tribal roads is a significant \nreason that the rate of fatal traffic accidents on tribal roads is four \ntimes higher than the national average. It is also a major obstacle to \neconomic opportunity in Indian Country.\n  These are just a few of the ways the Federal Government is failing to \nmeet its trust and treaty obligations to Native people and tribes. \nUnfortunately, President Bush's proposed budget for next year would \nmake things even worse. Dozens of programs serving Native Americans and \nAlaska Natives are flat-lined, reduced, or simply eliminated.\n  According to the National Congress of American Indians, the \nPresident's proposed budget cuts Indian hospital and clinic \nconstruction by 56 percent; Indian school construction by 19 percent; \nand tribal college funding by 11.5 percent. The tribal COPS program is \nslated to be cut by 20 percent, the tribal courts program by 26 \npercent, and the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program by 83 percent. \nThe President's proposed budget also cuts $52 million from the BIA for \ntribal law enforcement, tribal roads, and Indian child welfare \nprograms.\n  Earlier this month, BIA Assistant Secretary Dave Anderson shocked \ntribes with an announcement that BIA programs will be slashed another \n$79 million in fiscal year 2006.\n  The president of the National Congress of American Indians, Tex Hall, \nhas said, ``Asking us to somehow prioritize which programs in the BIA \nshould be cut is like asking Indian Country to decide which child \nshould go hungry, which elder should go unprotected, and which of those \nwho need medical help should go untreated.''\n  Rather than do that, the National Congress of American Indians and \nBIA's Tribal Budget Advisory Council met recently with BIA officials in \nWashington over 2 days to develop an alternative budget. A tribal \nleader from my State, John Steele, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, \nis a member of that advisory council.\n  Assistant Secretary Anderson visited South Dakota reservations \nrecently, so I know he is familiar with the staggering unmet needs of \nIndian Country. He surely must know that cuts such as those recommended \nby the White House will do real harm to people and communities that \nhave already suffered greatly because of the policies and neglect of \nthe Federal Government.\n  I hope Assistant Secretary Anderson will consider carefully the \nrecommendations of the Tribal Budget Advisory Council as he prepares \nhis budget request for fiscal year 2006. If he will take a strong stand \nfor this government to meet its trust and treaty obligations, I know he \nwill find many allies in Congress. I am one of them.\n  But Assistant Secretary Anderson and Interior Secretary Norton do not \nhave to wait until the department completes its fiscal year 2006 budget \nproposal. They can do something today that will not cost a dime and \nwill make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of Native \nAmericans, especially children.\n  Three times now, the Federal judge hearing the Cobell v. Norton \nIndian trust case has had to order the Interior Department to shut down \nits computer system to protect individual Indian money accounts from \nhackers. Every time BIA has shut down computers in the Office of \nSpecial Trustee, it has shut down the computers serving Indian schools \nas well. The last time, the shutdown lasted for 5 days. Such \ndisruptions cause serious problems for teachers, students, and school \nadministrators.\n  In response to a recent letter from me, Interior Department officials \nsaid they did not choose to shut down the BIA school computers; they \nwere forced to do so when the judge ordered the Indian trust computers \nshut down.\n  I have been told there is a simple solution: All Interior Department \nofficials have to do is properly certify and verify to the court \nhearing the Cobell lawsuit that the BIA school computers are separate \nfrom the trust fund computers and protected from intrusion. Based on \nthe department's certification and verification, if the trust fund \ncomputers ever have to be shut down again, BIA school computers will be \nspared. It is a simple step that can make a difference in the education \nof Indian children, and I urge the Interior Department to do it as soon \nas possible.\n  I also ask the Interior Department, the White House, and our \nRepublican colleagues to work with us to come up with budgets that \nhonor America's trust and treaty obligations to Indian people and \ntribes--next year, the year after that, and every year. This should not \nbe a partisan issue.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a year ago this Saturday, President Bush \ndressed up in a flight suit, flew out to the aircraft carrier Abraham \nLincoln, and declared ``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq.\n   Our mission was far from accomplished then, and it is far from \naccomplished now.\n   At his press conference in the White House earlier this month, the \nPresident was asked if he knew of any mistakes he had made, and he said \nhe couldn't think of any. It is too much to expect that he would have \nmentioned Iraq, but he might at least have mentioned the trip to the \ncarrier. The trip was nothing more than a photo op tailored for the \n2004 election.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n   Then, as now, the President had no plan and no strategy about how \nAmerica can stabilize Iraq, bring our soldiers home with dignity and \nhonor, and accomplish the mission. Then, as now, we are muddling \nthrough day by day, hoping for the best, fearing the worst.\n   Iraq was the big mistake. There was no urgent need to go to war in \nIraq. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. But he did not pose the \nkind of immediate threat to our national security that could justify a \nunilateral, preventive war without the broad support of the \ninternational community.\n   It is clear that the Bush administration manipulated, \nmisrepresented, and distorted the available intelligence in order to \njustify the war in Iraq. They put a spin on the intelligence and a spin \non the truth. They said Saddam was acquiring nuclear weapons. He \nwasn't. They said he had close ties to al-Qaida. He didn't. Congress \nwould never have voted to authorize the war if we had known the truth.\n   Our military had a brilliant plan to win the war. Our soldiers \nperformed brilliantly during the 3-week initial military operation. But \nthe President had no plan to win the peace. He said we would be treated \nas liberators, and in the first day or two after the statue of Saddam \nfell, we were. But then the massive looting began. Resentment by the \nIraqi people began, and the liberation quickly turned into an \noccupation.\n   Iraq has become a quagmire. It may well go down as the worst blunder \nin the entire history of American foreign policy.\n  Iraq is George Bush's Vietnam. By going to war in Iraq, President \nBush squandered the immense good will of the world community we had won \nin the wake of 9/11, and we are paying a high price in the lives of our \ntroops and the respect of other nations.\n  By going to war in Iraq, President Bush has made the real war on \nterrorism harder to win. We left the war in Afghanistan unfinished. We \nshould never have given al-Qaida precious time to recover and regroup \nand expand their reach. By doing so, we made future terrorist attacks \non the United State more likely.\n  Before the war, Pentagon officials assured Congress that firm plans \nwere in place to secure Iraq and rebuild it. The reality is that the \nadministration had a plan on paper, but not a real plan--and precious \nlittle paper at that.\n  The administration's post-war planning was based on a quicksand of \nfalse assumptions. It has been hamstrung by blunder, after blunder, \nafter blunder. The continuing arrogance of the administration has \nblinded it to the cold, hard facts about the immense challenge of post-\nwar reconstruction in Iraq.\n  Based on our experience in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in East Timor, and in \nAfghanistan, we knew security could be a profound problem, with major \nchallenges from a restless population. Yet we had no broad security \nplan, as the early looting quickly showed, and a dangerous security \nsituation still exists today.\n  The administration assumed that we would be able to draw on thousands \nof Saddam's police force to protect security--but in the critical early \nweeks that followed the war, they were nowhere to be found, and too \nmany of their officers turned out to be thugs and torturers.\n  The administration assumed that Iraqi exile leaders could return to \nIraq to rally the population and lead the new government, but they \nwere--and still are--strongly resented by the Iraqi people.\n  Today, with the transfer of sovereignty scheduled for the end of \nJune, the administration still has no idea about who should run the \ncountry. They assumed that after a few hundred of Saddam's top advisers \nwere removed from power, large numbers of local officials would remain \nto run the government--but the government crumbled. Today, it remains \nin shambles.\n  Wrongly, we continue to rely primarily on a military solution for \npolitically inspired violence. Look at Fallujah. Let us hope we don't \nhave to hear Secretary Rumsfeld say, ``We had to destroy Fallujah in \norder to save it.''\n  It is painfully clear that the President and those who advocated the \nwar have lost all credibility on Iraq. They did not understand the \nsituation going into the war. They do not understand the situation now. \nAnd they have no plan to extricate us from the quagmire they created. \nThe result has been chaos for the Iraqi people, and continuing mortal \ndanger for our troops.\n  We cannot cut and run. Our soldiers deserve a genuine strategy to \ndeal with the continuing crisis.\n  All of us who have concerns about the administration's past policy \nwelcome the reinvolvement of the United Nations in Iraq and the \nadministration's openness to a new U.N. resolution. The question is \nwhether the administration's efforts will provide any significant \nrelief for our troops.\n  There is no sign of that yet. The Bush administration has poked its \nfinger in the eye of almost every other nation in the world, and they \nhave little incentive or interest in coming to our rescue.\n  Our military has been bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. \nWe have 80 percent of the troops on the ground, and we have suffered 80 \npercent of the casualties. That burden is increasing, with Spain, \nHonduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador pulling troops out of the country, \nand others threatening to do the same.\n  Very little will change after the transfer of sovereignty and under \nthe administration's plan to work with the international community. It \nis not even a genuine transfer of sovereignty. We'll still be running \nthe show in Iraq. A U.S. occupation by another name is still a U.S. \noccupation.\n  We need a real change in our foreign policy, not a cosmetic change. \nOnly a new administration that has the trust and confidence of the rest \nof the world will be able to bring in the international community to \nprovide international troops, provide international police, provide \ninternational financial resources, achieve a workable political \nsolution, and, relieve the burden on our military and bring them home \nwith dignity and honor.\n  Mr. President, our mission in Iraq is far from accomplished. Our men \nand women in uniform know it. The Iraqi people know it. And the \nAmerican people know it too.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4628-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4628-S4630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MISSION NOT ACCOMPLISHED\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a year ago the President of the United \nStates harkened back to his days as an aviator for the Texas Air \nNational Guard to deliver a dramatic made-for-television speech. Eager \nto experience the thrill of a carrier landing, the President donned a \nflight suit, strapped into a jet, and rocketed off into the wild blue \nyonder for a 30-mile journey.\n  This flight of fancy concluded with the dramatic landing of that \nspeeding plane onto the deck of an aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham \nLincoln--so named for the stoic leader who guided our country through \none of its most troubled times.\n  Such was the scene on May 1, 2003, under the warming rays of the \nCalifornia sun. The President delivered to the sailors on that ship a \nwelcome and long overdue message: He commended the men and women on \ntheir outstanding service to our country during the trials of the war \nin Iraq, and welcomed them back to the United States of America.\n\n  While the President delivered those words of appreciation, every \ntelevision viewer in the country--and, indeed, the world--could see in \nthe background a banner with the words ``Mission Accomplished''--\n``Mission Accomplished''--superimposed upon the Stars and Stripes.\n  In contrast to the simple humility of President Lincoln's Gettysburg \nAddress, President Bush's speech was designed from the outset to be \nremembered right up until November 2, 2004.\n  The President announced unequivocally that ``major combat operations \nin Iraq have ended,'' and that ``in the battle of Iraq, the United \nStates and our allies have prevailed.'' Now, 1 year later, combat \ndeaths are more than five times that of a year ago when our President \ncelebrated ``mission accomplished.''\n  Since that time, Iraq has become a veritable shooting gallery. This \nApril\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nhas been the bloodiest month of the entire war, with more than 120 \nAmericans killed. Young lives cut short in pointless conflict, and all \nthe President can say is that it ``has been a tough couple of weeks''--\na tough couple of weeks, indeed.\n  Plans have obviously gone tragically awry. But the President has, so \nfar, only managed to mutter that we must ``stay the course.'' But what \ncourse is there to keep when our ship of state is being tossed like a \ndinghy in a storm of Middle East politics? If the course is to end in \nthe liberation of Iraq and bring a definitive end to the war against \nSaddam Hussein, one must conclude, mission not accomplished, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The White House argues time and again that Iraq is the ``central \nfront'' on the war on terrorism. But instead of keeping murderous al-\nQaida terrorists on the run, the invasion of Iraq has stoked the fires \nof terrorism against the United States and our allies. Najaf is \nsmoldering. Fallujah is burning. And there is no exit in sight. What \nhas been accomplished, Mr. President?\n  Al-Qaida has morphed into a hydra-headed beast, no longer dependent \non Osama bin Laden. The administration has flippantly claimed that it \nis better to tie down terrorists in Iraq than to battle them in our \nhomeland. Mr. President, with hundreds of thousands of American troops \nin Iraq for the foreseeable future, and a worldwide campaign of \nterrorism gathering steam, who is tying down whom?\n  Indeed, our attack on Iraq has given Islamic militants a common cause \nand has fertilized the field for new recruits. The failures by the \nUnited States to secure the peace in Iraq has virtually guaranteed al-\nQaida a fertile field of new recruits ready to sacrifice their lives to \nfight the American infidels. These extremists openly call for \n``jihad,'' swear allegiance to bin Laden, and refer to the September 11 \nmurderers as the ``magnificent 19.'' According to intelligence sources, \nhundreds of young Muslims are answering recruitment calls with a \nresounding ``yes.''\n  Amidst all this, the American people are asking themselves one \ncentral question: Have we been made more safe by the President's war in \nIraq? Do we sleep more soundly in our beds now that Saddam Hussein has \nbeen captured? Or, instead, are we starting to fully comprehend and \nregret the fury which has been unleashed by the unprovoked attack on \nIraq?\n  Deaths and casualties of Iraqi citizens are in the thousands--their \nblood is on our hands--but an actual number cannot be obtained. Is it \nany wonder that Iraqis see us, not as liberators, but as crusaders and \nconquerors? A growing number of Iraqis see us as we would see foreign \ntroops on the streets of Chicago or New York or Washington, or any \nsmall town in America. Surely one can understand the hatred brewing in \nIraq in the hearts of the men and women and children--the boys and \ngirls--in Iraq when we see the agony--the agony--of an Iraqi family \nthat has lost a loved one due to an errant bomb or bullet.\n  One year after President Bush proclaimed the conclusion of major \ncombat operations in Iraq, is the world any safer from terrorism? Iraq \nhas become a breeding ground for terrorists of all stripes. The Middle \nEast seethes in deepening violence and the culture of revenge. Our war \non terror appears to many as a war against Islam. A one-sided policy on \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict drives both sides away from the peace table, \nand hundreds of millions more to hatred of our country. No, the world \nis not safer.\n  One year after the ``mission accomplished'' speech, is America safer? \nWe have not secured our homeland from terrifying threats of \ndestruction. This President has sown divisions in our longstanding \nalliances. He has squandered our treasure in Iraq and put us deep in \ndebt. Our brave soldiers are pinned down in Iraq while our enemies see \nthe invincible American armor as penetrable by the sword of urban \nguerrilla warfare. No, America is not safer.\n  One year ago, the President announced an end to major combat \noperations in Iraq. And yet our troops are having their deployments \nextended in Iraq while our lines are stretched thin everywhere else. \nBillions upon billions of taxpayer dollars are being poured into Iraq. \nSeven hundred and twenty-two American lives have been lost before \ntoday. And we hear that 8 to 10 additional lives have been lost today. \nUnknown thousands of Iraqis are dead. Claims of WMD and death-dealing \ndrones are discredited. And bin Laden is still on the loose.\n  I stand behind no one in supporting our troops through the dangers \nthey face every day. I grieve along with the families that have lost \nloved ones. The failures of post-war Iraq lay squarely on the Bush \nadministration for recklessly sending this country--sending our men and \nwomen--to war, a war that should not have been fought, a war in the \nwrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons.\n  Mission accomplished? The mission in Iraq, as laid out by President \nBush and Vice President Cheney, has failed. Even more disturbing, the \ndisdain for international law, and the military bombast of this cocky, \nreckless administration have tarnished the beacon of hope and freedom \nwhich the United states of America once offered to the world.\n  How long will America continue to pay the price in blood and treasure \nof this President's war? How long must the best of our Nation's \nmilitary men and women be taken from their homes to fight this \nunnecessary war in Iraq? How long must our National Guardsmen be taken \nfrom their communities to fight and to die in the hot sands of Iraq? \nHow long must the mothers and the fathers see their sons and daughters \ndie in a faraway land because of President Bush's doctrine of \npreemptive attack? How long must little children across our great land \ngo to sleep at night crying for a daddy or a mother far away who may \nnever come back home?\n  President Bush typified the Happy Warrior when he strutted across the \ndeck of the USS Abraham Lincoln a year ago this coming Saturday. He was \nin his glory that day. But on this May 1, we will remember the widows \nand the orphans who have been made by his fateful decision to attack \nIraq. We will be aware of the tears that have been shed for his glory. \nHow long? How long? How long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield my remaining time to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in the midst of the ongoing upsurge of \nthe violence in Iraq, President Bush has offered two options for the \nUnited States. The first option is to stay the course; the second \noption is to cut and run. That is a false choice between staying the \ncourse and cutting and running. It is too typical of the black and \nwhite approach that this administration has repeatedly and unwisely \ntaken.\n  For example, saying ``you are either with us or against us'' is a \nblack and white choice--the stark choice the President laid down to \nallies. Well, it may make you feel good to say that, but it needlessly \noffends those who are certainly not hostile to the United States but \nmay be unwilling to affirmatively endorse all of our actions.\n  In addition to the President's stark two options--staying the course \nor cutting and running--there is a third way, and that is to correct \nthe course we are on. The administration has belatedly begun this \nprocess, but there is much to be done, and it is much harder and more \ndifficult because of the administration's stubborn insistence that no \nmistakes were made and its refusal to learn the lessons that need to be \nlearned from those mistakes.\n  For instance, after holding the United Nations at arm's length, the \nadministration is now belatedly working with the U.N., asking them to \nhelp identify an entity to whom sovereignty could be restored by June \n30--an entity which needs to have the confidence and credibility of the \nIraqi people. I hope this will be the start of a true partnership at \nthe U.N. in fostering Iraq's political and economic development.\n  The administration has decided to retain some troops in Iraq that \nwere scheduled to leave, despite the fact that the administration \ndisparaged General Shinseki when he foretold the need for more troops \nfor the stability phase.\n\n  The administration decided to modify its policy on de-Baathification \nand reinstate about 11,000 teachers and\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nhundreds of professors and is reportedly looking to reinstate others \nwhose skills and support are needed for Iraq's development. I hope this \nrevision is seen for what it is--acknowledgement that we went too far, \nacknowledgement that we made a mistake. I hope it will also include the \nremoval of Ahmed Chalabi as the head of the de-Baathification program, \nas well. He is the wrong person for the job for a lot of reasons.\n  While not reversing the mistaken decision to disband the Iraqi Army, \nthe administration's decision to bring back some military officers who \nwere not high Baathists to help guide the new Iraqi Army and other \nsecurity forces is a practical first step--very late. We only have a \nfew thousand in the Iraqi Army who are now trained but long overdue.\n  One other mistake was perhaps the biggest mistake of all, in my \njudgment. Our uniformed military leadership was largely excluded from \nthe planning for the potentially violent aftermath of the fall of \nSaddam Hussein's regime. The civilians in the Pentagon who were put in \ncharge projected rose-colored scenarios in their planning for the \naftermath: Our troops would be greeted with embraces and flowers. It \nwould be a cakewalk.\n  Had our uniformed military leadership been more deeply involved in \nthat planning, it would have been very different, as our military plans \nfor worst case scenarios. The worst case scenario is what turned out to \nbe the case. But uniformed military were all but left out of the \nplanning for the post-Saddam period. General Tommy Franks, the now \nretired commander of Central Command who planned the other phases of \nthe operation, confirmed that to me and to Senator Warner a few weeks \nago.\n  On the matter of planning, I realize the administration is committed \nto the June 30 date for the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty. But I \nhope that commitment will not prevent it from planning for other \noptions in the event Mr. Brahimi is not successful in identifying a \ncredible entity to whom sovereignty can be restored by that date.\n  If we have a chance of succeeding and bringing stability and \ndemocracy to Iraq, it will mean learning from our mistakes, not denying \nthem and not ignoring them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada for this \nopportunity to speak on behalf of the amendment being offered by \nSenator Daschle to the bill before the Senate about the use of ethanol \nand other renewable fuels.\n  Here we are in the middle of this energy price crisis in our country, \nwhen in Minnesota the price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is \nalmost $2, and in other parts of the country it is as high as $2.50. \nPossibly it is going higher. I am being asked what are we doing about \nbringing the price of motor fuel down. I think the honest answer is \nnothing. There is not a whole lot we can do when we are dependent upon \nforeign supplies of oil, when we are sending $115 billion a year \noverseas to buy that product.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment--I give him great credit for every year \nchampioning the cause of renewable fuels, with the opportunity that is \nright before us in America today to shift from foreign oil consumption \nto using a cleaner burning, lower priced, American-grown, American-\nproduced fuel, not as a substitute for MTBE--the additives to \ngasoline--but as a substitute for gasoline itself. I know that because \nI drive all over the State of Minnesota in a Ford Explorer, factory-\nproduced, with a slight modification to the usual engine. It was \nmodified in the factory. I drive on 85-percent ethanol and 15-percent \ngasoline. Today it is 20 cents a gallon cheaper than regular unleaded \ngasoline. I can get it in most places in Minnesota.\n\n  We can give the American people a choice to have a homegrown fuel \nwith the money staying in America to benefit our rural economies. We \ncan renew it every year. We know we can produce the amount that will be \nnecessary, and today it will cost 20 to 15 cents a gallon less than \nregular unleaded gasoline and likely in the future $1 less than the \nrising cost of gasoline. If we are not going to take any steps to bring \nabout that opportunity, people will think we are out of our minds.\n  I do not understand why the debate today on Senator Daschle's \namendment about why do this, or why not do this and even more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nfinish my remarks.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that the majority have an additional \n1 minute in morning business also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, Senator Daschle has been heroic in my \ncaucus and this body in his support for those who are not in corn-\nproducing States who support ethanol and other renewable fuels, \nbiofuels as products. But this is not just about South Dakota or \nMinnesota. Yes, it benefits my State. It benefits the farmers of my \nState. This benefits America. This is the best opportunity in my \nlifetime to shift our energy consumption from our traditional sources \nand their costs to something that is American, that is clean, and that \nis cheaper. I am amazed we are not racing to the stores for that \nproduct. We have it. Senator Daschle's amendment will take us in that \ndirection. We should be doing even more than that, but this is an \nimportant first step. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I had come to the Senate floor to talk \nabout an issue that is very important to all of us, particularly \nMedicare recipients in this country. But first I have to express some \ndisappointment, frankly, and some surprise about the discussion that \nhas gone on here in the first 30 minutes criticizing the President on \neverything that is happening overseas, acting as if we are not in \nsupport of what is happening there.\n  I am very surprised and, frankly, disappointed. All they talk about \nis what the President has done. We voted here on this floor to do this \njob in the Middle East. That is what we are seeking to do, and that is \nwhat our great service people are doing for us over there.\n  The idea behind conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom was to free 25 \nmillion Iraqis from the Saddam Hussein regime. That is why we are \nthere: to defend the will of the international community, to remove the \nthreat of terrorism that happened here on September 11, and to change \nthe dynamics in the Middle East. That is what we are seeking to do, and \nthat is what we are trying to carry on, and it is an admirable effort.\n  Madam President, 211 Members of Congress have visited Iraq and \nwitnessed firsthand some of the extraordinary efforts of the coalition \nforces and Iraqis. I have been to Iraq. I am impressed with what they \nare doing. For us to simply criticize everything that is happening \nthere aimed at the election in 2004 is a great disappointment to me.\n  Despite the terrorist attacks and the tough events that have \nhappened, public opinion has found 56 percent of Iraqis believe things \nare better than they were; 71 percent believe a year from now they will \nbe better than they are now. Again, having been there, I agree with \nthat assessment. I have been there traveling around with the military, \nwith all the little kids waving and saying hello. I have seen the \nschools and hospitals that have been fixed up. Of course, there is a \nreal problem with terrorism, there is no question about it.\n  The defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime is the second major victory in \nthe war on terrorism. We need to continue.\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nI hope we give the kind of support that is necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4631-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we also have issues at home about which \nwe ought to be talking. One of them is health care, of course. We have \ngreat health care in this country, the best in the world. We have some \nlimited access, however, because of the costs, and we need to address \nthat issue.\n  There are many reasons for the costs. One reason is liability and \nmalpractice, which we do not seem to be able to deal with. Another \nreason, I suppose, is overutilization. There is a difference between \nhealth care and health. We have some responsibility to take care of \nourselves as well. Modern equipment is the biggest cost increase. We \nall want the modern equipment. We have to find the system in which the \ncosts can be reduced.\n  In any event, what we are talking about today is the opportunity to \nmake it much better for Medicare folks through a Medicare drug discount \ncard in which seniors will soon be able to enroll. All Medicare \nbeneficiaries, except those who have medication paid for by Medicaid, \nwill be eligible. While seniors may enroll in only one Medicare-\napproved discount card, they can keep the other discount cards if they \nhave them, if they like. There are going to be 40 official discount \ncards available. It is surprising there has been that much involvement. \nIt shows we are moving in the right direction and doing what needs to \nbe done.\n  This is the first time in Medicare's history that seniors will have a \ndiscount for pharmaceutical drugs. Quite frankly, it is the first thing \nin about 30 years we have done to bring Medicare more into the modern \nworld and give some options to seniors. I want to emphasize what is \ngoing to happen. In 2006, there are going to be options for seniors. \nThey can stay with what they now have. It is also the first time that \nlow-income seniors will receive additional assistance from the Federal \nGovernment for the cost of their medications. It is a great step \nforward for seniors to deal with the high cost of drugs.\n  This is more of a temporary program. When we put this together in the \nFinance Committee, of which I am a member, we knew changes were going \nto be difficult. We knew it would take some time to prepare for those \nchanges, not only on the part of seniors but on the part of people who \nhave a program. This program will be implemented and in place until \n2006, when there will be a broad system put into place. We need to take \nadvantage of this card system as quickly as possible so we get the \nbenefits from it.\n  I commend the hard work of Secretary Tommy Thompson and CMS \nAdministrator Mark McClellan. There has been an overwhelming response \nto this program. As I mentioned, 40 drug discount cards will be \navailable from which seniors can choose. I believe there are an \nadditional 33 that will be available on a regional basis. So there is a \nlot of interest for doing something in this area.\n  Drug card sponsors are required to provide information to \nbeneficiaries, the annual enrollment fee cannot be more than $30 per \nyear, and the people who are putting out the cards will have to show \nwhat their discount prices will be. The transparency will give an \nopportunity for people to choose what will work best for them.\n  We are trying to make this as simple as possible. Medicare's Web site \nwill be the best opportunity for people to get an update on drug \nprices. The Web site is www.medicare.gov. The information will be \nthere. In my home State of Wyoming, AARP is holding seminars to help \npeople understand the benefits, what the options are, and how you can \ntake advantage of them. It is very important for seniors in the next \ncouple of weeks to take advantage of the informational efforts being \nput forth. The easiest one, of course, is for seniors to call 1-800-\nMedicare, and a live person in this country will answer and help them \nfigure out the card that meets their needs the best.\n  CMS has already received a lot of calls. They received 112,000 calls \non Monday, as a matter of fact--isn't that amazing?--and 94,000 on \nTuesday from seniors seeking information. It is the right thing to do \nto call that 1-800-Medicare number.\n  The average wait is only a very short 22 seconds, I believe. This is \na huge accomplishment for a Federal bureaucracy to be able to put this \ninto place to deal with that many people in that short a time.\n  By mid-May, seniors should make a decision so they can receive a \ncard, and the benefits are to begin on June 1. I think it is great to \ntake advantage of this information. Our own offices in Wyoming will \nhave the information as to where people can go to get the information \nand find out the choices that are available.\n  Contrary to what some people have said on the other side of the \naisle, this discount card will provide for significant savings. There \nwas a study that was done which shows there will be an approximate 17-, \n18- to 25-percent reduction in the cost. The average beneficiary will \nprobably spend $1,500. This is a significant amount of saving over \nwhere we are today.\n  It is expected that the overall savings to seniors would be probably \nabout a billion dollars over the next year, and that is very useful.\n  The card provides immediate help to the most needy Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Low-income seniors who do not currently have \nprescription drug coverage or do not qualify for Medicaid will be given \nadditional help. Low-income beneficiaries will be helped by receiving \n$600 annually to help them buy the medicine right from the \npharmaceutical companies.\n  To qualify for that additional assistance, they must have an income \nof 135 percent of the Federal poverty level. That is about $12,000 per \nindividual or $16,000 for couples. If they qualify for Medicaid, of \ncourse, they get their assistance there and will not get it from the \ncard.\n  Further, the Federal Government will pay the annual enrollment fees \nfor low-income seniors. Major card companies have told HHS that they \nwill continue to provide the drugs that are already given free or at a \nsteeply discounted rate for those people who qualify for the $600 use. \nSo low-income people will reap a great benefit from this.\n  In Wyoming, of course, we know that our AARP chapter and the Senior \nHealth Insurance Information Program have been working hard. I think \nthat is the case in all States. So I guess the point we are trying to \nmake today is, here is a program that has the potential to be \nbeneficial to all Medicare recipients. It is a choice program. If they \nhave other cards that are not in this official brand, they may keep \nthose. They do not need to get into it if they choose not to, but it is \nbeneficial, and they need to know what is required to get the \ninformation and then have an opportunity to make choices among several \nthings that can indeed happen.\n  So we want to urge everyone to take advantage of this potential new \nchange and the opportunities available to reap some savings and to make \npharmaceuticals even a stronger part of their health care program by \nmaking them less expensive through this program.\n  I yield to my friend from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The minority is trying \nto take the President apart at the cost of our troops, and we cannot \nstand for that. We have people fighting in Iraq. Two weeks ago I was in \nGermany, and I met with some of the wounded troops. We thought we would \nhave to pump them up, but they pumped us up. Their message to us was: \nHow come everything sounds so bad back home when it is improving in \nIraq? They said the people of Iraq appreciate what we are doing. We are \nmaking a difference. Let us do our job.\n  Then we hear this rhetoric which is just based on a Presidential \nelection. It has nothing to do with the true feelings in Iraq or the \nprotection of our troops. In much the same way, I hear people on that \nside of the aisle trying to scare seniors about Medicare.\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n  Seniors are about to get the best advantage they have ever had since \nthe founding of Medicare, and that is the new prescription drug \nprogram.\n  Next week, we will take the first step in the history of Medicare \ntoward providing seniors with the help they need to pay for their \nprescription drugs. We made improvements to Medicare in a three-stage \nparcel so that it can be done right. What begins next week is that \npeople begin to get information so they can select a prescription drug \ncard where they will get 10- to 20-percent discounts on the drugs they \nare taking now. They can do it easily. They can go online and make a \ncomparison, or they can call 1-800-MEDICARE and talk to live people, \ntell them what their drugs are, and get some help in gathering \ninformation. But they do not have to make the decision right now. That \nis just a telephone call to find out what the best possibility is right \nnow.\n  So seniors can begin to run options through their minds and make the \nbest selection for the drugs they take to get the biggest discount they \npossibly can.\n  This is an historic new benefit for seniors, and I am sorry there has \nbeen so much rhetoric surrounding the new law. There are some people \nwho would prefer to have had an issue instead of a solution. But \nPresident Bush said we are going to have a prescription drug plan, and \nbecause he put the effort behind it, and because people here believed \nin it, we got a solution.\n\n  The solution comes in three parts: By June 1, seniors can get the \ndrug card. That is the 2004 benefit. In 2005, for the first time \nseniors under Medicare will be able to get a physical, part of \npreventive medicine. We think that it is important that people find out \nwhat their medical problems are early and solve them. Preventive \nmedicine is proven to be the most beneficial for the patient and \nabsolutely the best from a pain standpoint, and it does prevent \nproblems from happening, which is also a huge cost saver.\n  So get on the phone or get on the Internet. Seniors should call in, \nfind out how the drug benefit works, and they will receive up to 10 to \n20 percent off the prices they are paying now for their drugs. And if \nthey happen to be a low-income senior who signs up for the card, they \nwill receive an extra $600 in credit in 2004 and 2005 to help pay for \ntheir prescriptions.\n  A number of the pharmaceutical companies also have agreed to provide \ntheir brands of drugs free of charge to seniors who exhaust their $600 \ncredit. That is going to cost the companies quite a bit of money.\n  Some people who say we didn't do anything, that there is a donut hole \nin the benefit. My response is, before we did the Medicare bill there \nwas not even a donut. Now there is only a donut hole.\n  So in 2006, there will be more extensive and comprehensive coverage \nof prescription drugs, and a maximum out-of-pocket spending of $3,600 \nper person on drugs before catastrophic coverage kicks in.\n  There has been a tremendous benefit that has been delivered, but \nseniors have to participate if they are under Medicare. They have to do \nthe research to find out what the best discount card for them would be.\n  There are two ways to do that. One is on the Internet at \nMedicare.gov. The other is by telephone at 1-800-MEDICARE. There will \nbe live people on the phone to help seniors gather the information by \nJune 1. Seniors do not have to sign up until June 1, but they should do \nthe research and watch what happens to the price as competition kicks \nin. That is what this is, a number of companies vying for the business \nof seniors, all seniors, because all seniors will have help with their \ndrug benefit--up to 10 to 20 percent, in some cases higher with the \ndiscount cards, but $600 if they are low income, and some other \nbenefits beyond that.\n  I hope we can end some of the rhetoric that is coming from the other \nside of the aisle about what this does and does not do, and we can get \non board and help seniors to take advantage of what has been done. We \ntalked about doing a benefit for years, and it did not get done. The \nPresident got behind it, pushed it, said we will have it done, and it \nis done. The reality is now that seniors have access to new benefits \nunder Medicare, they can sign up for that with a drug discount card \nbeginning next week. They do not have to sign up until June 1 with no \npenalty if they wait until then.\n  So let us do what is right by seniors and put politics aside for a \nmoment. There will be plenty of time later for debating and \ncampaigning. The great majority of seniors will benefit from the new \nMedicare discount cards.\n  Let me recap again what this bill does.\n  Next month, seniors can begin signing up for a Medicare-endorsed drug \ndiscount card that will save them 10 to 20 percent, at least, off \nretail drug prices. Seniors with low incomes will also get up to $600 \nin credit to help them pay for their prescriptions.\n  Next year, Medicare will cover new preventive benefits, including a \n``Welcome to Medicare'' physical exam for all Americans when they turn \n65.\n  And in 2006, Medicare will offer voluntary, comprehensive drug \ncoverage, with special benefits for seniors with low incomes and \nseniors with high drug bills.\n  The new drug benefit will be voluntary. It will offer the most help \nto those who need the help most. And it will provide much-needed \nsecurity and peace of mind to seniors who worry about losing their life \nsavings in the event of a devastating illness.\n  Despite all of these good things, there are still some who insist on \n``talking down'' this new Medicare drug benefit. There are some who are \ntrying to convince seniors and their families that this is somehow a \nraw deal, a sham, or worse.\n  I hear that, and I know that other Members who voted for the Medicare \nbill from both sides of the aisle hear these things. And then I review \nagain what the bill actually does, and I wonder what the problem is.\n  I think I have finally figured out the problem.\n  The problem is that this new Medicare drug benefit does not fit the \ntired old storyline about Republicans and healthcare.\n  We Republicans know the story all too well. I am surprised someone \nhas not turned it into a children's book yet, so that kids can hear it \nwhen they are very young. Or maybe someone has.\n  The tired old story changes over time, but the main points are always \nthe same.\n  The tired old story is that Republicans do not care about healthcare; \nthey do not care if healthcare is affordable or available to everyone; \nthey do not care if people with low incomes can get care when they need \nit; they do not care about seniors and their drug bills.\n  And the problem for the storytellers is that the facts on the \nMedicare drug benefit do not support their story.\n  Nevertheless, the storytellers persist in peddling this tale. It is \nso bad right now that some of the storytellers are trying to undo this \nimportant legislation before it even gets off the ground. In fact, some \nare completely reversing their longstanding positions on this issue, in \nan attempt to remove parts of the new Medicare law that are nearly \nidentical to sections of their bills from recent years.\n  I understand why some in the minority are upset with the new Medicare \nlaw. They are upset because Republicans campaigned 2 years ago on a \npromise to pass a meaningful drug benefit for seniors, and we delivered \non that promise.\n  But the reality is that now seniors have access to new benefits under \nMedicare, and they can sign up for the first new benefit--the drug \ndiscount card--beginning next week.\n  So let's do right by seniors and put politics aside for a moment. \nThere will be plenty of time later for debating and campaigning.\n  The great majority of seniors will benefit from the new Medicare drug \ndiscount cards. Our job should be to work together to help seniors make \nthe best decisions about their own healthcare and their own finances. \nLet's give them the right information so they can decide whether to \nsign up, and which card to choose. Let's do this now, because seniors \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4632-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4632-S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1072\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \ngiving\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nus some time. We are in another critical juncture in our efforts to \npass a transportation bill, a highway bill, or SAFTEA. I propose a \nunanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of the House-passed highway bill, H.R. 3550; \nprovided further that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and \nthe text of S. 1072, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill \nthen be read a third time and passed; further, the Senate then insist \non its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair \nthen be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with \na ratio of 11 to 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, as my good \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, knows, the current \nextension expires tomorrow. In fact, the House of Representatives has \nalready passed it. That measure is at the desk now. We need to do \nsomething today that will not require further action by the House \nbecause they will be gone.\n  I ask my colleague if he will agree that we need to act today on \nanother extension of the highway bill, or if not today, tomorrow?\n  Would the Senator agree to modify his request and provide for the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4219, which is the bill I referred to \njust a minute ago, a 2-month extension of the highway bill, and that \nthe Senate proceed then to its passage, the bill be read, of course, \nthree times, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and there \nbe no intervening action or debate?\n  If we do this, it gives us time to continue our informal discussions \nabout the larger bill.\n  I hope the Senate will agree to pass this today to ensure that there \nare no disruptions in highway projects. I ask my friend to modify his \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I would be happy to accept that as an \naddendum to my request. The problem is, we need to appoint conferees to \nthe House. I want to call attention to the fact that for 11 weeks we \nhave been stalled. If we cannot appoint conferees, then I have a hold \non the extension. So unless my good friend is willing to accept the \nunanimous consent request I propounded, I cannot accept his unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. REID. Further, Madam President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time is remaining on everything?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes remaining to the \nmajority.\n  Mr. REID. That is all for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Then we have a Burma discussion; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After the 10 minutes there is another 15-\nminute period.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak on my position for 5 minutes and give equal time for the \nmajority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I reserve the right to object. I will not object, but I \nwill point out to the Senator that we are prepared to move on to the \nBurma issue, and it is important. I know what the Senator wants to \ndiscuss: the importance of passing the highway bill and his objection \nand the usual degeneration that has taken place around here. We would \nlike to talk about Burma and a woman who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner \nwho is being kept under house arrest. But I will not object to the \nrequest of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the Senators here because the time has been \nallotted to him. I do appreciate the 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We really do need to pass this 2-month extension. I say to \nmy friend from Missouri and all others here, Senator Inhofe and I have \nworked very hard to move this bill along. The 11 weeks the Senator \ntalked about, of course, a lot of that time we have been out of \nsession. I have spoken to Chairman Young. He wants a bill. Senator \nInhofe wants a bill. A bill has, in fact, passed both bodies by \noverwhelming majorities. To not allow this 2-month extension will cause \na layoff of 5,000 people beginning Saturday. They will no longer be \nable to work. These are employees of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation.\n  Not agreeing to the extension will cause new highway and bridge \nprojects to be shelved. It will stop reimbursement payments to States \nfor projects that already are incurred. It will halt safety grants, \nstop transportation projects in cities and towns, interrupt enforcement \nof motor carrier safety regulations, and disrupt safety inspections at \nthe Nation's borders. This is a temporary extension designed to provide \ntime for the Congress to complete its work on a fully funded \nauthorization. The extension is a means to an end, and the end is the \npassage of a highway bill, so we need to get to work on that.\n  Madam President, we have tried very hard to pass this bill. We got 76 \nvotes to pass it and get it to the President. We need to keep working \non it. The Nation expects nothing less.\n  As we discussed yesterday, the Republican leadership is going to meet \nlater on to decide what they are going to do with this bill. I think \nthat is appropriate. As I indicated, I wish that I and others were in \non that discussion, but I am glad they are meeting.\n  Madam President, the Americans for Transportation Mobility, which \nincludes hundreds of organizations--hundreds, including the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, Associated General Contractors, International \nUnion of Operating Engineers--and, as I say hundreds of other \norganizations, including organizations from the State of Missouri--the \nKirksville Area Chamber of Commerce, Lake of the Ozarks West Chamber of \nCommerce, Missouri Chamber of Commerce, Springfield Area Chamber of \nCommerce--in effect, they have written a letter to each Senator. Among \nother things they say:\n\n       As business and labor, we will only support a final \n     conference report at the Senate investment level for a six-\n     year bill. To that end, we support agreement on funding \n     levels for the legislation before entering into a formal \n     conference committee. We urge that final legislation meet our \n     minimum $318 billion objective.\n\n  So these hundreds of groups disagree with the Senator from Missouri, \nincluding people from his own State.\n  I know how strongly he feels about a highway bill. I have talked to \nhim. He has discussed this publicly and privately. But I think in \neffect he is shooting himself in the foot by not agreeing to the 2-\nmonth extension. We have made progress in the few meetings that the two \nstaffs have had.\n  So I say to my friend, we have cleared on our side--there are no \nobjections on our side to having a 2-month extension. I think it is a \nheavy weight for my friend to carry, to bring down everything that is \ngoing on around the country tomorrow by objecting to this 2-month \nextension.\n  If that is the weight he wants to bear, that is what he has to bear. \nBut I am very disappointed. As the Senator knows, we have had problems \nwith conferences. That doesn't mean we can't complete important \nlegislation as we have done on numerous occasions without a formal \nconference. In this instance, we may be able to do a conference, as I \nhave spoken about with Senator Inhofe. We need to do a little more work \nthis morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent, in closing, to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from Americans for Transportation Mobility, together with \nits members.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 23, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: The House and Senate will soon begin meeting \n     to reconcile differences on reauthorization of the federal \n     highway and transit law (H.R. 3550/S. 1072). The undersigned \n     organizations firmly believe there is no more important \n     legislation this year to benefit all industries, all \n     communities, all working people and the American economy.\n       As we have stated previously, the appropriate investment \n     blueprint for this legislation is provided by the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation's recent Conditions and \n     Performance Report, which outlines that the federal \n     investment share necessary to begin\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\n     improving the nation's surface transportation network is $375 \n     billion over the next six years. The bi-partisan leaders of \n     the House Transportation and Infrastructure (T) Committee \n     identified this goal earlier this year and we continue to \n     support their efforts to reach this objective.\n       The Senate passed TEA-21 reauthorization proposal (S. 1072) \n     would authorize a total of $318 billion for federal surface \n     transportation programs, with $294 billion in guaranteed \n     highway and transit investment over the next six years. The \n     Senate investment levels represent the mid-point between the \n     nation's surface transportation needs and the current \n     inadequate federal highway and transit funding levels.\n       As business and labor, we will only support a final \n     conference report at the Senate investment level for a six-\n     year bill. To that end, we support agreement on funding \n     levels for the legislation before entering into a formal \n     conference committee. We urge that final legislation meet our \n     minimum $318 billion objective.\n       A $318 billion investment level would create and support \n     over 2 million American job opportunities and help address \n     the growing deterioration of the nation's highway, bridge and \n     transit infrastructure facilities. With the Department of \n     Transportation stating that 47,500 U.S. jobs are created for \n     every $1 billion of federal highway and transit investment, \n     investment levels below $318 billion would miss a critical \n     opportunity to create badly needed jobs.\n       The U.S. is facing a transportation infrastructure deficit \n     that can no longer be ignored. Traffic crashes cost our \n     society $230 billion per year and inadequate roadway \n     conditions are a factor in one-third of these accidents. \n     Traffic congestion robs $70 billion per year from the U.S. \n     economy and denies Americans time with their families. A \n     recent study has shown the number of traffic bottlenecks \n     nationwide have grown from 167 to 233, while only one-quarter \n     of households have access to adequate public transportation. \n     This situation will only get worse if we do not enact a \n     reauthorization bill of at least $318 billion.\n       The Senate-proposed investment levels are attainable \n     without raising the federal gas tax or user fee, or \n     increasing the federal deficit. It continues the important \n     principle of paying for highways, bridges and transit through \n     the Highway Trust Fund. As such, the $318 billion investment \n     level complies with surface transportation program financing \n     parameters identified by the Bush Administration.\n       We strongly urge the conferees and the bipartisan House/\n     Senate Leadership to support a $318 billion investment level. \n     Our business and labor organizations, and the American \n     people, will accept nothing less. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n       Americans for Transportation Mobility.\n       Transportation Construction Coalition.\n\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to everyone on the other side of \nthe aisle for extending me the extra 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I want to reclaim my time. First, let me \nsay I know all the pressures. I know the people my good friend from \nNevada mentioned. They want a highway bill at $318 billion that we \npassed. I want one. I have long quotations. I have all kinds of people \nbehind me. The chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe wants it. I \nknow that Senator Reid wants it and Senator Jeffords wants it. But do \nyou know something, we can't do anything because we are opposed, we are \nblocked by the minority from going to conference.\n  A lot of people in America don't understand. They have heard about \nfilibusters. They know we filibuster judges around here. They know we \nfilibuster bills. But this is the first time I know of where a bill \nthat has passed this body with 76 votes has been stopped from going to \nconference by the opposition of the minority.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield to the assistant leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Missouri, it is not actually \nthe first time this has happened. It has become, actually, repetitious. \nThey prevented us from going to conference on the CARE Act, the \nBankruptcy Act, the Workforce Investment Act, the Patients Safety Act, \nnot to mention the Transportation bill. So there is a pattern, I would \nsay to my friend from Missouri, which is that the minority is saying to \nthe majority of the Senate and to the majority in the House: You make \nthe bill exactly the way we want it or we won't let the legislative \nprocess go forward. Complete stalemate.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague and neighbor for the \nclarification. I have never seen, in my history, a bill passing the \nSenate with this much support, that is so important to our Nation, \nbeing held up. It is 11 weeks since we passed a highway bill, the $318 \nbillion Surface Transportation Equity Act. To get it to conference, we \nhave to have the approval of the minority.\n  I am taking this step. I am taking this radical step because the \npeople of America need to know. When I go home, they say: How come we \ndon't have a highway bill? They don't understand that we are being \nblocked from going to conference. We can't work out the differences \nbetween the House and Senate unless we can go to conference. If there \nhas ever been a bipartisan bill, I believe this bill is it.\n  Chairman Inhofe with Senator Jeffords, Senator Reid and I have \nworked, I think collegially and effectively, in bringing a good bill to \nthe floor of the Senate. I appreciate the work that my colleagues did.\n  It is obvious when the bill passes with 76 votes that it was a good \nbipartisan bill. We can't tell what is going to come out of conference. \nI am going to go into conference saying we need a $318 billion bill. \nBut if we can't go to conference, we can't even take that step.\n  We have been delayed and delayed from going to conference. That is \nwhat, unfortunately, we have to explain to our constituents around the \ncountry--that the transportation system lifeline to our country and our \neconomy is being held up. We cannot take the next step and make the \nmajor investment in the future of this system to promote increased \nemployment, decrease congestion, enhance security, to lay the sinews of \neconomic development for the future and, most of all, provide safety on \nour highways.\n  There are 43,000 Americans killed on the highways each year; in \nMissouri, more than three a day, and at least one and probably more of \nthose are killed because of inadequate highways. What can we do about \nit? We can do something in the Senate. But we don't get the job done. \nWe have to sit down and work with our colleagues in the House and come \nup with a compromise proposal that I hope looks like our bill in the \nSenate.\n  I am going to fight as hard as I can when we can get to conference. \nBut until we can get to conference, we don't know and there is no hope \nof us getting a new bill. That is why I have placed a hold on the \nextension of the highway bill. Yes, this is a drastic measure. How long \nare we going to kick the ball down the road? I objected to holding up \nthe first extension, but we have had extension after extension after \nextension. When are we going to get a bill? It is very simple. We can \nhave this bill. We can have the extension if the minority will agree to \nlet us appoint conferees so this can go to conference.\n  I assure you that we will continue to work, Senator Inhofe, our \nranking members, Senators Jeffords and Reid, as we did before to get a \nbill that looks as much like the Senate bill as we possibly can, but \nuntil we do that, I am going to continue to object to the extension. I \nregret we have to take this drastic action, but the people of America \nand the people concerned about highways need to know what is causing \nthis problem.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first of all, to show how unrelated the \nstatements are to reality, we couldn't have gone to conference 11 weeks \nago. The House didn't pass the bill until the first part of April. The \nbill has been passed for 3 weeks. So there is no 11 weeks. That is \ncertainly not a valid statement.\n  I repeat: We need to pass this 2-month extension in an effort to get \nthis bill moving. If we don't pass a 2-month extension, 5,000 people \nare going to be laid off starting Saturday. This is no joke. This is \nnot hyperbole. This is a fact. People will be laid off and construction \nprojects around the country will come to standstill.\n  We can talk about the fact that in previous months we have enacted \ninto law many pieces of legislation. We have entered into law 60 pieces \nof legislation without a conference. We have preconferenced them. We \ncan do that on the highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I must tell my colleagues that, as \nchairman of the Energy Committee, I am having a good week for a change. \nOn Monday, Senator Cantwell came to the floor and sought unanimous \nconsent to bring up one piece of the Energy bill. On Tuesday, the \nminority leader came to the floor and offered a portion of the Energy \nbill as an amendment to the Internet tax bill.\n  We seem to be on a roll. Members know this country has a serious \nenergy problem. They are feeling the political pressure to do something \nabout it. That is good news for this chairman, who has waited so long \nand worked so hard seeking to develop some sort of political consensus \non a broad energy bill.\n  Fellow Senators, I have never in my 31 years worked on legislation \nthat is so hard to piece together, because every time you have a \ncomprehensive bill, you show it to somebody and they read it in its \nentirety, they find one piece out of hundreds they cannot support. If I \nhad the wisdom and the time to go to every Senator and let them read it \nand say what can I take out that would make you happy and have you go \nfor this bill, I assume that when I was finished, this 900-page \nauthorizing bill would probably end up being just a few sheets of \npaper.\n  The truth is that America is crying for a comprehensive energy bill. \nAmerica is not worried about one Senator's particular concern about one \nparticular aspect. They are worried about the fact we will soon be \nimporting natural gas. We have been using our own natural gas, and now \npredictions are that we are going to be using foreign natural gas in \nlarge quantities very soon.\n  The consensus that I indicated to you is very hard to achieve. In the \nlast Congress, the House and Senate both passed bills but were unable \nto resolve their differences in conference. I am not speaking of a few \nmonths ago; I mean the last legislative session, the last Congress.\n  Last year the Senate considered energy legislation for somewhere on \nthe order of 3 months before we were able to pass a bill off the floor. \nThis time we got a conference agreement.\n  I have been criticized for that conference. Some say we didn't have \nenough meetings. Some say the meetings were not open to the public. \nOthers say they were not open to the Democratic staff.\n  Let me tell you, this is good rhetoric, but the truth is we conducted \none of the most open conferences that I have been in in almost 32 years \nin the Senate. We made agreements public as they were reached and at \nthe end, before we circulated the agreement for signature, we held an \nopen meeting and reconsidered all the amendments. When amendments could \nbe agreed to by both bodies, we made changes. That is very different \nthan the way most conferences are conducted. I have asked Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle if they have been involved in bills where they \nwere the minority and they didn't even participate in the conference, \nand many have said that is almost the course of things as we live in \nthis Senate. Yet we did our best to use the Internet as a new tool. We \nsubmitted this to all the press through the Internet. They knew more \nabout this bill if they wanted to report it than anybody has ever \nknown. While doing that, we obviously submitted it to the minority and \nthe minority staff.\n\n  I responded to that criticism by dramatically reducing this bill. It \nis a slimmed-down energy bill. It dramatically reduces the cost for the \nnontax portions. We have reduced the cost from $5.4 billion to a minus \n$1.3 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4635-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 150, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 150) to make permanent the moratorium on taxes \n     on Internet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on \n     electronic commerce imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 3048, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Daschle amendment No. 3050 (to the language of the bill \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 3048), to eliminate \n     methyl tertiary butyl ether from the United States fuel \n     supply, to increase production and use of renewable fuel, and \n     to increase the Nation's energy independence.\n       Domenici amendment No. 3051 (to amendment No. 3050), to \n     enhance energy conservation and research and development and \n     to provide for security and diversity in the energy supply \n     for the American people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be up to \n1 hour of debate only equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope I don't use all that time. Will the Chair advise \nme when I have used 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3051\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we cut the cost by $6.7 billion. The \namendment before us is not subject to a point of order and it can \nproceed without any concern in that regard.\n  We have been criticized heretofore because we had an MTBE safe harbor \nprovision. That provided faulty product liability protection for the \nmanufacturers of MTBE. When the conference report was on the Senate \nfloor, I spent a great deal of time defending that position which was \ninsisted upon by the House. I thought that provision was necessary, but \nbecause we could not get that provision accepted by the Senate, it is \nnot in this legislation.\n  I feel very chagrined today to note, while it has not been to my ear \nwhere I have heard it, I understand the oil companies and their major \nlobbying groups are opposing this bill because of MTBE not being in it. \nI think that is a shortsighted approach. How are they going to get MTBE \nif we don't get a bill? If we don't get a bill, we stay right where we \nare, except we don't have an energy bill for America. What we have is \nno change in the MTBE law, but we do not have an energy bill.\n  I urge those who are taking that position to assume the reality of \nthings. If they think we are going to change the original bill and get \ntwo more votes--remember, in a cloture situation on the original bill, \nwe got 58 votes. I remind those who think we can go back and fix it \nthat it is also subject to seven points of order. Sooner or later, it \nwould have been defeated by a point of order.\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\n  For those who are sitting around thinking that we can get that, they \njust absolutely are talking irrelevant, they are talking things that \ncannot happen. Now let's talk about the bill.\n  I hope my friend Larry Craig comes to the Senate floor before we are \nfinished because I could not have a better helper than he. He \nunderstands this bill. I want to suggest to all that this bill, in its \nslimmed-down manner, when coupled with the tax provisions that are in \nthe tax bill that will come up in the Senate next week, will put before \nthe American people one of the best energy bills we have ever done. The \nAmerican people are watching as gasoline prices soar, and they are \ngoing to be looking today as Senators vote yes or no on keeping this \nbill alive.\n  I know it is tough to get 60 votes. I know that Senators have their \nparticular reasons--one little piece of this bill--for voting no. I \nknow there are some Senators even on my side who are being told: Wait \naround until we get MTBE. We are not going to get MTBE in the Senate. \nIt is an absolute wish that cannot be accomplished. For those who are \nworried about it, they ought to let us get a bill and then see what \nhappens.\n  Let me move to a few other issues. Senator Bingaman came to the \nSenate floor yesterday with a list of concerns. He does not support the \nhydroelectric relicensing provision, the Indian energy provisions, or \nthe electricity title. I understand his perspective, but I contend that \nhis views on these issues are the ones that are outside the consensus. \nWe need consensus. We do not need what one Senator thinks we need; we \nneed consensus. This bill has consensus.\n  Take the hydroelectric relicensing which is so important to Senators \nof both parties from the Northwest. We are not trying to build new dams \nor change the standards. All we are trying to do is streamline the \nprocess. Senator Craig has been active in that issue, and many Senators \nvoted for it, even though they are not from that area.\n\n  Let's take the electricity provision about which many experts have \nsaid the future of America lies in the electric grid of America growing \nand becoming stronger and becoming better, and of all the things we can \ndo, this is the most important.\n  When I became chairman, I assumed that issue would be an obstacle to \nreaching consensus in light of the great controversy over the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission's recent rulings. We worked for months to \nget an agreement, and the final product is, to my amazement, supported \nby almost all the players in the industry across this land. It is by \nfar the greatest achievement of this bill that we could reach such an \nagreement in the months since we completed that conference. The \nagreement has held, and it is here. There are parts of this bill that \nsome criticize, just as there are parts of this comprehensive \nlegislation that, taken alone, I would criticize; however, on balance, \nthis package is a middle ground in this Congress.\n  We know this bill is before us in an extraordinary way. We know that \nif after this vote the McCain vote succeeds, we are wiped out, we are \nremoved from the calendar. We understand that. I guess the probability \nis that we cannot get cloture, but we are not giving up because we \nunderstand there is some kind of bipartisan support for getting \ncloture.\n  This bill also has that most attractive part for many Senators, the \nethanol provisions, which 31 Republicans voted for when it was \nintroduced. Senators can look at that and see if they voted for it or \nnot, and if they did, they should vote for the Domenici bill. I hate to \ncall it ``mine'' because it is the result of so many Senators working \non both sides of the aisle. I think I would call it the ``consensus \nbill,'' but maybe people would not like that because they do not think \nit is consensus for them.\n  This bill provides great quantities of natural gas from American \nsources over the next 5 to 10 years--from Alaska and from underground \noff our shores without in any way violating the moratorium. It produces \na modernization which addresses the drilling activities in our country \nso we can get more oil and gas without harming the environment.\n  It solves the electric problem. In addition to the grid I talked \nabout, believe it or not, this bill provides that when there is \ngridlock, when you cannot proceed any further because you run into \nState lines or you run into somebody else's right-of-way, believe it or \nnot, we got a consensus, including Republicans, that after negotiations \nthat occur in the States or between the companies that are at \nloggerheads, we have a provision that eminent domain can apply. Nobody \nthought we would get that. That is an extraordinary position to get and \nbring before the Senate.\n  I know it does not sound sexy, as some political issues, but it is \ngood. This bill is filled with very good things. I hope those who are \nlooking at this bill with a microscope, and want to make sure every \nsingle provision meets with their satisfaction, understand that the \nAmerican people are not looking at this bill with a microscope. They \nare looking at this bill to see if the Senate wants to pass an energy \nbill. This will be a signal of whether we want to put something \ntogether that will help America in this energy crisis.\n  If we do not want to, then we can send a signal that we do not like \nthis provision and we do not like that provision, but at some point in \ntime the American people are not going to look at that. They are going \nto see where were the Democrats, where were the Republicans, where were \nthe leaders in trying to get a bill that will help solve America's \nenergy problem.\n  I see the minority leader in the Chamber, and I understand his great \nconcern on the ethanol front. I suggest that he has been very helpful \nin the past in trying to get a comprehensive bill which would include \nethanol, and I understand that, but I submit there are an awful lot of \npeople who are very shortsighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 1 more minute and yield the time.\n  I understand the minority leader is in a predicament because of this \nbeing a bill that the consensus was worked out not by his side, \nalthough there were some, but predominately by this Senator on this \nside. I believe the American people are going to say on every major \naspect of America's growing dependence, the price of gasoline, the \nprice of natural gas, wiping out of the fertilizer industry in America \nwhich affects our agriculture, and on and on, they understand we need \nan energy bill.\n  We need this bill. This is as good as we will ever get. Having spoken \nas well as I can for as long as is prudent in the Senate where one can \nspeak too long--the House does it in 2 or 3 minutes; if they would have \nforced me I guess I could have done that--but as I started out saying, \nas the chairman of this committee, it has been a good week and a few \ngood things have happened. There has been some evidence that people \nwant to get this bill done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \nall of what the distinguished chairman of the committee has said, but \nwhat I did hear him say I find myself in agreement with.\n  Let me first talk procedurally for a moment and then I want to talk \nsubstantively. I hope, procedurally, we can reach an agreement to \nattempt to get to the votes earlier rather than later. I think it would \nbe great if we could have the three cloture votes beginning at noon to \naccommodate our policy conference meeting. If that could be done, I \nthink it would also accommodate a number of Senators' schedules.\n  With regard to the larger procedural question, this is not our first \nchoice. This is not the way we ought to approach comprehensive energy \nlegislation or targeted energy legislation, as my amendment did with \nethanol. I have made no secret of my frustration and disappointment \nwith regard to the conference process and the way in which Democrats \nagain were locked out of the opportunity to express themselves.\n  I warned our House colleagues and our leadership on the other side \nwith regard to putting MTBE legislation into the conference report. All \nthose warnings, all those admonitions, all those concerns about being \nlocked out have been expressed on a number of occasions.\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\n  As I said the other day, I am also very deeply concerned about the \nreported decision to delay any real debate about energy legislation \nuntil the fall. I think it was reported in the Energy Daily on Tuesday.\n  So for all of those procedural concerns, we had no choice but to act \nas we did the other day and to provide at least an opportunity for \nSenators to be heard and for us to vote once again on legislation that \non a bipartisan basis this Senate has supported over and over.\n  The first vote we will cast this morning will be on the renewable \nfuels standard. I hope our colleagues will support cloture on it. Two-\nthirds of the Senate has voted for it in the past. All we need, of \ncourse, is 60 votes so I cannot imagine that anybody would flip their \nvote, having supported it on several occasions, and vote against it as \nwe contemplate its consideration today.\n  It is the exact same legislation that we have offered. It eliminates \nthe reformulated gasoline programs oxygen standard, replaces it with \nthe renewable fuel standard, and sets a 10-year schedule for assured \ngrowth in alternative energy. It contains the same waiver authority \nagreed to in the energy conference report and it strikes all liability \nprotection for MTBE and ethanol and bans MTBE within 4 years.\n  So this is an amendment that merits the bipartisan support that it \nhas received before, and I hope our colleagues could support the \namendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support cloture on the comprehensive Energy \nbill. Senator Domenici did what he said he was going to do. He took out \nMTBE liability immunity. He has also taken out the provisions having to \ndo with many of the tax incentives created originally in the Energy \nbill. This is a much different bill. So those who voted against it \nbefore I think ought to look very carefully at voting in favor of it \nthis time.\n  One of the reasons on this side of the aisle that we have always \nopposed cloture is to protect Members' rights to offer amendments. In \nthis case, there is no concern for the protection of a Senator's rights \nbecause they will be protected. We are only bringing cloture on the \namendment. The bill is open as wide as it is now to any amendment that \nSenators wish to offer on energy or on anything else. So we are not in \nany way excluding or minimizing Senators' opportunities to be heard and \nto offer other legislation.\n\n  I might say the third cloture vote is the critical one. That is the \ncloture motion that I hope will be defeated, because I believe we have \nnot had a good enough debate on the Internet tax bill. We have not had \nan opportunity to offer our amendments. We have not really had the kind \nof debate that an issue of this import requires.\n  There are very divergent views in the Senate on a bipartisan basis, \nand I think as we consider those divergent views it is critical for us \nto ensure the debate and the opportunity to reach consensus prior to \nthe time we invoke cloture or bring this bill to a premature conclusion \nand have the vote that I think can be taken at some point as that \ndebate produces the consensus for which we are looking.\n  So if we are going to accommodate the schedule that I have just \nsuggested, I will not dominate the floor. Let me again reiterate that I \nhope my colleagues will support the cloture vote on ethanol. I hope \nthey will support the cloture vote on energy. I hope they will oppose \nthe cloture vote on the Internet tax bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. My guess is that most Senators understand the process and \nthe procedure we are under, but there is a large body of interest that \ndoes not understand what we are doing at all. It is called the American \nconsumer.\n  I can put it this way: The minority is trying to wrestle control of \nthe floor away from the majority and set their own agenda. That is one \nway of looking at it. The other way of looking at it is to create an \nenvironment of false hope for that consumer who went to the gas pump \ntoday and paid more for gas than he or she has ever paid in their life.\n  I question the integrity of Senators who will argue and opine the \nproblems of energy but set in motion a procedural event that denies us \nthe opportunity to produce for the American consumer a national energy \npolicy.\n  So go home to your voters and tell them it is no longer big oil's \nfault, that it is no longer the nuclear industry's fault, it is the \npoliticians' fault because consistently over the last 5 years Democrats \nand Republicans alike have denied the American consumer a legitimate, \ncomprehensive policy for national energy. So we are now held hostage \nfor some 60 percent of our consumption by a foreign interest. Or we are \nheld hostage by an environmental lawsuit that denies access. Or we are \nheld hostage by the bickering of States who cannot agree that a \ntransmission line ought to cross their territory.\n  Those are the realities of where we are today. We are going to tell \nthe American farmers they are going to pay 30 percent more this year \nthan they thought for input costs to produce their grains. But who is \ngoing to pay for it? The farmer can't. He is hardly breaking even. But \nthe politician in the Senate has created the environment for that 30-\npercent increase in production costs. It is not the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, not this Senator who for 5 years has worked to build \na comprehensive energy policy, but those who have decided they must \nhave a small piece their way, and their way denies the American \nconsumer the reality of energy.\n  So the average household--if you are wealthy, my goodness, $300 or \n$400 more in costs; 5 percent of your income this year will go to \nenergy. But if you are making $29,000 a year, 20 percent of your income \nwill go to energy. If you are making $10,000 a year as an American, 40 \npercent of your income will go to energy.\n  So let's not stand here and debate the small stuff. Let's say to the \nAmerican consumer what is an honest statement, that the Senate has not \nbeen able to settle on the establishment of a national energy policy \nthat would, had it been implemented, begin to hold down costs and bring \nproduction up and bring conservation up and improve the environment and \ndo the very thing that quality energy has always done to the American \neconomy and for the American worker: allowed them to be the most \nproductive, most competitive of any economy and any workforce in the \nworld.\n  But today that is less the case. Today, the petrochemical industry \nshuts down and goes offshore because they can't afford to produce in \nthis country. Today, in lieu of natural gas we are going to establish \nports and liquefy somebody else's gas and bring it here on a ship. \nShame on us for that silly attitude that the American politician has \ndeveloped.\n  Does he or she think the American consumer is going to roll over? I \ndon't think so. I think that consumer grows angrier by the day; when \nthey go to the gas pump, weekly, and all of a sudden it is not $1.50 \nfor regular, it is $1.65, $1.75, $1.80. Last week it hit an all-time \nhigh. This week it will hit another all-time high. If you are out in \nCalifornia, you pay $2.50. If you are in Idaho, you are paying $2.00 \nfor regular gas.\n  Now let's talk about the House. Let's talk about our inability to get \nout to western gasfields. Let's talk about the unwillingness to bring \ndown gas out of Alaska. What have we done? Through the Clean Air Act we \nsaid the only way you can meet air shed standards is to generate \nelectricity by the use of natural gas. We saw those turbines begin to \ngo in place over the last good number of years when it was $2.30 a \nmillion cubic feet. Now it is $5, now it is $6, and those turbines are \nshut down.\n\n  Shame on us, and I do mean Senators. I do mean this procedure. I do \nmean this false process.\n  Is there cynicism afoot? You know, there ought to be. The American \nconsumer ought to grow progressively cynical--become the cynic, I \nshould say, of the process that denies them reasonable high-quality \nenergy.\n  To the American producer, to the American farmer, to my farmers in \nIdaho--I know they are calling me. I hear them. They are frustrated and \nthey are angry. They have a right to be. We will play this political \ngame. I must tell you, shame on us because we cannot get it right and \nthe vote today on the Daschle amendment will not get it right.\n  Tragically enough, the vote today on the alternative that I and \nothers have worked on collectively in a bipartisan way will not be \nallowed to get it right.\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\n  If we fail, and if we go into the fall and gas prices keep ticking up \nand somebody over in the Middle East says, Got them where we want them, \nlet's crank, I must say the American consumer has a right to grow angry \nand a right to be frustrated because their political process--and those \nof us who have been invested with the responsibility of making it \nwork--have denied them reasonable, high-quality energy of the kind they \nought to expect. Now they better start demanding it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hope we can get cloture in a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, who controls time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader controls the time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That was my understanding. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 24 minutes 30 seconds on your side, \n11 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time will the Senator from Oregon require?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Five minutes will be plenty, if that is acceptable to the \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I hope we can yield back as much time as possible to \naccommodate the votes as quickly as possible, but I am happy to yield \nto the Senator from Oregon 5 minutes and the Senator from Delaware 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. We have had 3 full \ndays of debate on the Internet tax question. I am hopeful we will be \nable to get cloture on the McCain substitute.\n  If the Alexander proposal, the alternative, is accepted, all across \nthis country folks who now get a message that says ``You've got mail,'' \nwill get a message that says ``You have special taxes.''\n  What Senator Allen and I have done over the last 3 days on the floor \nof the Senate is outline, under the Alexander proposal, the scores and \nscores of local jurisdictions that would be able to impose these \nspecial taxes on electronic commerce.\n\n  Over the last 7 years, we have heard these State and local \nprojections by governmental bodies about how revenue would be lost. In \neach instance, colleagues, they have not come to pass. In 1997, for \nexample, the National Governors Association said that our Internet tax \nfreedom bill would cause the virtual collapse of the State and local \nrevenue system. That next year revenue went up $7 billion.\n  All we are trying to do in the McCain compromise, and it is, in fact, \na compromise--Senator Allen and I have sought a permanent ban on \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. We are \ncompromising now so that it is a 4-year proposal. We have made it clear \nto the other side regarding telephone calls made over the Internet, the \nway in which those are handled and taxed would not be changed. So this \nis a compromise proposal.\n  We have had 3 days of debate. It doesn't involve sales taxes or \nproperty taxes or utility taxes or any other kinds of taxes. This is a \nquestion of whether there ought to be double taxation on something \nfolks have already paid for, and that is Internet access. I hope we \nwill be able to invoke cloture on the McCain substitute and be able to \ngo on with the amendment process. We have had 3 full days of debate. I \ncompared it to prolonged root canal work because I know this is not \ninherently the most fascinating subject. I hope today we can invoke \ncloture on the McCain substitute and get about the task of amending and \npassing the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Before I yield additional time, I know Senator Carper \nwanted 5 minutes, and I will yield to our distinguished manager, the \nSenator from North Dakota, 5 minutes. But I want to be sure people \nunderstand there will be three votes, regardless of the outcome of \nthese votes. There will be a vote on the Daschle amendment; there will \nbe a vote on cloture on the energy amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico; and there will be a vote on McCain, a cloture vote on \nthe McCain substitute, the amendment pending. There will be three \ncloture votes.\n  I know there was some question as to whether there would be a vote, \ngiven how the amendments may be resolved. The votes will be cast \nregardless.\n  I yield the floor to accommodate the requests made by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the question here today is not whether we \nwant to tax people's access to the Internet. We don't. None of us want \nto do that. That is not the issue.\n  The question is, are we going to say to State and local governments \nthat have collected a portion of their taxes for years from \ntelecommunications, from telephone services, are we going to take away \ntheir ability to do that? We are going to reduce their ability to do \nthat? We are going to reduce their revenue base but at the same time, \nwhatever shortfall they realize, we are not going to make up for it?\n  Ever since the time of Alexander Graham Bell, State and local \ngovernments have been collecting taxes on traditional telephone \nservices. What is at issue here is whether we are going to empty the \nState and local treasuries to the tune of as much as $20 billion in the \nyears ahead, at a time when they are facing the greatest fiscal crisis \nthey have faced since World War II.\n  Are we going to empty the treasury of California by another $836 \nmillion? It is already empty. Do we want to empty the treasury of the \nState of Connecticut by some $170 million, or $265 million out of \nKentucky's treasury, or $110 million out of Louisiana's Treasury, or \n$225 million out of Massachusetts' treasury, or $360 million out of \nMichigan's treasury, or $285 million out of Minnesota's treasury, or \n$600 million out of New Jersey's treasury, or $370 million out of North \nCarolina's treasury, or $358 million out of Tennessee's treasury, or \n$200 million out of Wisconsin's treasury? The list goes on.\n  I have said on the Senate floor before and I will say it again: If we \nwant to do something good for the telecommunications industry--I do, \nand I am supportive of a number of other initiatives for the industry--\nif we are supportive of tax credits or allowing companies to expense \ntheir investments, we should pay for it as Federal legislators. It is \nwrong for us to say we are going to give a break to the \ntelecommunications industry, or any other industry, and say not only \nare we not going to pay for it, but we will tell the State and local \ngovernments they have to pay for it. In my view, that is wrong. That is \nnot treating other people the way we want to be treated, and it is \nsomething we shouldn't countenance today.\n  We are going to vote on cloture in a short while with respect to the \nMcCain amendment. Let me say this: There is a reasonable compromise \nbetween where Senator Alexander and I stand and where Senator McCain \nstands. There is a reasonable compromise. We will get to that \ncompromise with a ``no'' vote on cloture. I am convinced that we will \nget it.\n  I stood here last week and urged people to vote no on the cloture on \nthe Frist bill on asbestos. I said if we do it, we will create a \ndynamic where real compromise and consensus can be built around \nasbestos--a very difficult issue. We voted no on cloture, and as we \ngather here right now, over in SH-216 in Hart there are serious \nmeetings going on to get us to a real settlement on asbestos.\n  We need real negotiation. A ``no'' vote on cloture on McCain does not \nend prospects for consensus, but it actually creates it. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a brief comment in response to \nthe comments of my colleague from Idaho.\n  He is quite correct. We have an urgent situation with respect to \nenergy. We have two subjects at this point. One is the underlying bill, \nthe Internet tax bill, and the other represents amendments offered by \nmy colleague, Senator Daschle, and an amendment offered by Senator \nDomenici. I intend to support cloture with respect to both of these \ninitiatives.\n  I want to respond to my colleague from Idaho who says, Shame on us, \nthis is false procedure, it is politics, and\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nsomeone is trying to take over the floor of the Senate, and so on.\n  If we believe that we have an urgent need to pass an energy bill--\nincidentally, I was one of those who supported an energy bill when it \ncame to the Senate floor, and it lost by two votes--if there is a time \nand place to do that, we are going to have a cloture vote. I suggest \nwith respect to his suggestion about anger, hold your anger for a \ncouple of hours until we see how we vote on cloture. If we want to \ndebate energy, let us do that. I am in favor of debating energy. I am \nalso in favor of concluding the bill dealing with Internet taxation.\n  Also, my colleague, Senator Carper, said that he is not in support of \ntaxing access to the Internet. I am not, either. I have previously \nsupported a moratorium on taxation. I hope before this process is over, \nI will be able to support this. But we are dealing with two different \nsubjects.\n  My colleague from Idaho just described the subject of energy. My \npoint on energy is very simple: There is a way to deal with energy \nsooner rather than later. The way to do that is vote for cloture in the \nnext half hour or so, which I intend to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and then yield the remainder of my time. I understand \nthe Senator from North Dakota is going to yield the remainder of his \ntime also; is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds before then.\n  I commend to my colleagues this morning the Washington Post editorial \nentitled ``Energy Follies.'' I quote:\n\n       It would make far more sense for Senators who are \n     interested in some aspect of this legislation--whether \n     ethanol or electricity regulation or renewable fuels--to \n     design bills around those issues and vote on them separately, \n     judging each by its own merits. But that would be too \n     rational for this Senate, which almost seems to prefer doing \n     things sideways.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record, \nand I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 29, 2004]\n\n                             Energy Follies\n\n       The Senate's machinations over the energy bill this week \n     seem to prove the existence of a link between overly complex \n     parliamentary procedures and bad law. The original energy \n     bill, as readers will remember, failed to pass last November, \n     and for good reason. Its size, price and expensive perks for \n     industry became too much even for a majority of senators. \n     Since then, Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) and the Senate \n     leadership have been looking for another way to pass it, or \n     at least most of it. They've now found a place: The bill, \n     which in its ``slimmed-down'' version numbers more than 900 \n     pages, has been attached as an amendment to a bill on \n     Internet tax law.\n       True, the idea of using an Internet tax bill to pass a law \n     on energy was not original to Mr. Domenici. He proposed his \n     ``amendment'' only after the Senator minority leader, Thomas \n     A. Daschle (D-S.D.), proposed another ``amendment''--one \n     promoting the use of ethanol, a piece of pork much beloved by \n     members of Congress representing corn-producing states.\n       After Mr. Daschle's proposal, Republicans first condemned \n     the Democratic leader for attaching a ``non-germane'' \n     proposal to the Internet bill--and then decided not to beat \n     him but to join him. There are various other layers of \n     complication, but the probable result will be a messy series \n     of votes today, after which both amendments will fail. If \n     that doesn't happen, and if Mr. Domenici's amendment gets a \n     full vote, the Senate could find itself grappling with a \n     large, complicated piece of law stuck to another piece of \n     law, which would then become tangled further in conference \n     with the House. We can only hope the Senate will be wise \n     enough to avoid such an outcome.\n       It would make far more sense for senators who are \n     interested in some aspect of this legislation--whether \n     ethanol or electricity regulation or renewable fuels--to \n     design bills around those issues and vote on them separately, \n     judging each by its own merits. But that would be too \n     rational for this Senate, which seems almost to prefer doing \n     things sideways.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I note that the Washington Post is \nrecommending support for the Alexander- Carper version of the \nlegislation. This is not about taxes. This is not about the Internet. \nThis is about Senators and Congressmen coming to Washington, passing an \nexpensive idea, and sending the bill home to State and local \ngovernments.\n  I am voting against cloture on the McCain proposal and against \ncutting off debate because this legislation breaks our promise to State \nand local government.\n  In 1994, 300 Republicans stood on the Capitol steps and said: No \nmoney, no mandate; break our promise, throw us out. In 1995, the \nRepublican majority passed the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. There are \n62 Senators serving in this body today who voted for that.\n  This legislation breaks our promise in a big way. The Congressional \nBudget Office tells us it is an unfunded mandate. The National League \nof Cities says it is a nightmare. The National Governors Association \nsays it can cost States up to $18 billion a year because of language in \nthe proposal. The commissioner of revenue from the State of Tennessee \nsays in a letter dated yesterday, to put it in dollar terms, Tennessee \nwould lose $350 million a year, up to about 5 percent of the States \nbudget.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those three documents printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               State of Tennessee,\n\n\n                                        Department of Revenue,\n\n                                    Nashville, TN, April 28, 2004.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: We were asked by your office to \n     evaluate the impact of the ``McCain Compromise'' bill to \n     preempt certain state and local taxes on Internet access and \n     related services. After reviewing the McCain Compromise \n     language, it is our conclusion that the proposed compromise \n     does nothing to mitigate the adverse impact that S. 150 would \n     reap on our state revenue structure. To put this in dollar \n     terms, we believe Tennessee would lose approximately $350 \n     million annually in revenue. This loss would increase as \n     additional services migrate to the Internet. Given that \n     Tennessee imposes a broad levy on telecommunications \n     services, we believe that the majority of sales taxes \n     collected on this levy are at stake. This loss does not \n     include services which may be bundled with the sale of \n     Internet access.\n\n\n            how the mccain compromise reduces state revenues\n\n       First, the proposed language does not do anything to \n     correct the fundamental problems that exist in the definition \n     of Internet access. One aspect of the proposed changes in the \n     McCain Compromise continues to perpetuate the unfunded \n     mandate on states that prevents states from taxing \n     telecommunications ``to the extent such services are \n     purchased, used, or sold by a provider of Internet access to \n     provide Internet access.''\n       This has the effect of exempting telecommunication services \n     that makeup the Internet backbone, the ``middle mile'' \n     telecommunications used by Internet Service Providers to \n     provide internet access, and the ``last mile'' \n     telecommunications services used to connect an end user to \n     the Internet. The Alexander-Carper bill provided a much more \n     limited preemption for the ``last mile'' telecommunications \n     services used to connect the consumer to the Internet.\n       While the sale of Internet access to the consumer is no \n     longer subject to sales tax in Tennessee, the state does \n     impose tax on all telecommunications services used in \n     connection with providing or receiving Internet access. This \n     tax would be eliminated under S150 or the McCain Compromise.\n       Second Tennessee is deeply concerned that the term Internet \n     access is defined to ``include access to proprietary content, \n     information, and other services that are a part of a package \n     of services offered to users.'' As long distance services and \n     other services are increasingly bundled with Internet access, \n     we are concerned that these telecommunications services \n     become subject to the preemption pursuant to this broad \n     language.\n       Third, the VOIP exception to the moratorium actually does \n     nothing for the states' abilities to tax that or similar \n     services that may migrate to the Internet. Current Tennessee \n     law allows the state and local governments to tax VOIP as a \n     telecommunications service, as long as there is no federal \n     preemption. The McCain ``exception'' to the federal \n     preemption does not apply to voice services that are a \n     package of services offered with Internet access, and since \n     that is how VOIP services are currently sold and probably \n     will continue to be sold, the exception is the McCain bill in \n     fact provides no protection against states losing revenue as \n     phone services migrates to VOIP.\n       To summarize, Tennessee continues to support the provisions \n     of S. 2084 or a straight 2 year extension of the original \n     moratorium.\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\n       If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to \n     call (615) 741-2461 my office of the Tennessee Department of \n     Revenue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Loren L. Chumley,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   NGA Supports Reasonable Extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n       The National Governors Association (NGA) supports extending \n     the federal ban on state and local taxation of Internet \n     access in a manner that is technology neutral and fiscally \n     fair to state and local governments. Unfortunately, two \n     pieces of legislation currently moving through Congress \n     violate these basic principles. The House of Representatives \n     has already passed H.R. 49 and S. 150 is currently under \n     consideration in the Senate. By permanently expanding the \n     definition of tax-free Internet access, both bills rob state \n     and local governments of existing revenues while creating a \n     tax free zone for future communications services.\n       The NGA calls upon Congress to adopt S. 2084, the \n     ``Internet Tax Ban Extension and Improvement Act.'' This \n     compromise bill, sponsored by Senators Alexander and Carper, \n     offers a reasonable extension of the moratorium while \n     addressing industry concerns for technological neutrality \n     without unduly burdening state and local governments.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Although the U.S. Constitution grants Congress broad \n     authority to regulate interstate commerce, the federal \n     government, historically, has been reluctant to interfere \n     with states' ability to raise and regulate its own revenues. \n     State tax sovereignty is a basic tenet of the federalist \n     system and is fundamental to the inherent political \n     independence and viability of states. Only in the most \n     narrowly defined exceptions has Congress crossed that line.\n       The 1998 ``Internet Tax Freedom Act'' (ITFA), which imposed \n     a moratorium on state or local taxation of Internet access, \n     is one exception to this long held practice. The ITFA expired \n     briefly in 2000 but Congress renewed it through November 1, \n     2003. Designed to ``jump start'' the then-fledgling Internet \n     industry, the moratorium included three important \n     restrictions to protect states:\n       (1) It applied only to new taxes--existing taxes were \n     grandfathered;\n       (2) The definition of Internet access, while broad, \n     excluded telecommunication services; and\n       (3) The bill expired after two years to allow Congress, \n     states and industry the opportunity to make adjustments for \n     rapidly developing technologies and markets.\n\n\n                            the nga position\n\n       Today, over 130 million Americans access the Internet using \n     everything from dial-up modems, high-speed broadband, and \n     Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) offerings to wireless \n     technologies and even satellite and power line connections. \n     The Internet's broad reach and technological promise is also \n     transforming entire industries such as telecommunications, \n     which is rapidly migrating all of its services to Internet \n     based technologies and rolling out new services such as Voice \n     Over Internet Protocol (VOIP).\n       As Congress considers legislation to extend the moratorium, \n     NGA encourages members to adhere to the following guidelines \n     to maintain the balance struck by the original moratorium, a \n     balance that encouraged the growth of the Internet but still \n     respected state sovereignty:\n       1. Do no harm--Any extension of the moratorium should \n     preserve existing state and local revenues.\n       The original moratorium protected existing state revenues \n     by grandfathering tax laws in place before 1998 and \n     prohibiting only new taxes on Internet access. In contrast, \n     H.R. 49 and S. 150 would cost states much needed revenue by \n     repealing the grandfather clause and expanding the law to \n     prohibit taxes on telecommunications ``used to provide \n     Internet access.'' Stating that the proposed bills would \n     trigger a possible point-of-order under the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates \n     removing the grandfather provision would cost states between \n     $80 and $120 million annually. The effect of the second \n     provision could be even greater. ``[D]epending on how the \n     language altering the definition of what telecommunications \n     services are taxable is interpreted,'' the CBO said, ``that \n     language also could result in substantial revenue losses for \n     states.'' With state and local governments collecting over \n     $18 billion in telecommunications taxes annually, any \n     significant change in the taxability of telecommunications \n     could cost states billions of dollars. At a time when state \n     and local governments are facing large increases in mandatory \n     spending and stagnant revenue growth, Congress should not \n     exacerbate state fiscal problems by interfering with the \n     collection of existing taxes.\n       2. Be clear--Definitions matter.\n       The original moratorium split the definition of Internet \n     access into two parts: a broad and inclusive description of \n     Internet access and an absolute exclusion of \n     telecommunications services from the moratorium. The \n     definition read: ``Internet access means a service that \n     enables users to access content, information, electronic \n     mail, or other services offered over the Internet, and may \n     also include access to proprietary content, information, and \n     other services as part of a package of services offered to \n     users. Such term does not include telecommunications \n     services.''\n       The exclusion of telecommunications services protected \n     states by clarifying that Internet access was a separate, \n     distinct and limited service. It also clearly preserved \n     existing state and local taxes on telecommunications services \n     that amounted to over $18 billion in 1999. The definition, \n     however, allowed some jurisdictions t4o tax the \n     telecommunications component of certain broadband \n     technologies like DSL while others remained tax-free. This \n     perceived inequity led to a push to alter the definition of \n     Internet access in H.R. 49 and S. 150 to make tax free \n     telecommunications services ``used to provide Internet \n     access,'' as a means of making the ITFA technology neutral. \n     This change, however, is too broad. Not only would it \n     prohibit taxes states and localities are collecting on DSL, \n     it would also exempt all telecommunications services used \n     anywhere along the Internet--from the end-user all the way to \n     and including the ``backbone.'' Compared to the original \n     moratorium, which expressly exempted telecommunications from \n     its scope, H.R. 49 and S. 150 could ultimately put at risk \n     most, if not all, state and local telecommunication tax \n     revenue. (See below.)\n       H.R. 49 and S. 150 would also intensify a long-standing \n     problem with the original definition: the unlimited ability \n     to bundle together content and ``other services'' into a \n     single offering of tax-free Internet access. Services such as \n     VOIP highlight the risk states face from this broad \n     definition. Unlike traditional telecommunications services, \n     VOIP uses the Internet to transmit voice communications \n     between computers, phones and other communications devices. \n     Industry observers expect 40 percent of all telephone calls \n     in the United Sates to be Internet based within five \n     years. If VOIP is allowed to be bundled with Internet \n     access into a single tax-free offering, and \n     telecommunications used to deliver that offering are also \n     tax free, states could quickly see their \n     telecommunications tax base erode to nothing. Language in \n     S. 150 as amended and S. 2084 that requires service \n     providers to unbundled taxable services from non-taxable \n     Internet access is helpful, but only if the universe of \n     what constitutes Internet access is actually limited.\n       3. Stay flexible--A temporary solution is better than \n     permanent confusion.\n       Rapid pace innovation in the Internet and \n     telecommunications industries makes it difficult to define \n     accurately these complex and ever-changing services. The \n     original moratorium was made temporary in part for this \n     reason--to provide Congress, industry and state and local \n     governments with the ability to revisit the issue and make \n     adjustments where necessary to accommodate new technologies \n     and market realities. The fact that the courts, the Federal \n     Communications Commission and Congress are all in the process \n     of examining and redefining the core elements of what \n     constitutes telecommunications and Internet access \n     underscores the need for caution. With so much uncertainty, a \n     temporary extension of the moratorium is the best way to \n     avoid unintended consequences from a permanent moratorium.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       NGA supports S. 2084 because it best reflects a balance \n     between state sovereignty and federal support for the \n     Internet. First, it protects states by drawing a line in the \n     sand to prohibit new taxes on Internet without interfering \n     with existing state taxes. Second, by making the connection \n     from a consumer to their Internet access provider tax free, \n     the Alexander-Carper bill actually levels the playing field \n     for competing technologies without overreaching. Third, it \n     gives Congress, industry and states a chance to revisit the \n     Act by making the moratorium expire after two years. For \n     these reasons NGA supports S. 2084 as a true compromise that \n     is fair to industry, respectful of states, and good for \n     consumers.\n\n STATE AND LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAXES

   ____\n      Alexander-Carper Internet Tax Bill Protects Local Authority\n\n       Washington.--The following is an opinion-editorial by the \n     National League of Cities that will appear in the Nation's \n     Cities Weekly Monday April 26:\n       This coming week, Congress will consider two vastly \n     different approaches to local revenue authority in the area \n     of Internet taxes. One is an important step forward in the \n     right direction. The other would be a nightmare for America's \n     cities, towns and consumers.\n       The stakes in this issue are enormous and far-reaching.\n       The step in the right direction is offered by Sen. Lamar \n     Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.) Their \n     bill, the Internet Access Tax Ban Extension and Improvement \n     Act (S. 2084), would preserve local authority to collect \n     existing, legally due taxes and it would help clarify \n     Internet tax issues. The National League of Cities supports \n     the Alexander-Carper bill.\n       The wrong approach is the ``Internet Tax Non-Discrimination \n     Act'' (S. 150), which would strip away local authority to \n     collect vital revenue and would cost America's cities and \n     towns billions of dollars in lost revenue.\n       S. 150 would deny local authority to collect a range of \n     legally due taxes and threaten as much as $9 billion in local \n     revenue that funds police officers, teachers and other \n     essential local services and infrastructure in cities and \n     towns across America.\n       By redefining ``Internet access,'' this bill would squash \n     local and state authority to collect current gross receipts \n     taxes, right-of-way fees, and other existing taxes on \n     telecommunications services.\n       Not only would the bill trample local revenue authority, it \n     dishes out a multi-billion tax break to the \n     telecommunications industry--at the expenses of local and \n     state taxpayers, small businesses and working families.\n       The net impact of S. 150? Lost revenues, cuts to services \n     and additional fiscal burdens for local governments.\n       The National League of Cities strongly opposes S. 150 and \n     urges you to let your members of Congress know that the bill \n     is bad news. The bill is likely to come up for consideration \n     on the Senate floor for debate early this week.\n       The right approach is the Alexander-Carper bill, S. 2084, \n     which will be offered as a substitute for S. 150.\n       The Alexander-Carper bill defines Internet access in a way \n     that preserves the ability of local and state governments to \n     continue to collect telecommunications taxes and franchise \n     fees. Their bill would create parity among all types of \n     Internet platforms, whether phone lines, cable modems or \n     digital subscriber lines (DSL).\n       Let's be clear. Our position has never been an attempt to \n     tax e-mail or impose new taxes on the Internet. Instead, we \n     are simply insisting that local revenue authority for \n     America's cities and towns not be eroded by an unnecessary \n     law that siphons money out of local coffers and pumps it \n     directly into the telecommunications industry.\n       On the important issue of protecting local revenue streams \n     to support essential public services, the Alexander-Carper \n     bill is the best solution for America's cities, towns and \n     consumers.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this proposal violates the Budget Act. \nIt breaks our promise. While it has distinguished support among my \ncolleagues, it is a political trick because it means lower taxes here \nand higher taxes there.\n  I suggest that my colleagues might go home and ask legislators and \nmayors whether they plan to fire teachers or raise local property \ntaxes, whether they plan to raise college tuition or raise their \nState's tax on food, or whether they plan to let prisoners out of jail \nor put in a new State income tax.\n  This legislation has the wrong name. It at least has an incomplete \nname. It ought to be called the ``Higher Local Property Tax Act of \n2004'' or the ``Higher State Income Tax Law of 2004'' because that is \ninevitably what would happen. This does not have to happen this way. \nThere is a better way.\n  I support a 2-year ban on State and local taxation of the Internet. I \nhave suggested four ways to fix the McCain substitute. I would take the \nTexas law that President Bush passed in 1999 and make it permanent, \ngiving everybody up to a $25 credit on their tax.\n  We need to continue this debate. We need a comprehensive review. The \nindustry doesn't need a subsidy. My hope is that Congress will continue \nto debate and decide if it intends to give an additional subsidy to the \nhigh-speed Internet access business that we in Congress pay the bill \nwith Federal dollars rather than sending the bill back to State and \nlocal governments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the second and third votes and that the votes be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the time of the minority.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle \n     amendment No. 3050 to S.150:\n         Thomas Daschle, Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, Kent Conrad, \n           Byron L.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \ncloture on the Domenici amendment. It has really no business on an \nInternet tax bill. We all know that. I read again from the Washington \nPost of this morning:\n\n       It would make far more sense for Senators who are \n     interested in some aspect of this legislation, whether \n     ethanol or electricity regulation or renewable fuels, to \n     design bills around those issues and vote on them separately, \n     judging each by its own merits. But that would be too \n     rational for this Senate which seems almost to prefer doing \n     things sideways.\n\n  There is no need for this legislation on the bill. It has no place on \nit. I can assure my colleagues it would be dropped in conference if it \nwere adopted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield my time to Senator Craig.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is absolutely \nright. Energy should not be on an Internet tax bill. But if you want to \nvote for energy this year, if you want to go home to your consumers and \nsay: I voted for a comprehensive energy bill, this may be the last \nchance you will have. The reality is, if you vote for cloture on \nDomenici and then you vote for cloture on McCain, Domenici falls. So \nweigh it out. Weigh the odds. What do you want to go home and tell the \nconsumer, who today is paying the highest price for energy in the \nhistory of this country? The reason they are paying it is because we \ncan't produce a bill and change our policies.\n  We have an option. It is quite simple. We can vote for energy by \nvoting for cloture. Then we can vote for McCain, because he is right, \nit should not be here. Domenici will fall. Then we get to where we \nought to be today on an Internet tax bill. We didn't do this. Somebody \nelse did this and fouled the process. Now let's clear it up. Clean it \nup. Vote for energy, vote for cloture.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I want to express my serious \nconcern with the content of the amendment offered by Senator Domenici. \nThis amendment differs even from the surprise energy bill that was \nintroduced on February 12, 2004, and placed directly on the Senate's \ncalendar.\n  Senators should make no mistake, this legislation is not the product \nof bipartisan consensus in the Senate committees of jurisdiction. In \nmost respects, this amendment is the energy bill conference report we \nhave already defeated. And most importantly, it is not the right energy \npolicy for America.\n  I agree with Senator Daschle that we should try to reach consensus on \ntargeted pieces of energy legislation. We could pass legislation on \nissues such as renewable motor fuels, as Senator Daschle has proposed \nwith his amendment. We could enact fiscally responsible extensions of \nneeded energy tax provisions, such as the wind energy tax credit. \nNational electricity reliability standards are another area in which \nSenator Cantwell and I believe there could be agreement and we could \npass a bill.\n  But there should be no agreement on the poor environment policy that \nis contained in this amendment. The Senate should reject this \namendment, and oppose cloture.\n  As with the energy bill conference report, nearly a hundred sections \nof this amendment are in the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We were not consulted on any of these provisions, and \nI have repeatedly raised concerns about them on the Senate floor.\n  This amendment does not represent the kind of forward-looking \nbalanced energy policy that our Nation needs. The Senate should be able \nto ensure that our constituents have reliable electric power without \npolluting their drinking water. Our constituents deserve cleaner \ngasoline without requiring them to breath dirtier air. We should be \nable to promote renewable energy without waiving environmental laws.\n  This amendment seriously harms the environment. The supporters have \nsaid that a waiver of liability for MTBE producers is not contained in \nthis amendment. That does not make the motor fuels provisions good or \nworkable public policy. Though we know MTBE is environmentally harmful, \nthe amendment would allow this product to be used for 10 more years \nbefore we pull it off of the market. In addition, the amendment allows \nthe President to overturn the MTBE ban prior to June 30, 2014, and \ncontinue its use indefinitely.\n  The amendment unravels the ozone designation process in the Clean Air \nAct by delaying compliance with the national health-based air quality \nozone standards until the air in the dirtiest city is cleaned up. \nNeither the Senate nor the House of Representatives has ever considered \nthis damaging provision. It is a leftover from the failed energy bill \nconference report.\n  Changing cities' ozone compliance deadlines under the Clean Air Act \ndoesn't increase our Nation's energy supplies. Exposing the public to \ncontinued levels of harmful dangerous air pollution emissions for far \nmore time than allowed under existing law guarantees thousands of more \nasthma attacks, more hospital visits and more cases of respiratory \ndistress, disease and illness. Recently, the EPA announced that there \nare record numbers of Americans, more than 165 million, who are \nbreathing unhealthy air.\n  The change is also unfair to States that have worked hard to achieve \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act's health-based national standards. \nWhy should areas that have done little or nothing to reduce emissions \nbe given a free pass from halting local pollution? This amendment also \nprovides unprecedented relief for a single region of the country from \napplication of the entire Clean Air Act, without a hearing in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee or Senate consideration.\n  The amendment continues the administration's drive to greater \ndependency on old technologies and fuel systems. This focus will \nincrease greenhouse gas emissions and keep us on the wrong path that \nincreases the risks from global warming and climate change.\n  This amendment also continues to include language from the failed \nenergy bill that exempts oil and gas exploration and production \nactivities from the Clean Water Act stormwater program. The Clean Water \nAct requires permits for stormwater discharges associated with \nconstruction activity. The amendment changes the Act to provide a \nspecial exemption for oil and gas construction activities from \nstormwater pollution control requirements. The scope of the provision \nis extremely broad. Stormwater runoff typically contains pollutants \nsuch as oil and grease, chemicals, nutrients, metals, bacteria, and \nparticulates.\n  I have told colleagues this before but EPA estimates that this change \nwould exempt at least 30,000 small oil and gas sites from clean water \nrequirements. In addition, every construction site in the oil and gas \nindustry larger than 5 acres\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nwould be exempt as well. The large sites have held permits for 10 years \nor more. That is a terrible rollback of current law. I want Senators to \nimagine trying to explain to constituents why an oil drilling site that \nhad to comply with the Clean Water Act for 10 years suddenly no longer \nneeds to do so.\n  So let's review the contents of this amendment. This amendment \npollutes our surface and groundwater by exempting oil and gas \ndevelopment from provisions of the Clean Water Act. It pollutes our \ndrinking water by allowing MTBE to seep into our public and private \ndrinking water systems for 10 more years. The amendment pollutes our \nland by accelerating development of energy installations on public \nlands, including parks, wildlife refuges, and sensitive areas. And this \namendment pollutes our air in many different ways. It extends pollution \ncompliance deadlines and continues to avoid serious progress in \ncleaning up our air.\n  There are too many serious problems with this amendment. We should \nnot invoke cloture on it. The American people do not want energy \nsecurity at the expense of the environmental quality. We should be \npassing the pieces of the energy bill where we can reach agreement to \ndo so, like those issues I outlined.\n  We should not be rushing to pass legislation with such serious \nconsequences. This is an aggressive, overreaching amendment, and it is \ndeeply flawed. I will vote against cloture, and other Senators should \nas well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment incorporates a whole energy \nbill. It has many provisions that are deeply flawed. But we are voting \non whether to end debate on a complicated, flawed energy bill before \ndebate has even begun, making it very difficult to correct those flaws.\n  The Senate passed a comprehensive and balanced energy bill in July \n2003. Then, after weeks of closed-door meetings with virtually no input \nfrom Democratic conferees, the Republicans put forward a ``take it or \nleave it'' energy conference report that was drastically different than \nthe bill that the Senate passed. I voted against cloture on the \nconference report in November 2003 because it was deeply flawed and had \nbeen produced by a flawed process. The Domenici amendment, the energy \nbill, which is before the Senate today, suffers from that same problem. \nThere are simply too many provisions on the negative side of the ledger \nfor me to support it, and because this is a cloture vote, voting yes \nwould make it difficult to consider amendments.\n  At a time when crude oil prices are at 13-year highs, gasoline prices \nare reaching new record highs daily, diesel prices are breaking \nrecords, and high jet fuel prices are straining our airline industry, \nthe Senate should be considering legislation that would do something to \nlower oil prices. The bill however, would push oil, gasoline, diesel, \nand jet fuel prices even higher by directing the Department of Energy, \nDOE, to ``as expeditiously as practicable acquire petroleum in amounts \nsufficient to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the [1 billion] \nbarrel capacity.'' By directing DOE to take tens of millions of barrels \nof oil off the market at a time when supplies are tight and prices \nhigh--as they have been for the past 2 years--this bill would tighten \nsupplies in the commercial inventories even further, drive oil and \ngasoline prices even higher, and keep private sector inventories from \nbuilding back to normal levels.\n  The bill would fill the SPR in a manner that is inconsistent with two \nrecent amendments adopted by the Senate. Last fall, the Senate \nunanimously approved an amendment that Senator Collins and I offered to \nthe Interior Appropriations bill, directing DOE to develop procedures \nto minimize the cost to the taxpayer and maximize the overall supply of \noil in the United States when acquiring oil for the SPR. This amendment \nexpressed the sense of the Senate that the DOE's current procedures for \nfilling the SPR have raised oil prices, are too costly for the \ntaxpayers, and have not improved our overall energy security. \nUnfortunately, this amendment was not included in the Interior \nAppropriations conference report, and the administration has continued \nto fill the SPR without regard to the price or supply of oil. This is a \nsignificant reason oil and gasoline prices are so high today.\n  In light of the continuing rise in oil and gasoline prices, and the \nadministration's refusal to suspend SPR shipments, the Senate approved \nan amendment that Senator Collins and I offered last month to the \nbudget resolution for FY 2005. Our amendment would cancel the planned \ndelivery of 50 million barrels of oil to the SPR from now through \nsometime in 2005 that would have completed the filling of the reserve. \nThe SPR is 93 percent filled already. Our amendment is being considered \nin the House-Senate conference on the budget resolution.\n  By directing the DOE to fill the SPR to 1 billion barrels--300 \nmillion barrels above its current capacity of 700 million barrels--the \nbill before the Senate today would worsen a SPR policy that is 180 \ndegrees opposite from the direction the Senate just approved in the \nSenate budget resolution.\n  By increasing deposits in a government reserve at a time when \ncommercial supply is scarce and prices are high, oil companies will \nmeet the additional demand for crude oil for the reserve by removing \noil from their own inventories rather than purchasing high-priced oil \non the spot market. Since the price of oil is so closely tied to \ninventory levels, filling the SPR under these market conditions both \ndepletes private sector inventories and pushes up prices for America's \nconsumers.\n  Two years ago, the DOE's own staff explained this as follows: \n``Essentially, if the SPR inventory grows, and OPEC does not \naccommodate that growth by exporting more oil, the increase comes at \nthe expense of commercial inventories. Most analysts agree that oil \nprices are directly correlated with inventories, and a drop of 20 \nmillion barrels over a 6-month period can substantially increase \nprices.''\n  For these reasons, in 2002, DOE SPR staff recommended against buying \nmore oil for the SPR in tight markets. The administration chose to \nignore these warnings. SPR deliveries proceeded. As the DOE staff \npredicted, oil supplies tightened, private inventory levels fell, and \nprices climbed.\n  In summary, the direction in the bill to DOE to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve by another 300 million barrels, to a total level of 1 \nbillion barrels, is likely to increase the cost of crude oil and crude \noil products, such as gasoline, home heating oil, and diesel and jet \nfuel, to American consumers and businesses, with no benefits to our \nnational security.\n  The electricity provisions of the bill before us are also deeply \nflawed. Instead of improving our current situation, I believe they will \nmake it worse. The massive power failure of August 2003, on top of the \nmassive price manipulation perpetrated by Enron and others, provided \nadditional proof--proof that should not have been needed--that the \nUnited States' deregulated energy markets are not functioning well to \nsecure a supply of energy against interruption.\n  The bill before us--the Domenici amendment--would repeal the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 1934, PUHCA, long-standing consumer and \ninvestor protection legislation governing energy industry structure and \nconsolidation. With the repeal of PUHCA, the resulting provisions of \nthe bill before us fail to provide adequate protections to prevent \nindustry market manipulation and consumer abuses.\n  The Congress needs to enact mandatory reliability legislation, and \nwhile some provisions of the bill would be an improvement over the \ncurrent voluntary system of reliability standards, other provisions of \nthis bill would take us in the wrong direction and could, in fact, make \nthings worse. The bill fails to ensure that regional transmission \norganizations, RTOs, will have the authority to enforce electric \nreliability standards in order to prevent, or respond effectively to, \nanother blackout. Further, the ``participant funding'' provision of \nthis bill shifts the cost of building new electric transmission such \nthat transmission construction will be discouraged and utilities will \nbe encouraged not to participate in RTOs. There is a strong need for a \nstand-alone electricity reliability bill that sets mandatory standards, \nrequires utilities to join RTOs, and establishes consistent rules for \nenforcement of standards. But the bill before us today is not the right \nanswer.\n  Two provisions of the bill would significantly impede the ability of \nfederal\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nand state agencies to investigate and prosecute fraud and price \nmanipulation in energy markets. If adopted, section 1281 would impede \nstate and Federal authority, other than the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing in financial and \ncommodity markets. It would turn the CFTC into a gatekeeper for all \nother federal and state investigations into matters within CFTC-\nregulated markets, which would be an unprecedent intrusion into the \nenforcement of state and federal consumer protection laws.\n  Section 1282 would impose a higher, criminal standard, ``knowingly \nand willfully'', for filing false information and for improper phony \nround trip trading than exists under current law. The new round trip \ntrading provision is inconsistent with current law and the Cantwell \namendment that recently passed the Senate, which prohibited market \nmanipulation in electricity markets.\n  Manipulation is difficult to prove even under current law. By raising \nthe burden of proof, this provision will make it nearly impossible to \nprove illegal round trip trading or wash sales. Rather than weakening \nthe laws preventing fraud and manipulation in energy markets, the \nCongress should be strengthening these prohibitions.\n  Over the past several years, the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I previously chaired and on which I am now the \nranking minority member, has investigated how Enron, financial \ninstitutions, and others have manipulated financial energy markets and \nprices. The record we have established is clear and dramatic. \nStrengthened oversight and transparency are critical to the proper \nfunctioning of our energy and financial markets. The provisions in this \namendment will weaken our ability to ensure these markets are \nfunctioning properly.\n  There are some provisions of the bill before us that I support. The \namendment contains two provisions that appear on their face to \npartially address the unfair air quality restrictions placed on a \nnumber of Michigan counties. These provisions do not go far enough, \nhowever, to remedy the negative impacts that I have fought against for \nyears.\n  According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, would not be required to act on \nthe results of the demonstrations study that is required by the so-\ncalled Upton language included in this amendment. It also would not \nrelieve new major sources from state new source review regulations, and \nit would not release Southwest Michigan from Clean Air Act provisions \nthat mandate specific local reductions following completion of the \nstudy. Finally, it would not prevent Southwest Michigan nonattainment \nareas from classification bump-up if the area is unable to attain the \nstandard by the deadline.\n  The so-called Barton provisions contained in this amendment would \nhelp some for two Michigan counties, Cass and Muskegon, those are the \nonly two counties subject to transport that have been designated under \nSubpart 2 of Section 181 of the Clean Air Act. However, the help is \nmodest because it is workable only if those areas fail to meet the \nstandard by the deadline and the EPA decides to ``bump them up'' to a \nhigher classification.\n  We need to do more to prevent restrictions from being placed on areas \nthat are impacted by overwhelming transport. The potential consequences \nof a nonattainment designation are significant. I will continue to work \nwith the EPA and the Congress to ensure that the Clean Air Act \nprovisions are applied with common sense so that counties are not \nrequired to take costly actions for problems that are created downwind, \nwhich would be illogical and unfair.\n  The Senate has worked to create a national energy policy for years, \nbut the bill before us today is not the right answer. Even if we were \nto pass it today, it will get caught in a logjam between the House and \nSenate on energy policy that is centered on the issue of the fuel \nadditive methyltertiarybutylether, MTBE. The energy bill conference \nreport that I voted against in November contained a provision that \nwould exempt its producers from liability. In Michigan, it has been \nestimated that MTBE has contaminated groundwater around over 700 \nleaking underground storage tank sites. There are similar problems in \nmany other states.\n  The crux of the matter is that the Senate will not pass legislation \nthat includes the MTBE provision and the House will not pass \nlegislation without it. So we are in a logjam, and I believe that any \nlegislation that we pass will eventually come back to this body \ncontaining the MTBE liability exemption, which would then again be \nrejected.\n  We should continue work to complete a long-term, comprehensive energy \nplan that provides consumers with affordable and reliable energy, \nincreases domestic energy supplies in a responsible manner, invests in \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy sources and protects the \nenvironment and public health. But the bill before us today, offered to \nlegislation on a completely different matter, is not the right answer. \nNor is voting ``aye'' to end debate on an important bill like energy \nbefore the debate has begun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, under the rule we had a minute to \nrespond. Let me just say that I am disappointed that we didn't get \ncloture on the Daschle amendment. I am also troubled by the fact that \nwe find ourselves in this position to begin with. We should not be on \nthe Energy bill as an amendment to the Internet tax, but many of us \nhave been asking to have an energy bill scheduled now for some time for \ngood, open debate, given our failure to pass the conference report. \nThis is our only option. This does not in any way preclude a Senator \nfrom offering other energy amendments on the Internet tax bill. It \ndoesn't in any way undermine a Senator's right to be heard on an energy \ndebate.\n  If we move to cloture, we bring this bill to an opportunity that \notherwise we should have had, had the legislation been freestanding. So \nfar that has not happened. I hope Senators will support cloture so we \ncan move this energy legislation forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 3051, offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rules. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 74 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 55 and the nays are \n43. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion fails.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the next vote.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield my 1 minute to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nAllen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, Senator Wyden, \nmyself, and others who are in favor of Internet tax freedom, I \nrespectfully urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this amendment. \nWhat is at stake is whether 15- to 18-percent taxes will be imposed \nupon Internet access.\n  The Internet is a great invention for the advancement of ideas, of \ninformation, for commerce, for telemedicine, and for education. This \ncountry has been a leader in technology, although we are falling \nbehind, particularly in broadband. I ask my colleagues to vote for \ncloture.\n  There can be germane amendments but allow us to go forward. A vote \nfor cloture is a vote for freedom and opportunity for the American \npeople. Stand on the side of that principle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent to take 1 minute of leader time \nto respond.\n  Mr. President, I was 1 of those 74 Senators who voted for the motion \nto proceed. I want to see this bill completed. I would like to find a \nway to resolve the outstanding differences. I think that can happen.\n  We have now found ourselves in a position where cloture would deny \nSenators the opportunity to offer relevant amendments. They may not be \ngermane but they certainly are relevant. So I would vote against \ncloture in the hope that we can find a way to continue this debate and \nallow for the offering of amendments that are relevant. My hope is that \nat the end of the day we can reach a conclusion procedurally as well as \nsubstantively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to speak?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Did I not have 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the Senator from \nTennessee speaking for 1 minute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Tennessee \nbe allowed 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, since that would put two speakers on \nthat side, I ask unanimous consent that one other speaker on the other \nside be permitted 1 minute to speak.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am voting against cloture, against \ncutting off debate. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nVirginia have worked hard to make this a good amendment. I and my group \nof colleagues have been working on this issue. We are for a 2-year ban \non State and local taxation of Internet access but this does much more \nthan that. A vote against cloture, against cutting off the debate, is a \nvote to do no harm to State and local governments. It will allow us to \ncontinue the debate. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the debate \nsurrounding the Internet tax moratorium. I believe strongly we can and \nshould find a reasonable replacement for the expired 1998 moratorium on \ntaxation of internet access, a replacement that balances the fiscal \nneeds and rights of the States and the overwhelming national interest \nin fostering and growing the internet economy.\n  The McCain substitute is a solid, and I believe well intentioned, \nfirst step toward such a compromise. Its provision to extend the \nmoratorium for 4 years seems a reasonable solution to legislating about \nan industry that is rapidly changing. The McCain amendment's phasing \nout of the current grandfather provisions over 3 years seems a \nreasonable compromise with those who would end the grandfather \nprovisions immediately. The McCain amendment's provisions to exempt \n``voice over Internet'' services from the moratorium seem a reasonable \nanswer to the States' concerns that their undisputed right to tax the \ntelecommunications base be preserved.\n  In its general framework, the McCain substitute outlines the \nfoundation of a reasonable compromise to the highly contentious issue \nof taxation of internet access. Unfortunately, the Senate has only had \na few days to consider the highly technical and important details of \nthe McCain substitute. And there is legitimate and heated disagreement \nover exactly what the McCain substitute would do. This is exactly the \nsort of instance in which the Senate should take the time to debate, \nconsider, and amend where necessary to produce a true compromise that \nis truly workable. Invoking cloture today would cut off that very \nlegitimate and necessary process, and therefore I cannot support it.\n  But we need to keep working to reach a compromise on the tax \ntreatment of Internet access. As we struggle as a nation to address our \neroding manufacturing base, one answer is to make our Nation more \nattractive to Internet based companies and our companies more willing \nto employ new Internet-based technologies. This can't happen if States \ntax every new form of Internet-access technology.\n  That is why I am saddened by having to vote against cloture today. \nThis was an extremely difficult decision. I support many aspects of the \nMcCain legislation. However, as both sides continue to argue about the \npotential effects of the proposal, the bottom line is that we need more \ntime. We need more time to debate the best possible solution, the way \nto balance the needs of innovation versus the needs of the States.\n  I remain hopeful that the vote today is not the end, but rather the \nbeginning. That it is the beginning of a solution, of a compromise of \nwhich both sides can be proud. That is not out of reach, and I call on \nthe leaders to leave the McCain bill on the floor and let us continue \nto work on a compromise.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the managers' \namendment to S. 150, the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act. Although \nthe amendment is not perfect, I believe it will sufficiently protect \nconsumers from State attempts to embrace the Internet as a new platform \nfor taxation. Rather than increasing taxes on consumers, we should all \nwork to embrace the Internet for its potential as a critical source of \ninformation and services and as a tremendous new marketplace for all to \naccess, not just those that can afford to pay more taxes.\n  Of course, this vote takes place at a time when the economy is \nbeginning to rebound as a result of tax relief--not tax increases--and \nthe U.S. high-tech sector is getting its second wind, preparing to lead \nthe economy once again into a period of increased productivity and job \ngrowth. Let us not stifle this by giving a green light to taxing \ninnovation, to taxing Americans' access to the Internet.\n  There is no question that technology boosts U.S. economic output and \nmakes U.S. workers more productive, and that the U.S. high-tech sector \nis a leading force driving our recent economic growth. Between 1992 and \n2000, high tech companies created twice as many jobs as non-high \nprivate employers nationwide in the United States. Not to mention that \nthese jobs pay, on average, nearly twice as much as other private \nsector jobs.\n  Additionally, the Internet and technology have contributed \ndramatically to our expanding knowledge base, bringing opportunity and \nhope to those who need them most. Distance learning is offered to more \nthan 3,300 American schools, providing knowledge and education to \nanyone who can log on, wherever they live. Not to mention, the \nincreased access to government services, born by State, local and \nFederal Government reliance on the Internet to provide its citizens \nwith valuable government information and services. To realize the full \npotential of the Internet and the digital economy, every person must be \nable to participate fully.\n  But today, we are talking about taxing the Internet, the vital core \nof the information technology revolution of the 1990s and the single \ngreatest resource for Americans to have increased access to vast \ninformation resources and government services. About this, there should \nbe no question, and no debate. With technology playing such a critical \nrole in our economy, society\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nand way of life, one would expect political leaders to be supportive of \nits continued growth for all Americans. Taxing Internet access has \nnever been good policy, and it isn't today. Whether access is provided \nby traditional phone lines, high-speed Digital Subscriber Lines, DSL, \nor even wireless, the Internet must remain free of taxation.\n  To the extent that I have any reservations about the amendment, it \nwill likely prolong the different tax regimes for DSL and cable modem \nservice. It is my belief that all high speed data connections should be \ntreated the same and that the government and this legislation should \nnot allow any disparities to continue.\n  Nevertheless, let me reiterate my support for this bill and the \npromise that it provides for continued economic growth. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this vital measure. I remind them \nthat the economy is not beginning to rebound as a result of more taxes; \nit is beginning to rebound as a result of less taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the \nChair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate to the pending \n     McCain substitute amendment No. 3048 to Calendar No. 353, S. \n     150, a bill to make permanent the moratorium on taxes on \n     Internet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on \n     electronic commerce imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n         Bill Frist, John McCain, Jon Kyl, Norm Coleman, Jim \n           Bunning, Gordon Smith, Mitch McConnell, Pete Domenici, \n           Conrad Burns, Rick Santorum, Olympia J.

On this vote, the yeas are 64, the \nnays are 34. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am delighted with the outcome of that \nlast cloture vote. It means we can proceed on course to finish this \nbill--a very important bill.\n  I congratulate the managers but encourage our colleagues to come \nforward with germane amendments. We will be working through the \nafternoon. We will be voting through the afternoon. We can finish the \nbill this afternoon. We have been debating this bill all week. It is an \nissue that we debated months ago. We are debating it now. Now is the \ntime to bring those amendments forward so we can have these final votes \nand complete the bill this afternoon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the Daschle \namendment is not germane and ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for the \ncomity that has existed in addressing this bill.\n  I thank, of course, Senator Allen, Senator Lott and Senator Sununu, \nand many others who have helped to get this bill to the point where it \nis.\n  We are ready to consider amendments. I assured the opponents of this \nbill who have fought tenaciously--Senator Voinovich, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Carper in particular--that if there is an amendment which \nthey have filed which is not technically germane but is associated with \nthe Internet tax, I would ask consent that it be considered because \nthere was a feeling that they did not have their amendments properly \nconsidered. I hope we can give them that consideration.\n  I hope we can move forward soon with the amendments. As I last \nchecked, there are about 30 which were filed. I hope we can move \nforward, debate, and dispose of those amendments. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak very \nbriefly after the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, having been involved in this issue now for \n8 years, I can say it has never been easy. Certainly what we have seen \ntoday demonstrates that once more.\n  But I think the Senate has made an important statement today; that \nis, as we try to lay out the policies that will say a lot about the \nfuture of the Internet, it is critically important this exciting \nopportunity for Americans not be subject to more discriminatory taxes.\n  We have said once again in the Senate, we want to try to find common \nground around the principle of technological neutrality, for example. \nIf we do not do that, we will be discriminating against the future, \nbecause if we do not work it out now in the amendment process, \nbroadband services delivered through DSL would be taxed and Internet \naccess through cable would not be taxed. That is not technological \nneutrality.\n  What is going to give Americans the best array of technologies at the \ncheapest prices is true competition where there is a level playing \nfield for the various technologies. I have said repeatedly I don't want \nto see the people who now get the message ``You've got mail'' to get a \nmessage that says ``You've got special taxes.'' My colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle agree with that as well. We have a difference \nof opinion with respect to how we are going to get that done. Now we \nwill be able to go to the amendment process.\n  I have compared this exercise repeatedly to something resembling root \ncanal work. I make it clear to my friend from Tennessee, the Senator \nfrom Delaware that we are going to do everything possible to make sure \nthere is an adequate opportunity for colleagues to offer their \namendments and discuss them. These are very technical, complicated \nissues. I have spent about as much time on the Senate floor discussing \nthese issues over the last 3 days as any Member. I intend to stay at \nthis post so we give everybody who wants a chance to discuss these \nissues that kind of opportunity.\n  Over the last 7 years, we have seen a lot of reports about dire \nconsequences that come about if we pass this legislation. That has not \ncome to pass. I see the distinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n  We were told in 1997, if we pass that, we will bring the collapse of \nthe revenue system in States and localities, and revenue went up $7 \nbillion the next year. We have to deal with those issues. In the last \ntwo iterations of this legislation, I have said repeatedly that no one \nhas brought forward an example of a local jurisdiction hurt by their \ninability to discriminate against electronic commerce. That is what \nthis bill does; it makes sure you cannot single Internet out for \nspecial taxes.\n  We will use this amendment process now to address the concerns of \nvarious Senators. A lot of Members did not think we would get to this \npoint today, but we have a chance, working with colleagues, to produce \na bipartisan bill that will be passed overwhelmingly by the Senate. I \nintend to stay and work with the Senator from Tennessee and others to \nmake sure they get the discussion on the topics they feel strongly \nabout and that it is fair and thorough. That is my pledge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see other Senators waiting to speak, \nso I will be brief. I acknowledge and congratulate Senator McCain, \nSenator Allen, Senator Wyden, and others who have worked very hard on \nthis issue. Their point of view on the cloture vote is prevailing. I \ncongratulate them and thank them also for the discussions we have had, \ntrying to assure Members that this legislation, in the end, would do \nthe minimum amount of harm to State and local governments. I would like \nto continue to do that.\n  There are a number of amendments that have been filed. We need to \nhave a few minutes to talk about exactly in what order we would like to \nbring up those amendments. I believe in some cases the Senator from \nOregon, the Senator from Virginia, and I intend to do the same thing, \nbut that our language does a different thing. To the extent there is a \nmisunderstanding that produces concerns on my part and among the \nNational Governors Association, the mayors, and the county executives \nof the country, perhaps we could work those things out by consensus.\n  I congratulate them on moving ahead with this step. I appreciate the \noffer to continue to work together. Within a few minutes, we will have \nan idea of which amendments and in what order we would like to proceed, \nand we will move along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Delaware. I know he has a \ncomment he wants to make.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague for yielding. I join Senator \nAlexander in congratulating Senator Wyden, Senator Allen, and Senator \nMcCain for the vote on the cloture. All week I had a different point of \nview on how we wanted to approach this matter. Now that is behind us. \nWe want to approach this in the spirit of comity and see if we cannot \nfind a consensus.\n  I said yesterday and I reiterate again today, there are four areas of \ncontention, as I see them. We are discussing going from a very narrow \nmoratorium to a very broad moratorium and the issue of what is defined \nas exempt under the moratorium. It is a good deal broader than what we \nfaced in recent years. That is a matter of concern. Going well beyond \naccess fees and discriminatory taxes is a matter of second concern.\n  I appreciate Senator McCain's offer to go from a permanent moratorium \ndown to 4 years. We were interested in 2 years. I don't know if there \nis a similar area there for compromise. I think there is a number \nbetween 2 and 4 that might work. That would be consistent with the \nthird area of contention where the duration of the grandfather clause \nfor State and local governments is 3 years. They are protected for 3 \nyears, and the length of the moratorium is 4. If we could put those two \ntogether, 3 and 3--3 years for the moratorium and stick with the 3 \nyears for the grandfather clause--I think that actually addresses that \nconcern.\n  In conversation with Senator Wyden, Senator Allen, Senator McCain, \nSenator Voinovich, and Senator Alexander, everyone says nobody wants to \ndeny State and local governments the opportunity to collect taxes from \ntelephone services that they have collected for decades. I have not \ntalked to anybody who wants to deny State and local governments that \nhave been collecting taxes on telephone services almost since the day \nAlexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Everyone says they do not \nwant to deny the ability to collect that for State and local \ngovernments. The concern is, as telephone service and commerce \ncommunication migrate to the Internet, we want to make sure that as \nthat happens State and local governments do not see those they \ntraditionally rely on cut out.\n\n  Those are four areas, and I think there is middle ground--at least on \nthree of them. I don't know if we can ever agree on the breadth and \ndepth of the definition. We will approach it in a good spirit.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I propound a unanimous consent request regarding time. My \ncolleague from Arkansas wishes to speak for 10 minutes on a subject \nunrelated to the matter before the Senate. I would like to follow her, \nif I might accommodate my Senator from Arkansas, on a subject matter \nunrelated to the matter before the Senate. I clearly know the priority \nis to get amendments up here. If I may, I make such a request, that the \nSenator from Arkansas be recognized for 10 minutes, and following her \nremarks I be recognized for 15 minutes to speak on a matter unrelated \nto the subject matter before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart but with \na great sense of Arkansas pride as well to pay tribute to five members \nof the Arkansas 39th Infantry Brigade who lost their lives fighting for \nour country in Iraq this past weekend.\n  According to recent reports, Saturday was one of the deadliest days \nfor the Arkansas service members since 1950 in the Korean War. On \nSaturday, four soldiers from the Arkansas 39th were killed in a mortar \nattack, and 27 hours later a fifth Arkansan was killed by a roadside \nbomb as he patroled the neighborhoods of Baghdad.\n  I think back to last fall when I had the honor of attending a sendoff \nceremony for the 39th Infantry Brigade in Little Rock, AR. That \nceremony brought together soldiers, families, friends, and loved ones \nto commemorate the occasion and wish them the best in their mission, to \njoin together in prayer and send them off with the idea that we would \nbe back soon to welcome them home safely.\n  The sendoff was not a celebration. In fact, it was a sobering \noccasion. After all, no one relishes the prospect of traveling halfway \naround the world, far from family and friends and home, to take on a \ndangerous mission. But even at such a somber occasion something special \nhappens. Differences begin to fade away. The soldiers that were \nstanding before me were no longer from big cities or small cities, they \nwere no longer Black or White, and they were no longer male or female. \nTheir differences did not exist. Those brave soldiers were Americans, \nand for the defense of this Nation, they become one of mind and one of \nmission.\n  The oneness of purpose that the 39th exhibited that day should serve \nas a lesson to those of us they leave behind. They are sacrificing \ntheir lives not just for their kind and kin but for every American who \nenjoys liberty and peace.\n  When a member of the 39th patrols Baghdad, he does not just patrol it \nfor the sake and safety of Lewisville, AR, or Little Rock, AR, or Hazen \nor Humnoke or Batesville, AR; he patrols Baghdad for the sake and the \nsafety of all Americans and the values and the ideals that we, as \nAmericans, believe in and support. When a member of the 39th Infantry \npays the ultimate price in battle, he does it not just for the sake of \nhis children but also for the sake of my children and your children as \nwell. In the end, these courageous souls are not only protecting our \nliberty, they are also teaching us what it means to be a part of one \nAmerican family--one American family.\n  In this time, when so many Americans are willing to lay their lives \non\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nthe line, we in this body--we in this Nation--must become one America. \nWe must understand what it takes to be one with the sacrifices that we, \ntoo, must undertake.\n  Unfortunately, carrying out the duty of a nation requires sacrifices, \nand some of those are sacrifices we would rather not take. This \nweekend, we were once again reminded of the sacrifices that are \nrequired to protect our Nation. We, too, as leaders in this body--all \nAmericans--must make sacrifices, too--to govern, to protect, to get \nalong, and to make this Nation strong. Our sacrifices are not even \nworthy to be compared to what these brave Americans have done and the \nsacrifices they have made, but our sacrifices, too, are all too \nimportant, that the sacrifices they have made will not have been done \nin vain, that our Nation can remain as strong as it has ever been, and \nthat each of us--from big cities and small, men and women, Black and \nWhite, Republican and Democrat--must become one America.\n  Over the course of those 2 days, the State of Arkansas lost five \nbrave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice to make the world a \nbetter place. I know that my colleagues in the Senate join me in paying \ntribute to CPT Arthur ``Bo'' Felder, 36 years old, of Lewisville, AR; \nCWO Patrick W. Kordsmeier, 49 years old, of North Little Rock, AR; SSG \nStacey C. Brandon, 35 years old, of Hazen, AR; SSG Billy Joe Orton, 41 \nyears old, of Humnoke, AR; and SP Kenneth A. Melton, 30 years old, of \nBatesville, AR.\n  Captain Felder served as a youth director at Saint Luke Missionary \nBaptist Church in North Little Rock. He was known as someone who felt \nat ease with children, who loved them, cared for them, and wanted to \nhelp prepare them for the future. It was reported in the Arkansas \nDemocrat Gazette that Captain Felder was remembered by his friends as a \nperson of faith and prayer.\n\n  Chief Warrant Officer Kordsmeier was killed as he rushed to the aid \nof his fellow soldiers. His selfless act illustrates the kind of \ncourage which is necessary to keep this Nation strong and free.\n  According to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Sergeant Stacey Brandon \nwas a prison guard for the State Department of Correction and later \nworked at the Federal prison in Forrest City, AR.\n  His friends said of him:\n\n       He was a very outstanding young man whose loss will affect \n     a lot of people. He was one of the young people you could \n     admire.\n\n  Sergeant Orton was loved by his family and friends. It is reported \nthat when they learned of his death over 100 people gathered around his \nhome to stand vigil and to support his family. It was noted by those \nthere that Billy had given his life for the cause of freedom.\n  Many of Specialist Melton's fellow soldiers from Bravo Company were \nespecially affected by his death. He had known and worked with many of \nthem for years. It is reported that upon the announcement of Specialist \nMelton's death, his comrades did not think of the dangers of their \nmission but of comforting Specialist Melton's wife and children.\n  Saturday's deadly attack on Camp Cooke, the base camp for Arkansas' \n39th Infantry, occurred at 5 a.m. Captain Felder, Chief Warrant Officer \nKordsmeier, Sergeant Brandon, and Sergeant Orton were killed in the \nfinal moments of the attack when they took a direct mortar hit as they \nemerged from the bunker where they had been taking cover. On Sunday, \nSpecialist Melton was killed by a roadside bomb as he manned a machine \ngun atop his Humvee.\n  These five brave men are a shining example of the citizen soldiers \nwho are fighting in the deserts of the Middle East. Those serving in \nIraq today are not only military men, but they are also doctors, \nlawyers, police officers, firemen, teachers, factory workers, business \nowners, and elected officials. Most importantly, they are husbands and \nwives, they are mothers and fathers.\n  In short, they are our American family. They are the leaders of their \nrespective communities. Their loss will not only be felt on the \nbattlefield but also by their families, friends, and communities who \nwill miss their love and leadership.\n  When their Nation called, these brave men answered. They did so \nwithout regard to politics or party. They did so without regard to the \nmany small differences we allow to divide us as a nation.\n  I am sure the entire Senate body will join with me as we send our \ncondolences and sympathy to the families and friends of these brave \nAmericans, to send our thanks for the courageous way they have served \ntheir country. They left their homes as family members, co-workers, and \nfriends, and they return as heroes.\n  I am honored and humbled to pay tribute to their sacrifice. It is \nhard to find the words that you might think could match those \nsacrifices because there are no words. But we try. I challenge my \ncolleagues today, let us not just use words. Let us use actions. Let \nour work be an example of the sacrifices we are willing to take by \nsaying to one another, we will be one America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, may I also make a \nunanimous consent request that at the conclusion of my remarks, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, be recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. My remarks will be off the subject matter of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator from \nConnecticut restate what his request is?\n  Mr. DODD. At the conclusion of my remarks, which are about 15 minutes \noff the subject matter of the bill, Senator Byrd of West Virginia be \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, is the subject of \nSenator Byrd's remarks the Internet tax issue?\n  Mr. DODD. I do not know. I have not asked the Senator.\n  No, it is not. It is a tribute to a constituent.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I understand the nature of Senator Byrd's \nremarks. We all want to get to the amendments that might be proposed on \nthe Internet tax issue, but knowing the subject matter of Senator \nByrd's remarks, there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Arkansas for her \nvery eloquent remarks. While she addressed them to four specific \nindividuals from her State, she could have been speaking for any one of \nour States in talking about any one of the several hundred young men \nand women who have lost their lives in Iraq over the last year. I thank \nher for the eloquence of her remarks, the sense of passion and \ncommitment she brought to them. I know she is joined by all of us--\ncertainly this Senator--in expressing deep sorrow for the loss of these \nArkansans. We will certainly keep them in our thoughts and prayers.\n  My remarks follow on a little bit with the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Arkansas. Later today or tomorrow, this body will be asked to vote \non the confirmation of the first Ambassador to be sent to post-Saddam \nHussein Iraq, John Negroponte. Presently, he is our Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. Ambassador Negroponte has a very distinguished \ndiplomatic career and is well suited to undertake what is surely going \nto be an extremely difficult and complex assignment, likely the most \ndifficult one of his career, and certainly one of the most difficult in \nthe history of the diplomatic corps, going back over the more than 200-\nyear history of our Nation.\n  While we have had our differences from time to time, I happen to \nbelieve John Negroponte is eminently qualified to take on this post. I \nthank him for his willingness to assume this responsibility, if he is \nconfirmed, and I believe he will be. I also thank his family for their \nwillingness and understanding that our country needs John Negroponte's \nservice at this critical hour.\n  During his nomination hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee, \nI stressed to Ambassador Negroponte\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nthat it would be terribly important for him to be candid with this \nCongress and the American people about what is happening in Iraq and \nwhat is not occurring. As we send our sons and daughters, mothers and \nfathers, brothers and sisters in harm's way, as we have just heard our \ncolleague from Arkansas so eloquently describe, the American people \nhave every right to expect and demand that U.S. officials are telling \nthem the truth about what is happening in Iraq because if they lose \nfaith in what our government is telling them, the United States will \nnot be able to sustain the long and difficult task we have undertaken \nin this faraway country. Ambassador Negroponte acknowledged his \nobligation to keep us informed. I am very confident he will do so.\n  While I intend to support Ambassador Negroponte's nomination when the \nSenate votes on this matter, I would not want that vote of support for \nhim to be interpreted as an endorsement of the U.S. policy in Iraq, as \nit is presently being conducted. I am deeply troubled about the pace \nand direction of our policy in that country. The situation in Iraq \ncould not be more volatile. Yet the Bush administration seems hell-bent \nto stick to the planned date of June 30 for the transfer of sovereignty \nto the Iraqi Government. Given the recent upsurge in violence in places \nsuch as Falluja and Najaf, given the absence of an effective Iraqi \nsecurity force to deal with such acts, and given the inadequate numbers \nof U.S. and foreign troops in that country to restore and maintain \nstability, I wonder--and I assume others do as well--whether we are \nsetting ourselves up for a catastrophic failure by rigidly adhering to \nthis deadline of June 30.\n\n  This coming Saturday, May 1, will be the 1-year anniversary of \nPresident Bush's declaration of mission accomplished in Iraq. Recent \nevents make it painfully obvious that nothing could be further from the \ntruth; rather, our mission may be just beginning. Certainly the return \nof sovereignty to Iraq is a laudable goal which I support, as I assume \nmost all of my colleagues do. It should and must be our end game. But a \ntransfer of authority will not in and of itself be a panacea for all \nthe problems Iraq faces. Moreover, if we do it prematurely, it could \nput our whole mission and the future of Iraq at risk.\n  This has been obvious to many of us for some time. But the Bush \nadministration continues to plunge forward with the hope and prayer \nthat everything somehow will work out after June 30. It does so without \nany clear sign that Iraq is ready for us to turn over authority or its \ninstitutions are at all capable at this juncture of successfully taking \non this incredible responsibility. In fact, I would argue that all the \nevidence before us suggests that Iraq is not ready and will not be \nready in the coming 62 days. Ironically, in light of recent events, \nwith each step closer to June 30 we seem to be taking a step back in \nterms of our readiness to hand over control to the interim transitional \nIraqi Government.\n  Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held three \nconsecutive hearings on the situation in Iraq. I commend Senator Lugar \nand Senator Biden for holding the hearings. On Tuesday, the committee \nconsidered the nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to be the first \nAmbassador to post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. Many questions were explored in \nthe course of those hearings. Frankly, with respect to many of those \nquestions, there were no or very few clear answers. However, we did \nreceive some very excellent testimony from expert witnesses with very \ndifferent backgrounds--from the U.S. military, from academia, from \npolicing experience, and counterterrorism.\n  Despite their different expertise, all of the witnesses were in \nagreement on one thing: that is, a major course correction with respect \nto U.S. efforts in Iraq is badly needed, and needed immediately. I have \ncome to a very similar conclusion. Let me be clear. This need for a \ncorrection in our policy is not because our men and women in uniform \nhave somehow failed to do their jobs. Quite the contrary, these men and \nwomen have performed every task that has been asked of them with the \nhighest degree of professionalism, patriotism, and heroism. Let there \nbe no doubt about that in the mind of any single American. But it is \nnow more than 1 year after the end of major combat, and arguably the \ndangers to our troops have never been greater 1 year later.\n  Why then are our troops in so much danger? I believe the answer, \nunfortunately, is quite simple. We have failed to craft and implement \nan effective stabilization plan for the nation of Iraq. This is not the \nfault of those in uniform; rather, it is the responsibility of top \ncivilian officials in the Department of Defense and the White House who \nfrom the very beginning ignored--in fact, scoffed at and thwarted--\nrecommendations from leading uniformed officers, including GEN Eric \nShinseki, that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to \ncomplete our mission in Iraq. In retrospect, it certainly seems that \nGeneral Shinseki's judgment was right on the mark. More recently, \nmilitary experts have concluded that we are likely, at least in the \nshort term, to need an additional 50,000 U.S. troops if we are going to \nbe able to secure the peace in that country.\n\n  We are also going to need a similar number from our European allies \nin NATO, and we need these reinforcements soon before events spin even \nfurther out of control than they already have.\n  Indeed, I wonder if last March we had sent a larger number of troops \nto Iraq--and had broad international participation--whether we would \nnow be facing the same unacceptable lack of security throughout that \ncountry. I also wonder what effect increased security in Iraq would \nhave had with respect to Iraqis' tolerance of a U.S. military presence \nin their country.\n  Unfortunately, this lack of security has been evident from the \nearliest days of the conflict, when it first became apparent that the \nadministration had not paid sufficient attention to the security needs \nof Iraq. Museums were looted. Ordinary civilians took up arms to guard \ntheir neighborhoods. Lawlessness prevailed throughout much of the \ncountry. Most importantly, in that short period of time, we lost the \nconfidence of the Iraqi people.\n  This isn't simply my observation. I was told very directly by an \nIraqi during my trip to the nation back in December, well before the \nrecent flareup in violence over the last several weeks--this Iraqi \ncitizen is a Shiite, a moderate, a forward-looking individual. He very \nfrankly told me that the lawlessness which followed the war negatively \nimpacted Iraqis' confidence as to the intentions, preparedness, and \ncapabilities of coalition forces to create a safe and secure Iraq.\n  His contention was reinforced by Hasan Zirkani, who in November 2003 \nlisted the lack of law and order, rampant unemployment, and the lack of \nbasic services as sources of Shiite unrest. I would note that Mr. \nZirkani is a Shiite cleric who supports Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical \nleader who commands the loyalty of the group responsible for much of \nthe recent violence and unrest in Iraq.\n  I also point to a February 2004 nationwide poll in Iraq, which showed \nthat 64 percent of the Iraqi people consider regaining public security \nas their ``first priority'' over the next 12 months.\n  Disturbingly, the Bush administration has attempted to make up for \nits lack of security preparation in the same reactive and hasty manner \nas much of the planning for post-war Iraq was carried out. One example \nof this has been the assembling of the various Iraqi security forces, a \nprocess which most experts agree was done far too quickly, with little \nor no training, and with inadequate vetting. We all witnessed the \nconsequences of these rushed activities during the recent upsurge in \nviolence, when Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of armed resistance.\n  Insecurity in Iraq has also affected the ability of U.S. and foreign \nNGOs to perform the necessary humanitarian and reconstruction duties \nthat would help them turn around the mood in the Iraqi streets. \nUnfortunately, due to the lack of security, many are unwilling or \nunable to operate in that country. In many places, reconstruction \nactivities have come to a screeching halt. Contractors sit in hotel \nlobbies in Kuwait and Jordan, waiting for order to be restored so they \ncan return to their projects.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n  The administration says we are on course for June 30. I ask: What is \nthat course? Where is all this leading?\n  One thing is clear: From the very beginning, the Bush administration \nhas done an inadequate job of preparing for the peace in Iraq. It has \nattempted to fix problems in shortsighted, often haphazard ways. It has \nonly begrudgingly moved to adapt to the resulting strategic realities \non the ground.\n  That is why I believe it is fair and responsible to question the \nadministration's plans as they relate to the upcoming June 30 deadline. \nHow much more complex will this situation be if we try to stand up an \nIraqi authority prematurely--if we stubbornly adhere to this date? What \nhappens if that authority crumbles?\n  I don't underestimate the problem of delaying the turnover. Clearly, \nif U.N. Special Envoy Brahimi were to announce that the turnover on \nJune 30 is impossible, that would make our choice much easier. But we \nmust recognize that the situation in Iraq is incredibly fragile. If \nthis effort to build a stable and democratic Iraq is to succeed, it is \ngoing to need enormous international support. That support will not be \nforthcoming if the interim government in Iraq is not perceived as \nlegitimate--both by the Iraqi people and the international community.\n  I emphasize again that I understand there will be a cost by delaying \nthe June 30 date. My point is that whatever that cost is, the cost of \nadhering to that date, sticking to it prematurely I think would be far \nmore precarious than whatever damage may be associated with delaying \nthe date beyond the June 30 date. Indeed, for all the difficulties in \ndelaying the turnover of authority in Iraq, they pale in comparison, in \nmy view, to going forward and seeing the situation irreversibly spiral \ndownward.\n  Equally troubling is that the administration is now saying that our \nhandover of sovereignty to the Iraqis on June 30 will be ``limited.'' \nMr. President, I don't quite understand what that means. I suspect the \nIraqi people don't either. The law of administration for the state of \nIraq, the so-called transitional law, which was drafted and approved \nearlier this year, calls for the establishment of a ``fully sovereign \nIraqi interim government.''\n\n  Now it would appear that a yet-to-be-negotiated annex to that \ntransitional law is going to spell out the limits of Iraq's sovereignty \nafter June 30. Of course, nobody yet knows what that annex is going to \nlook like--what concessions the administration will have to make to get \nthe various Iraqi factions to sign off on the individuals who will make \nup the interim government, or whether those concessions, made in haste, \nin the long run will undermine our goal of a fully independent and \ndemocratic Iraq.\n  I don't pretend to have all the answers with respect to what needs to \nbe done before sovereignty is handed back to the Iraqi people. But I \nwill say that the rapidly deteriorating security situation, combined \nwith the lack of legitimacy for the U.S. presence in Iraq, has created \nconflicting pressures on the administration with respect to the June 30 \ndeadline.\n  Administration officials assert if we hand over authority to the \nIraqis on schedule, the U.S. presence in that country will become less \ncontroversial. I disagree. The way to enhance U.S. legitimacy is to get \nthe security situation turned around. That isn't going to happen by \nsimply declaring Iraq a sovereign nation on July 1; it is only going to \nhappen with a carefully planned and implemented stabilization program.\n  That stabilization program will require more troops on the ground--\nour troops and troops from other nations sanctioned by a clear U.N. \nmandate. Whether that can be accomplished by June 30 remains to be \nseen. I think it is very unlikely.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are only 62 days away from the turnover \ndate. Yet, we still don't know who we are turning that authority over \nto. We don't know whether the individuals to be chosen by a U.N. \nspecial envoy will be acceptable to the Iraqi people.\n  What we do know is that virtually every day more Americans and more \nIraqis are dying. Recent events have forced the Bush administration to \nacknowledge some of these realities. I do not think we should dismiss \nout of hand that a course correction may be called for that makes the \nprimary focus of our efforts security; or that we put off, for a time, \nthe standing up of an unelected interim government.\n  That would also give us additional time to make sure that when \nauthority is transferred, it is transferred to a body that has \nlegitimacy in the eyes of the international community and the Iraqi \npeople. To help do this, we need to go to the U.N. and NATO before \nturning over authority, not after. The U.N. and NATO would be \ninvaluable partners in tackling a task never before attempted from the \noutside: converting dictatorship into democracy. It would infuse our \nefforts with much-needed legitimacy.\n  There are roughly 9 weeks left before June 30. In the interim, a lot \ncould be accomplished in Iraq that might make the turnover of \nsovereignty possible on the timetable the administration has laid out. \nWe could have achieved, before that date, a clear and concrete U.N. \nmandate for nation building in Iraq. We could have a secured commitment \nfor a significant NATO troop deployment in that nation. We could have \ndeployed additional troops to address the security challenges of a \ngrowing insurgency movement--including troops from governments in the \nregion. But we have not achieved any of those things yet. We need to be \nhonest about that.\n\n  Mr. President, now is the time for a careful, informed debate in \nAmerica about U.S. policy in Iraq, especially about the wisdom of our \nset deadlines--the pros and cons of moving forward as planned. After \nthat debate, as June 30 draws nearer, we may in fact determine that \nsufficient progress has been made to go ahead as planned with the \nturnover of sovereignty. That may in fact be the right thing to do. But \nif on balance we conclude it is not, we in Congress need to say so \npublicly and on a bipartisan basis. The Bush administration needs to do \nso as well. Then we need to act accordingly.\n  Former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Chas Freeman, recently sent \nan e-mail to some of his friends concerning the situation in Iraq. It \nwas printed in the Washington Post about 2 weeks ago. He concluded with \nthese comments:\n\n       Military triumph does not necessarily equate to a political \n     victory. Wars end only when the defeated accept defeat, not \n     when the victor declares victory. A victory that does not \n     produce peace can be much more costly than protracted \n     confrontation that accomplishes deterrence. Arrogant \n     daydreams that inspire military actions can become \n     humiliating nightmares that produce political debacles.\n\n  Before our daydreams for a free and democratic Iraq become our \nnightmares of a bottomless quagmire, let us do the sensible thing and \nat least honestly take a hard look at our decision to turn back \nauthority to the Iraqi people on June 30--before we are sure that \n``victory is going to produce peace.'' Once we have allowed the Iraqi \npeople to govern themselves, it is going to be virtually impossible to \ntake that sovereignty back without enormous loss of the blood and \ntreasure of both of our peoples.\n  That is something no one wants to see happen. I urge the \nadministration to think about the wisdom of moving forward on the June \n30 date.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the order is that the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia gets the floor. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be able to ask, under my time postcloture, some \nquestions of the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Is that OK with the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been fascinated with the statement of \nthe Senator from Connecticut. What triggered my mind was the statements \nhe made about General Shinseki who said we would need a couple hundred \nthousand troops over there. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, what \nhappened to him? He is gone.\n  Mr. DODD. He is gone. He retired. He was not fired.\n  Clearly, the message was quite clear that he had stepped out of line \nby saying what he thought from a military standpoint--he had a \ndistinguished career of many years in military service--that in order \nto be successful, that number of troops was necessary. He was, in a \nsense, penalized, at the very\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nleast rhetorically for suggesting as such.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator, does he remember a man named Larry \nLindsey? I suggest he was on the Board of Governors working with Alan \nGreenspan. He also was the chief economic adviser to President Bush. \nDoes the Senator from Connecticut remember a time just a short time ago \nafter the war started that he said he thought the war could cost as \nmuch as $200 billion?\n  Mr. DODD. I recall that.\n  Mr. REID. He was even more lenient than that. The news article I have \nsays it would be between $100 billion to $200 billion. The Senator \nrecognizes that he was also given his walking papers; is that true?\n  Mr. DODD. That is exactly what happened. He was also highly condemned \nfor suggesting a number that now looks small in comparison to what the \nreal pricetag is going to be.\n  Mr. REID. Before asking my final question, I ask the Senator from \nConnecticut, I am confident he is aware of the last press conference \nthat the President held; is that true? Does the Senator remember the \nquestion that was asked in that press conference where the President \nsaid, when asked the question about having made mistakes, he couldn't \nremember any? I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he thinks this is a \nmistake made by the President: No. 1, going on the aircraft carrier and \nhaving a banner above it saying ``Mission Accomplished''? The Senator \nis aware that since that time, about 700 American soldiers have been \nkilled; is that true?\n  Mr. DODD. That number I think is roughly correct. Most of those, by \nthe way, have died since May 1 of last year.\n  Mr. REID. So it is fair, is it not, that could have been a mistake?\n  Mr. DODD. I think by anyone's estimation to declare that the mission \nwas accomplished was a mistake.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Connecticut also think it was a \nmistake for the President to say--when asked about whether there would \nbe any people who would cause trouble there, does the Senator from \nConnecticut remember him saying, ``Bring 'em on''?\n\n  Mr. DODD. I do recall that statement he made.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest to the President's people that they should advise \nhim the next time he is asked that question, he could at least relate \nto those two things--No. 1, ``Mission Accomplished,'' and No. 2, \n``Bring 'em on.'' Since the time of ``Bring 'em on,'' hundreds of \nsoldiers have been killed and thousands maimed for life and injured in \nother ways.\n  I appreciate very much that statement of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may take 1 additional minute, my point \nis, I voted in favor of the authority. I believe it was the right thing \nto do. My concern is the June 30 date. I am concerned, and I realize \nthere is a cost in changing it. We need to evaluate whether turning \nsovereignty over at that date is going to serve our interests. That was \nthe sum and substance of my remarks.\n  I appreciate the questions my colleague from Nevada raised. I made \ncomments regarding holding rigidly to a date that could turn out to be \na mistake.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I also voted for the resolution. I \nthink it is extremely important that we who support the effort in Iraq, \nprotecting the men and women who are representing our country over \nthere, have the ability to speak out freely on this issue and not be \ncriticized as having been unpatriotic for having done so.\n  The Senator from West Virginia was originally almost a lone voice \nspeaking out against this event. Time has shown perhaps his vision was \nmore meaningful than people realized at the time. I appreciate the \nSenator responding to my questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield to me 30 \nseconds for a comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  It is the intention of all to finish this legislation tonight. I hope \nthose with amendments will come over during the period that Senator \nByrd makes his remarks so we can proceed with amending this \nlegislation. I regret it, but I will object to further extraneous \nconversation or dialog until we finish consideration of this bill \nbecause I do not want to inconvenience Members by keeping them in late \ntonight. We have some 31 relevant amendments. We need to get about \naddressing them.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for allowing me to comment.\n  Mr. REID. If I can, as a matter of trying to lay out what is ahead of \nus, Senator Wyden spoke with me and one other Senator indicating they \nworked to get cloture on this amendment that the Senator from Arizona \nfiled. There has been an agreement--I have not been part of those \nagreements--that Senator Wyden, Senator Carper, and others would have \nan opportunity to offer amendments. The Senator from Arizona has \nindicated that he will do everything within his power to make sure \nthose amendments are offered and debated in an orderly time.\n  My only statement to the Senator from Arizona is, I think it may be \ndifficult to finish this bill today because he talked about extraneous \nmatters. The Senator from West Virginia has a right to speak for 1 hour \non this matter, as do I and others. No one is attempting to stall this \nlegislation. The Senator from Arizona had a very important vote, but I \nhope this matter is not, in effect, going to be jammed through. This is \nan important piece of legislation. We will work with the majority as \nmuch as we can, but based on my experience in the Senate--the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I came on the very same day, so one does not have more \nexperience than the other--I think it will be difficult to finish \ntonight. If we can, we will work with you. I think it is extremely \ndifficult to finish tonight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for one additional comment, I \nappreciate what the Senator from Nevada said. He is very experienced at \nfloor procedures. I point out we have been on this bill all week. I \nwould hope we could finish it tonight. I see no reason why we cannot.\n  I understand his skepticism. In no way did I mean to criticise the \nvery important statements being made on the vital issue of national \nsecurity.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his indulgence. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                         SGM Michael Boyd Stack\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Easter Sunday, April 11, 2004, this \nNation lost a fine soldier, a good man, a loving father and husband, \nand a faithful Christian when SGM Michael Boyd Stack of C Company, 2nd \nBattalion, 5th Special Forces Group Airborne, was killed in an ambush \nin Iraq.\n  SGM Stack is 1 of more than 700 men and women who have given their \nlives in this conflict and 1 of the more than 100 who were killed in \nthe month of April alone. Each is mourned. Each is honored. Each is \nsorely missed.\n  These men and women knew the meaning of duty, honor, and courage. \nThey and their comrades in arms still serving are most emphatically not \nthe summer soldier and the sunshine patriot whom Thomas Paine warned \nagainst, who shrink from the service of their country in times of \ncrisis.\n  SGM Stack and his fallen comrades wore the uniform of the United \nStates proudly and bravely. When told to go to Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthey saluted and prepared to go. They said their farewells to their \nloving and fearful families and set off. From spare bivouacs, they \npatrolled dusty streets and lonely highways. They faced rocket-\npropelled grenades, improvised landmines, sniper fire, and ambush. They \nlooked out for one another with humor and grace and caring. They gave \ntheir very best. In the end, they gave their all.\n\n     Soldier, rest!\n     Thy warfare oer,\n     Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,\n     Dream of battled fields no more,\n     Days of danger, nights of waking.\n\n  So said Sir Walter Scott in the Lady of the Lake.\n  These fallen heroes made the ultimate sacrifice, bravely and \nunshirking. When all is said and done, all policy laid aside, out there \nat the sharp end of the spear, these men and women did what good \nsoldiers do. They stood\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nshoulder to shoulder and did not flinch. In the heat of battle, in the \nthreat of danger, in the face of death, they did not flinch.\n  SGM Stack had faced such dangers before. His 27-year Army career \nspanned the cold war, the first Gulf war, and the conflict in the \nBalkans. His experience and his cool head in tense situations made him \na valued member of his company and his battalion. He volunteered for \nAirborne School and service in the 82d Airborne Division upon his \nenlistment in 1977. He joined the Special Forces in 1988, serving 16 \nyears with the 3d, 5th, and 10th Special Forces Groups, and as an \ninstructor in the 1st Special Warfare Training Group. Much of what he \ndid will never be made public, but he earned the unqualified respect \nand admiration of his fellow soldiers. The high standard of \nprofessionalism, ability, teamwork, and fairness that SGM Stack \nexemplified and taught to new generations of Green Berets will be his \nlegacy to the Army, as well as in the Armed Forces of other nations \nthat he helped to train.\n\n  Even as a young platoon sergeant, he was known as ``No Slack Billy \nJack Stack,'' in recognition of the high standards he expected, and \nrequired, of the men he led. He cared deeply for his men and died among \nthem, manning a .50-caliber machine gun in the heat of battle, keeping \nthem safe and striving, as always, to achieve the mission goals.\n  SGM Stack was a professional soldier, hard-eyed and competent, the \nvery picture of a happy warrior, who might have inspired these words by \nthe poet William Wordsworth:\n\n     Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he\n     That every man in arms should wish to be?\n     It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought\n     Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought\n     Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:\n     Whose high endeavors are an inward light\n     That makes the path before him always bright:\n     Who, with a natural instinct to discern\n     What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;\n     Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,\n     And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!\n     Turns his necessity to glorious gain;\n     In face of these doth exercise a power\n     Which is our human nature's highest dower:\n     Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves\n     Of their bad influence, and their good receives:\n     Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,\n     Or mild concerns of ordinary life,\n     A constant influence, a peculiar grace;\n     But who if he be called upon to face\n     Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined\n     Great issues, good or bad for human kind,\n     Is happy as a Lover; and attired\n     With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;\n     And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law\n     In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw.\n\n  In and out of uniform, SGM Stack set high standards for himself. He \nearned his college degree while serving in the Army. He was active in \nhis church. He kept a Holy Bible in his desk at work, by his chair at \nhome, and in the pocket of his battle dress uniform. He had the quiet \nconfidence of a man who keeps the Lord close to his heart. Before \nleaving on his final patrol, SGM Stack asked the unit chaplain to say a \nprayer over his men.\n  He kept his family close as well. He went home to lunch most days. He \nlavished love on his young children and took great pride in the \naccomplishments of his older children. In his wife, Suzanne, he had a \nsoulmate with whom he was planning a long and happy retirement, a \nretirement which never came. He relished quiet hours spent with family \nand friends, and he took justified pride in his cooking abilities at \nsuch times. He was slow to anger and quick to forgive. He left behind \nhim a full measure of That best portion of a good man's life, His \nlittle, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love.\n  SGM Stack is survived by his wife, Victoria Suzanne Stack; his \nchildren Milissa, Virginia, Jillian, David, and William; step-son \nBryan, and grandchildren Jakob, Tylor, and Jesse. His father, Cecil, \nand mother, Antoinette Stack, also mourn him, as do his brother, Cecil \nStack, Jr., and sisters Tammy, Kimberly, and Christina.\n  Military service was a tradition in the Stack family that stretches \nacross generations. SGM Stack's father, brother, and nephew all serve \nor served in the Army. SGM Stack's father-in-law retired from the Air \nForce. The Nation owes a deep debt of gratitude to such families, who \nhave answered the call to arms so often and so willingly in our \nhistory.\n  Today, as SGM Michael Stack is laid to rest at Arlington Cemetery, \njoining the quiet ranks of fallen heroes there, no words can truly \ncomfort hearts that loved him and that are grieving. But at this Easter \nseason, especially, we are reminded that death is not the end, but only \na parting for a little while. Michael's faith gave him comfort as he \nstepped in front of danger; may that same faith sustain his family that \nthey will surely be together again.\n  Once again, I reach for the words of William Wordsworth, from his \nOde, Intimations of Immortality:\n\n     Though nothing can bring back the hour\n     Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n     We will grieve not, rather find\n     Strength in what remains behind;\n     In the primal sympathy\n     Which having been must ever be;\n     In the soothing thoughts that spring\n     Out of human suffering;\n     In the faith that looks through death,\n     In years that bring the philosophic mind.\n\n  I offer the thanks of a grateful Nation to SGM Stack, who served his \ncountry in the Army, who served his country with great honor and \ndistinction. To his family, I offer my sincere condolence for their \nloss. I pray that the Lord gives them strength to bear this sad burden \nuntil, in the fullness of time, they are all united again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the leader yields, I thank the \nleader. This was a very gracious thing to do. We don't do it often \nenough. I commend the Democratic leader for taking out a few minutes to \nrecognize people who make such a difference here every single day. The \nleader does this repeatedly, and I commend him for it.\n  I associate myself with his remarks, and I wish to express our deep \ngratitude to Tom and his family for remarkable service to this country. \nI hope the people out there realize with all that happens within the \nview of a television camera, there are literally hundreds of people who \nmake this government of ours, in spite of all of its inefficiencies, \nfunction remarkably well, and Tom certainly falls within that category. \nI thank the leader for taking a few minutes out to recognize him.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have heard my colleagues come to the \nSenate today criticizing the President about the handling of Iraq and \nthe war on terrorism. I hate for it just to lie there and somebody not \nexplain to the American people that we are at a war. This is a war that \nis as big as World War II or World War I. It is global in its size, but \nit is with a different enemy than we have ever known before in the \nhistory of this country or any other country. It is terrorism. It is \nperformed by people who do not wear uniforms, who operate in the \nshadows and are faceless, are indiscriminate in whose life they take--\nwhether they be combatants or noncombatants, men or women, young or \nold--and a respecter of no nationality. That is the enemy.\n  Some would actually question the decision to move against Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Let me remind my fellow Americans and also my colleagues, \nwe could go back as far as Beirut when a building was bombed there and \nover 200 marines lost their lives. It was a car\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nbombing. We had never experienced that before. It gave us a pattern of \nwhat was to come in later years.\n  We have heard the crying of the Iraqi people. I believe the spirit of \nfreedom lives in their breast as it does in ours. But let's look at the \ntrack record, how we got to where we are today.\n\n  Do you recall the World Trade Center, the first time it was hit, \nFebruary 26, 1993? Six people died. Cyanide gas and other chemicals \nwere found in that building. Next, we move to June 25, 1996, when 19 \nAmericans were killed and 372 were wounded at a place called Khobar \nTowers in Saudi Arabia. Nothing was done about either one of those \nattacks.\n  Then came August 7, 1998. Two embassies were bombed; one in Tanzania, \none in Kenya, eastern Africa.\n  Then came October 12, 2000. The USS Cole was attacked in Yemen. \nSeventeen American sailors died.\n  Then we come to September of 2001--September 11; 9/11--and the World \nTrade Center, New York City. Two airplanes were flown into the two \ntowers. Over 2,500 people were killed on that fateful day that most of \nus remember. There was another attack in Washington, DC, at the \nPentagon on that same day. On that day some 3,000 people died. We did \nnot even lose that many at Pearl Harbor when Japan attacked our forces, \nthe U.S. Navy.\n  We could go on about Santiago, on September 27, 2001; the U.S. \nhousing compound in Saudi Arabia--all of those terrorist attacks on \nAmerican citizens.\n  Because we did nothing to answer any of those attacks, was that \nbasically a green light to go ahead? How long do we have to apologize \nand say, Well, we are trying to find a way to take care of this cancer \nthat has invaded our world?\n  So the decision was to say, after 9/11: Let's go after the cancer. \nAnd we did that. And al-Qaida, even though it operates, I will tell \nyou, it does not operate as freely as it did.\n  The American people, have they forgotten we have not been hit by \nanother terrorist act in this country since we made the decision to \ntear the heart out of the dragon?\n  And then the idea of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, he had \nthem. He used them. He manufactured them. People were even trained.\n  I do not think we need to apologize to anybody anymore for the \nactions we are taking. Enough is enough, for the protection of our \ncountry and for the protection of the people who live here, who work \nhere, and long to be free.\n  Just ask the young men. For everybody who would say, Well, this thing \nis falling apart, do you realize our recruitments are up? People who \nare reenlisting in the service--those numbers are up. If you talk to \nour young people there in Iraq, who are doing those patrols--and I have \ndone that; I have been there--they know what the mission is. They know \nthe risk involved. They willingly accept it because they have a great \nheritage of generations before them. When called upon to make the \nsacrifice for national security, Americans have always answered the \ncall--even in light of those who would be apologists.\n  So we as, say, the political arm also have an obligation to make sure \nthey inherit the world they think they are getting. They are willing to \ndie for it. We should support them because they understand the next \ngeneration will. If you wanted to take a poll on how many people wanted \nto be on Normandy Beach on June 6, 1944, I doubt you would get a \nmajority of people who would like to have been there. But we went. We \nanswered the call. That is what is important. We cannot lose our will \nas a people or a society or as our military forces. That is what I am \nhearing is our will. They understand what is at stake for the next \ngeneration. That is what has made this country great. We always think \nabout the next generation. It is not about our own generation. It is \nabout our kids. That is what this is all about.\n  If we keep backing and shrinking away, then our enemy will take \nwhatever we give them, and we will pay an even higher price than we \nhave already paid--Americans killed, innocently, going about their own \nbusiness in their own way in a free country.\n  We have men and women who have answered the call and a Commander in \nChief who is doing his level best to not only end it in an honorable \nway but to also secure the freedom and the safety of people in a part \nof the world where that has been done very few times. He is to be \ncommended for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to 59 young \nAmericans who have been killed in Iraq from March 22 to April 26. All \nof them to whom I am going to pay tribute were from California or were \nbased in California.\n  I have previously read the names of all the others connected to \nCalifornia who have died. Sadly, these numbers are going up. I was \nshocked to just hear on the radio that 11--11--of our troops have been \nkilled today in Iraq.\n  So I am going to read the names of those who are connected to \nCalifornia. And this, again, is from March 22 until Monday of this \nweek.\n  LCpl Jeffrey C. Burgess, age 20, died March 25, due to enemy action \nnear Fallujah.

He was \nassigned to 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I \nMarine Expeditionary Force, at Twentynine Palms, CA.\n  Sadly, since this list was compiled, we have suffered more and more \nlosses. Today alone, I understand from radio reports, we have lost 11 \nsoldiers. So this list that I read pays tribute to those lost between \nMarch 22 and Monday of this week. It took me too long, Mr. President, \nand I had to ask for more time because, sadly, we have lost more than \n700 people, and the numbers are escalating.\n  I say to the families not only of these brave servicemen--and I don't \nthink there was a woman in this particular list--I say to the parents \nwho have lost a child here, and I say to the wives or the husbands who \nhave lost a spouse here, and I say to the children who have lost a dad \nhere, or the siblings who have lost a brother or sister here, you \nshould be very proud of your family member; that love of country takes \nmany forms, and one form is being willing to carry a weapon on to the \nfield of battle where you face death, and that is what these brave men \nand women are doing right now.\n\n  As a Senator, I owe you a plan, I owe you a clear mission, I owe you \na clear exit strategy. Working on the Foreign Relations Committee with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Senators Lugar, Biden, Kerry, \nDodd, Sarbanes, Chafee, and all the Members on both sides of the aisle, \nwe owe it to the people to come together now and figure this out.\n  My friend from Montana said this is a war against terrorism. I want \nto bring us back for a moment to September 11 when the whole world was \nwith us against Osama bin Laden, and I gave the President full \nauthority to go get the people who did this to us.\n  After September 11, as each of us were trying to find out what \nhappened, I asked the State Department about al-Qaida and where al-\nQaida operated.\n  I have a booklet that was printed after September 11 from the Bush \nadministration's State Department. Al-Qaida operated at that date in 45 \ncountries, including our own. Iraq was not on the list. And somehow \nbecause we did not have a plan and we lost the support of most of the \nworld for this, we find ourselves alone in this matter.\n  For every name that I read, there is a family grieving with tears \nthat we can only imagine. We owe it to them now, because we are where \nwe are, not to come to the floor and snipe at each other, but to find a \nplan so we can make sure the world is with us and make sure the Iraqi \npeople are with us.\n  Yes, we are going to have those elements--the Baathists and the \nextremists--but if we can win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, \nas we have been saying on the Foreign Relations Committee for so long, \nwe can turn this around. But we need to do it with the world behind us, \nand that takes leadership.\n  For me to come to the floor and talk about all these deaths and then \nhave to ask for additional time because there are so many deaths that I \nran out of time--this is not what the American people were told. We \nneed a plan. We need more support. We need an exit strategy that makes \nsense that gives us pride, that gives the people of Iraq pride, that \ngives them at least the limited sovereignty they have been promised.\n  This is a very hard time. I support our men and women in Iraq. I am \ngoing to work overtime in a bipartisan way to make sure the tone around \nhere can change, and we can come together.\n  Yes, we differed on the way in. I differed with how we went in and \nwith whom we went in, but we are where we are, and now is a time to \nfigure out a way to get us out of there in a way that makes the world \nsafer, makes us safer, and once more puts America in the front of the \nworld as the country that will, in fact, be able to bring democracy in \na way that makes sense for the people of the world.\n  I am going to give back my time because I am very anxious to get this \nbill passed with my colleagues, Senators McCain, Wyden, Allen, and \nothers.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher courtesy.\n  I would like to report that after a very productive meeting amongst \nthe principals who have been involved in this legislation, I might add, \nI was reminded, for about 8 years now, and thanks to the good offices \nof Senators Dorgan, Voinovich, Allen, Lott, Alexander, and Carper, I \nthink we have the outline of an agreement that I hope can lead to a \nsuccessful conclusion within the next hour or so.\n  We have refined the issues basically down to two. One of them is the \nissue of a moratorium. We expect Senator Lautenberg to come to the \nfloor with an amendment on the issue of moratorium, the numbers of \nyears of a moratorium for different protocols, and also one on the \ndefinition of the backbone. It is not clear whether the second issue \nwill require a recorded vote.\n  We also reached an agreement on an amendment I will propose on behalf \nof all of us in a few minutes that has to do with the voice over \nInternet protocol issue, a definition to which we have agreed.\n  I inform my colleagues, I think it is very possible that we could \nhave one or two more votes and then vote on final passage. At least I \nam hopeful of that outcome. I again thank my colleagues for their \nprogress.\n  I will also mention that there are a couple of Senators who are being \nchecked in who had amendments to make sure their concerns are being \naddressed in the amendments that may be proposed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his leadership. \nWe did just conclude a meeting and, as a result of that meeting, it \nappears to me we should be able to complete this legislation likely \nthis afternoon. We dealt with the question of the voice over Internet \nprotocol, VOIP. I think Senator McCain will offer an amendment that \nreflects an agreement on all sides of that issue. That is one of the \nissues resolved.\n  There still remains some issues dealing with the grandfather issue. I \nbelieve Senator Lautenberg will offer an amendment on that issue. \nSenator Lott has an amendment. I am not certain whether they need \nvotes. In any event, they will be working on those.\n  The other issue is the definition as to what extent this legislation \napplies to certain activities with respect to taxation of telephone and \ntelecommunications issues and the Internet.\n  The underlying bill is a Federal preemption of taxation with respect \nto the Internet. The point of the legislation, as introduced, is to \neffectively prevent taxing the connection to the Internet, believing \nthat the buildout of broadband services in this country is good for the \ncountry and will expand the economy and create jobs.\n  Almost all of us previously voted for a moratorium on taxes on the \nInternet. I voted for it, and so has most of my colleagues. This \niteration of that moratorium has become increasingly complicated \nbecause since the moratorium, new technologies have developed, and it \nhas caused more difficulties in negotiating. Even though we do not have \nagreement on every feature, my expectation is that in the next couple \nof hours the likelihood is this legislation could be completed in the \nSenate.\n  Again, I appreciate the leadership of Senator McCain. A group of us \nhave been active in trying to see if we can find common definitions and \ncommon intent with respect to this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I share the view of the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and Senator Dorgan. I think the end is now in sight. \nI see the distinguished Senator from Virginia on the floor right now, \nand I commend him for all the effort and the relentless pursuit of a \ncause that he and I have shared for many years, going back to when he \nwas Governor and when I was the original Senate sponsor.\n  We have held steadfast to the proposition that the Internet, this \nextraordinary national and global treasure, should not be subject to \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes. I think the earlier Senate vote \nindicates that a majority of the Senate is prepared to support policies \nwhich will ensure that the Internet is healthy and vibrant for the \nfuture.\n  I see the chairman of the Commerce Committee on the floor. People \nfelt strongly about the question of telephone calls over the Internet. \nThe chairman of the Commerce Committee came, had a very constructive \ndefinition which made clear or clearer what Senator Allen and I have \nfelt all along, and that is that there should not be a change in the \nstatus quo. That is very constructive.\n  My guess is that the big challenge over the course of the afternoon \nwill be on the issue of definitions. Certainly there are definitions \nwith respect to how what is called the backbone of the system, the \narchitecture, is handled. Depending on how it is written, that \ndefinition could provide for taxes on BlackBerrys and e-mails and the \nkind of thing that the Senator from Virginia and I have opposed \nstrongly. We will have to oppose that once again, but I want to make it \nclear, as I did earlier in the afternoon, that we are anxious to deal \nwith the remaining issues in a collegial fashion with the Senator from \nTennessee. The Senator from Tennessee has made it clear he wants to \nmove this bill along.\n  I join my colleagues in saying that after 8 years of being at this, \nliterally since the time I came to the Senate early in 1996, I suspect \nin a few hours the Senate will have acted once more in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  I want to wrap up by commending the Senator from Virginia. He has \nbeen willing to compromise with respect to issues but he has never \ncompromised on principle, and I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we await the arrival of Senator Lautenberg \nso we can move forward with his amendment. Then I am informed that at \nleast Senators Alexander, Carper, and Voinovich do not intend to offer \ntheir amendment on definition, but there are other Senators who also \nhave an interest in this issue. So it is not for sure that we are not \ngoing to have an amendment on that issue.\n  As I mentioned, moratorium and the grandfather issues need to be \naddressed, and Senator Lautenberg's amendment addresses the issue of \ngrandfathering. So we await his arrival in hopes that we can get that \ndisposed of, and then the Lott amendment and then we would be ready to \nmove to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning we came to the floor and were \nconfronted with a situation where we tried to get an extension of a \nhighway bill. That was objected to by the senior Senator from the State \nof Missouri. We talked a little bit at that time, and what we talked \nabout is, basically, if there is no extension given--which has been \ncleared on our side, by the way--there will be some 5,000 Federal \nemployees of the U.S. Department of Transportation laid off. They may \nbe able to wait until Monday, but certainly they will be able to wait \nno longer.\n  What does this mean? It means new highway and bridge projects will be \nshelved. It will stop reimbursement payments to the States for projects \nalready incurred. It will halt safety grants to the States. It will \nstop work on transit construction in the Nation's cities and towns. It \nwill interrupt enforcement of motor carrier safety regulations. It will \ndisrupt inspection efforts at our Nation's borders. All we are asking \nis a temporary extension.\n  I said this morning, and I say tonight, Senator Inhofe has been a \nreal soldier. He has been with us every step of the way to get a \nhighway bill that is meaningful. No one can question the conservative \ncredentials of Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nnoted for being a person who watches where the money is spent. But he \nrecognizes the bill we reported and passed in the Senate, a bill that \nwas some $318 billion, is legislation that is important for the \ncountry. It is important for the State of Oklahoma. It is important for \nthe State of Nevada. It is important for the State of Rhode Island. It \nis important for the State of Virginia, and every other State I see \nrepresented on this Senate floor--which is no other State at this time.\n  This is something we have to do. I think it would be a terrible \nshame, and I can't imagine the reason that my friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Missouri, has used for wanting to object to this \nextension.\n  He says: I want a conference appointed.\n  Mr. President, we have said there are other ways of arriving at this. \nThere are other ways of having legislation approved by the body, by the \nHouse, and sent to the President.\n  I have in my hand bills enacted into law without using conferencing. \nThis is an effort to negotiate differences in language between the \nHouse and the Senate. We have, just in the 108th Congress, 21 different \nmeasures, important measures: TANF, military family relief, Tax Relief \nAct, veterans' benefits, and many other pieces of legislation--18 \nothers, to be specific.\n  I think it is a tightrope I would not want to go to Nevada on, saying \nthat I objected to the highway bill and I am closing the Department of \nTransportation because the minority won't agree to a conference. I \ndon't think that is very good reasoning. I think the people of the \ncountry would also think it is not good reasoning.\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\n  We have worked, in a bipartisan manner, to produce a highway bill in \nthe Senate. That legislation achieved 76 votes. We received a letter \nfrom 20 Republican Senators, dated today, supporting the Senate funding \nlevels. These are Republican Senators, 20 Senators. These are Senators, \nany one of which----\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for the parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At what time does the Pastore rule apply?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not apply postcloture.\n  Mr. REID. Three hours. Pastore works 3 hours after we take up a \nmeasure. So that wouldn't apply here.\n  I appreciate my friend's interest.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. But we are postcloture and germane debate is \nrequired.\n  Mr. REID. Certainly, I understand that totally. Mr. President, the \nreason I understand that is the legislation that is before this body, \nthis Internet legislation, has so many ramifications that are important \nto what is going on in the country today. One of the things going on in \nthe country today is how we have improved the way we work on \ntransportation generally. But for the high-tech industry we couldn't do \nmany of the things that are done today. There are many different things \nwe do today that we didn't do 5 years ago, or even 10 years ago as a \nresult of computerization.\n  The vehicles on the roads now, with some exceptions in the State of \nNevada, Department of Transportation vehicles, have computers in them. \nSo I have no qualms, using my hour's time on this legislation, talking \nabout the importance of the highway bill and, of course, the fact is, \nwith the highway bill there are many high-tech propositions that would \nbe affected by this underlying legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter. I would read all the names, but, \nfrankly, I can't read them because I can't read some of the signatures. \nBut I do see one signature that jumps out at me: Elizabeth Dole. She \nhas been Cabinet Secretary two or three times, but one of those times \nshe was a Secretary. In one of our President's Cabinets she was \nSecretary of Transportation.\n  Elizabeth Dole is one of those supporting the $318 billion bill. \nVirtually every Senator on the Democratic side supports it. That is 69 \nvotes right there.\n  I hope what we are doing today is only for a short time. We need in \nthe worst way to find out a way of getting Senator Bond to agree to \nthis extension. This Nation expects nothing less.\n  The Republican leadership is going to meet today or tomorrow and talk \nabout what they think should be the size of this bill. The vast \nmajority--far more than 67 Senators, the veto-proof number of \nSenators--believe we should have a higher number.\n  It is very clear. If a bill came to the Senate or the House with $318 \nbillion for highway transit, we would override any veto of the \nPresident. Why? Because this bill does not raise the debt. It is paid \nfor out of trust fund money, and revenue streams are already in place.\n  Not only do we have a lot of people supporting this legislation, as I \nindicated earlier today--and it is now in the Record--but we have \nhundreds of organizations that support this legislation: U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce; Laborers International Union of North America; Associated \nGeneral Contractors--they are not together very often on anything--\nAmerican Road & Transportation Builders Association; International \nUnion of Operating Engineers; American Public Transportation \nAssociation; National Asphalt Pavement Association; National Stone, \nSand & Gravel Association; Association of Equipment Manufacturers; \nAmerican Waterways Operators; Air Transport Association; and Waterways \nWork.\n  These are only a few of the hundreds of organizations that want us to \nproceed.\n  I hope we can do this. It would be a shame to lay off 5,000 people. \nThe impact it would have on their immediate families is important. But \nthe impact it would have on this country--we are just beginning to come \nout of a recession, so I am told. We are really fighting for jobs. One \nway to work to have more jobs is to keep the highway program going.\n  This legislation that is before the Senate is about as high tech as \nyou can get. We know for every $1 billion spent in infrastructure \ndevelopment, 47,500 jobs are generated. That is important. That is only \nfor direct jobs, and thousands of other jobs are spun off from that.\n  I hope we can move forward. I understand the importance of consumer-\nfriendly legislation. Let us please not have an objection to this \nlegislation.\n  I am not going to ask unanimous consent until Senator Bond has some \nknowledge that I will do that. But I will do that later in the day.\n  I appreciate everyone's courtesy. I know they stretched the rule a \nlittle bit for me. I am very grateful. Even though the highway bill is \nhigh tech, I am not sure it is that high tech.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would never, ever believe that my friend \nfrom Nevada would stretch any of the Senate rules. Of course, I \nappreciate his real knowledge of the rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3082 to Amendment No. 3048\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3082, which is my \namendment to the McCain underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3082 to amendment No. 3048.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To extend the 1998 grandfather from 3 years to 4 years)\n\n       On page 5, line 2, strike ``2006'' and insert ``2007''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to explain exactly what is \ninvolved, it is quite simple. The amendment would extend the 1998 \ngrandfather coverage in the bill from 3 years to 4 years. I support \nending this grandfather provision for States that had already enacted \nsome Internet tax by 1998. I support phasing that out.\n  I would like to have this issue dealt with in a broad, comprehensive \nway. I hope the Commerce Committee will do that in the next year or \ntwo. I felt that 3 years was enough of an extension of that grandfather \nclause. But I have talked to a number of Senators on both sides of the \naisle who say that in the interest of fairness you have the grandfather \nclause phased out in 3 years, and this bill is for 4 years. Wouldn't it \nbe fairer, and we would be more supportive of it, if we could get these \ntwo provisions in the same position?\n  For that reason, I filed an amendment yesterday just before 1 \no'clock. I have discussed this with Senator Stevens, Senator McCain, \nand Senator Wyden. Members on both sides are aware of what this \namendment is. Senator Sununu had some reservations about it but \nunderstands what we have done.\n  We are prepared to go forward with this amendment now. I am willing \nto do it because I think it is so important that we have Senators who \nfeel good about this legislation and believe it is fair so we can get a \nbill, get it now, and deal with this moratorium after these many months \nof laboring to do the right thing.\n  That is basically what this is all about. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it and it can be accepted, hopefully, on a voice vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis very adroit, as always, capable work on this issue and moving this \nlegislation along.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, who feels very \nstrongly about this issue. I know we will be revisiting this issue \nagain.\n  I thank my colleagues. I strongly recommend that we agree to the \namendment by voice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have no objections to the amendment that \nis being offered by my colleague from Mississippi. We discussed the \namendment earlier today. It is an amendment\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nI support. I hope we can agree to it without a recorded vote. I think \nthat makes sense.\n  I might say while addressing this at the moment that I am trying to \nget in touch with Senator Feinstein to determine whether she intends to \noffer an amendment on this subject. I believe that is perhaps the last \namendment on our side of which we need to try to determine the \ndisposition. As soon as we determine what that is, I will let Senator \nMcCain know.\n  Once again, I do not object at all to the amendment offered by \nSenator Lott. I think a voice vote is in order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is no further debate on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3082) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this appears to \nbe a moment where we are waiting for other Senators to be contacted to \nfurther work on amendments that may or may not be offered. I want to \ntake this opportunity to say something positive about this institution \nwhich has been having difficulties lately.\n  This bill shows what you can do when Senators will work together on a \nvery difficult issue. Senators prefer not to vote on this issue. We \nhave friends on both sides--all of us. We have heard from our \nGovernors, mayors, and from the industry. We have heard from all \ndifferent points of view. But with the tenacity and persistence of \nSenator Allen, Senator Wyden, the chairman of the committee, and the \nmanager on the Democratic side--they have some feel for what this \ninstitution can do and should do. I think they all deserve a lot of \ncredit. We may actually get something done. This is something that \nneeds to be done and something of which we can all be proud.\n  I was talking to Senator Daschle earlier today repeating my oft-\nstated opinion that when you govern and when you produce results, \neverybody wins regardless of party. That is what we are really here \nfor.\n  I say to those who are on the other side of this issue--former \nGovernors, of course, led by Senator Alexander, Senator Carper, and \nSenator Voinovich--they have been eloquent in their presentations. They \nhave made us all uncomfortable with the points they made while \nsubmitting their arguments. They have been dogged, but they have also \nbeen reasonable.\n  If we get this bill completed today, the people on all sides can feel \ngood about how it was done. I commend all concerned. It makes me feel \ngood for a change about what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3104 to Amendment No. 3048\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have submitted an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Lautenberg, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3104 to amendment No. 3048.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Comptroller General to study the impact of the \n    Internet Tax Freedom Act on State and local governments and on \n                         broadband development)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GAO STUDY OF EFFECTS OF INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM ON \n                   STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ON BROADBAND \n                   DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       The Comptroller General shall conduct a study of the impact \n     of the Internet tax moratorium, including its effects on the \n     revenues of State and local governments and on the deployment \n     and adoption of broadband technologies for Internet access \n     throughout the United States, including the impact of the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note) on build-out of \n     broadband technology resources in rural under served areas of \n     the country. The study shall compare deployment and adoption \n     rates in States that tax broadband Internet access service \n     with States that do not tax such service, and take into \n     account other factors to determine whether the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act has had an impact on the deployment or adoption \n     of broadband Internet access services. The Comptroller \n     General shall report the findings, conclusions, and any \n     recommendations from the study to the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce no later \n     than November 1, 2005.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer an amendment, No. 3104, to the \nMcCain substitute amendment to S. 150, the Internet Access Tax \nMoratorium bill. My amendment, if adopted, would require the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, to conduct a study on the impact of the \nmoratorium and report its findings back to Congress by November 1, \n2005.\n  GAO would be tasked with analyzing the revenue impact of the Internet \ntax moratorium on State and local governments. GAO would also be tasked \nwith analyzing the effect of the moratorium on the deployment and \nadoption of broadband technologies for Internet access throughout the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment directs GAO to compare deployment and adoption rates in \nStates that tax broadband Internet access service with States that do \nnot tax such service, and to take into account other factors to \ndetermine whether the Internet Tax Freedom Act has had a positive \nimpact on the deployment and adoption of broadband Internet access \nservices.\n  Having GAO conduct such a study is important because we simply don't \nknow what the real impact of this legislation will be on the tax \nrevenues of State and local government. The way Internet ``access'' is \ndefined in the bill, it could be a giant loophole ripe for exploitation \nby telecommunications companies, especially with regard to the emerging \nmarket of Internet telephony, which is commonly referred to as ``Voice \nover Internet Protocol'', VoIP. Tax and public utility officials I have \nspoken with in New Jersey are very worried that S. 150 could cost the \nState and jurisdictions within the State hundreds of millions of \ndollars annually. This is revenue they desperately need to provide \nessential services.\n  Furthermore, we simply don't know what the real impact of this \nlegislation will be on the telecommunications industry and on future \nbroadband deployment, both of which are so important to our economy. \nSupporters of the bill claim that the moratorium is essential. But I \nwould note that three economists at the University of Tennessee \ncompared Internet access rates in jurisdictions with Internet taxes and \njurisdictions without any such taxes. The access rates were the same. \nIn other words, the moratorium may not be having any beneficial effect. \nThat is something we need to find out.\n  Mr. President, I understand that my amendment will be adopted and I \nappreciate Chairman McCain's support for it. I think it is an eminently \nreasonable amendment, and I hope that it can be protected in the \nConference Committee deliberations on this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Lautenberg's amendment calls for a GAO study on \nbroadband for the effects of tax moratorium on State and local \neconomies and other impacts of this Internet tax moratorium. I find it \na very valuable amendment. It would be very helpful because this is a \nmoratorium, not a permanent ban. It would be very helpful as we debate \nthis issue, which I imagine will start again in a year or so.\n  The Lautenberg amendment is a good amendment. Senator Lautenberg is a \nconferee, and I know Senator Dorgan will agree we will fight to make \nsure this GAO study is included.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the Lautenberg amendment. His \nsuggestion makes a great deal of sense. I hope we can voice vote the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3104) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As far as I know--and Senator Dorgan is more aware than I \nam--we have one more amendment we agreed to which I hope to propose \nwithin a couple of minutes. Senator Feinstein may or may not be \nproposing an amendment. We will find out shortly. Then we would be \nprepared to go to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while we are awaiting the amendment and \nthe presence or decision on Senator Feinstein's amendment, I wish to \nmake a couple of comments about individuals. I specifically speak of \nSenator Alexander, Senator Voinovich, and Senator Carper, who fought \nvery hard and valiantly on this issue. We have honest differences of \nopinion on this issue.\n  It is very likely we will pass this legislation, but Senator \nAlexander, Senator Voinovich, Senator Carper, and Senator Dorgan have \nhad an enormous impact. We have gone from a permanent ban to a 4-year \nmoratorium. We are changing the definition of voice over Internet \nprotocol. We have made significant changes to this legislation thanks \nto their efforts.\n  Throughout, our debate has been characterized by mutual respect and \nunderstanding that we just have fundamental differences of opinion. I \ncongratulate them on a battle well fought. Although they may have lost \nin passage of the legislation, they improved it dramatically, and I say \nthat from a position on both sides of the issue. They brought into play \ntheir backgrounds as Governors of their respective States and bring a \nmuch needed perspective to this body. I congratulate them for their \nvery outstanding work, particularly over the long period of time we \nhave been involved in this issue.\n  If we pass this bill shortly--and we may not--there are two \nindividuals who deserve the credit: Senators Allen and Wyden, who took \nup this legislation years ago, and followed it. They have been \nrelentless, dedicated advocates, and have brought their debate and \ndiscussion all over America. They have done an outstanding job. They \nare the ones who, I believe, deserve the credit on all of it for the \nmagnificent work they have done on an issue that is of great importance \nand profound importance to small and large businesses all over America. \nI thank them for their valued efforts.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before the Senator leaves the floor, I don't want to turn \nthis into a bouquet-tossing contest, but I came to the Senate in the \nwinter of 1996 as a new member of the Commerce Committee. The chairman \nof the committee was exceptionally helpful in terms of working on the \nlegislation then. We have gone through two iterations already.\n  Senator Dorgan and I have spent untold numbers of hours talking about \nthis vastly important bill, more than either of us would have wanted. \nThe Senator from Virginia is here as well, and the fact that he has \nbeen involved so extensively has been an enormous help. The Senator \nfrom Virginia has consistently talked about standing up for freedom. He \nis absolutely right.\n  There is a reason the Gray Panthers, for example, are for this \nlegislation. They and millions of other consumers understand how \nimportant it is that we not hammer Internet access.\n  We will have other debates with respect to the future of the \nInternet. Certainly the Senator from North Dakota has talked \npassionately, for example, about a project the Governors were talking \nabout, the streamlined sales tax concept. So we will have these other \ndebates.\n  But the chairman of the Commerce Committee, who was so gracious to me \nand the Senator from Virginia, helped us consistently through this 8-\nyear-long battle. I want the chairman of the Commerce Committee to know \nI am very appreciative of all of the help and support he has given us \nin this cause.\n  We are going to be wrapping up the work of the Senate in just a few \nminutes, and a lot of people who have said it just was not in the \ncards, it just was not to be, the Senate was gridlocked--suffice it to \nsay there will be further debates as we discuss this with the other \nbody.\n  This is a very significant step forward. Every Member of the Senate, \nin my view--and I have talked to almost every Member about this on a \npersonal basis--every Member understands the value to the opportunity \nof a healthy and vibrant Internet. What we had over the last few days \nis a debate about the best set of policies to attain that objective. \nThis will not be the last debate. For example, even in an area where we \nhave come to an agreement with respect to the taxation of telephone \ncalls made over the Internet, this is not the last word. As the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and I have discussed, we still have the Federal \nCommunications Commission in a position to take a more comprehensive \nlook, for example, on how phone calls made over the Internet are going \nto be regulated and dealt with by the various jurisdictions.\n  This debate is sure to continue for many days ahead, but this is a \nbanner day. This is a day when the Senate has made some judgments that \nwill help keep the Internet healthy and vibrant in the days ahead. That \nis a great success. I commend my colleagues for being patient enough to \ndeal with the subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3550\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a few moments ago, my good friend from \nNevada talked about how the highway transportation system in Nevada \ndepends upon the Internet and all the technology there. And I agree \nwith him. We are very proud of the technology, the intelligence \ntransportation systems, and other things we have in our Missouri \nDepartment of Transportation, our highway entity.\n  I was very pleased he read off a list of people who support the \nmeasure we passed in the Senate. That just reinforces what I have said \nfor a long time. We had an overwhelming vote to get the number of $255 \nbillion for highways. We had an overwhelming vote to get a bill to the \nfloor. We had an overwhelming vote of 76 to 21 to pass a good 6-year \nhighway bill.\n  My good friend from Nevada worked very closely with us. I tell you, \nas long as I have been in the Senate, I do not know if we ever had \nbetter bipartisan cooperation than Senator Inhofe and I on the \nRepublican side have had with Senator Jeffords and Senator Reid on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. President, 11 weeks ago, we passed this wonderful highway bill. \nThis, what I hold in my hand, is the highway bill. It passed \noverwhelmingly. It is a 6-year, $318 billion bill for all of \ntransportation. Do you know what? It is still sitting at the desk. I \nwas on this floor raising Cain with our House colleagues because they \nwould not move. I believe my friend from Nevada joined with us.\n  Well, they moved. It will be 4 weeks tomorrow that they moved. Now, \nsomething that maybe a lot of people don't understand is, when you pass \na bill like this, it doesn't go into the President's hands; it doesn't \nbecome law. You have to take some procedural steps to move it out of \nhere. You have to substitute this bill for the House bill. You have to \ninsist on a conference. You have to name conferees and send it back to \nthe House--procedural items.\n  For most of the time I have been here, it happens automatically. Once \nyou have a conference, then the Republican and Democratic conferees \nfrom the House sit down with the Republican and Democratic conferees \nfrom the Senate, and you can move forward.\n  But do you know what. We are stuck. We are stymied. Senator Reid \nwants to know what we can do. I say, very simply, what we need to do is \nto stop blocking the transfer of this bill back into conference with \nthe House. What part of ``yes'' don't you understand? This is a simple \nmatter. Now we have kicked the can down the road. We have had \nextensions and extensions, and we can't sit down and talk with our \nHouse colleagues.\n  And I said: Wait a minute. We have intelligence transportation \nsystems in Missouri and every other State in the Nation. We have a need \nfor good highways, roads, and bridges, to promote our homeland \nsecurity, to create jobs, to relieve congestion, to promote long-term \neconomic growth, and for safety. At least a third of the 43,000 people \nkilled on highways every year in the Nation are killed because of \nunsafe highways.\n  So my good friend from Nevada wants to know what he can do to get an \nextension; and I said so this morning. I said: It is very easy. Let us \nmove forward on the bill. We have tough issues to work out with the \nWhite House. We cannot work on those issues until we can sit down with \nthe House and move forward. We have been\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nblocked by the actions of the other side.\n\n  I asked unanimous consent this morning to move forward, and the \ndistinguished minority whip on the other side had another unanimous \nconsent request. I said I would be happy to accept his if he accepts \nthis one. Let's move the process forward. This is not rocket science. \nThis is a necessary procedural step.\n  I am going home to Missouri this weekend. And do you know what. \nPeople are going to ask me: Why haven't you passed a highway bill? I \nwould not be surprised if at least 90 percent of the Members of this \nbody are asked the same question: Why haven't you passed a highway \nbill? One simple answer: 76 Members of this body voted for it, but now \nthe other side objects to the procedural steps we need to take to move \nthis into conference.\n  Nothing is going to happen until we move this bill into conference. \nThis is not some strange procedure. Up until this year, this has been \nthe normal procedure. Maybe if my colleague is sufficiently concerned \nabout the extension, maybe if I renewed my request, he would be willing \nto move the bill forward.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the House-passed highway bill, H.R. \n3550; provided further that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of S. 1072, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof; the \nbill then be read a third time and passed; further that the Senate then \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the \nChair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, with a ratio of 11 to 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have a \nbill that is about to be completed, and I do not want to interfere. I \nhave a statement that will take a few minutes. But I want the Record \nspread with the fact that after I do object, sometime before the day is \nout I will renew my request for the 2-month extension together with a \nstatement.\n  So at this time, I say to the two managers of the bill, do you want \nto do something on this bill that is now before the Senate? I ask, \nthrough the Chair, the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, are you ready to do something right now on the bill? \nOtherwise, I will give my statement.\n  As I said to the Chair, I do not want to take away from moving this \nbill forward if people are ready to do something. But we are waiting \nfor Senator Feinstein, I understand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. Please proceed.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond, Senator Feinstein has \nactually left her office and is on her way.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly. When she shows \nup, I will finish within a couple minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am sorry there continues to be an \nobjection. I do not want to hold up this bill any longer. I want to see \nthe Internet tax moratorium bill pass. I want to see us move forward on \nhighways and transportation. I felt it was necessary to come down to \nclarify, based on what my good friend from Nevada said, that I am \ntrying to move the process along. And when he asks his unanimous \nconsent, I would ask that my unanimous consent be added to it so we can \nmove forward. That is all we are doing.\n\n  This is very simple, standard procedure. I appreciate the time of the \nmanagers and everybody else. But there are an awful lot of people in \nthis country who are waiting for a good 6-year Transportation bill, one \nlike we passed in this Senate.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' time. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be the third extension of this \nvery important legislation. The first extension was the 5-month \nextension. We did that because we could not get our act together: \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and this Senator. As a \nresult of that, we got a commitment from the majority leader and the \nminority leader we could take up this bill at a specified time in \nFebruary. Everyone lived up to that agreement, and we did that. Within \nalmost a record period of time, we passed this very important \nlegislation. So that was the reason for the first extension.\n  The second extension was necessary because the House had not yet done \ntheir legislating. We asked for a 2-month extension on this matter on \nFebruary 27.\n  At that time Senators McCain and Lieberman objected to that extension \nbecause they had some problems with the 9/11 Commission. As a result of \nthat, a number of us came to the floor and said: How could Senator \nMcCain and Senator Lieberman do such a thing? And in the process, \nstatements were made, some of which were by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  I quote from the Congressional Record of that date. I will not read \nthe whole statement. I will read that which is pertinent. This is a \nquote from the distinguished Senator from Missouri:\n\n       What the Senators from Arizona and Connecticut are doing is \n     seeking to hold hostage the whole highway program in the \n     United States.\n\n  I agree. That is what is happening now.\n  The Senator further went on to say:\n\n       This extension expires on Sunday.\n\n  Just as it does now.\n\n       If we fail to extend this, there will be a shutdown of any \n     further contract authority for Federal aid highway projects \n     and a shutdown of payments for work already contracted for by \n     the States and performed by contractors. This means no \n     further projects can be approved or awarded. It also means \n     that not only the Federal Highway Administration but also the \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal \n     Motor Carrier Administration, as well as the Bureau of \n     Transportation Statistics, will cease operation.\n\n  Skipping:\n\n       Not only are we talking about people's livelihoods, we are \n     shutting down the Federal agencies, which will have an \n     adverse consequence for our Nation's highways, motor carrier \n     safety, and consequentially for the condition and operation \n     of our Nation's surface transportation system.\n\n  Skipping down two more paragraphs:\n\n       Jobs will be lost in the private sector. An extension is \n     bad enough, but a complete disruption of the program when \n     there are crucial job needs across the country will have an \n     economic impact on the families directly, and on the economy.\n\n  Next paragraph:\n\n       We need the extension to stop playing politics with \n     people's jobs in this most important legislation.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will shortly.\n  I could not have said it better myself. That is what we are facing \nright now. We are facing a shutdown of jobs. We will furlough 5,000 \npeople in the agencies that were referred to on February 27 by my \nfriend.\n  The people of this country should understand there are different ways \nof getting a bill to the President's desk. It is not necessarily with a \nconference. I have told Senator Inhofe and Senator Frist that does not \nmean we are not going to go to conference.\n  I say to my friends, anyone within the sound of my voice, if \nconferees were appointed right now, immediately, the first thing we \nwould do is say: OK, staff, majority staff, minority staff, majority \nand minority staff from the House, get together and work on this. See \nwhat you can come up with. Bring it back to us. That would take a \ncouple of weeks to do that.\n\n  Then we would work through whatever they couldn't work through \nthemselves. Finally, the Members would agree on certain things. Then if \nthere were things we could not agree on, we would take it to the full \nconference.\n  We are weeks and weeks away from that if we appoint a conference \nright now. The point is, we are not appointing conferences right now \nbecause, as I said before, we have on many occasions, more than 20 \ntimes already in this year's Congress, passed legislation by what we \ncall preconferencing it. It does not matter what you call it.\n  I have the same goal as the Senator from Missouri. We want a highway \nbill. I appreciate and admire and respect his energy in helping arrive \nat this bill where we now have a bill that is good\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nfor the American people, a 6-year bill, $318 billion that is good for \nroads and transit.\n  I hope the Senator has made his point, but I do believe we need to \nget this short 2-month extension done and then if there is something \nthat comes up in 2 months that the Senator thinks we are not making \nprogress on the legislation, then he may want to try something such as \nthis again.\n  I yield to my friend who said he had a question.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Nevada for reciting the deathless prose that I shared with this \nbody the last time we were trying to get an extension. I made those \nstatements because the highway bill is so important.\n  I ask my friend if he understands my message today--I know what the \nprocess is like; we go through this process of appointing conferees, \nand it takes a long time to get it done--if he understands that the way \nto move forward is to stop objecting to the simple procedural process \nof substituting this bill for the House bill, reading it a third time, \npassing it, naming conferees, sending it to the House and asking for a \nconference, all he has to do is to say yes to the unanimous consent \nrequest. I will say yes to his request and we can get on with the \nbusiness. This is absolutely an unnecessary procedural delay. Every day \nwe fail to appoint conferees, we are further down the road.\n  Did I make myself clear to my friend from Nevada? If he will agree to \ntake the procedural steps, I will be happy to remove my objection to \nthe extension.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in answer to the Senator from Missouri's \nquestion, I certainly understand the point he is making. I simply do \nnot agree.\n  I, therefore, at a subsequent time before we adjourn this evening, \nwill ask unanimous consent that the Senate pass a 2-month extension, \nsomething the House has already done.\n  At this time Senator Feinstein has arrived and I would only end by \nsaying that I personally would not want to return to Nevada, \nrecognizing that I would not agree to a 2-month extension. In Nevada, \nit would wreak havoc with the growth of the State there.\n  The fact is, even where there is not rapid growth, as in Nevada, \nthere are repairs that must be done. The construction season is upon \nus. Some of these projects will never go forward.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3105 to Amendment No. 3048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Allen, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Carper, \n     and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 3105 to \n     amendment No. 3048.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8 strike lines 1 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1108. EXCEPTION FOR VOICE SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET.\n\n       ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to effect the \n     imposition of tax on a charge for voice or similar service \n     utilizing Internet Protocol or any successor protocol. This \n     section shall not apply to any services that are incidental \n     to Internet access, such as voice-capable e-mail or instant \n     messaging.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I submit the amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Allen, Senator Voinovich, Senator Alexander, Senator \nDorgan, Senator Carper, and Senator Wyden. It refines the language \nconcerning the voice over Internet protocol. It is a product of an \nagreement of language between all of us. I ask for its consideration.\n  Before I do that, I believe Senator Feinstein has an amendment she \nwants to propose. I hope we can get an agreement, say, 40 minutes \nequally divided, if that would be agreeable.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That would be fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Forty minutes equally divided, followed by a recorded \nvote, which would then be followed by final passage. I ask unanimous \nconsent that after disposal of the pending amendment, no more \namendments be in order, that there be 40 minutes equally divided \nbetween myself and Senator Feinstein, a vote on the amendment, followed \nimmediately by a final passage recorded vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I direct this question to \nthe manager of the bill, Senator Dorgan. Is that correct, that all \namendments have been offered?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, to my knowledge, all of the amendments \nthat have been previously noticed would not be offered. We have tried \nto check with the authors. A number of them would not be in order \npostcloture. We have checked with the authors of the amendments that \nwere noticed. My understanding is that there are no amendments on this \nside other than Senator Feinstein. At least we have not been notified \nthat there is an amendment out there other than Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. REID. I would say also to the two managers of the bill, then we \nshould be advised there will be at least two more votes, perhaps on \nFeinstein and final passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I would say also to my two friends, I always like to have \nthe trains run on time. This is excellent work. I appreciate this. I \nthought it couldn't be done today. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is agreeing to amendment No. 3105.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Is it appropriate for me to make a few remarks on the \nMcCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I won't take many minutes, but I wanted to do this \nwhile the chairman of the committee and Senators Wyden and Allen and \nDorgan are all here. I intend to vote for this legislation tonight. \nThis is a good result.\n  Senator Lott made some comments a few minutes ago about how the \nSenate can sometimes come to a good conclusion. Before I came to the \nSenate, I spent a year and a half teaching a course in American \ncharacter at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. What we \ntalked about there was what distinguishes our country is that we agree \non a few principles. Professor Samuel Huntington pointed out that our \npolitics is a conflict between those principles. We had a conflict here \nbetween laissez-faire free market principles and federalism, and they \nare both very important.\n  We have been working hard to come to agreement, and we got a good \nresult. Senator Allen and Senator Wyden should feel very good about \nwhat they have been able to accomplish, and this has been a fashion of \ntheirs for a long time. I feel good about the fact that Senators \nCarper, Voinovich, Graham, Feinstein, and others have been able to \nremind us of the importance of a strong Federal system as we debate our \nissues, and that we promise as a Congress to do our best to minimize \nharm to State and local governments as we take important actions here.\n  So what pleases me about the result is what Senator McCain talked \nabout--moving from a permanent ban to 4 years. I think that is good. \nFar and away, the most important result is the clarification that \nSenator McCain has been able to achieve on the question of whether we \nare trying to decide what to do about telephone calls made over the \nInternet. That is not what we are trying to do with this legislation. \nWe had that in our mind on both sides, but we have not been able to \nagree on that. That is far and away the biggest issue for State and \nlocal governments, because they collect up to $18 billion a year in \ntaxes on telephone services. That may change as time goes on, but we \ndid not want ambiguous language, or a misunderstanding, or to run the \nrisk during the period of this moratorium--which we prefer to call a \ntemporary timeout--that anyone would think we were trying to decide the \nissue of what to do about telephone calls made over the Internet.\n  Senator McCain's amendment makes that clear and it speaks for itself. \nAlso, he has been able, through his final suggestion, to leave some \ngrandfather extensions in the bill. I would like to see more. We will \nhave a chance to vote on more in a minute.\n  The area where we did not go as far as we would like on our side was \nin the definition. It expands the tax exempt coverage to what we call \nthe backbone and a number of other Internet activities. But this is a \ngood result. It should be a wake-up call to Members of the Congress \nthat this is the fastest-growing new technology in America. It is\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\ngoing to change the way we live, and it should be a wake-up call to us \nwho care about federalism--all of us, and Governors and mayors \neverywhere--that we are going to have to do careful, creative, \nconstructive thinking about what the impact of this is on our Federal \nsystem. What does it do to Governors, mayors, and county commissioners?\n  We are making a temporary decision here, but the Commerce Committees \nof this Congress have already said they are going to take the issue up \nin November. So from where we started in December, to where we are \ntoday, I feel very good about it.\n  I especially thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee, who has, \nfrom the beginning, in terms of allowing me to testify before the \ncommittee--I am not a member of the Commerce Committee; this is not an \narea in which I am usually involved--he respected my effort, and that \nof others, to push the issue of federalism forward. I thank him for \nhelping us create a very good result.\n  So while I intend to be a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein's bill, I \nbelieve that what we have achieved so far goes a long way in minimizing \nthe effect of this legislation on doing harm to State and local \ngovernments. It taught all of us that this is an issue we need to learn \nmore about to make sure we deal with it intelligently.\n  I thank you for the time. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nleadership. Also, Senator Allen and Senator Wyden have been congenial \nas well as effective in their work. I am grateful for that as well. I \nhave enjoyed working with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the McCain \namendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator McCain has offered this amendment \nwith agreement from all of us who have participated earlier today in a \nmeeting to discuss areas of disagreement. This was one of the areas of \ndisagreement. It is called VOIP, voice over Internet protocol. We had \nconcern about the section of the McCain substitute that dealt with this \ntopic.\n  After a meeting, we were able to reach agreement on the language. So \nwhat Senator McCain is now offering is an amendment to his substitute \nwhich actually deals with this issue in a manner that is consistent \nwith the intent of everyone who has participated in the meeting. I am \npleased to support it. I think it improves this bill and adds to the \nbill language that reflects the intent of all of us who have worked \ntogether on it.\n  So I fully support the amendment offered by Senator McCain. There is \nno objection to passing it by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Delaware would like to make a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have listened, and I understand we are \ndebating--actually embracing--the McCain amendment to modify the \nlanguage that would ensure States which have traditionally been able to \nderive revenue from telephone communications would continue to be able \nto do that. As we go forward in time--and those communications are \nexpected to migrate to the Internet--we want to make sure we don't \nundercut the ability of States to continue to derive some revenues from \nthis.\n  We had a good exchange an hour or so ago among Senators Alexander, \nVoinovich, myself, and our friends who have different views on the \noverall bill. I am pleased we were able to come to an agreement, not \njust in spirit but in letter as well. We all said we were interested in \nthe same thing. We don't want to undercut the bill. The language in the \noriginal amendment did not appear to do that--at least to us. We would \nrather not have ambiguity going forward.\n  At a future date, if there is a court hearing and a judge is looking \nat the language, trying to figure out what we meant, we want the judge \nto understand very clearly that this body, the Congress, has no \ninterest in taking away the ability of States to raise revenue from a \nlongstanding traditional source--some say it goes back to the time when \nAlexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. I don't know if the tax \nhas been around that long, but I think this preserves that for the \nStates, and that is important, as telephone communications migrate to \nthe Internet.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators McCain, Allen, and Wyden, for working \nwith us. In fact, our staffs helped thread the needle in a very \nconstructive and tough way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3105) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3052, As Modified, to Amendment No. 3048\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have sent a modification to the desk \nto amendment No. 3052.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3052, as modified, to amendment No. 3048.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To extend the grandfathers for the term of the moratorium \n                               extension)\n\n       On page 5, line 20, strike ``2005.'' and insert ``2007.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, essentially, this is a one-line \namendment. It takes page 5 of the bill and strikes the date 2005 and \ninserts 2007.\n  Essentially, this amendment makes both grandfather clauses in the \nbill 4-years in duration. This would mean no new taxes for the industry \nthat is concerned, and the cities and counties would not lose the \nrevenue they currently receive, for at least 4 years.\n  I want to say again--I said this yesterday--not one single California \ncompany that supports this bill has contacted me, but I have heard from \nrepresentatives of 478 cities in the State saying: Please, don't do \nthis. It may well be because in California, local jurisdictions have \nvery limited revenue sources. It is either the property tax or a small \namount of sales tax or if they have a hotel tax, but there are not many \ntax vehicles. So utility user taxes, as well as telephone taxes, have \nfor many cities been a critical part of their budget, for some up to 15 \npercent. That is just a fact. California may be an anomaly. Maybe I \nknow this because I have been a mayor for 9 years and a county \nsupervisor for 9 years.\n  This would affect telecommunications services, taxes that have been \nin place since the old moratorium was enacted, particularly local \nexchange.\n  For the city of Los Angeles, whose chief administrative officer, \nWilliam Fujioka, has said his city could lose $40 million a year if \nlocal exchange service is not protected. So this grandfather clause to \nthe largest city in my State is worth $40 million a year of taxes that \nhave been levied, of revenues that are counted upon to balance the \nbudget.\n  Senator Inouye joins me in cosponsoring this amendment, as do Senator \nCarper, Senator Alexander, Senator Voinovich, and Senator Hollings.\n  It seems to me that it is not unreasonable to say to hard-pressed \ncities and counties that you have 4 years to find other revenue sources \nor make the necessary cuts. This does not have to be done immediately. \nNone of the companies who benefit from this bill are suffering. As a \nmatter of fact, most of them are doing very well. It is the cities that \nhave the hard time funding police officers, funding firefighters, and \nit is not easy. Nearly every city in the State of California has a \ndeficit and is losing revenues. I cannot just stand here on the floor \nof the Senate and let this happen because I have news for everybody: \nWhere people want their services is on the local level.\n  Some say: Oh, no, this will not happen. But when you ask the \ntechnical analysts and the attorneys of these communities whether it \nwill happen, they say yes.\n  I very much appreciate the change that was made in the Voice Over \nInternet Protocol language of the bill. This goes a long way. I very \nmuch appreciate the 4-year grandfather clause given for Internet \naccess. That goes a further distance.\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\n  There is this 2-year grandfather for those who use DSL or these local \nexchanges--and I do not understand why one is 4 years and the other is \n2 years. I do not understand why these companies cannot wait 4 years \nbefore they are going to end up socking it to the cities. It may be \nthat in some States this is not the case. I know it is the case in my \nState.\n  Again, I am very pleased to be joined by Senators Inouye, Alexander, \nCarper, Voinovich, and Hollings as cosponsors of this amendment. It \nseems to me to make sense. It seems a compromise which for the \nproponents should be relatively easy to make. I think it will make a \nbig difference to the cities of California.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who yields time to the \nSenator from Oregon?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I believe we have an agreement to share the \ntime. I am allocated 10 minutes to speak on this amendment. I am not \ngoing to take 10 minutes, but it will come from the allocation under \nthe agreement worked out by the chairman of the committee and the \nmanager of the bill, Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is off the chairman's time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This would come off Senator McCain's time.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, that will be fine. I will not take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California knows how much respect I \nhave for her, but I must profoundly disagree with this amendment. This \namendment would essentially reward bad behavior. What we have is a \nnumber of jurisdictions doing what clearly is in violation of the law. \nWe do not even think they are in California, but in jurisdictions \naround the country people are taxing DSL. We are convinced that is \nclearly against the law. It certainly promotes technological inequality \nbecause we have a situation where cable gets a free ride, and then they \nend up taxing DSL.\n  The Feinstein amendment would make the 2-year DSL grandfather 4 \nyears. Some of these grandfathers in this bill are going to live longer \nthan Methuselah. It certainly does not make sensible public policy, and \nit does not make sensible public policy when we would be discriminating \nagainst the future. The future is broadband, high-speed Internet access \nthrough DSL. This would allow folks to keep taxing DSL, which has \ncertainly been contrary to the spirit of everything we have done over \nthe last 7 years. It, in effect, would be rewarding bad behavior. It \nwould certainly discriminate against DSL relative to cable.\n  I think this would be a significant mistake. Certainly, there are \ndifferent technology platforms for Internet access, but for 8 years, \nthe central proposition I tried to advance on this legislation is that \nthere ought to be technological equality; that we ought not to treat \nall technologies differently. We had a number of jurisdictions violate \nthat. They have gone out and stuck it to DSL. So DSL gets taxed, and \ncable does not get taxed. We don't think it happens in California, but \nit certainly has happened around the country.\n  I do not think we ought to let these grandfathers outlive us all. \nThat is essentially where we are going on this issue. We just keep \nextending the life of these grandfathers. It is going to do great \ndamage to the country's future by particularly discouraging broadband \ndevelopment through DSL.\n  I hope the Senate will oppose the amendment. I cannot say there is \nanybody I would rather not oppose than the Senator from California. I \nagree with her on virtually everything under the Sun with respect to \npublic policy.\n  But, Mr. President, I say to the Senate, if they vote for the \nFeinstein amendment, they are rewarding bad behavior. They are \nencouraging technological inequality. We have already taken steps to \nlet some of these grandfathers live longer than I certainly would. We \nare now saying that some of them are going to make Methuselah look \nyoung. I think it is a mistake. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to be sure the record is \ncorrect. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Oregon. He knows \nI respect him and enjoy working with him. There is no problem there.\n  Let me make sure the record is correct. California's cities do not \ntax DSL. We are not one of the 27 states.\n  Mr. WYDEN. We agree.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is not the issue. The issue is the local \nexchange and because of the particular ``proposition 13'' situation \nwhere local revenues are so restricted, property taxes are so \nrestricted, it is extraordinarily difficult. So utility user taxes, \nlocal exchange taxes actually play a substantial role in some smaller \ncities' budgets. That is just a fact.\n  Los Angeles, the biggest city, a city with a lot of problems, a city \nwith a big gang population, needs a lot of police. Some of that police \nforce is actually funded from this local exchange money, which totals \n$40 million a year.\n  I yield time to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. May I ask \nhow much time he would like.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Three minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 3 minutes of my time to Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from California for her leadership \non this issue. From the beginning, because of her background as mayor \nof San Francisco, she has had a clear understanding of the effect of \nthis debate on the ability of cities and States to do what they are \nexpected to do, and the importance of our Federal system of government.\n  Now, Senators should consider on both sides of the aisle what this \nmeans. It means we have largely come to a consensus, at least from my \npoint of view, about what we want to do. We have decided that for the \nStates that were already taxing Internet access in 1998, they should \nhave 4 years more as we have a 4-year moratorium on new taxes.\n  What the Senator from California is saying is, then the States that \nare taxing Internet access that is delivered in other kinds of ways \nshould also have the same 4 years. I believe she is right. Senator \nFeinstein's position says no new taxes, no new harm, and treat all \nStates the same. That is a fair result that fits with the consensus \nthat we have developed for the rest of this legislation, and I will \nsupport it, vote for it, and cosponsor it. I hope our colleagues will \ndo the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Virginia such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, the Senator from California mentioned \nwaiting for 4 years while this bill ends. The reality is that those who \nare paying taxes right now because some States and localities have \nstarted taxing DSL in the last several years, that means consumers, \nwith the amendment that was approved in the McCain amendment, that the \nconsumers are going to be taxed for 2 more years. The design of this \nbill, as amended, is to protect taxpayers. It is to protect consumers. \nIt is to expand opportunity, jobs, and commerce to people all across \nthis country.\n  The grandfather clause that Senator McCain put in his amendments, \nparticularly on the DSL, is different than what we passed out of the \ncommittee, which was to stop these DSL taxes immediately because what \nhas happened in the last few years is some of these localities and \nStates have figured out ways around the intent of the original Internet \ntax moratorium and, indeed, are taxing the backbone. Having a 4-year \ngrandfather on DSL taxes, on the backbone, on high-speed broadband, \nrewards those who have been the most aggressive in looking at loopholes \nto tax. It is going to cause probably more litigation as well because \nit can always be argued over.\n  The reality of taxes is that they want to put them on DSL. They want \ntelecommunications taxes. Telecommunications taxes on average across \nthis country are about 15 to 17 percent. Some places it is worse than \nothers. Richmond, VA, is about the worst in the whole country. About 27 \npercent is the local tax. These are the kinds of taxes that are going \nto be imposed on DSL bills, whether from the telephone, wireless, \nBlackBerrys or Y5.\n  The issue is this is the way that our Internet access bills should \nlook, without DSL taxes on it. Here is the cost,\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n$23.90, $25, $37, whatever it may be, no taxes, clear, simple, \nunderstandable, and more affordable. If taxes are put on, the Internet \nservice bill will look like what a telephone bill looks like right now, \nand this is just one page of it, but all the local taxes, all the State \ntaxes, all the Federal taxes, again, on average in this country are \nabout 17 percent. This is what we are trying to prevent.\n  The Feinstein-Alexander amendment, though, would allow this sort of \ntaxation onto the Internet service access bill. One of the problems we \nhave, and Senator Wyden brought it up, is how do we ever get rid of \ntaxes? Guess what. Part of this tax was put in as a luxury tax on \ntelephone service to finance the Spanish American War in 1898. \nEverybody is still paying that tax. That war has been fought and won \nover 100 years ago. That is how difficult it is, nearly impossible, to \never get rid of taxes.\n\n  The McCain compromise allows those who are taxing DSL to wean \nthemselves off of that tax over 2 years. The reality is if the \ngrandfather is allowed to go on 4 years, which is the duration of the \nentire measure on the moratorium, they will never take off those taxes. \nSo I say to my colleagues, the time to act is now because this is how \nit will impact across the country.\n  Say someone wanted to e-mail from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles, CA. \nThat is going to be routed to Chicago, which has a hub, another big hub \nin Austin, across all the way to the Bay area of San Francisco that has \na hub, and then to Los Angeles. That is the way it would go. All of \nthese jurisdictions in between that 3,000 miles are going to be able to \nput on these DSL taxes. This is what we are trying to stop.\n  The ones that have been doing it--and it is unclear how many States \nare doing it at this point. Some say 8, some say 12, some say 20. The \npoint is, there is going to be 3,000 miles of taxes from localities, \nStates, and jurisdictions in between.\n  The States will have enough time with the McCain compromise, which \nis, I think, very generous to those who are advocates of allowing \ntaxation on the Internet, to have 2 more years to wean themselves off \nof it.\n  The big issue on the fiscal impact that one would hear all the time \nwas voice over IP, worrying about telephone service migrating to the \nInternet. That has been resolved. The junior Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Alexander, and I debated and discussed it. All of us worked on it, \nand finally, this afternoon we were able to get language that everyone \ncould agree upon.\n  So when folks say it is going to have such a big hit, a big cost on \nStates and localities, the voice over amendment, which we all adopted \nunanimously, will take away those fiscal impacts.\n  What we are now talking about, though, is whether there is going to \nbe 3,000 miles of taxation and subjecting Internet traffic to that sort \nof taxation. This is clearly undesirable, particularly when we are \ntrying to get high-speed broadband built out to rural and small town \ncommunities. If we start increasing taxes on DSL and broadband, it is \ngoing to make it very difficult to get companies to invest, but most \nimportantly it will mean more people will be unable to afford DSL or \nhigh-speed broadband services.\n  So I ask my colleagues to make sure we avoid this sort of taxation. \nDo not let all those States in America put on taxes like the ones we \nsee on our telephone bill. Let us make sure we act on this amendment to \ndefeat it. The defeat of this amendment will be a protection to \nconsumers, and it also will be a vote to expand economic opportunity \nand prosperity for all Americans everywhere in our country.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to defeat or vote no on the \nFeinstein-Alexander amendment because it is contrary to the \ndesirability of economic opportunity for Americans. Adding more taxes, \nor allowing these taxes to continue for 4 years, is not the policy to \nmake this country more competitive, individuals more free, with greater \nopportunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, perhaps I have been in local and State \ngovernment too long. I really do care about my brothers and sisters in \nState government and in local government.\n  I was not going to speak on the Feinstein amendment, but I have some \nstatistics about the fiscal stress on the States that would lose the \nDSL after they sunset the exemption in the next 2 years. I am here to \nurge my colleagues to support the 4-year extension for those States \nthat have used DSL.\n  The reason for it is this: The States are under one of the worst \nfiscal constraints they have been in since the Second World War. \nAlabama, projected deficit next year, $620 million; Alaska, $475 \nmillion; Arizona, the State of the Senator McCain, sponsor of the \nunderlying compromise, $1.1 billion; California, $15 billion; \nConnecticut, $200 million; Illinois, $2 billion; Indiana, $595 million; \nKentucky, $200 million; Louisiana $500 million; Minnesota, $185 \nmillion; Mississippi, $709 million--a small State, lots of money; \nMissouri, $600 million; New Jersey, $5 billion; New York, $5.1 billion; \nNorth Carolina, $400 million; Rhode Island, $188 million; South \nCarolina, $300 million.\n  The States are in trouble. If we give them an extra 2 years so they \ncan make the adjustment in terms of losing these dollars, I think it \nwill help them segue into a situation where they can get themselves \nback on track.\n  The last thing I would say is that the way this is going, I think it \ncould end up being the largest unfunded mandate on the States. We \nshould at least give these States a break.\n  I urge my colleagues to include passing the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ncomments and for his leadership.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank Senator Feinstein for yielding time and \nparticularly for offering this amendment. I would say to my colleagues, \nI believe we have made pretty good progress, not just today but over \nthe last several weeks, maybe the last several months, in terms of \nnarrowing our differences. I am encouraged by that. I hope others of us \nare as well.\n  One of the great concerns some of us had was a moratorium on the \nability of State and local governments to collect certain kinds of \nrevenues that lasted forever. I am pleased that is not the case \nanymore. We have a moratorium of a finite duration, and the duration of \nthe moratorium will be 4 years. I am encouraged that we entered into a \nhealthy negotiation on just how can we make sure State and local \ngovernments which traditionally derive revenue from telephone \noperations continue to do that. We had a good-faith negotiation, and \nthat led to an amendment offered by Senator McCain that was accepted \nunanimously. That was a very important provision.\n  There is one more issue I believe needs to be addressed. It is \naddressed in the Feinstein amendment. If somehow the Feinstein \namendment could be adopted, I believe we would have a bill--in fact, we \nwould have a bill I would vote for. I know the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Alexander, with whom I have worked very hard on these issues, \nindicated he would very likely do the same thing. For us to come from \nsort of how far apart we were to the point where we could actually vote \nfor this bill were this change enacted is no small amount of progress.\n  Some of my colleagues have said to me that this is a complex issue. \nIt is. Some have said to me I don't really understand most of these \nissues. I have studied hard. I confess there is still a good deal I \ndon't know. But I would share with my colleagues, whether you \nunderstand the intricacies of the backbone of the Internet and what DSL \nmeans, I think we understand this and I hope we could agree on this: If \nwe are going to say that on the one hand we are going to extend the \nmoratorium for 4 years, and we are going to say to State and local \ngovernments there are\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\ncertain things you can't do during those 4 years, I think there is a \ngreat virtue in saying to those States that are legally collecting \nrevenues that they can continue to do that. They have not violated the \nlaw. In fact, the old moratorium enacted in 1998 explicitly said the \nmoratorium did not apply to telecommunications services. That is what \nit said.\n  DSL has a telecom component in it. As such, States are not prohibited \nfrom taxing DSL. Around 17 States currently do. All we are asking in \nthis amendment is that the grandfather clause, both for dial-up and for \nDSL, run coterminously with the term in the McCain compromise, and that \nis 4 years.\n  If we have a 4-year moratorium, why shouldn't we have a 4-year \ngrandfather in States that are not doing anything illegal but, frankly, \nexercising their rights as sovereign States? I like that symmetry and \nbalance. What I like maybe even more is it enables those of us who \nfought very hard over these issues in recent weeks and months to \nactually come together in the end and vote for this package.\n  So I say to my colleagues, if you voted earlier today, maybe, for \ncloture, and you thought in voting for cloture you were voting for a 4-\nyear grandfather for State and local governments, you did not. What you \nthought you were voting for and what you thought you were getting, you \ndid not get. You have the opportunity now to make amends for that, and \nI hope you will do that by voting for the Feinstein amendment: 4-year \nmoratorium, 4-year grandfather. It is a good symmetry, and, frankly, it \nis a very good compromise and one that will enable us to go ahead and \nproceed on this bill and pass it and ultimately to enact it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to comment for a couple of \nminutes on the discussion that was had with Senator McCain, Senator \nDorgan, and Senator Wyden and the concern here of the \ntelecommunications taxes which have been exempted from the bill--in \nother words, those that have always been a legitimate source of revenue \nraising. I have an Ernst & Young study going back to 1999 that shows, \nfor example, in the taxes collected by California in the year 1999, on \ntelecommunications transaction taxes, the amount was $802 million. It \ndoesn't say which precise taxes those are. This is the depth of this \nproblem. This is not a small problem. What bothers me is we are moving \non without really knowing. The finance officers of the larger cities of \nCalifornia tell me one thing. The Senator from Arizona believes that is \nnot correct and says the intention of the bill is not, in fact, to make \nthese non-DSL telecommunications services tax-exempt.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield briefly? Because I have been \nfollowing this, along with the Senator from Arizona, and we may be able \nto have a colloquy to work this out.\n  California does not tax DSL now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is good. California does not tax the backbone of the \ncommunications system now. California does, based on these analyses \nthat have been given you, tax various telecommunications services. I \nthink it would be fair to all of us to say it is our desire to keep the \nstatus quo in California.\n  In other words, various services are paying telecommunications taxes \nnow. The reading of our proposal indicates there is nothing which would \nprevent California from being able to continue to impose those taxes.\n  Would it be acceptable to the Senator from California to have a \ncolloquy which would allow us to include some report language \nstipulating in those areas where communications services are being \ntaxed now that there is nothing in the McCain proposal which would \nchange that? If that would be acceptable to the Senator from \nCalifornia, we might be able to work out with the chairman of the \ncommittee and the Senator from Virginia report language and withdraw \nher amendment. That would protect the status quo in California. It \nwould, however, make sure we are not rewarding bad behavior in other \nStates around the country that tax DSL.\n  If the Feinstein amendment is offered in its current form, I will \noppose it very strongly. The Feinstein amendment, if it is offered, and \nif we can't agree on a colloquy, would promote technological \ninequality. It would nail DSL and give cable a free ride.\n  I will urge the Senate to oppose the Feinstein amendment, but I would \nbe open to report language with my colleague from California to make \nsure it is the intent of the Senate to keep the status quo in \nCalifornia where DSL isn't taxed and the backbone isn't taxed where the \nSenator has been concerned.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might respond to that question through the \nChair, we have worked with a group--the Senator from Delaware, the \nSenator from Ohio, the Senator from Tennessee--all along on this. I \ndon't know the particular situation of their States. I don't know \nwhether they tax DSL. I do know that the bill exempts \ntelecommunications, and telecommunications has been a legitimate source \nof revenue which is now affected by this grandfather clause. Obviously, \nif I could get half a loaf for my State, I do not want to sell out \nthose whom I have been working with over the last week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be given 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like an opportunity to talk \nwith the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Ohio, and the Senator \nfrom Delaware to see if we can work something out that might meet the \nconcern of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator could do that in the next few minutes \nwhile I make a couple of comments, if that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to be clear that a tax on DSL \nservices is a tax on Internet access. Seventeen States have cleverly \nfound a way to get around the Internet tax moratorium. Right now, 17 \nStates have gotten around at least the spirit if not the letter of the \nInternet tax moratorium by taxing DSL service.\n  The heart of this compromise to the original legislation had no \ngrandfathering whatsoever--none, zero. So we put in a compromise that \nwould have called for 3 years of non-DSL taxation, 2 years \ngrandfathering in for non-DSL taxes. This would have given the DSL \ntaxing States 2 years to adjust their budgets. Then we went from 3 \nyears to 4 years' moratorium, lifting the moratorium for those who are \ntaxing non-DSL taxes.\n  If we do this, we are gutting the compromise. It is unfair to DSL \nconsumers. Why should consumers in one-third of all States be treated \ndifferently from the rest of the country?\n  I strongly oppose the amendment. I would like to work out the \ncompromise as discussed between Senator Feinstein, Senator Wyden, and \nSenator Allen. I hope we can agree to it.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent to send an amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of myself and Senator Hutchison which would then allow \nthe State of Texas to have their ``access line fee'' included in the \nvoice over IP compromise language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I didn't understand exactly what was \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to consideration of the \namendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the right to object so I can understand what is \nhappening.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent for its consideration on behalf of Senator Hutchison.\n  If there is an objection, just object and let us move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the parliamentary situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Feinstein amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 15 seconds for the Senator \nfrom Arizona, and 1 minute 42 seconds for Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have compromised. We have been working \non this issue for a long period of time. This is a compromise that is \nnot widely regarded, and Senator Allen and Senator Wyden accepted this \ngrandfathering clause with great reluctance. Now the whole \ngrandfathering clause would be made moot. I don't think consumers in \none-third of all States should be treated differently than the rest of \nthe country. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has a minute 42 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the \ndiscussion. The discussion shows how rapidly we are doing something \nabout all the ramifications we may not know. This concerns me greatly.\n  This amendment is a simple amendment. It simply extends the \ngrandfather clause and secures the telecommunications areas for those \ncities and States that have been using this methodology for revenue \nraising for years. In California, in 1999, the amount was $802 million \nthat came from this area. For Los Angeles, in 1 year it is $40 million.\n  I hope Members of this body would be willing to move the 2-year \ngrandfather clause to 4 years. This gives an opportunity for this to be \nsorted out. There is a Ninth Circuit Court opinion affecting DSL and \ncable. No one knows how that will sort itself out because it just came \nout a few weeks ago. The legislation may well be affected by it.\n  All I am asking is, make the grandfather clauses in both areas even. \nRaise the 2-year in this one--which affects the local exchange of \ntelecommunications--to 4 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to table the Feinstein amendment and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett) \nand the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Breaux), \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 37, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 76 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--37\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bennett\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Kerry\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, much of Massachusetts' economy is now \nbased on technology and innovation. The high-tech industry tripled in \nMassachusetts over the past decade and drove our region's economy. The \nMassachusetts telecommunications sector employs over 110,000 workers in \nthe State. We need to support their continued growth. We need to make \nbroadband a priority since the technology can add $300 billion a year \nto the U.S. economy and generate more than 1.2 million jobs. That is \nwhy this legislation is so important.\n  The issue on final passage of the McCain compromise amendment is \nwhether the Nation continues to have a moratorium preventing taxation \non access to the Internet. I have always supported the moratorium in \nthe past, and I will do so again today.\n  I opposed cloture earlier today because I thought there was room for \nimprovement, and I wanted the Senate to take the time to get it right. \nI am pleased with the improvements that have been made during the \ncourse of today's debate.\n  Congress should not jeopardize the continued advance of information \ntechnology by allowing the tax moratorium to disappear, subjecting the \nInternet to ``multiple and discriminatory taxes.'' We clearly need to \nreinstate the moratorium. Now is the time to pass this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McCain \nsubstitute, amendment No. 3048, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3048), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n\n                             dial-up access\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President I have some concerns about the impact of S. \n150 that I wish to address to the gentleman from Oregon, the author of \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. It is my understanding that S. 150 \nprovides that Internet access services do not include \ntelecommunications services purchased by customers to obtain dial-up \naccess to the Internet. I also understand that S. 150 provides that \nonly telecommunications services purchased or used by the provider of \nInternet access in providing Internet access are included within the \nmoratorium.\n  Further, I understand that the Internet access moratorium does not \napply to the sale or use of telecommunications services that are \ncarried or ``routed'' over the internet that are not purchased or used \nto provide internet access, for example, services that are comparable \nto today's circuit switched voice but which are provided over internet \nprotocol. This is often called ``Voice Over Internet Protocol,'' or \nVOIP. Finally, to the extent that a telecommunications carrier sells \nboth internet access services and telecommunications services, I \nunderstand that the charges for internet access are covered by the \nmoratorium subject to the accounting rule covering aggregated charges \nfor internet access and telecommunications services. Am I correct in my \nanalysis of S. 150?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the question from the Senator from Minnesota, \nwho is distinguishing himself for his keen interest in technology \nissues. He is correct in his understanding of those matters and in his \nreading of the legislation. As the author of the original Internet Tax \nFreedom Act, it is my intent that when it comes to services that are \ncomparable to today's circuit switched voice but which are provided \nover internet protocol, what some call VOIP, the legislation's \nmoratorium would not apply. In other words, the internet access \nmoratorium would not apply to the sale of telecommunications services \nthat are carried or routed over the Internet that are comparable to \ncircuit switched voice services.\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \nThis bill represents a reasonable compromise. We should enact it.\n  A tremendous amount of work went into this bill. I commend the \nCommerce Committee for its effort to resolve some of these complex \nissues. In particular, I commend Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings \nfor working to bring parties together and develop a common-sense bill.\n  Last fall, the Senate entered an order recognizing that the Commerce \nand Finance Committees share jurisdiction over this bill. That order \ngranted sequential referral of this bill to the Finance Committee after \nthe Commerce Committee acted. We inherited a host of unresolved issues. \nAnd, after thorough examination--and in consultation with members of \nthe Finance Committee--we decided to allow the bill to be discharged \nwithout a markup.\n  Let me briefly explain what this compromise bill does. Importantly, \nthe bill extends the moratorium for 4 years. Some argue that this is \ntoo long, and others believe that the tax moratorium should be \npermanent. Four years represents a reasonable compromise. Four years \nwill allow us to revisit unresolved issues in the future.\n  Next, the bill allows States to continue tax telecommunications if \nthey decide they want to. The bill makes clear that when phone lines \nare carried over the Internet in the future using Voice Over Internet \nProtocol technology, States will still be able to assess \ntelecommunications taxes on that service. I know several Senators had \nconcerns about protecting their States' ability to tax phone service, \nand this bill meets their concerns.\n  Finally, the bill provides a soft landing for States that have been \ngrandfathered under the 1998 act. The 1998 act allows certain States, \nwho taxed Internet access prior to 1998, to continue to do so. It is \ntime to make the Internet Tax Freedom Act national policy. The Internet \nis a national treasure, and a pillar of interstate commerce. In future \nlegislation we should phase out the grandfather clause and allow us to \nmove this national policy forward, without leaving any State behind.\n  This does not mean that I believe the bill is perfect. But it is a \ngood bill. And it should move forward.\n  But before I agreed to support this bill, I made sure of two things: \nOne, this bill would not harm Montana's businesses and citizens; and \ntwo, this bill would bring jobs and economic growth to Montana.\n  First, this bill will not harm Montana. It accommodates Montana's \nspecial needs in Universal Service and emergency 911 services.\n  This bill does not jeopardize the Universal Service program. \nUniversal Service helps Montana rural telephone companies to provide \ntelephone access to rural areas. Universal Service is extremely \nimportant to Montana.\n  Rural America stands on the edge of a digital revolution. Technology \nwill move us to places about which we can only dream. But we must \npreserve the networks that will provide us that opportunity.\n  The telecommunications network in Montana is among the best in the \ncountry. Over 140 communities have DSL. We have 95 videoconferencing \nsites spread throughout the state. The Universal Service Fund helped \nbuild this network.\n  In addition, this bill would not harm Montana because it helps \nmaintain emergency communications through the federal enhanced 911 \nprogram, or E-911.\n  E-911 allows police, fire, and emergency workers automatically to \nlocate those who call 911. In Montana, where open space can go on for \nmiles, this technology can mean the difference between life and death.\n  Many State and local governments have diverted 911 funds to other \nuses--away from development of an 911 network. This bill ensures that \nthose providers that use the 911 network continue to pay for it.\n  We need to ensure funding of this extremely important program. I \nappreciate the efforts of Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings to \nensure that 911 is protected.\n  Second, this bill will bring good jobs to Montana. Companies like \nInternet Montana--an Internet service provider headquartered in \nBozeman--provide Internet access to thousands of subscribers in Montana \nand neighboring States.\n  Keeping Internet access tax-free helps businesses like these grow. \nKeeping Internet access tax-free breaks down costly barriers. This \nkeeps jobs in Montana.\n  The next 5 years will bring change in the technology and the market \nfor Internet access. Technological advances will blur the very \ndefinitions of Internet service and use. These changes will affect how \nwe access the Internet, and how much we pay for doing so. These changes \npose challenges for writing legislation.\n  This bill represents an attempt to balance the interests of those who \nwant to make sure that the Internet remains taxfree, with those who are \nconcerned that if we try to define Internet access, we may erode State \nand local tax coffers.\n  As technology changes, we will need to watch this delicate balance. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nlegislation lives up to its promise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor and strongly \nsupport the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, S. 150. I thank Senator \nWyden, Senator Allen, Senator McCain and others for their leadership on \nthis legislation.\n  I also support Senator McCain's compromise amendment to extend for 4 \nyears the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. In addition, the McCain \namendment would safeguard fees for universal service and 9-1-1 or e-9-\n1-1 services and does not affect the emerging technology of Voice Over \nInternet Protocol, VOIP.\n  I urge the Senate to support electronic commerce by keeping it free \nfrom discriminatory and multiple State and local taxes and from \nInternet access taxes.\n  The Internet has changed the way we do business. Today businesses can \nsell their goods and services all over the world in the blink of an \neye. E-commerce has created new markets, new efficiencies and new \nproducts.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home \nState of Vermont. For example, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, which \nemploys more than 300 Vermonters, sells online 60 percent of its bears \nduring its two busiest times of the year--for Valentine's Day and \nMother's Day. That is 60 percent of all Vermont teddy bears sold online \nduring this busy time.\n  Hundreds of Vermont businesses are selling online, ranging from Al's \nSnowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream. These \nVermont cybersellers are of all sizes and customer bases, from Main \nStreet merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of famous ex-\nhippies who make great ice cream.\n  What Vermont online sellers have in common is that Internet commerce \nallows them to erase the geographic barriers that historically limited \nour access to major markets. With the power of the Internet, Vermonters \ncan sell their products and services anywhere, anytime.\n  Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in \nits infancy. Stability is the key to reaching its full potential, and \ncreating out new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong \nthing to do.\n  E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply to \nother commerce. Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are \n30,000 different jurisdictions around the country that could levy \ndiscriminatory or multiple Internet taxes on E-commerce.\n  Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce--with its great \npotential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be \ncrushed by the weight of discriminatory or multiple taxes.\n  I also believe that extending the bar on Internet access taxes will \nhelp Vermonters end the digital divide and help Vermonters compete for \nbetter jobs. Recently, the University of Vermont released a study that \nfound only 39 percent of Vermonters who earning less than $20,000 a \nyear have a personal computer, while 67 percent of Vermonters who earn \nmore than $35,000 a year own a personal computer. And 92 percent of \nVermonters who do own a computer are connected to the Internet. We have \nto close this digital divide\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nfor Vermonters to have the skills for the good-paying jobs of the 21st \ncentury.\n  We need to bar Internet access taxes and multiple or discriminatory \ntaxes on goods and services sold over the Internet to provide the \nstability necessary for electronic commerce to flourish, and to close \nthe digital divide for all Americans.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are about to vote on final passage of the \nInternet access tax moratorium. After months of negotiations, I believe \nthe amended version before us represents a fair and reasonable \ncompromise. It addresses, although not entirely, most of the concerns I \nraised when we debated this bill in November. I plan to vote for it \ntoday.\n  I do not support taxing the Internet. I never have. I stood before \nyou 2 years ago and proposed an amendment that would have put in place \na ``permanent'' moratorium. But my colleagues, at the time, presented a \nvery compelling argument as to why a ban on taxing the Internet should \nnot be made permanent. They said we should simply extend the moratorium \nfor 2 years rather than put in place a permanent mandate on \ntechnological development.\n  The major point of contention, they said, was the way in which we \ndefined ``Internet access.'' They said we needed to let technology \ndevelop before defining what could and could not be taxed 10 years down \nthe road. In retrospect, I agree with my colleagues, and I agree with \nmy colleagues now. The moratorium needs to be extended for 4 years, as \nis done in this compromise. We need to put in place a moratorium for 4 \nyears because it is extremely difficult to write a definition today \nthat will protect and promote technology even 5 years down the road. \nTechnology is simply changing too fast for us to make those kinds of \ndecisions with any certainty.\n  For example, in my home State of Wyoming, we have a small telephone \ncompany in the northwestern part of the State that serves about 7,000 \npeople. Two years ago, in this small community, the company was working \nto update their plain old telephone system so they could handle the \ncapacity needed for dial-up networking.\n  Today, after 2 years of upgrades and investments, the company now \noffers to every single customer a package of high-speed Internet \naccess, digital cable service, multiple telephone lines, and voice over \nthe Internet in some areas. Talk about rapidly changing technology. \nThis company is making things happen. However, at the same time, the \ncompany's progress highlights the difficulty we face in determining \nwhat is and what is not Internet service.\n  For instance, most of us don't know exactly when a local telephone \ncall ceases to be a telephone call and becomes a dial-up Internet \nservice. We don't understand how to decipher a digital packet of voice \ninformation from a digital packet of Internet service information. And \nwe certainly don't know exactly how the digital data in our BlackBerrys \nconnects to our desktop computers at home, to our laptop computers in \nthe car, or to our mobile phones in our pockets. But, we do know when \nwe are trying to make a phone call and when we are typing with our \nfingers.\n  Voice telecommunications are treated differently than other broadband \nInternet services, and that is a fact. It is not fair and it is not \nright, but it is a fact. The compromise before us recognizes this \nproblem. That is why it carves out VOIP or voice over the Internet. I \nam pleased my colleagues were able to craft language this afternoon \nthat improved the original VOIP provision included in the McCain \nsubstitute. The new language makes it more clear and easier for our \nStates, cities, businesses, and judicial system to interpret.\n  I am glad my colleagues were able to reach an agreement on the issue \nof VOIP. Unfortunately, we weren't as lucky on the definition of \n``internet access service.'' The Allen-Wyden, Alexander-Carper and \nMcCain proposals all contained different definitions that would \nrestrict the ability of States and locals to tax telecommunications \nservices. What troubled me was that each definition would have cost our \nStates millions of dollars, but nobody could tell me exactly how much \nit would have cost them. That is the problem.\n  CBO was unable to estimate how much our States and locals would lose \nunder the Allen-Wyden or McCain definitions, but clearly stated that \nthe loss could be ``substantial.'' The most concrete numbers from CBO \nwere provided in a letter dated November 5, 2003. In that letter, CBO \nestimated that revenue losses could range from $80 to $120 million per \nyear to State and local governments that are already taxing Internet \naccess and were covered by the ``grandfather clause.''\n  Additionally, CBO states that ``other states are currently imposing \ntaxes on charges for the portions of DSL services they do not consider \nInternet access.'' Those States would lose between $40 and $75 million \nper year. As you will recall, under the Allen-Wyden and McCain \ndefinition, taxation of all DSL services would be preempted.\n  The Multistate Tax Commission estimates that the loss could be as \nmuch as $4 billion to $8 billion under the Allen-Wyden and McCain \ndefinitions. Given these two examples, there is clearly a lot of \ndiscrepancy between the agencies that are supposed to know the most.\n  Of course, the Alexander-Carper definition wasn't perfect either. It \nwould have also cost our States millions of dollars over time, but it \nwould have been far less significant. It would have prevented States \nfrom collecting new revenue from consumers who are paying for the last \nmile of their DSL services. However, once again, nobody could tell me--\nincluding CBO--how much the Alexander-Carper definition would have \ncost. With over $20 billion being collected from taxes on \ntelecommunications services every year, this imprecise data made it \ndifficult for me to support any definitions. That is why we had to \ninclude other provisions--like the grandfather provisions and the VOIP \nlanguage--that would help cushion the impact this bill will have on our \nStates and locals.\n  The grandfather provisions are important because they ensure that \nStates and locals that are currently taxing do not lose millions of \ndollars over the next couple of years. I had hoped all of the \ngrandfather clauses would expire at the same time, but we were beat \nfair and square. The problem is that extending the grandfather for some \nStates for only 2 years still creates an unfunded mandate.\n\n  As many of you know, this is an issue I have followed closely for \nyears. Questions about unfunded mandates have always been the issues \nthat cause me, especially when I served in the Wyoming State \nlegislature, to sit up and take notice. Whenever Congress takes up an \nissue that could have an effect on State revenues, every State Governor \nand legislature stops what they are doing to see what we are up to--and \nhow it may affect them--or more to the point--what it is going to cost \nthem.\n  So now, after months of hearings, meetings and negotiations, we are \ngetting ready to pass a bill that could create an unfunded mandate for \na couple of years but doesn't do it permanently, which I am pleased \nabout. The original Allen-Wyden bill proposed a ``permanent'' \nmoratorium on access taxes and ``permanent'' definition of internet \naccess. My question was whether or not we should lock any type of \ntechnology in a glass box labeled ``permanent'' when that technology is \nchanging shape and size at the speed of light. The problem with the \nword ``permanent'' was that it didn't allow for a lot of wiggle room. \nThe changing shape of technology would break the glass box whether we \nlike it or not, so I am pleased that we crafted a bill that will keep \nthe latch open to allow for expansion and future growth. That way we \ncan check on the progress of technology in 4 years, and then decide \nwhether we should lock it up tighter or change its design to allow for \nmore expansion and development.\n  The key words here are time and change. By signing on to something \nthat was supposed to be ``permanent'' we would have been committing \nourselves to something that might not have survived the test of time. \nThings are moving quickly and changing fast and we are trying to make \ndecisions about what lies down the road based on what we have just \ndriven past--or the scenery that surrounds us right now. It might work. \nBut it might not. It might not because no other product of technology \nhas seen such growth and\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nchange in the past few years as the Internet and information \ntechnology. That is what has made it a difficult issue to track and to \naddress in terms of what its future may hold. The bill we have before \nus is an effort to allow some of these issues to ripen, while \nprotecting internet users from future taxation.\n  That being said, I think we might benefit from taking a look at the \npast history of the issue before we try to form an opinion on its \nfuture. Two years ago, I stood before you and offered an amendment that \nwould have--like this bill--made the moratorium on Internet access \npermanent. At the time, I believed we were taking a fair and equitable \napproach to a prohibition on taxing the Internet.\n  My amendment, which was cosponsored by my good friend and colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, would have made the ban on taxing \nthe Internet permanent, and it would have simplified the extremely \ncumbersome network of State sales and use taxes. My amendment failed, \nin part because most Senators did not want to put in place a \n``permanent'' moratorium.\n\n  The other reason my amendment failed was because it addressed a \ncomplex issue that most Senators did not understand. It was the issue \nof streamlined sales and use tax. I introduced the Streamlined Sales \nand Use Tax Act in 2001 and again last year because it would greatly \nreduce the complexity of our system of sales and use taxes.\n  This year, Senator Dorgan and I have been joined by 18 bipartisan \ncosponsors in introducing S. 1736. Like our bill in the 107th Congress, \nS. 1736 would make it easier for American consumers and businesses to \nconduct sales from remote locations and help States begin to recover \nfrom years of budgetary shortfalls. It would authorize States that have \nsigned the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and have passed \nlegislation simplifying their tax system to require all sellers to \ncollect and remit sales taxes.\n  S. 1736 is a critical piece of legislation that many of my colleagues \nare learning more about and recognizing its growing importance as \nInternet usage explodes. Two years ago the revenue loss attributed to \nthe Internet sales tax loophole was fairly minimal. Today, the revenue \nloss has ballooned as online and other remote sales have increased. The \nStates have responded to this budget crisis by signing the Streamlined \nSales and Use Tax Agreement and implementing legislation that \ndrastically simplifies their sales and use tax systems. In fact, 20 \nStates have already signed into law the necessary implementing \nlegislation, while 9 others are currently in the process of doing so.\n  Two years ago, my colleagues said the States hadn't come far enough \nin the process to warrant congressional action. I think the opposite \ncan be said today. The States have taken the bull by the horns and are \npoised to act. Now, Congress needs to step up and do the same.\n  The sales and use tax bill has been referred to the Finance Committee \nand I hope to work with Chairman Grassley and others to bring it up in \ncommittee some time this year. But, that is not what we are talking \nabout here today.\n  Let me be clear--we are not talking about sales and use taxes today \nas part of the internet access tax moratorium. These are two completely \nseparate issues. Today we are talking about the Internet access tax \nmoratorium.\n  The compromise before us doesn't address every concern raised by the \nStates and locals, but it doesn't address every concern raised by \nindustry either. But, isn't that the sign of a true compromise? Both \nsides have to give a little in order to come up with the best product.\n  I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the issue to find \nmiddle ground that would protect consumers and ensure that States and \nlocalities don't lose billions in tax revenue. I think we have found \nthe middle ground. I have talked to both Republicans and Democrats and \nthis is the bipartisan solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, so we can allow the use \nof the Internet to continue to prosper and grow. It is a valuable \nresource because it provides access on demand. In addition, it is \nestimated that the growth of online businesses will create millions of \nnew jobs nationwide in the coming years. I hope you will vote with me \nin favor of both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I voted for the bill that has just \npassed because I have said all along I am against taxing Internet \naccess. I think it is a disruption of interstate commerce. I have said \nthat all along.\n  The reason I have been concerned about this bill is I have been very \nafraid that the city franchise taxes that are collected in my State of \nTexas were somehow going to be brought into the bill. I have now been \nworking with the Senate leaders, the managers of the bill, Senators \nMcCain, Allen, Wyden, and Senator Dorgan, to assure that it was not the \nintent to take the Texas franchise fee, which is called an access line \nfee in Texas, to be included in the ban on Internet access. It is not \nInternet access; it is a franchise fee.\n  I very much hope we can clarify the record on this point and assure \nthat in conference the definition will be clear so it will be \nrecognized under Federal law 47 U.S.C., section 1104(8)(B), that the \nTexas access line fee is included as a franchise fee or similar fee, \nand included in the exceptions from the definition of tax.\n  I hope we have an assurance from the managers of the bill that this \nTexas access line fee, which is a franchise fee, would not be included \nwithin the definition of Internet access tax.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am glad to work with the Senator. I wish to consult with \nthe chairman and also Senator Allen, but it has always been our \nintent--and as the prime Senate sponsor of the law back in 1998 it was \nalways my intent--that franchise fees not be affected by the Internet \ntax moratorium.\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\n  As the Senator has correctly noted, I say to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Texas has changed the name of its franchise fee to \nan access line fee. It was never our intention that franchise fees be \naffected by the moratorium.\n  I am very happy to work with the Senator from Texas on it. I will \nhave to consult with the Senator from Virginia, but he has always been \nvery gracious working with our colleagues. The two of us will be \nconsulting with the chairman of the committee. I want to make it clear \nI am very anxious to accommodate the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I state for the record that I concur with \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, that my intent as the author of the underlying bill, S. 150, \nis to prevent taxation of Internet access. Any modifications to the \ndefinition of Internet access taxes are not intended to include \npayments for franchising fees as described in section 1104(8)(B), \nincluding Texas' access line fees. I believe it is accurate to say the \nexemption for any franchise fee or similar fee in the definition of tax \nin section 1104(8)(B) of title 47 of the United States Code includes \nthe tax line fees as established in Texas in 1999.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for her strong advocacy for the people \nof Texas, making sure that this is brought up. I can assure the Senator \nfrom Texas that the Senator from Oregon and I, as this goes into \nconference, will work to make sure that express intent is effectuated \nwhen this measure comes back and is signed into law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to join my colleagues Senators Allen, Wyden and \nHutchison to include Texas access line fees collected by cities and \nlocal governments in the exception to the definition of ``tax'' in 47 \nU.S.C. section 1104(8).\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Virginia and \nOregon, and say that I also have the assurance from Senator McCain and \nSenator Dorgan that in the conference this issue will be addressed. It \nis a Texas-only issue, as I understand. It is a franchise fee but it is \ncalled an access line fee after Texas law was changed in 1999, which is \nwhy the moratorium puts it in question.\n  I would like to assure that we get this definition in conference. I \nknow now, from talking to the four managers, that it was not the \nintention to take our access fee as a part of the major bill, but in \nfact treat it as a franchise fee, which is what it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4671-S4673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PLAYING POLITICS WITH IRAQ\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as President pro tempore and presiding \nover the Senate, I have found the overheated rhetoric on Iraq over the \nlast few days at best disappointing and at worst misleading, harshly \npartisan, and motivated by election year politics. I have simply had \nenough of this. I have come to the floor to ask my Senate colleagues to \nrestore the level of debate that this institution demands. I urge the \nSenate to not play politics with Iraq.\n  Do not seek to gain some slim, fleeting advantage at the ballot box \nby making our country appear divided, and by making reckless \naccusations.\n  Our troops in Iraq deserve better than this. They deserve much \nbetter. If there is debate, let it be reasoned and measured, and \nfocused on the way forward in this war on terrorism.\n  When our forces are deployed and in the field, they deserve nothing \nless than our absolute, unwavering commitment to their success. Nothing \nless.\n  I take strong issue with three particular themes: First, the analogy \nthat Iraq is somehow like Vietnam. This analogy is wrong, and simply \ninflammatory; second, that the President was wrong when he made his \nspeech on the USS Abraham Lincoln a year ago on May 1; and third, that \nsomehow our action to remove the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein was in \nany regard ``unprovoked.'' That is simply and plainly not true.\n  Iraq is not Vietnam. It is wildly irresponsible--even reckless--to \ncompare the situation in Iraq to the war in Vietnam. Those who make \nthat false claim are engaging in dangerous rhetoric, and are ill \ninformed about history and facts of the two conflicts.\n  Comparing Iraq to Vietnam does not advance the debate, it simply \ninflames the issue, obscures the facts and, unfortunately, misleads the \nAmerican people.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, started this \nIraq is Vietnam spin in a speech a few weeks ago. Of all people, he \nknows better than to make that bogus comparison.\n  I encourage my colleagues to turn down the rhetoric on Vietnam, and \nget the facts right. Here are some of those facts:\n  In Vietnam, President Kennedy sent ``advisers'' to Vietnam in 1961, \nbut they were not authorized to use force until 1964, 3 years later. \nThen, in 1971, Congress repealed that authority.\n  In Iraq, this very Congress approved a resolution that authorized the \nuse of force in October, 2002, well in advance of any forces being \ndeployed. That resolution still stands today.\n  In Vietnam, eight nations joined with the United States.\n  In Iraq, over 30 nations are in our coalition, including 16 of 26 \nNATO allies.\n  In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh violated zero U.N. Security Council \nresolutions--none.\n  In Iraq, Saddam Hussein violated seventeen--seventeen--U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions, beginning immediately after the 1991 Gulf war \ncease fire agreement.\n  In Vietnam, how many draftees were sent to that country? About two \nmillion draftees, all young men.\n  In Iraq, how many draftees are there? Zero, none. We have an all-\nvolunteer force. They know the risks, they know their duty, and they \nvolunteer to step forward and serve our country.\n  I have yet to meet one at the hospitals here who hasn't asked me the \nquestion: How can I go back to my unit? How can I go back to Iraq? They \nask that despite the many serious wounds they have.\n  In Vietnam, against how many Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians did \nHo Chi Minh use chemical and biological weapons? Were there chemical \nand biological weapons used by North Vietnam? No, none.\n  In Iraq, against how many Iraqis, Iranians, and Kurds did Saddam \nHussein use chemical and biological weapons? Thousands and thousands of \npeople--the Kurds, the Iraqis, and Iranians--were the subject of \nchemical and biological weapons used by Saddam Hussein.\n  I have an article here from last Sunday's Providence Journal-\nBulletin, and the headline of that article is this: ``Historians, \nSoldiers Hesitant to Call Iraq another Vietnam: the purposes, strategy, \nterrain and players in the Vietnam war were far different than those in \nIraq, many experts say.''\n  Far different than those in Iraq, indeed.\n  That is a true statement by the Providence Journal-Bulletin. In this \narticle, Anthony Cordesman, a military expert and former diplomat, says \n``I really worry about the analogy between Vietnam and Iraq, where \nwe're not really fighting a foreign enemy.''\n  Mr. Cordesman, who is now at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, goes on to say:\n\n       There is as yet no massive insurgency [confronting \n     coalition forces]. We're not dealing with massive external \n     powers supporting the insurgents. We do not have a situation \n     where we have lost a majority of the population as we did in \n     Vietnam when we lost the Buddhists. We are not attempting to \n     get around the reality of a need to create a legitimate \n     government, which we did after the fall of the South \n     Vietnam's Diem regime.\n\n  I hope that cooler heads and cooler rhetoric will prevail here in the \nSenate. My colleague from Delaware, the ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations committee, has found the Vietnam analogy, \n``misleading'' because, as he says, ``The vast majority of Iraqis share \nour vision for a participatory, representative democracy.''\n  President Bush is absolutely right when he says that the Vietnam-Iraq \nanalogy is false. And he is right that brandishing that false analogy \nas a rhetorical weapon, ``sends the wrong message to our troops and \nsends the wrong message to the enemy.''\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\n  With regard to President Bush's speech on the USS Abraham Lincoln, \nsome have chosen to make a great issue about it. They have endlessly \ntaunted the Commander in Chief for words on a banner, and have twisted \nhis words to suit their purposes.\n  What the President said is this:\n\n       Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle \n     of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And \n     now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing \n     that country.\n\n  The President was dead-on right. He spoke clearly and plainly, yet \nsome refuse to listen to what he said.\n  He went on to say that ``major combat operations in Iraq have \nended.'' The President was and is absolutely correct today in making \nthat statement.\n  Saddam's regime of oppression and torture was gone. The Hussein Baath \nParty regime was disbanded, and no longer in power. Baghdad had fallen, \nand was under the control of the coalition of which we were the leader.\n  Active, organized military resistance had collapsed. Saddam's \nmilitary forces were not resisting; their will to fight had been \ndestroyed; they had no ability to command and control the few forces \nthey had left.\n  The mission was to remove a threatening, brutal dictator from power, \nto bring to an end the ruthless oppression of the Iraqi people--and \nthat mission was accomplished.\n  President Bush made it abundantly clear that he recognized the \nchallenges that would face America and confront our troops. He said, \n``And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that \ncountry.''\n  He said:\n\n       We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order \n     to parts of that country that remain dangerous. The \n     transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but \n     it is worth the effort. Our coalition will stay until our \n     work is done.\n\n  That could not be clearer or more truthful. There are those in this \nbody who should listen to these words and hear them accurately.\n  Let me state that again. He said:\n\n       We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order \n     to parts of that country that remain dangerous. The \n     transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but \n     it is worth the effort. Our coalition will stay until our \n     work is done.\n\n  The clear and compelling meaning of the President's words on May 1, \n2003 was that Saddam Hussein had been removed from power, Iraq's \nmilitary defeated, and the work of stabilizing and reconstructing Iraq \nhad begun--and that such work would be both difficult and costly.\n  The President was right when he spoke on the carrier a year ago, and \nhe is still right today.\n  What has happened in recent weeks and months is an emerging \ninsurgency, and the appearance of foreign fighters in Iraq who will do \nanything--anything--to see the coalition fail, and see Iraq revert back \nto a brutal dictatorship, and become a breeding ground for radical \nIslamic terrorists.\n  These terrorists have joined with former regime elements, and have \nchosen to make Iraq a full-blown battlefield in the war on terrorism.\n  This is not a war against Saddam Hussein. This is a war on terrorism. \nWhat these terrorists and their sympathizers fear most is Iraq becoming \na stable, functioning democracy that benefits the Iraqi people, joins \nthe world community, and serves as a source of democratic influence on \nthe people of the region.\n  They have no regard for the will of the Iraqi people, for their \nsafety, for their security or for their future. They are simply using \nIraqi soil, and taking innocent Iraqi lives, in their ruthless Jihad, \nin their desire to spread chaos and foment hate across the Islamic \nworld, and in their hatred of freedom, moderation and democracy.\n  I urge those who are twisting the President's words of now almost a \nyear ago to listen carefully to what he said, to end the personal \nattack, to stop the spin. Stop parsing words and stop mocking plastic \nbanners. We can and we must do better than that in the Senate.\n  And unprovoked? I heard the word ``unprovoked.'' My third point is, I \nsay to those who claim the war to liberate Iraq was somehow \n``unprovoked,'' that is wrong. It is absolutely wrong. Could that \nstatement be more preposterous? Could anything be more disconnected \nfrom the truth in Iraq? Can anyone say with a straight face Saddam \nHussein did nothing to provoke the international community?\n  Here is a sampling of some of the ways that Saddam Hussein provoked \nthis conflict, how he provoked the United States, and how he provoked \nthe world. In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and used chemical weapons against \nthe Iranian people. In 1988, Saddam's forces killed 5,000 innocent \ncivilians in a chemical weapons attack against the Kurdish villages of \nHalabja. In 1990, Saddam's forces invaded another neighbor, this time \nKuwait. We all know in the Gulf War thousands of innocent Kuwaiti \ncivilians were raped, tortured, and murdered during the occupation. In \n1991, Iraq was poised to march on other nations but was stopped by a \nU.S.-led coalition of forces. We call that the Gulf War. Iraq has \nlaunched ballistic missiles at four of its neighbors. Remember that, \n``unprovoked''? It launched ballistic missiles at four of its \nneighbors: Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Israel. I might say, I was \nin Israel when one of those was launched.\n  Saddam's Iraq was, at a minimum, engaged in clandestine research and \ndevelopment activities to develop, refine, and employ chemical and \nbiological weapons. From 1991 to 2003, Saddam's Iraq fired more than \n1,000 missiles at our aircraft as they patroled Iraq's U.N.-sanctioned \nno-fly zones. We went over to Kuwait. We met the pilots who were flying \nday after day--what we call the CAP, the constant air patrol--at the \nrequest of the U.N. in compliance with the U.N. resolution. They told \nus how they were fired at again and again and again. Saddam Hussein was \nfiring at U.S. planes daily. Provocation? I can't think of another \nprovocation. As a matter of fact, we should have gone to war when \nPresident Clinton said he was about ready to go to war in 1998.\n  For more than a decade, Saddam's Iraq steadfastly ignored the will of \nthe United Nations and the civilized world and ignored no fewer than 17 \nU.N. resolutions.\n  I could continue with the list, but the point is the same: To say \nthat Saddam Hussein is not responsible for his fate and Iraq's current \nstatus and did nothing to provoke that change is ludicrous. It is \nplainly untrue.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: The tone of the debate on Iraq must \nchange. With our troops under daily attack, we cannot make Iraq a \npolitical football in an election year or any year.\n  Representative Jim Marshall, a freshman Democrat from Georgia, wrote \na compelling column in the Washington Post last October. The title of \nhis column was ``Don't Play Politics on Iraq.'' A decorated Army Ranger \nwho served in Vietnam, Congressman Marshall was right then and he is \nright today. His observations were wise then and even wiser today: \nDon't play politics on Iraq.\n  Let me quote from that article Congressman Marshall wrote:\n\n       Many in Washington view the contest for the presidency and \n     the control of Congress as a zero-sum game without external \n     costs or benefits. Politicians and activists in each party \n     reflexively celebrate, spread and embellish the news bad for \n     the opposition. But to do that now with regard to Iraq harms \n     our troops and our effort. Concerning Iraq, this normal \n     political tripe can impose a heavy external cost.\n\n  I continue with the article written by Congressman Marshall:\n\n       For now, responsible Democrats should carefully avoid using \n     the language of failure. It is false. It endangers our troops \n     and our effort. It can be unforgivably self-fulfilling.\n\n  That Congressman gets it. He really gets it. You do not play politics \non Iraq. You do not play politics with national security. You do not \nplay politics with the defense of this country. You do not play \npolitics with troops deployed. You do not let seeking partisan \nadvantage drive a wedge between Americans when troops are in harm's \nway.\n  I urge our colleagues to end this divisive practice of using the \nfloor of this Senate and this issue on Iraq to bash the administration \nto try to score political points. We can do better than that. For those \nwho persist on this practice, reflect on Congressman Marshall's words: \nIt endangers our troops and our effort. It is simply wrong, election \nyear or not. Those who irresponsibly endanger or use Iraq for partisan \nadvantage should be warmed: You must understand and take responsibility \nfor\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nthe message you send to the enemies of freedom, democracy, and liberty \nthrough the world.\n  This country should be united when we have troops abroad. We should \nbe united when we have people trying to assist Iraqis to find freedom \nand defeat the terrorists who persist to bring the war on terrorism to \nIraq after we won the war against Saddam Hussein. I urge my colleagues \nto follow Congressman Marshall's injunction: Do not play politics \nanymore on Iraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week was National Minority Cancer \nAwareness Week, an annual event for the past 18 years. Though we have \nbeen monitoring disparities in cancer for nearly two decades, the gap \nin some cancer mortalities has widened rather than narrowed.\n  One of the most important reasons for this disparity is poor access \nto health care. People who do not get mammograms, colon exams, and Pap \ntests on schedule are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a \nlater stage of the disease, when survival rates are lower. And why \ndon't they get these necessary tests on time? Members of racial and \nethnic minority groups are more likely to be poor, have lower education \nlevels, and less likely to have health coverage or a source of primary \ncare.\n  Recently, I told the story of a young Indian girl who was \nmisdiagnosed with heartburn at an under-funded Indian Health Service \nclinic. It turned out that she really had stomach cancer that had \nalready spread and was, therefore, untreatable. I will remind you that \nthis is not some rare exception. For Native Americans and other \nminority communities across the country, the miracles of modern \nmedicine--and sometimes even the most basic primary care--are beyond \ntheir reach.\n  The disparities within our health care system have reached a crisis \npoint, and the consequences for America's minority communities are \nstaggering.\n  Overall, African Americans are more likely to develop cancer than \npersons of any other racial or ethnic group.\n  Cervical cancer incidence in Hispanic women has been consistently \nhigher at all ages than for other women.\n  Only 52 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native women aged 40 years \nand older have had a recent mammogram.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have the poorest survival rate \nfrom all cancers combined when compared to other racial and ethnic \ngroups.\n  I am grateful that National Minority Cancer Awareness Week causes us \nto reflect on these facts. America faces few more important or complex \nchallenges than building a world-class health care system for everyone, \nregardless of race, income, or geography.\n  There are no quick fixes. The factors that have led to these \ninequities in our health system are complex and interrelated.\n  Minorities are far less likely to have health insurance or a family \ndoctor, making regular preventive visits less likely. And many of those \nwho do have insurance report having little or no choice in where they \nseek care.\n  Minority communities are more frequently exposed to environmental \nrisks, such as polluted industrial areas, cheap older housing with lead \npaint, or asbestos-laden water pipes.\n  For Hispanics, Native Americans, and others who do not speak English \nas a first language, the lack of translators and bilingual doctors \nmakes it more difficult to communicate with doctors and nurses.\n  The Native American community has been forced to cope with a system \nsuffering from decades of neglect and underfunding of the Indian Health \nService. The IHS has consistently grown at a far slower rate than the \nrest of the HHS budget, and at only a fraction of health care \ninflation.\n  America is obligated, by statute and by treaty, to provide health \ncare for American Indians--a commitment the U.S. Government made to the \nIndian people in exchange for their lands. America is not honoring that \ncommitment. The White House's budget this year included only $2.1 \nbillion for IHS clinical services. That is more than 60 percent below \nthe bare minimum needed to provide basic health care for people already \nin the IHS system.\n  The problems run still deeper. Even when minorities and white \nAmericans have roughly the same insurance coverage, the same income, \nthe same age and the same health conditions, minorities receive less \naggressive and less effective care than whites.\n  The racial and ethnic disparities in our health care system are not \nmerely minority issues or health care issues. They are moral issues. A \nhealth care system that provides lesser treatment for minorities \noffends every American principle of justice and equality.\n  The Republican Leadership has promised to address these issues.\n  After seeing no action for almost a year, House and Senate Democrats, \nled by the House Minority Caucuses, introduced the Healthcare Equality \nand Accountability Act of 2003.\n  This legislation would reduce health disparities and improve the \nquality of care for racial and ethnic minorities. There are several \nelements of this bill that would specifically address minority cancer \nrate reduction. I would like to highlight four particularly important \nissues.\n  First, this bill will provide adequate funding for the Indian Health \nService--so that we can finally stop the shameful underfunding of \nIndian health needs.\n  Second, it will provide funds to increase cancer prevention and \ntreatment programs. This includes the development of screening \nguidelines for minority populations for chronic diseases, including \nprostate, breast, and colon cancer.\n  Third, this bill will provide funding through the Health Research and \nServices Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National \nCancer Institute for patient navigators. Patient navigators work in \nunderserved communities to bring individuals into the health care \nsystem sooner, so they can learn about preventing and detecting \ndiseases--especially cancer--before they become ill. Patient navigators \nalso help individuals overcome language and cultural barriers to \nsetting up appointments and understanding their doctors' instructions. \nPatient navigators can also be important resources to individuals \nliving in rural areas, since they often have to travel outside their \ncommunities to receive certain health services. The American Cancer \nSociety notes that ``Patient navigator programs offer a low-cost, \ntangible fix in a part of our health care system that is broken, giving \nhope to millions of medically underserved individuals, saving lives and \nreducing health care costs.''\n  The last item I would like to highlight in this bill is the focus on \nimproved health literacy, the degree to which individuals can obtain, \nprocess, and understand basic health information. The bill will provide \nfunds to support programs that remove language and cultural barriers. \nJust two weeks ago, the Institute of Medicine released its report on \nhealth literacy and recommended that ``Government and private funders \nshould support the development and use of culturally appropriate new \nmeasures of health literacy.''\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\n  On that same day, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nreleased findings that showed that individuals with low literacy--\nlower-than-average reading skills--are less likely than other Americans \nto get potentially life-savings screening tests such as mammograms and \nPap smears.\n  In addition, Secretary Thompson remarked that, ``We must ensure that \nall Americans get the prevention and health information that they can \nunderstand and use to keep themselves and their families healthy.'' He \npointed out, ``Health literacy can save lives, money, and improve the \nhealth of millions of Americans.''\n  The Healthcare Equality and Accountability Act would move us closer \nto the goal of ensuring equal access to quality health care.\n  Last year, the majority leader said, ``Inequity is a cancer than can \nno longer be allowed to fester in health care.''\n  I agree. We know what happens when cancer is allowed to spread.\n  Too many Americans in minority communities have lost their lives \nbecause they are not getting the care they need. We cannot afford to \nwait any longer to confront the minority health gap in our country.\n  Americans are asking for our leadership on a challenge that is \nquickly becoming a national emergency. We have an obligation to answer \ntheir call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4674-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4674-S4675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EL DIA DE LOS NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, every year on the 30th day of April, \nnations throughout the world, especially in Latin America, honor and \ncelebrate the importance of children to families and communities. Many \nLatino families honor their children on this day by celebrating El Dia \nde los Ninos in their homes. Today, nearly 45 million children under \nthe age of 18 reside in the United States, and one in four of these \nchildren are of Hispanic descent. The El Dia de los Ninos holiday \nprovides a wonderful opportunity for all Americans to pay tribute to \nthose who represent the future of our great country--our Nation's \nyouth. A growing number of cities, schools, libraries, museums, \nchurches, and other community organizations across the nation observe \nthis holiday by planning activities and events that celebrate children.\n  While El Dia de los Ninos recognizes the importance of children, the \nholiday also provides an occasion to shed light on the unique \nchallenges currently facing Latino children in America. Every day \nnationwide, 751 Latino children are born into poverty; 518 are born \nwithout health care; and 561 Latino high school students drop out of \nschool.\n  As every parent knows, our children are a gift we have been given in \nexchange for a commitment to put their well-being above all else. It is \nour covenant to meet our children's needs before our own and to work \nand plan so that they may have a better future.\n  The Bush administration's fiscal year 2005 budget proposal breaks \nthat covenant by giving tax cuts for the wealthy higher priority than \ninvestments in our children. His administration has created record \ndeficits that mortgage our children's future.\n  The choices contained in the President's budget fail to address the \nbasic needs of children in key areas such as health care, education, \nHead Start, child care, housing, child nutrition, and the prevention \nof, and treatment for, child abuse and neglect.\n  The number of Americans without health insurance increased by 2.4 \nmillion between 2001 and 2002, the largest jump in a decade, to a total \nof almost 44 million. Among those 44 million are more than 9 million \nchildren under age 19, almost 90 percent of whom live in working \nfamilies. However, the administration's budget proposal does nothing to \nsignificantly expand health insurance coverage.\n  Latinos are the most likely of all groups to lack health insurance. \nOne-third of Latinos, 33.2 percent, lack health insurance, and nearly \none-quarter, 24.1 percent, of Latino children are uninsured. Since a \nsignificant reason for the low level of insurance coverage among \nHispanic children is the result of current law that bars them from \nparticipating in Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP, removing these barriers to health care is key to \nensuring that Latino children have access to health care services. Yet, \nthe administration's budget does not recommend taking this important \nstep, leaving millions of children without coverage.\n  Just when schools are struggling to meet the new requirements of the \nNo Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, President Bush has proposed the \nsmallest increase in Federal education funding in 9 years. Since 2002, \nthe NCLB program has been shortchanged by $26.5 billion. This year \nalone, President Bush has proposed a budget that would underfund the \nNCLB program by $9.4 billion.\n  The administration's budget shortchanges education programs that are \nparticularly important for Latino students. Dropout assistance, \nbilingual education funding, Migrant Education, HEP and CAMP and the \nparent assistance program--all of which help migrant students--are all \nsignificantly underfunded.\n  The President's budget proposal would virtually freeze Head Start \nfunding even though the program currently reaches only 3 out of 5 \neligible preschoolers, and only 3 percent of infants and toddlers \neligible for Early Head Start.\n  At a time when the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Services Programs \nserve only 19 percent of eligible migrant and seasonal children, the \nPresident's budget provides $269.4 million--far short of what is needed \nto meet demand.\n  The President's budget proposal would flat-fund child care assistance \nat a time when only 1 out of 7 eligible children currently receives a \nchild care subsidy; when States are making significant cuts to child \ncare services due to State budget crises that are exacerbated by recent \ntax cuts; and when more than 550,000 children across the country are on \nwaiting lists for child care assistance. The Senate recently voted 78 \nto 20 to increase the Federal investment in child care so that low-\nincome working families can succeed in the workplace and make sure \ntheir children have safe, high-quality, appropriate care.\n  The President's budget proposal cuts section 8 housing assistance by \n$789 million, intensifying the unmet need for affordable housing. Of \nthe 2 million households that receive section 8 rental vouchers, 52 \npercent are families with children, making section 8 the main source of \nhousing assistance for low-income children.\n  The President's budget proposal provides no significant increase in \nfunding for child nutrition programs, while 22 million children live in \nhouseholds suffering from hunger or living on the very edge of hunger.\n  More than 900,000 children were abused and neglected in 2001, yet the \ninvestments proposed for preventing child abuse and neglect and \nassisting children and families in crisis, totaling $151 million, fall \nfar short of the need.\n  As we look to the future, we must do more than simply hope that our \ncountry will be in good hands. We must take steps to ensure that each \nchild growing up in America has access to world-class health care and a \nquality education. El Dia de los Ninos allows us to celebrate the hopes \nand dreams of our children while reflecting on their many \naccomplishments and assisting them in reaching their future goals.\n  As a proud father and grandfather, I happily celebrate El Dia de los \nNinos. However, my commitment to young Americans and the Latino \nCommunity will not end today. I am committed to championing legislation \nthat will help families realize the vision of El Dia de los Ninos \nincreased access to health care; higher investments in Head Start, \neducation, and child care; access to decent housing; stronger child \nnutrition programs; and more child abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms. By working to meet our children's needs today, we are \nbuilding a better future for all Americans.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I speak in celebration of El Dia de los \nNinos, a traditional Latin American holiday celebrating the future of \nchildren. This holiday honors Latino children and other children \nthroughout the United States. In my home State of New York a number of \nimportant celebrations are taking place in honor of this important day.\n  Today, there are nearly 45 million children under 18 living in the \nUnited States and one in four of these children\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nare of Hispanic descent. Of the 3.5 million children under 18 living in \nNew York, nearly 1 million are Latino.\n  While El Dia de los Ninos recognizes the importance of all children, \nthe holiday also provides an occasion to shed light on the unique \nchallenges currently facing Latino children in America. Every day \nnationwide, 751 Latino children are born into poverty and 561 Latino \nhigh school students drop out of school. In New York, 35.9 percent of \nLatino children live in poverty and nearly 20 percent of Hispanic youth \ndrop out of high school each year.\n  We must do better for our children, especially our Latino children. \nThe President's budget fails to provide adequate investments in \neducation that could significantly improve the future of our most \nvulnerable children. President Bush's fiscal year 2005 budget \neliminates the dropout prevention program and even calls them \nunnecessary despite the fact that over 27 percent of Latinos across the \ncountry currently don't graduate from high school. His budget freezes \nfunding for bilingual education and migrant education programs; cuts \nfunding for Head Start, after school programs, and college loan \nprograms; and eliminates Even Start. This budget is devastating to \nprograms designed to help Latinos gain an even footing in education.\n  That is why I joined my colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter \nto the Appropriations Committee urging the committee to target funding \nto meet the needs of our Hispanic children. To strengthen our Nation, \nwe must take steps to ensure that all children growing up in America \nhave access to a quality education. Throughout the remainder of the \n108th Congress, I will continue to champion legislative efforts to aid \nall young Americans and the Latino community so that we can help these \nchildren pursue their hopes and dreams. Today, as we celebrate El Dia \nde los Ninos I encourage all Americans to stop for a moment and pay \ntribute to the future of our great country--our Nation's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4675-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4675-S4677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM MEEKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nKentuckian and UofL alumnus, Tom Meeker. Tom is the President of \nChurchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. This Saturday, horse \nlovers from around the world will watch with anticipation as Tom \npresides over the 130th Run for the Roses.\n  In September of 1984, Tom was named President of Churchill Downs. Two \ndecades later he oversees one of horseracings largest operations. His \nsuccess didn't come easily or without personal struggles. When Tom \nassumed the reins at Churchill Downs, the 109-year-old racetrack was in \nneed of a facelift. Today, the track is entering the final stage of a \n$121 million renovation.\n  Under Tom's leadership, Churchill Downs Inc. has also expanded its \noperations and now owns six tracks in five States, as well as its own \nsimulcast network. And the company continues to give back to the \nLouisville community through philanthropic donations.\n  Tom has been described as a hard working, aggressive, loyal and \nforceful leader. He has had some tangles over the years with the \nKentucky General Assembly regarding expanded gambling and other \nbusiness issues. But these encounters pale in comparison to the \npersonal battle he fought with alcohol. Fifteen years ago he sought \nhelp, and returned a month later a changed man.\n  Churchill Downs is lucky to have Tom Meeker. Under his direction, it \nhas matured and thrived to become the place we all come home to, \nparticularly the first Saturday in May.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article, \n``Churchill's Hard Charger; Tom Meeker rebuilt the track--and his \nlife'' from The Courier-Journal, be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, April 24, 2004]\n\n  Churchill's Hard Charger; Tom Meeker Rebuilt the Track--and His Life\n\n                           (By Marcus Green)\n\n       Tom Meeker was a 41-year-old lawyer with little racetrack \n     experience when he took the top job at Churchill Downs in \n     1984.\n       The 109-year-old track ``was about ready to fall down,'' \n     said Meeker, who didn't think he'd last too long either.\n       But in two decades Meeker has built Churchill Downs Inc. \n     into one of the three big players in the sport, along the way \n     eliciting both great praise and sharp criticism.\n       Some who know Meeker describe him as a visionary, a bold \n     and aggressive executive whose legacy at Churchill might \n     rival that of the legendary Derby promoter Col. Matt Winn.\n       ``If you look at Churchill Downs then and you look at \n     Churchill Downs today, the only similarity is the name, the \n     Twin Spires and the fact that the Kentucky Derby is there,'' \n     said Gerald Lawrence, the track's former general manager and \n     executive vice president.\n       ``The place has just been completely changed. It's a \n     foresight and a vision that (Meeker) had.''\n       Today Churchill owns six tracks in five states and beams \n     its races live to bettors at tracks, off-track betting \n     parlors and homes across the country.\n       Despite having one year left in a $121 million renovation \n     of the flagship track in Louisville, Churchill still has the \n     resources to offer $45 million to buy the Fair Grounds in New \n     Orleans, one of the last independently owned, top-tier \n     thoroughbred tracks in the country.\n       In addition, Churchill Downs has emerged as a leading \n     corporate citizen with Meeker at the helm, contributing more \n     than $7.7 million to charity over the last five years, \n     including $2 million to the local community.\n       ``Tom is a great leader,'' said Churchill Downs Inc. board \n     Chairman Carl Pollard. ``And I think we have to give him \n     credit--most of the credit, if not all of the credit--for \n     recognizing that the industry was changing and that in order \n     to take advantage of the change in the industry we had to be \n     more than one racetrack.''\n       Meeker, who commanded Marines in Vietnam, has been \n     described as a hard-working, aggressive, loyal and forceful \n     leader.\n       Meeker volunteers another word.\n       `` `Arrogant' has come up any number of times,'' he said. \n     ``I think that's a function of being action-oriented. I mean, \n     if there's one thing you can't criticize about our team is we \n     do things.''\n       But Meeker said he would not have been able to guide the \n     company's expansion if he didn't get help for his drinking \n     after the 1989 Kentucky Derby.\n       ``The taint that I painted on the company--you know, `Here \n     is some drunk running the company. What can he do?'--at that \n     point, I kind of figured it would be short-lived before I \n     moved on,'' Meeker said.\n       Change, for Meeker, often meant breaking with tradition.\n       During his first year as president, Meeker rankled some \n     when he raised Derby ticket prices to fund on-track \n     improvements.\n       He called the track's neighborhood ``blighted'' and \n     promoted Sunday races to the dismay of area ministers.\n       And critics note that the same man who now embraces \n     simulcasting was initially opposed to it--a fact Meeker \n     readily admits.\n       ``Change is such a tough taskmaster. It truly is,'' Meeker \n     said. ``You have to have the sense of purpose, conviction and \n     risk-taking to be able to weather some of those storms and \n     believing what you are doing is the right thing.''\n       Most recently, the track's multimillion-dollar renovation \n     has given Churchill a much-needed face-lift--but it also adds \n     mammoth stacks of luxury suites that come close to \n     overshadowing the famed Twin Spires and has left some \n     longtime Derby ticket holders without a view of the race.\n       The changes have upset some traditionalists.\n       Meeker argues that replacing the patchwork of clubhouse and \n     grandstand additions that had been bolted on to previous \n     expansions will enhance the track's architectural integrity.\n       ``If we don't move,'' Meeker said, ``we're going to get \n     lost in the wash.''\n       Under his leadership, Churchill also expanded its portfolio \n     by buying other tracks and later formed a separate simulcast \n     network.\n       ``He's taken Churchill Downs from just a facility that was \n     used two days a year: the Oaks and Derby,'' said trainer John \n     T. Ward Jr., a former Kentucky racing commission member. ``. \n     . . He's continued to promote quality racing in everything \n     he's done, and he understands there's a definite relationship \n     between the racing and the horsemen--even though he's made a \n     few horsemen mad.''\n       Ed Flint, who negotiated with Meeker when he was president \n     of the Kentucky Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective \n     Association, would partially agree.\n       ``He did some great things for Churchill Downs. He's made a \n     lot of changes out there that have been good for the \n     industry,'' Flint said. ``But at the same time, I think his \n     negotiating tactics and his style have hurt the industry \n     some.''\n       Added Flint: ``He had the mentality of a go-get- `em, hard-\n     nosed type of person, and he let that run over into trying to \n     negotiate a lot of things that pertain to a lot of people. \n     You know, racing touches a lot of people--owners, trainers, \n     grooms, backside workers.''\n       Louisville businessman J. David Grissom, a Churchill Downs \n     director since 1979, said Meeker used to be impatient with \n     average or mediocre performance but has become more patient \n     through the years. Still, Grissom said: ``He does not suffer \n     fools gladly.''\n       Not overlooked as a priority when Meeker took over 20 years \n     ago was refocusing Churchill as a community player.\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\n       ``We were not contributing,'' Meeker said. ``We did a \n     modest amount of token contributions to this charity or that \n     charity, but we were not involved in our community at all.''\n       In 2003, Churchill Downs Inc. donated $424,460 to \n     Louisville philanthropy, bringing the total contributions to \n     $1.5 million over the last 3 years. The company recently \n     contributed $125,000 to a new Junior Achievement center in \n     the Russell neighborhood that is expected to teach financial \n     skills and business basics to 24,000 elementary and middle \n     school students each year.\n       But its generosity didn't help Churchill win friends when \n     it began its support in 1993 for expanded gambling as a way \n     to generate more revenue and boost purses for horsemen.\n       Bills to expand gambling at racetracks failed to advance in \n     the General Assembly in 2002, 2003 and again in this year's \n     session.\n       Churchill was a lightning rod during debate on Kentucky \n     House Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark's casino bill, which \n     stalled in the General Assembly this year. Clark's measure \n     would have put the issue before voters as an amendment to the \n     State constitution.\n       Clark, D-Okolona, wanted Churchill to locate its casino in \n     downtown Louisville. Meeker said a better location would be \n     the refurbished track or property the company owns at Fourth \n     and Central Avenues.\n       Rep. Tom Burch, D-Buechel, who praised Meeker's role in \n     building up Churchill Downs, said Meeker's style has agitated \n     some lawmakers during the General Assembly's consideration of \n     additional gambling.\n       ``Tom is very confrontational, and he shows it,'' Burch \n     said. ``Most legislators don't want to have him around.''\n       Burch said legislators are dealing with potential \n     repercussions in their areas of the State, and ``I don't \n     think (Meeker) understands that.''\n       But Meeker says he understands there will be friction \n     between a business person who wants to move fast and a \n     legislator who wants to build consensus.\n       ``One of my weakest skills is dealing with the legislative \n     body in Kentucky,'' he said. ``(In) every other jurisdiction \n     we have famous relationships. I talk to governors, speakers, \n     leaders, and we work well together. . . . For whatever reason \n     we haven't been able to achieve a collaborative, open \n     dialogue with our leaders in Frankfort. Why that is I don't \n     know. I'll accept the blame for it.''\n       Uninspired by his first trip to a horse track--a visit to \n     Churchill Downs with his future wife Carol's family in 1962--\n     Meeker had not seemed destined for a career in racing.\n       Nothing excited me about it,'' Meeker said, ``I mean, I \n     didn't know who to bet or any of that stuff.''\n       Meeker graduated summa cum laude from the University of \n     Louisville School of Law in 1973 and practiced corporate and \n     health-care law as an attorney with Wyatt Tarrant & Combs.\n       He began going to the track regularly when later serving as \n     understudy to John Tarrant, the longtime lawyer for Churchill \n     Downs, before being named general counsel in 1981.\n       It was a tumultuous time for the track. Summer racing \n     produced small fields and turned off bettors. There were two \n     separate attempts by others to take over Churchill. Meeker \n     was in the thick of the action, helping the track organize \n     its defense.\n       ``I came to understand,'' he said, ``exactly what the \n     potential of the company was.''\n       Meeker was named interim president following his friend \n     Lynn Stone's resignation. ``The deal was; I'd stay out here \n     for three or four months, get some visibility, meet people.''\n       But in the span of two months, Meeker's performance was \n     enough to sway the track's board. He was named to the post \n     permanently on Sept. 28, 1984.\n       There were some personally embarrassing moments along the \n     way. In a highly publicized incident in 1986, Meeker ejected \n     Kentucky state Sen. Greg Higdon from Churchill's suite during \n     a University of Louisville basketball game.\n       Meeker thought Higdon was crashing the party. Higdon hadn't \n     identified himself and neither man knew the other, Meeker \n     later apologized.\n       A new turf course inside the dirt oval, new paddock and \n     Turf Club helped boost Churchill's image. So did a new paint \n     job.\n       The turf course helped Churchill land the first of its \n     record five Breeders' Cups in 1988. The top four Breeders' \n     Cup crowds--all greater than 70,000--have been in Louisville, \n     including a then-record attendance of 71,237 in 1988.\n       In just four years, Churchill had made a quick turnaround. \n     By spring of 1989, Churchill had posted nine straight meets \n     with increased betting handle and attendance.\n       Meeker, however, was starting to get bored. Four years into \n     the job at Churchill Downs, Meeker simply didn't see running \n     a racetrack in his future.\n       ``I just didn't think I could be happy out here for the \n     long haul,'' he said. ``Then things started happening.''\n       Intertrack wagering, or simulcasting, was a new system that \n     allowed horse tracks to televise their races to other tracks \n     and take bets on races run elsewhere.\n       William King, then-president and general manager of the \n     Louisville Downs harness track on Poplar Level Road, \n     introduced simulcasting in Louisville with broadcasts of \n     races from Turfway Park in Northern Kentucky in 1988. The \n     experiment generated $8 million wagered at Louisville Downs.\n       Meeker originally opposed simulcasting, arguing that it \n     could diminish on-track attendance and weaken purses for \n     horsemen. His preference was establishing a network of off-\n     track betting parlors across the state, but he changed his \n     mind after seeing Louisville Downs' results.\n       Louisville Downs and Churchill Downs wrangled over \n     splitting simulcasting revenue and broadcast dates. The \n     bickering ended when Churchill bought Louisville Downs for $6 \n     million in 1992.\n       The purchase ended harness racing in Louisville, but it \n     gave Churchill much-needed barn space and a training \n     facility. A refurbished simulcasting center, which opened \n     later that year at the Louisville Downs site, was the heart \n     of the deal.\n       ``It was state of the art, the big screens and all that \n     stuff,'' Meeker said. ``We were kind of the darling child of \n     the industry. And it was cranking off tons of money. It was \n     doing well, which allowed us then to internally finance some \n     of these other capital improvements.''\n       Simulcasting set the stage for the company's push into the \n     1990s. But Meeker now believes he might not have seen the \n     growth that followed--buying and developing other tracks and \n     expanding its simulcast business--if he had not gotten help \n     for a drinking problem that threatened to spiral out of \n     control.\n       Meeker remembers the late Churchill Downs board Chairman \n     Warner L. Jones Jr. as an irascible, hard-nosed man who \n     cursed like a sailor and gave like a saint.\n       ``And he was the one that got me sober--truth be known.''\n       Fifteen years later, Meeker has put his drinking into \n     perspective. He is candid. He said his drinking never spilled \n     over to the office, but he acknowledged that it had to hurt \n     in other ways.\n       On occasion, Meeker would have a few drinks during Derby \n     Week before heading out to speak to groups. He believed, he \n     said, that he was being eloquent.\n       The reality was vastly different.\n       ``I was at the cusp of really just falling right off the \n     edge,'' he said.\n       It was May 7, 1989, the day after Sunday Silence won the \n     Kentucky Derby. Meeker decided he needed help to conquer his \n     alcohol abuse.\n       He called Jones, who in turn called his friend Wheelock \n     Whitney, a philanthropist and former co-owner of the National \n     Football League's Minnesota Vikings.\n       Through Whitney, a thoroughbred owner and breeder whose \n     wife sought treatment for a drinking problem, Jones arranged \n     a place for Meeker at the Hazelden alcohol and drug \n     rehabilitation center in Center City, Minn.\n       ``It was kind of tough in those days (to get in),'' Meeker \n     said. ``Everybody was drunk. They needed treatment.''\n       When Meeker arrived at the Louisville airport Tuesday \n     morning to fly to Minnesota, Jones was waiting to accompany \n     him. Jones, Meeker recalled, wanted to ensure that Meeker \n     made it to rehab.\n       Whitney met the two men in Minnesota and drove them to \n     Hazelden. Whitney and Jones carried on a lively conversation \n     in the front seat of the car. Meeker sat in the back, he \n     said, scared half to death.\n       Soon the three were lost. The Hazelden sign was small, and \n     the car passed it by. When they finally found the clinic, \n     Whitney said Jones tried to cut a deal with Hazelden's \n     president:\n       ``Tom Meeker means a lot to me, and we want to see him get \n     well. And I'll tell you what. If he gets well here, I'm going \n     to give you a new sign out on the road, because that one you \n     got is not what a place like this needs.''\n       Several years after Meeker left Hazelden, Jones made good \n     on his promise.\n       ``Warner did provide a brand new sign out on the highway \n     for Hazelden in honor of Tom Meeker's recovery,'' Whitney \n     said. ``It still stands there today.''\n       Meeker returned to Churchill Downs after a month of \n     treatment with ``my head screwed on right.''\n       By the early 1990s, Churchill Downs was posed to grow. In \n     1993 the company unveiled a four-part business strategy that \n     included increasing Churchill's share of the simulcast market \n     and acquiring additional racetracks.\n       The company explored the possibility of building a track in \n     Virginia Beach, Va., but that state's racing commission \n     awarded the license to a competing group that later built \n     Colonial Downs.\n       ``It was the first time where we actually in a \n     businesslike, methodical way targeted a development project, \n     and our skill sets were low-level,'' Meeker said. ``We had \n     not done any major acquisitions. We were good operators (but) \n     we didn't have a real strong finance component.''\n       Meanwhile, Churchill set its sights on Indiana. Any pari-\n     mutuel wagering or gambling in Indiana posed a direct threat \n     to Churchill Downs and Kentucky racing.\n       Churchill financed the development of a thoroughbred and \n     standardbred track in Anderson, Ind., then became majority \n     owner when the license holders defaulted. Hoosier Park, \n     Churchill's first track outside Louisville in the modern era, \n     held its first harness race on Sept. 1, 1994.\n       ``We had our operation up and running in Indiana before \n     Colonial Downs raced their first race,'' Meeker said. \n     ``That's how quick we responded, and many of the things that \n     we learned in Virginia we applied in Indiana.''\n       Indiana has since become a battleground state.\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n       The state's gaming commission granted the first license for \n     riverboat gambling in 1995, paving the way for fierce \n     competition for Kentucky's gambling dollar. And Churchill's \n     monopoly on live racing ended in late 2002 when Indiana Downs \n     in Shelbyville, Ind., opened the state's second pari-mutuel \n     track.\n       But the maturation of Churchill Downs Inc., came in a \n     string of acquisitions that began in the late 1990s. Starting \n     with Ellis Park in 1998, the company bought Calder Race \n     Course in Miami and Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif.\n       A merger with Arlington Park near Chicago in 2000 ballooned \n     Churchill's portfolio to six racetracks in five states, \n     including three in major U.S. markets.\n       ``It was one of those incredible times in business where \n     you actually invent new ways of doing things on the fly,'' \n     said John Long, chief operating officer at Churchill Downs \n     Inc., from 1999 to 2003.\n       Churchill's strategy shifted several years ago, considering \n     acquisitions in places where expanded gambling is likely.\n       Documents filed this week in a Louisiana bankruptcy court \n     show the company made the highest offer in private talks for \n     the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans.\n       Churchill still could buy the bankrupt New Orleans track at \n     an upcoming bankruptcy auction, a move that would give it \n     winter racing and a facility soon to install hundreds of slot \n     machines.\n       Meeker is 60 and his contract will be up for renewal in \n     2006.

Mr. President, I commend the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor its action today in reporting a resolution urging action by the \nUnited States and the international community to respond to the ongoing \nethnic violence in Sudan. The Senate should act on this resolution as \nsoon as possible.\n  It has been 10 years since the Rwanda genocide. A decade ago, 8,000 \nRwandans were being killed every day, yet the international community \nwas silent. We did not stop the deaths of 800,000 Tutsis and \npolitically moderate Hutu, in spite of our commitment that genocide \nmust never again darken the annals of human history.\n  Sadly, we may now be repeating the same mistake in Sudan.\n  In 1998, President Clinton made a special visit to Kigali, Rwanda's \ncapital, ``partly,'' he said, ``in recognition of the fact that we in \nthe United States and the world community did not do as much as we \ncould have and should have done to try to limit what occurred'' in \nRwanda. His visit and strong words remind us that we must not hesitate \nto act, when the horror is clear and when so many lives may be lost.\n  Over the past few weeks, reports of severe ethnic violence have come \nfrom Darfur, a region of western Sudan. We have heard accounts of \nthousands or even tens of thousands of people murdered, of widespread \nrape, and of people's homes burned to the ground.\n  The Sudanese Government has refused to allow full access to western \nSudan. International monitors and humanitarian workers have been \nprevented from reaching the area. We need immediate access to gather \nmore information on what is happening and to provide urgent \nhumanitarian relief to the one million people the United Nations \nreports have been displaced internally in Sudan or across the border to \nChad.\n  Many of us hoped that the humanitarian ceasefire and agreement \nearlier this month between the Sudanese government and rebel forces in \nwestern Sudan would end the many months of violence against entire \ncommunities. It has not. The bombing of villages by the Sudanese Air \nForce continues, and so does the mayhem by the paramilitary forces \nunleashed by the Government of Sudan.\n\n  The burning of homes and crops of desperately poor villagers has left \nin its ashes a humanitarian disaster. Without immediate relief, experts \npredict deaths in the hundreds of thousands. The cruelty of the \nGovernment of Sudan and its paramilitary allies against other ethnic \ngroups raises the very real specter of genocide.\n  The United States and the international community need to act now, to \nstop this brutality, to save lives.\n  President Bush should make a strong public statement alerting the \nworld to the violence in Darfur. He should call the international \ncommunity to action, and increase pressure on the Sudanese Government. \nDoing so would send a strong signal that the international community \nwill not accept these continuing atrocities. Sudan has been seeking \nbetter relations with the United States. It must be told that our \nnation will have no relations with a genocidal government.\n  The United States should propose a resolution in the United Nations \nSecurity Council to condemn the violations of international law being \ncommitted in Darfur, particularly the indiscriminate targeting of \ncivilians and the obstruction of humanitarian aid by the government. \nThe U.N. should demand immediate international access to the region to \nassess the full scale of the need for assistance. The U.N. should also \ninsist on adequate support for international human rights monitors and \nfor monitors of the ceasefire agreement reached last week.\n  The international community must demand that Sudan stop the violence \nnow, and give full humanitarian access to Darfur without question or \nqualification.\n  To minimize the suffering of those affected by the violence, we \nshould immediately identify funds and food aid to meet at least the \ntraditional U.S. share of the $110 million appeal from the U.N. Office \nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to support urgently needed \nassistance for internally displaced persons and refugees. These \ninternally displaced persons and refugees must also be allowed by the \nSudanese Government and militias to return safely to their homes, to \nrebuild their lives and communities, as soon as possible.\n\n  The European Community, African countries and the rest of the \ninternational community should use their considerable influence to \npressure Sudan to end the violence in Darfur, and end it now.\n  If the international community fails to act--and to act now--the \nconsequences will be dire.\n  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan was eloquent in his \nstatement at the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Rwanda \ngenocide. He said that he would not permit Darfur to become the first \ngenocide of the 21st century.\n  There will be discussion in Washington and around the world about \nwhether the ethnic violence in Darfur is, in fact, genocide, but we \ncannot allow the debate over definitions obstruct our ability to act as \nsoon as possible.\n  It is a matter of the highest moral responsibility for each of us \nindividually, for Congress, for the United States, and for the global \ncommunity to do all we can to stop the violence against innocents in \nDarfur. We must act, because thousands of people's lives will be lost \nif we don't.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4678-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STAND WITH OUR NATION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week mayors and police chiefs from \nacross the country will join with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence to urge President Bush and Congress to renew the federal \nAssault Weapons Ban.\n  The 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons, as well as a \nnumber of other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics \nsuch as pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash \nsuppressors. The assault weapons ban also prohibited the manufacture of \nsemiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two of these military \nfeatures and which accept a detachable magazine. This law is scheduled \nto expire on September 13, 2004.\n  I support the efforts of the law enforcement community and local \nleaders who are calling for legislation extending the law. In 1994, I \nvoted for the assault weapons ban and, last month, I joined a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend the assault \nweapons ban for 10 years.\n  Law enforcement support for the assault weapons ban is broad. It \nincludes the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, the Police Foundation, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Association of School Resource Officers, the National \nFraternal Order of Police, National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, the Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation, and the National Black Police Association.\n  In addition, mayors and police chiefs from Detroit, Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, Miami, Seattle, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. have joined \nover 200 other local leaders in sending a letter urging Congress to \nimmediately pass a 10-year extension of the assault weapons ban.\n  Despite broad support for this law, the National Rifle Association \nfought against passage of the assault weapons ban in 1994 and continues \nto oppose it to this day.\n  While President Bush has indicated that he supports reauthorizing the \nassault weapons ban, and a bipartisan majority in the Senate is on the \nrecord supporting reauthorization, the President has failed to urge \nCongress to act on this important legislation before it expires on \nSeptember 13th. The ban is a major public safety measure that protects \ncitizens and police officers and I urge the President and the Congress \nto act immediately to reauthorize the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4678-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4678-S4679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OUTSOURCING AND CLOW VALVE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after 2\\1/2\\ years of a largely jobless \nrecovery, the current administration is on track to be the first in \nover six decades actually\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nto lose jobs during its 4-year term. It is particularly alarming that \nthis country has lost more than one in seven of its manufacturing jobs \nsince this administration took office. More than one in seven.\n  One reason is outsourcing. We have been seeing good, high-wage \nmanufacturing jobs transferred overseas for a number of years. But \noutsourcing now has accelerated. It has spread to ``knowledge-based \njobs''--programming, auditing, accounting, engineering, design, \ntelemarketing, animation, editing, transcription, legal assistance, \ncall centers and even core research.\n  Some economists have argued over the years that free trade helps the \nUnited States to concentrate on creating high-wage, high-value-added \njobs here in America. But now those jobs are being exported, too. The \nold rules of comparative advantage have been exploded.\n  As we all know by now, the President's annual economic report, signed \nby Mr. Bush, explained why we should be celebrating the outsourcing and \noff-shoring of American jobs. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors, summed up the report. He said \nthat ``outsourcing is a growing phenomenon, but it's something that we \nshould realize is . . . a plus for the economy.''\n  Yes, you heard that right: Outsourcing is ``a plus for the economy.''\n  Outsourcing of U.S. jobs, however, is just one side of the coin. The \nother side of the coin is U.S. jobs that are lost because this \nadministration refuses to enforce our existing trade laws--for example, \nexisting laws that protect against sudden surges of imports from abroad \nwhich harm particular businesses or sectors here in our country. This \nrefusal threatens U.S. manufacturers and destroys American jobs.\n  Let me offer one vivid example:\n  Clow Valve Company has operated in the town of Oskaloosa, Iowa, since \n1878. It manufactures iron pipes, water hydrants and other foundry \nproducts. If there's a fire hydrant on your block--and there should be \none under most city codes--chances are excellent that it was made by \nClow Valve Company.\n  The company was acquired by McWane, Inc., of Birmingham, Alabama in \n1985. McWane owns similar facilities in several other states, including \nAlabama, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Tennessee, \nemploying some 7,000 workers.\n  Last year, McWane, Inc., faced a near tripling of Chinese imports of \nwaterwork pipes compared to the previous year, with Chinese product \nbeing sold at prices that severely undercut American producers. \nObviously, continued expansion of sales by Chinese companies at this \nrate could cause serious market disruption. It could threaten all 7,000 \njobs in these plants, including the 358 in the Clow facilities in \nOskaloosa, IA.\n  Nonetheless, President Bush has steadfastly refused to use his \nauthority under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 to restrain this \nsurge of imports, even though such a step was unanimously recommended \nby the International Trade Commission (ITC) last December. I wrote to \nthe administration on two occasions, once to the ITC and once to the \nPresident himself, urging that our trade officials utilize existing \nlaws that were enacted for the very purpose of temporarily protecting \nAmerican jobs from sudden surges of imported products.\n  The President's refusal to enforce our trade laws has profound \nconsequences. In Oskaloosa, it could mean the loss of some or all of \nthe 358 good-quality, high-paying jobs at the Clow Valve Company. In \nturn, that would have a devastating impact all across Mahaska County. \nBear in mind that Clow Valve is now the single largest employer located \nin the county. It is an employer with deep roots in the community. I \nimagine there might be some bewilderment among people there about the \nrefusal of the Bush Administration to stand up and defend those jobs.\n\n  Let me summarize the basic facts:\n  We have a clear case of harmful trade practices on the part of the \nChinese--flooding the U.S. market with cut-rate waterwork pipes.\n  In December, the United States International Trade Commission ruled \nthat a surge in imports of Chinese waterwork pipes had caused market \ndisruption and material injury to domestic manufacturers such as Clow \nValve Company.\n  The Commission was unanimous in its conclusion that imports from \nChina should be restrained pursuant to section 421 of the Trade Act of \n1974.\n  The Commission was unanimous in its prediction that, without \nimplementation of an effective relief program, the U.S. waterwork pipes \nindustry may have to close plants and lay off workers.\n  And yet, the White House refused to act. Which leads me to ask: Whose \nside are they on?\n  Mr. President, it is clear to me that the jobless recovery here in \nthe U.S. is not an accident. It is the result of a productivity surge \nthat has benefited corporate profits, not workers' paychecks. It is the \nresult of corporate America's enthusiastic embrace of outsourcing and \noff-shoring jobs, with the blessing and encouragement of the Bush \nadministration. And it is the result of the refusal of this \nadministration to enforce our trade laws--its refusal to stand up for \nAmerican workers, including in the face of seriously harmful trading \npractices from abroad.\n  We cannot build a sustainable recovery by exporting jobs, driving \ndown U.S. wages to match foreign wages, and allowing nations like China \nto flood our market with cheap imports.\n  No, a true recovery must include all Americans. It can only be built \non a foundation of good jobs and good wages--here in America, not \noverseas. And it can only be sustained if the administration, at long \nlast, is willing to enforce our trade laws and stand up for American \nworkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4679-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4679-S4680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, next week the Senate will consider a trade \nadjustment assistance amendment introduced by my colleagues Senators \nWyden and Coleman. I am a co-sponsor of this amendment, which is \noffered on the JOBS bill, to which we will be returning next week.\n  I also want to acknowledge Senators Rockefeller and Bingaman, who \nhave worked hard to produce a strong amendment.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do. And now is the right time to \ndo it.\n  The JOBS bill is about creating jobs and about keeping existing jobs \nin America. But we all know that--no matter how strong we make this \nJOBS bill--some workers may still see their jobs move overseas.\n  Since 1962, trade adjustment assistance--what we call ``TAA''--has \nprovided retraining, income support, and other benefits so that workers \nwho lose their jobs due to trade can make a new start.\n  The rationale for TAA is simple. When our government pursues trade \nliberalization, we create benefits for the economy as a whole. But \nthere is always some dislocation from trade.\n  As President Kennedy said, ``those injured by . . . trade competition \nshould not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact.'' ``There \nis an obligation,'' he said, for the federal government ``to render \nassistance to those who suffer as a result of national trade policy.'' \nWe meet that obligation through TAA.\n  The TAA program has not been static over time. Several times, \nCongress has revised the program to meet new economic realities.\n  Most recently, in the Trade Act of 2002, Congress completed an \nimportant overhaul and expansion of the TAA program. I am very proud to \nhave played a leading role in passing this landmark legislation.\n  But I am also the first to admit that our work is not done. Economic \nrealities continue to change, and TAA must continue to change with \nthem.\n  I am co-sponsoring the Wyden/Coleman amendment, because it makes \ncommon sense changes that help TAA keep up with the times.\n  Most importantly, the amendment extends TAA to service workers. Right \nnow, we only give TAA benefits to workers who make things. That means \nAmerican workers in the service sector cannot access this program.\n  But today, more than 80 percent of non-farm U.S. jobs are in the \nservice sector. And the market for many services is becoming just as \nglobal as the market for manufactured goods.\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n  Trade in services is a net plus for the U.S. economy. In fact, the \nservice sector generated a trade surplus of nearly $74 billion in 2001.\n  Just as we have seen with trade in manufactured goods, however, trade \nin services will inevitably cost some workers their jobs.\n  Indeed, there have been some well-publicized examples in the papers. \nExamples abound of service-sector jobs--even high tech service jobs--\nrelocating overseas. Software design. Technical support. Accounting and \ntax preparation services. Radiology.\n  Over the past 3 years, somewhere between a quarter and a half million \nservice jobs have moved to other mainly low-wage countries.\n  This trend has hit home in my State of Montana. Recently, a large \ntechnical support call center closed in Kalispell. At least 550 \nMontanans lost their jobs while jobs were created in Canada and India.\n  Another Montana employer laid off workers doing medical billing and \ndata management. Those workers applied for TAA and were turned down--\nnot because the layoff wasn't trade related, but simply because they \nare service workers.\n  That's not right. Extending TAA to cover service workers is a simple \nmatter of equity. When a factory relocates to another country, those \nworkers can apply for TAA. When a call center moves to another country, \nthose workers are not eligible for TAA. But they should be.\n  This amendment also makes some modest changes to eligibility rules to \nmake it more user-friendly for workers. It removes some of the steps \nthat workers have to take to meet the tests for shifts in production, \nalternative TAA, and to qualify for the health insurance tax credit. \nAnd it makes the health insurance options available to TAA recipients \nmore affordable.\n  The amendment provides for better data collection and reporting. That \nway Congress and the public will have a better idea who is using TAA \nbenefits and how participants are faring in the job market.\n  The amendment also helps trade-impacted communities to better plan \ntheir economic redevelopment and job creation strategies. That way \nworkers who complete TAA retraining have a better chance of finding \njobs in their communities.\n  Hard-working American workers deserve this safety net. Despite what \nsome opponents of TAA suggest, no worker would choose to lose his job \nso he can qualify for TAA. These benefits will always be second best to \na job. But they can really make a difference in helping workers make a \nnew start.\n  It is also critical to note that TAA can make an important difference \nin public attitudes. Surveys show that most Americans feel a lot more \ncomfortable with globalization, offshoring, and trade when they know \nthey will get help if their jobs are threatened.\n  That's why 66 percent of Americans responding to a recent poll agreed \nwith the following statement: ``I favor free trade, and I believe that \nit is necessary for the government to have programs to help workers who \nlose their jobs.''\n  The world is changing and TAA must keep up with the times. This \namendment will help our government to keep its promise to the American \npeople to make trade work for everyone.\n  I commend my colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator Coleman for \noffering this amendment. I look forward to voting on it next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4680-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4680-S4681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEDICARE DRUG DISCOUNT CARD\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a much \nanticipated health care benefit that will help millions of our Nation's \nseniors--the new Medicare prescription drug discount card.\n  There are approximately $900,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Missouri; \nof these about one-fourth doesn't have prescription drug coverage. The \nnew Medicare drug law provides these people with access to a \nprescription drug benefit for the first time in the history of the \nMedicare program. Medicare recipients--people 65 and older and some \ndisabled people--are eligible, unless they receive drug coverage \nthrough Medicaid. A person with a discount card can get the price \nbreaks by simply going to the participating pharmacies and presenting \nthe card.\n  Seniors know that these cards are a good deal--about 7.3 million \nMedicare recipients are expected to sign up for them. Applications for \nthe cards will be available May 3, and the discounts begin June 1. The \ncards have an annual enrollment fee of up to $30, and offer an average \nsavings of about 17 percent and for some drugs up to 25 percent off. \nThe average savings on generic drugs is even higher--35 percent to 40 \npercent. These discounts are for at least one drug in each of 209 \ncategories of medicines commonly used by seniors.\n  Beneficiaries with annual incomes less than $12,569 per year for \nindividuals or $16,862 for couples are eligible for a $600 annual \nsubsidy for their prescription drug costs. Also, these folks won't have \nto pay any enrollment fees for the next 2 calendar years. That's a \ntotal of $191 million in additional help for the 159,000 beneficiaries \nin Missouri who are currently eligible to participate in this program. \nThese lower income seniors will also get price discounts of up to 25 \npercent on brand-name drugs and up to 40 percent of generic drugs.\n  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expect 65 percent of the \nlow-income beneficiaries nationally to participate in this program. \nThis means that a total of 103,000 Missourians are expected to enroll \nin the Medicare drug discount card and to save a total of $124 million \nover the next two calendar years. You can see why this is a good deal \nfor America's seniors to help them lead longer, healthier lives through \nmedication therapy.\n  I have traveled all over my home State of Missouri and have visited \nwith dozens of seniors who've told me about the high price of medicine, \nand how they are making tough choices between paying for their needed \ndrugs and paying for other essentials of life.\n  I want to take a minute to tell you about Audrey Vallely, a senior \nfrom Pacific, MO, who testified at an Aging Committee hearing that I \nheld in St. Louis last August. Audrey has osteoarthritis, a \ndegenerative bone disease and another sinus disease that causes her to \nbecome dizzy. Her medicine costs over $100 a month for 15 or so pills \nto treat these conditions. But because she is living on a limited \nincome, she cannot afford to pay for these medicines.\n  Audrey told me how sometimes she must choose between buying \nprescription drugs or paying rent, buying food or just living with air \nconditioning in the summer. These are choices that no one should have \nto make. I made a promise to Missouri seniors like Audrey that I would \nhelp them get access to quality, affordable health care, and today I am \npleased to deliver on that promise.\n  I want to share with you some of the questions that seniors have \nasked me about the drug card as I visited with them during my Medicare \ntown hall meetings in Missouri.\n  First, folks wanted to know whether they had to enroll in the drug \ndiscount card. The answer is no, these discount cards are completely \nvoluntary. That means enrolling is their choice. Importantly, seniors \nand not the Government will have the power to choose which card is best \nfor them depending on their health care needs.\n  Seniors also wanted to know who can get one of these discount cards. \nI told them that almost anyone with Medicare can get a discount card. \nThe only people who aren't eligible are those who have outpatient \nprescription drug coverage through Medicaid when they apply.\n  Thinking that these drug discount cards could be a very good thing, \nseniors wanted to know how soon they could get these cards and how long \nthe discounts would last. I told them that they could begin enrolling \nin the drug discount cards this month, and the cards will be good until \nat least December 31, 2005, when Medicare's new prescription drug \nbenefit starts.\n  Seniors also asked me whether there was only one Medicare-approved \ndrug discount card that they could get. Last March, HHS approved 28 \nproviders that will offer about 49 different discount cards to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. This means that seniors will have a choice of more than \none discount card and this is a good thing since seniors with a certain \ntype of disease like diabetes or heart disease may choose a card with \ndeeper discounts on medicines that treat that disease.\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n  Also, there may be some seniors who prefer specific name brands or \ngeneric drugs, and they may want to choose a card from that \nmanufacturer. Missouri has a combined total of 43 individual drug \ncards. This includes 36 national drug cards, 4 regional cards, and 3 \nMedicare Advantage exclusive cards. With all these choices, seniors can \nchoose which card is best for their particular health care needs.\n  The cards are completely voluntary, so those seniors who don't want a \ncard don't have to have one. But for those seniors who choose to take \nadvantage of the drug discounts, I look forward to helping them get \nstarted and putting them in touch with people and resources to help \nthem make informed decisions.\n  Beginning today, 1-800-Medicare will be staffed with 1,400 operators \naround the clock to field questions about which discount card is best \nfor that particular senior. Or folks can go online at www.Medicare.gov \nand search prescription drug and other assistance programs to prepare \nfor the May 3 enrollment.\n  There is much to be excited about, and I am pleased to support this \nbenefit to help our Greatest Generation live longer, healthier lives.\n  I also thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership on the Medicare \nlaw, and recognize his hard work to build strong bipartisan support for \nthis legislation to help America's seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4681-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4681-S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO SLAIN CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, three law enforcement officers in the \nState of California have been murdered in the past three weeks in gang-\nrelated slayings. And a fourth was killed in February.\n  I come to the floor to pay tribute to these brave officers and \ndiscuss the perils police face every day, especially from gang members \narmed with high-powered assault weapons and other guns.\n  Late Saturday night, April 10, one of San Francisco's finest young \npolice officers, Officer Isaac Espinoza, was shot and killed.\n  Officer Espinoza was gunned down with an assault weapon, an AK-47, \ntaking three shots in the back as the gunman fired 15 rounds in just \nseconds. Officer Espinoza and his partner, who was also shot, had no \ntime to seek refuge. The suspect in the shootings is a known gang \nmember.\n  Officer Espinoza, at 29 years of age, was a distinguished police \nofficer, one of the Department's bright young stars who worked in one \nof the City's toughest areas.\n  In fact, Officer Espinoza received three major service awards in his \neight years with the Department including: the Silver Medal of Valor \nfor his bravery in a shoot-out that occurred on October, 20, 2000; the \nPurple Heart for injuries sustained in a foot pursuit as he and his \npartner attempted to make a drug arrest on May 5, 2002; and the Police \nCommission Commendation for his work to reduce crime in the Bayview \nneighborhood.\n  He was also recognized as Patrol Officer of the Month by the Captain \nof the Bayview Police Station in June 2003.\n  Officer Espinoza also served as a new board member of the Police \nOfficers Association. He was Assistant Commissioner of the softball \nleague. And he planned to take the next Sergeant's exam.\n  His death is a great loss to the Department and to the City. It is a \nparticularly great loss to his wife and 3-year-old daughter.\n  On April 15, Merced Police Officer Stephan Gray was shot and killed \nwhen a suspect he was chasing on foot turned around and fired two \nbullets into his chest.\n  Officer Gray, 34 years of age, worked in the Merced Police \nDepartment's gang violence unit, working with some of his community's \nmost dangerous offenders. In fact, the suspect in his killing is a gang \nmember with whom he is believed to have had previous encounters.\n  Officer Gray had served with the Merced Police Department for seven \nyears. And in those seven years of service, he earned the admiration of \nhis colleagues and once received a commendation for resuscitating an \n11-month old baby.\n  Being a police officer was not just a job for Officer Gray, it was a \nway for him to change the world. He not only patrolled the streets, but \nhe went out and got to know the neighborhood children in the \ncommunities he served. He shot baskets with the kids and, drawing on \nhis days as a high school track star, taught them how to sprint.\n  He was admired by his friends and neighbors for his loyalty to the \npolice department, but also his devotion to his family.\n  Officer Gray was a true pillar of his community. He is survived by \nhis wife and three children, ages 13, 5, and 3.\n  California Highway Patrol Officer Thomas Steiner, 35 years old, was \nmurdered April 21 in a drive-by shooting in broad daylight. Officer \nSteiner had just walked out of the Pomona courthouse after testifying \non a series of traffic cases when a 16-year-old shot him three times \nwith a handgun, hitting him once in the head.\n  According to Pomona Police Chief James Lewis, the teenager charged \nwith the shooting did not know Officer Steiner, but was merely intent \non ``killing a cop.''\n  Apparently, the 16-year-old wanted to kill a cop in an attempt to \nprove himself to a Pomona street gang.\n  Officer Steiner had been a member of the California Highway Patrol \nsince 1999. His colleagues described him as a positive influence on the \npolice force, the kind of guy who never had anything bad to say about \nanyone.\n  On top of being a well-respected cop, he was an excellent marksman \nand an avid sports fan. Officer Steiner is survived by his wife, his \n13-year-old stepson, and his three-year old son.\n  These three killings occurred in an 11-day period in April. They are \nbut the latest deaths to report.\n  Two months ago, Los Angeles Police Officer Ricardo Lizzaraga was \nkilled while responding to a domestic violence call.\n  At the apartment where the call originated, Officer Lizarraga \nconfronted a man. Within seconds, the individual drew a gun and shot \nLizarraga twice in the back as he and his fellow officers fled from the \napartment. The suspect in the shooting was a known gang member.\n  Officer Lizarraga, 31, had served two-and-a half years on the force. \nIn that time, he quickly became a well-respected police officer known \nfor his strong work ethic and great attention to detail.\n  He was viewed as a gentle giant by his colleagues, friends and \nfamily. Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton described him as the \n``face of Los Angeles.''\n  Officer Lizarraga is survived by his wife Joyce.\n  These stories are chilling. They remind us that even those charged \nwith protecting us are vulnerable. They reveal a segment of society \nthat is utterly lawless, unbound by any code of decency.\n  And sadly, they are just a few of the stories that we will tell this \nyear of cops being killed in the line of duty.\n  These tragic deaths are sure to continue because we have not done \nenough to stem the availability of guns nor curb the viciousness of \ngangs.\n  This body knows well that the assault weapons ban is on the verge of \nexpiration. However, what this Congress has failed to recognize is that \nif we allow assault weapons to be more freely available, law \nenforcement officers will be in even greater danger.\n  Around 70 officers are killed each year by criminals. And, according \nto a study by the Violence Policy Center, 1 in 5 law enforcement \nofficers killed between 1998 and 2001 were shot with assault weapons. \nNow, police officers in San Francisco and other cities are exploring \nwhether to equip officers with military-style assault rifles and \nKevlar-plated vests.\n  And that's why nearly every law enforcement organization in the \ncountry supports renewing the ban on assault weapons--they know that \nthe lives of their officers are at risk.\n  The expiration of the ban would mean that assault weapons like the \none used to kill Officer Isaac Espinoza will be easier to obtain \nwhether at the nearest gun shop, sporting goods store or in someone's \nhome.\n  The easier it is for criminals to get their hands on these weapons, \nthe easier it will be for them to terrorize communities.\n  To honor the many law enforcement officers who have given their lives \nin\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nservice to their communities, we must renew the assault weapons ban \nbefore it expires on September 13.\n  But there is much more that we need to do to make communities and \ncops safer in America. In particular, we must check the rampant gang \nviolence that plagues our city streets and, increasingly, our suburbs \nand rural communities.\n  Gang violence used to be a local problem, demanding local solutions. \nBut over the last 12 years, since I have been in the Senate, I have \nseen this problem spread from isolated neighborhoods to communities \nacross this country.\n  Gangs have become more sophisticated and more violent criminal \nenterprises. What were once loosely-organized groups centered around \ndealing drugs within a particular neighborhood are now complex criminal \norganizations whose activities include weapons trafficking, gambling, \nsmuggling, robbery, and, of course, homicide.\n  In 2002, over half of the 1,228 homicides committed in Los Angeles \nCounty were gang-related. Similarly, over half of the 499 murders \ncommitted in the city of Los Angeles during 2003 were the result of \ngang violence.\n  The reach of gangs, however, extends far beyond Southern California.\n  In fact, Los Angeles serves as a ``source city'' whose gang members \nmigrate to other communities across the country and set up new criminal \nentities. One such operation, the L.A.-based 18th Street Gang, is known \nto have initiated gang activities all over California, in Southwest \nborder and Pacific Northwest states, and in East Coast states including \nNew Jersey and New York.\n  Today's gangs are more sophisticated, more violent, and more numerous \nthan they were 12 years ago. And that is why we need a strong federal \nresponse.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Hatch that will give law \nenforcement and local communities the tools to deal with gang violence.\n  Our legislation: Creates new federal crimes to enable prosecutors to \ntarget violent gang members; makes changes to current law to allow for \neffective prosecution for violent street gang crimes; authorizes $650 \nmillion for law enforcement and community groups for suppression, \nprevention, and intervention programs.\n  This bill gives us an opportunity to do something about the gang \nviolence that beleaguers our communities and endangers our cops. We owe \nit to these fine officers who were killed so viciously to do what we \ncan to prevent more violence by gangs.\n  If we fail to act on both these measures, I am sad to say that I will \nbe back here before long telling the story of some other fine law \nenforcement officer who is patrolling the streets of one of our \ncommunities right now. We must do everything possible to prevent these \nkillings from happening over and over again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4682-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARCH FOR WOMEN'S LIVES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Sunday, April 25, the March for \nWomen's Lives took place here in Washington. Its organizers estimated \nthat more than a million men, women, and children from more than 57 \ncountries gathered under the banner of reproductive rights, health, and \njustice for all women. Participants called on Congress and the \nadministration not only to protect the right to choose but also to \nprotect and promote family planning, maternal and child health care, \nand the empowerment of women in the United States and abroad.\n  An op-ed by Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, \nappeared that same day in the Chicago Sun-Times. The piece was entitled \n``March is About More than Abortion,'' and it explained that the \nmarchers' concerns went beyond the issue of abortion to include \nconcerns about HIV/AIDS prevention, family planning, the President's \nimposition of a global gag rule on family planning providers, and the \nadministration's refusal to release funds to the United Nations \nPopulation Fund to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies that can \nlead to abortion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Fornos' article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 25, 2004]\n\n                   March Is About More Than Abortion\n\n                           (By Werner Fornos)\n\n       Passing a barbershop window in Juneau, Alaska, the other \n     day, I spotted a placard inviting locals to join a rally in \n     Washington, D.C., today that could have significant \n     implications for the November presidential and congressional \n     elections.\n       If people from as far away as our country's northwestern-\n     most state converge upon the nation's capital in sufficient \n     numbers--say, a quarter of a million and upwards--it might be \n     time for President Bush and his political guru, Karl Rove, to \n     unbutton their collars and reach for the hyperventilation \n     bags. The performance of the Bush administration on women's \n     rights may be judged more by the turnout for this event than \n     by any poll or survey.\n       The purpose of the March for Women's Lives is to deliver to \n     our national leaders a strong, unequivocal message of support \n     for reproductive health and rights and justice for all women.\n       There are concerns well beyond those of hard-core feminists \n     that Bush administration policies are unduly influenced by \n     right-wing religious zealots and the Vatican, who oppose \n     modern contraceptives as well as abortion.\n       Much of this rising tide of reaction emanates from pro-\n     choice advocates infuriated by the refusal of the White House \n     and a Republican majority in Congress to acknowledge federal \n     law pronouncing abortion as a matter between a woman, her \n     conscience and her physician. But the march is about more \n     than the termination of pregnancies.\n       For example, a fact sheet about condoms was removed from \n     the National Institutes of Health Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention Web site and replaced with a document \n     emphasizing condom failure and the effectiveness of \n     abstinence.\n       No one is suggesting that condom failure should be ignored, \n     or that there is anything wrong with promoting abstinence. \n     The fact remains, however, that the condom, in addition to \n     being a method of preventing unintended pregnancy, is the \n     most effective defense against HIV/AIDS for sexually active \n     individuals.\n       In a world where 10 more people are infected with HIV every \n     minute, where half of the 40 million people already infected \n     are women, where HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death among \n     African-American women ages 25 to 34 and the seventh leading \n     cause of death for white American women that age, it is \n     patently inexcusable to omit the condom option from what \n     should be the nation's most trusted source of medical \n     information.\n       To explain the removal of the condom fact sheet, the White \n     House Office of Science and Technology Policy offered the \n     flimsy excuse that the CDC ``routinely takes information \n     off its Web site and replaces it with more up-to-date \n     information.'' Updating the Web site is understandable, \n     expunging the role of the condom in preventing HIV is \n     simply indefensible.\n       If the Bush administration routinely ignores the \n     reproductive rights and health of women in the United States, \n     it is hardly surprising that respected international family \n     planning nongovernmental organizations give the White House \n     and U.S. congressional leadership low marks on their concern \n     for poor women around the world.\n       Within an hour or two after taking the oath of office, \n     President Bush signed the global gag rule, a policy to deny \n     U.S. funds to overseas family planning organizations that \n     provide, perform or counsel women on abortion. In the United \n     States, this would be a flagrant violation of the First \n     Amendment right to freedom of speech. But the Bush \n     administration, while robustly promoting democratization \n     worldwide, does not hesitate to penalize the world's poorest \n     women by withholding this right from family planning \n     providers overseas.\n       Then, too, the White House remains adamant in its refusal \n     to release a $34 million appropriation by Congress to the \n     United Nations Population Fund, the largest multilateral \n     provider of family planning and reproductive health services \n     to women in more than 140 developing countries.\n       Ironically, the combined impact of the Bush \n     administration's global gag rule and its refusal to release \n     the congressional appropriation for the U.N. agency has led \n     to thousands of abortions resulting from pregnancies to poor \n     women worldwide who have been denied access to family \n     planning information, education and supplies.\n       There is ample evidence that the availability of condoms \n     and other medically approved family planning methods already \n     has prevented substantially more abortions than the Bush \n     administration's policies have, can, or could. The women who \n     will march in Washington today understand the calculus of \n     reproductive health and family planning denial, even if many \n     of our national leaders do not.\n       Werner Fornos is president of the Population Institute and \n     the 2003 United Nations Population laureate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4682-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4682-S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING FORMATION OF GLASS CAUCUS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one of the many strengths of the \nSenate community is our diverse workforce. It is that diversity that \ncontributes to a more informed and representative government.\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n  The promise of our Nation lies in its promise to every one of its \ncitizens that they will be judged by the quality of their work, the \ndepth of their potential and the strength of their intellect and \ncharacter. Anything less undermines the very principles of fairness we \nuphold and it diminishes not just those who are discriminated against, \nbut the professional communities in which they live and work the Senate \nincluded.\n  Recently, several Senate employees announced that they have formed an \ninformal, non-partisan group called Gays, Lesbians and Allies Senate \nStaff, GLASS, Caucus. The caucus is open to all Senate staff and is the \nfirst ever for gay and lesbian Senate staff and their allies. It is \ndesigned to raise awareness of issues affecting the gay and lesbian \ncommunity and increase visibility; and promote the welfare and dignity \nof gay and lesbian Senate employees by providing a safe environment for \nsocial interaction and professional development.\n  The GLASS caucus held its inaugural reception last night. I was \nhonored to attend and congratulate the members on their organization's \nformation. This was an historic moment for the Senate and special \nrecognition must be given to four of the founding members of the caucus \nfor a job well done: Mat Young, Lynden Armstrong, John Fossum and \nJeffrey Levensaler.\n  Gay and lesbian Americans want the same civil rights that are \nextended to other Americans--nothing more, nothing less. We must build \na community here in the Senate and across the Nation of mutual respect, \ntolerance, and freedom. This new staff caucus will make many valuable \ncontributions in that regard.\n  I wish this group well and hope that it will prove to be a valuable \naddition to the Senate community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4683-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SMALL BUSINESS PERSONS OF THE YEAR 2004\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nimportance of small business as the foundation of the U.S. economy and \nto congratulate Michael and Michele Robuck, co-owners of the Alaska \nMint based in Anchorage, AK, who today have been named the Small \nBusiness Persons of the Year for 2004 by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, SBA.\n  According to the Small Business Development Center of Alaska, 97 \npercent of all businesses in Alaska are defined as small businesses. \nEighty-five percent of all new jobs in Alaska are created by businesses \nwith fewer than 20 employees. Small businesses have created the \nmajority of the new jobs created in the last few years on a nationwide \nbasis. So the importance of small businesses to the Nation's and to the \nAlaskan economies is obvious.\n  The President's small business agenda recognizes that the role of \ngovernment is not to create wealth but to create an environment where \nentrepreneurial endeavors can flourish and people can directly benefit \nfrom their efforts. It is well accepted that small businesses and young \nbusiness are the driving force in job creation and prosperity.\n  Since 1963, the President has designated a week as the National Small \nBusiness Week in recognition of the small business's contributions to \nthe country. Next month, the White House and the Small Business \nAdministration will join in celebrating the small business people and \nbusinesses of the year.\n  Today, Mike and Michelle Robuck, as co-owners of the Alaska Mint, \nwill be named as the Alaska District Small Business of the Year 2004. \nThey were nominated by their banker, First National Bank Alaska for \nthis award. Congratulations to Mike and Michele Robuck.\n  Small business winners are evaluated in Alaska by a panel of judges \nconvened by the Alaska District Office on a variety of criteria \nincluding: staying power, growth in employees, increase in market or \nsales volume, response to adversity, contributions to the community, \nand innovation of the products they offer.\n  Now let me tell you about Mike and Michele Robuck, the Alaska Mint \nand why they deserved to be small business persons of the year for \nAlaska. Alaska Mint is a second generation Alaskan business that trades \nin many things but most important in the commodities that made Alaska--\ngold, silver, and platinum. Alaska Mint designs and produces \nmedallions, coins and jewelry. The Alaska Mint is designated as the \nofficial mint of the State of Alaska, the Alaska Railroad, the White \nPass and Yukon Route, the Iditarod Trail Committee, the Yukon Quest, \nand the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous.\n  Part of the wonderful story of the Alaska Mint is its very beginning. \nMike Robuck started the business as a sidewalk vending cart in downtown \nAnchorage in 1989. He was following in his father's foot steps that had \nstarted a small family-owned jewelry store in Anchorage in 1967. Mike \nlearned the importance of dealing with the public and the value of \ntourism to Alaska. It was not long after that Mike opened a store and \nassemble the equipment to manufacture his coins, jewelry, and \ncollectibles. I wish I could share with each member of the Senate an \nexample of his creativity and artistry.\n  With the help of the Small Business Administration and the First \nNational Bank Alaska, Mike and Michele Robuck expanded the business and \nbegan doing business nationwide with the help of QVC network and the \ninternet. Last year Alaska Mint released a coin to commemorate the \ntragic events of September 11, 2001, that within a 24-hour period sold \nand raised over $50,000 for the Red Cross.\n  Their success is more than just the bottom line. The Robucks often \nassist a variety of charities and local schools. Mike and Michele help \nwith counseling and provide jobs for two rehabilitation programs \nhelping people to regain their place in the community.\n  It took 5 years since the Robucks formally formed the Alaska Mint for \nthe business to become truly established and successful. From a one-\nperson operation in the mid 1980s, the business now employs 10 people \nfull time and increases to 20 during the summer tourist season. They \nare now a tourist destination and a place of education about the art of \ntheir work.\n  When the criteria for the award of the Small Business Persons of the \nYear are applied to the Robucks, they meet all of the standards. They \nshine like the coins they make. They have shown their staying power, \nincreased the number of employees, increased their markets and sales \nvolume, responded to challenges, shown innovation of the products they \noffer, and continue to contribute to the community. Mike and Michele \nRobuck, as a team, exemplify the qualities, the business skills, \npersonal character, and the spirit of Alaska that warrant their being \nawarded the Small Business Persons of the Year Award for 2004.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4683-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4683-S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF SMOKEY BEAR'S 60TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a \nbirthday and to pay tribute to a hero and icon from my home State a New \nMexican who became the renowned symbol for the Cooperative Forest Fire \nPrevention program. His name is Smokey Bear.\n  Sixty years ago this year, Smokey Bear became the voice for the \nForest Service public education campaign to save American forests. \nSince his creation in 1944, most Americans now quickly associate the \nname Smokey Bear with his mantra: ``Only You Can Prevent Forest \nFires.''\n  Not many know the remarkable story of Smokey Bear or that the fire \nprevention program is the longest running public service advertising \ncampaign in the history of the Ad Council. In 1950, Smokey Bear became \nreal, sadly through an unfortunate forest fire. That spring, in Lincoln \nCounty, a little black bear cub was found clinging to the side of a \ncharred pine tree after a forest fire swept through the mountains. \nAfter being discovered, he was briefly called ``Hot Foot Teddy,'' but \nwas later named Smokey Bear after the Ad Council's poster bear.\n  Since that late spring day, that cub became the living symbol of \nSmokey Bear and worked to remind Americans of the importance of outdoor \nfire safety. It is a message whose importance has not faded since the \nbear was discovered on a charred New Mexico mountain.\n  New Mexico, along with other Western States, has experienced \ndevastating\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nfires in recent years, which is why the fire prevention message is so \nimportant. Forest fires burn millions of acres, destroy homes and \nbusinesses, and, worse yet, take the lives of wildland firefighters. As \nwe remember all too well, 2000 was the worst fire year on record since \n1957, and subsequent years have not been much better.\n  Last year's devastating fires prompted us to finally agree to the \npassage of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. I have a feeling Smokey \nBear would be proud of that accomplishment, and know that his wildfire \nprogram had never been more important. While we now work to improve our \nforests with this new law, Smokey's message must still resound. This \nmessage of forest fire prevention has undoubtedly helped to reduce the \nnumber of forest acres lost annually to wildfire. By what measure, I \ncan never know. However, to suggest that he has not made a significant \ndifference would be amiss.\n  The injured cub discovered in 1950, our Smokey Bear, eventually \narrived at the National Zoo in Washington, DC, where he would become \nthe living symbol for fire prevention. He resided in the National Zoo \nfor 26 years until he passed on November 9, 1976. Most appropriately he \nwas returned to his old roaming grounds and to his home town to be laid \nto rest.\n  Capitan is a small town in Lincoln County, nestled between those \nCapitan and Sacramento Mountains of central New Mexico. This beautiful \nplace is full of wonderful people who love the land and refer to Smokey \nBear as ``Capitan's favorite son.'' Each year Capitan residents \ncelebrate his memory with the Fourth of July Smokey Bear Stampede, but \nthis year is a special tribute. The village is hosting a special 60th \nbirthday celebration May 7-9. Much of the 3-day festivity will take \nplace at the historical park named in Smokey Bear's honor and along \nwhat is now aptly named Smokey Bear Boulevard.\n  I pay tribute to the people of Capitan in this Record--they have gone \nto great lengths to preserve the story and meaning of Smokey Bear. I \nalso salute the USDA, the Forest Service, the National Association of \nState Foresters, and the Ad Council for supporting this program all \nthese years. May the initiative's success only be a prelude to future \nforest preservation and wildfire prevention, and may Smokey Bear and \nall he represents forever remain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4684-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMADOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL'S INVOLVEMENT IN WE THE PEOPLE\n\n Ms. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a \nremarkable group of young people who will be traveling to Washington, \nDC next week, May 1-3, to participate in the national finals of ``We \nthe People: The Citizen and the Constitution.'' This program consists \nof competitions in which students field questions that test their \nknowledge of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I am pleased to announce that students from Amador Valley High School \nin Pleasanton, CA will be representing the State of California in this \ncompetition. With the help of their civics teacher, Matthew Campbell, \nthese students have studied for months to prepare for their role as \nexperts testifying on constitutional issues in a simulated \ncongressional hearing.\n  These students have all worked very hard through first the \ncongressional, then state, and now national competitions. The members \nof this year's civics team are Nichole Barlow, Anna Currin, Tony \nD'Albora, Logan Daniels, Shelley DeFord, Michael Gondkoff, Gabe Ivey, \nNate Koppikar, Kristin MacDonnell, Sonia Markovic, Jennifer Martin, \nLacie McFarland, Shawna McGrath, Nicole Melton, Barry Ripley, Elisabeth \nSchulze, Sunaina Selam, Kent Stander, and Jae Yoo. I congratulate each \nof them for coming this far and send them my best wishes for next \nweek's competition.\n  It is very encouraging to see young people take such a profound \ninterest in studying those ideas and principles which are at the heart \nof our democracy and of our country. I am certain that this type of \ninvolvement will only lead to a deeper interest and that it will build \nstrong citizens and strong leaders for our country's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4684-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4684-S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING AN ARMY LEGEND\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nCommanding General, United States Army Forces Command, General Larry R. \nEllis. General Ellis has served as the Commanding General of U.S. Army \nForces Command from November 19, 2001, to May 7, 2004.\n  General Ellis, an outstanding American Soldier from the great State \nof Maryland, will soon complete over 35 years of selfless service to \nthis great Nation in the United States Army. General Ellis' dedication \nto our Soldiers, commitment to excellence, and performance of duty has \nbeen extraordinary throughout his career, a lifetime of service \nculminating in an assignment as the Commanding General of the largest \nmajor command in the United States Army. He will retire on July 1, \n2004.\n  During more than 35 years in uniform, General Ellis served in a \nsuccession of command and staff positions worldwide. As a junior \nofficer, he served in combat in the Republic of Vietnam, and \nsubsequently with troop units in positions of increasing responsibility \nthroughout the continental United States, Europe, and the Republic of \nKorea.\n  While the Deputy Director for Strategic Planning and Policy at U.S. \nPacific Command, and as the Assistant Chief of Staff, J3, for United \nStates Forces Korea, General Ellis supervised the training and \nperformance of American military forces throughout the Far East.\n  He commanded units at every echelon of the Army, including the First \nArmored Division in Germany and when deployed as the Multinational \nDivision (North), in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a combined task force that \nincluded units from 13 nations. In this capacity General Ellis \ncoordinated European military and civil efforts to implement an \nextensive array of operations and programs to provide stability and \nrestore favorable economic and political conditions in that war-torn \nregion.\n  As the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, General Ellis \noversaw multi-year, multi-billion dollar programs supporting United \nStates Army budget strategic objectives, and executed annual operating \nbudgets of more than $15 billion across 16 major subordinate \norganizations. He directed the development of comprehensive strategic \nplans supporting the Army's continued success across the next three \ndecades by resourcing plans through decisive application of deliberate \nmanagement systems, strategic planning processes, environmental \nassessments, and periodic situational appraisals to ensure full \nintegration and compliance with strictly defined performance \nobjectives. He spearheaded the Army's effort to translate the senior \nleadership's Strategic Vision into an executable Transformation \nCampaign Plan.\n  Soon after the United States went to war in 2001, General Ellis \nassumed command of U.S. Army Forces Command, the Army's largest major \ncommand. He aggressively orchestrated the training, mobilization, and \ndeployment of more than 500,000 Soldiers and more than a million tons \nof equipment to locations worldwide which represents the largest \nmobilization since the Korean War. In addition to providing resources \nand directing long-range planning to move Army forces, he maintained \nclose operational control of ongoing events to ensure his subordinate \nunits could respond to emerging trends and circumstances. The strategic \ncommunications plan he instigated to engage disparate and complex \naudiences to include academia, Congress, local public officials, \nindustry, and members of the Department of Defense, ensured that his \ncommands' operations were understood and supported.\n  General Ellis holds degrees from Morgan State University, B.S., 1969, \nand Indiana University, M.S., 1975. His honors include the NAACP \nNational Service Award, 1999; Honorary Doctor of Law, Morgan State \nUniversity, 2000; Honorary Master of Strategic Studies, U.S. Army War \nCollege, 2001; Distinguished Alumni Service Award, Indiana University, \n2003. His military awards include the Defense Distinguished Service \nMedal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, and the Combat Infantryman \nBadge.\n  His three and a half decades of service earned for General Ellis a \nreputation as one of the Department of Defense's most forward thinking \nand insightful leaders. General Ellis represents the epitome of what \nArmy leaders, Soldiers, and the country expect\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nfrom our officers. He is a sterling example for young Soldiers to \nemulate . . . well known as a ``Soldiers' General.'' His service to the \nNation has been exceptional, and General Ellis is more than deserving \nof this recognition.\n  General Ellis will be sorely missed by those who have had the \nopportunity to serve with him over these many years. I join with his \nfriends and family as he celebrates this richly deserved upcoming \nretirement and wish him my best as he enjoys everyday of this new \njourney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4685-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TOUR DE GEORGIA IS A TOUR DE FORCE\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this week Georgians will line \nthe roads to witness the top-ranked bicycle stage race in North \nAmerica.\n  The Dodge Tour de Georgia promotes tourism, stimulates local \nindustry, and is proud to benefit the Georgia Cancer Coalition. The \nrace serves as a rolling festival to entertain and educate spectators \nacross the Peach State about cycling, fitness, and most importantly \nabout the possibility for a cure for and the prevention of cancer. This \nsecond annual event, April 20 to 25, 2004, takes pro cyclists and \nmultitudes of visitors on a scenic 653-mile journey through the great \nState of Georgia.\n  Athletes from over 23 countries will compete for $100,000 in cash and \nprizes. With a mix of road races, an individual time trial, and \nchallenging terrain, the 2004 Dodge Tour de Georgia will be an exciting \nevent for both racers and spectators.\n  A great deal of attention will be on cycling this year, since many \nelite athletes vie to represent their countries in the Olympic games in \nroad, time trial or track disciplines of cycling in August. And, five-\ntime Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong seeks his record sixth \nconsecutive win on the Champs-Elysees in July. Part of the reason for a \nsignificant increase in media and spectator interest in the Dodge Tour \nde Georgia this year is because Armstrong will compete in the event \nwith his United States Postal Service Pro Cycling Team. It will be the \nonly stage race Armstrong is expected to enter in North America, and \nthe only event in the U.S. for him prior to his record attempt in \nFrance.\n  Officials with the Dodge Tour de Georgia project a $20 to $30 million \nboost to the Georgia economy. The promotional and media value provided \nto its charitable beneficiary, the Georgia Cancer Coalition, is \nexpected to surpass $2.5 million, doubling the number from 2003. The \n2004 Dodge Tour de Georgia, the country's premier, professional cycling \nstage race, will visit 60 of Georgia's 159 counties in 6 days, from \nTuesday, April 20 to Sunday, April 25.\n  As a world-class sporting event, the Dodge Tour de Georgia is defined \nin part by the 120 elite, professional cyclists who will compete in \nseven stage races, traversing 653 miles across Georgia. As a vehicle to \npromote tourism and stimulate economic growth, the race is defined by \nthe thousands of visitors and volunteers who plan to visit from across \nGeorgia, the U.S. and abroad. Over 750,000 spectators are expected for \nthe week.\n  From just the impact of media, officials, teams, and support \npersonnel, not including spectators, local communities will see an \nimmediate impact from 3,000 room nights and over 7,000 meals.\n  I commend the sponsors, organizers, and staff of the Dodge Tour de \nGeorgia, for bringing a world-class event of this magnitude to the \npeople of the United States. I also commend the Union Cycliste \nInternationale, for sanctioning this event.\n  I would like this body to recognize the host communities, Alpharetta, \nAthens, Carrollton, Columbus, Dalton, Dahlonega, Dawsonville, \nHiawassee/Young Harris, Macon, Rome, and Thomaston; as well as their \nlocal organizing committees for their contribution to this worthy \ncause.\n  Cancer is a brutal killer that strikes without regard to age, race, \nsex, or station in life. I am grateful that there are organizations \nsuch as the Georgia Cancer Coalition, which are dedicated to its \neradication, and there is support from organizations such as Dodge; GE \nEnergy; The Georgia Department of Industry, Trade, and Tourism; Georgia \nPower; Southern LINC; and the many others who have bonded together to \norganize and promote Georgia's Race to Cure Cancer.\n  This event is not only about the 11 communities hosting this event, \nit is not only about Georgia. It is about bringing the finest cyclists \nin the world to compete in our Nation. It is about raising awareness to \nfight a terrible killer so that all of the world may benefit. I am \nproud that this event will be held in my home State of Georgia and ask \nthat this body commend the Dodge Tour de Georgia for its fine \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4685-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4685-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4685-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4181.

A bill to provide higher education assistance for \nnontraditional students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will address a growing trend in higher education--the changing \nface of today's college student.\n  Over the last decade, there has been a steady increase in the number \nof non-traditional students entering or returning to college. \nNationwide, non-traditional students on college campuses are slowly \nbecoming the norm--the percentage of non-traditional students on \ncollege campuses has increased to 47 percent in 2001 from 34 percent in \n1991.\n  Non-traditional students come in many different forms. Some waited to \ngo to college until their mid to late twenties or later--or were put in \nthe position of having to go back to college late in life because they \nlost their job. Others are attending college part-time while they work \nfull-time and/or are financially independent. Others have children, and \nmay or may not have the support of a spouse. And still others never \nobtained a high school diploma.\n  As you can imagine, these students face unique challenges that make \nit more difficult for them to graduate than their traditional peers. \nThese challenges include affording their education, balancing work, \nschool, and family responsibilities, and sometimes overcoming \ninadequate preparation.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n  Unfortunately, many of our current higher education policies make it \nharder, not easier, for non-traditional students to complete their \ndegrees. That is why today I am pleased to be introducing, along with \nmy colleague from the state of Florida, Senator Graham, The Non-\nTraditional Students Success Act.\n  This legislation is a comprehensive solution to the barriers non-\ntraditional students face as they try to earn a college degree. It is \ntimely, and our system is long overdue for improvement.\n  When I travel throughout New York, I hear about the challenges faced \nby many of our citizens, particularly those who have found themselves \nunemployed after years of working in companies like Kodak, Xerox, \nCorning, and IBM. Many of these citizens are in need of retraining--\nsome are returning to school, while others are attending college for \nthe first time.\n  The goal of this legislation is to increase graduation rates for non-\ntraditional students by addressing the range of barriers they face--\nfinancial, academic, and social.\n  First, I will begin with the financial; this legislation includes \nseveral provisions to make it more affordable for non-traditional \nstudents to complete their postsecondary education.\n  It increases the maximum Pell Grant to $11,600 by 2010. Pell Grants \nwork and there is no reason why we should not continue to invest in \nthis worthwhile solution.\n  This bill also increases the income protection allowance so that \nworking students can keep more of their income. Our bill sets the level \nat $18,000 per year as opposed to only $5,000 per year--which is \ncurrent law for single independent students.\n  It increases the amount of education expenses that students can claim \nunder the Lifetime Learning credit from 20 percent to 50 percent. Under \ncurrent law, students receive a credit of only $300 for education \nexpenses towards the Lifetime Learning credit. Under this proposal, \nthey could claim $750--money that would go a long way towards \noffsetting the cost of higher education today.\n  I am also proposing an information campaign so that students will \nknow more about the financial aid available to them. Research shows \nthat one of the most significant challenges to making ``lifelong \nlearning'' a reality is to overcome the perception held by many non-\ntraditional students, especially first-generation and adults with few \nwork skills, that they are not ``student material.''\n  A direct mailing campaign combined with outreach to employers about \nthe financial resources available to non-traditional students could \nsignificantly boost attendance and retention of non-traditional \nstudents.\n  Secondly, The Non-Traditional Students Success Act addresses the \ndaily challenges of balancing work, family and school by creating a \npilot program to provide financial aid to students who are attending \nschool less than half-time while maintaining a full-time work schedule.\n  This provision will provide resources to schools that create class \nschedules that accommodate the realities of non-traditional students' \nlives--classes that are taught in short, compressed modules, on \nweekends, in the evenings, and over the Internet.\n  This bill also creates a pilot program that will make Pell Grants \navailable year round so students are not forced to discontinue their \nstudies for the three-month summer period. These students want to \ncomplete their studies as soon as possible, and the three-month delay \nonly impedes their progress.\n  We are also putting forward ideas to put reliable childcare within \nthe reach of students who have children. During my husband's \nadministration we created CCAMPIS--a program to provide quality \nchildcare on college campuses. This is an excellent program that \ndeserves to be expanded. It has never received more than $25 million in \nfunding, even though the need for reliable childcare on campuses is \noverwhelming.\n  The Non-Traditional Student Support Act will expand the CCAMPIS \nprogram and provide a supplemental grant to low-income parents \nattending school.\n  This legislation also increases funding to TRIO and Gear-Up. These \nprograms have been successful in helping many non-traditional students \nachieve the goal of a college degree, and we must continue to support \nand expand these programs.\n  We have also included language that requires these programs to give \nspecial attention to first-year students, as research shows completion \nof the first year is a key indicator of retention through graduation.\n  I am very pleased with this legislation; it shows that we are moving \nin the right direction, tweaking our higher education policies to \nbetter serve our changing student population. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to incorporate these provisions into the \nreauthorization of the higher education act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the face of the American \nundergraduate is changing, and there is a growing need to reflect this \ntransformation in our Federal education policy. In 2001, 47 percent of \nall undergraduates were considered non-traditional students. Despite \nthis evolving landscape of higher education, many of our Nation's \nfinancial aid policies and student support services only address the \nfinancial needs and lifestyle demands of traditional students.\n  Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates come straight from high \nschool, depend on parental financial support, and enroll as full-time \nstudents. Today's colleges and universities are filled with an \nunprecedented amount of non-traditional students. These students have a \nvariety of responsibilities beyond their education that demand their \ntime, attention, and income.\n  Older scholars are in the unenviable position of having to balance \nschool, work, family responsibilities, and the obligation of meeting \nthe cost of higher education. Recent studies suggest that 39 percent of \nall undergraduates are 25 years or older and 27 percent have children. \nFurther, 40 percent of undergraduates work full-time and 48 percent \nattend college part-time.\n  Unfortunately, the needs of many devoted parents and hard working \nemployees who attend college are not adequately supported by federal \npolicy. For this reason, it is no surprise that non-traditional \nstudents are less likely than traditional students to complete a \nbachelors or associates degree.\n  The consequences of our higher education policy failing to address \nthe challenges faced by non-traditional students are great. In the \nglobal economy of the 21st century, a quality, accessible education \nremains the gatekeeper to achieving the American dream of economic \nself-sufficiency and meaningful employment.\n  Indeed, never before has a college degree been so vital to so many. \nToday's marketplace demands a well-educated work force. According to \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, postsecondary education will be \nessential for 42 percent of the new jobs created in this decade. Higher \neducation is not only the ticket to a good paying job, it is also an \navenue to improved health care, child-care, housing, and nutrition.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Clinton in introducing the Non-\nTraditional Student Success Act, legislation designed to address the \nbarriers that non-traditional students encounter while pursuing a \ncollege education.\n  Escalating college costs are a central obstacle to all students, but \ncan be especially devastating to non-traditional students who often \nhave families to care for. Responding to the rising cost of obtaining a \ncollege degree and the declining purchasing power of federal financial \nassistance, this legislation will help ensure that college is \naffordable and accessible to non-traditional students.\n  With this goal in mind, our bill will increase the maximum Pell Grant \nto $11,600 over the next five years and pilot a program that would make \nthis aid available year-round. This provision will ease the financial \nburden non-traditional students endure and help them complete their \ndegree programs more quickly.\n  Our legislation also addresses a problem many non-traditional \nstudents experience, not being able to qualify for a sufficient amount \nof financial aid due to their less-than-full-time enrollment status. We \npropose establishing a pilot program to provide more financial aid to \nstudents enrolled in a degree program less-than-half-time, students\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nwith compressed or alternative schedules, and/or students in distance \nlearning. It is imperative that our financial aid system no longer \nexists at odds with the needs and course loads of non-traditional \nstudents. This measure takes a critical first step towards correcting \nthis situation.\n  Our bill also expands the list of education expenses for the Lifetime \nLearning tax credit to include not just the costs of tuition and fees \nbut also books, supplies and equipment, childcare and living expenses. \nNon-traditional students often have more expenses than tuition and fees \nthat must be considered if a college degree is going to be financially \npossible.\n  A common sense way of making higher education more accessible is to \nincrease the public's awareness of available financial aid, including \neducation tax credits. In 2001, only 21 percent of respondents in a \nnational survey had heard of the education tax credits. Our bill will \npromote what financial aid programs are available.\n  It is not enough that we improve the affordability of college for \nnon-traditional students without improving student support services \nthat promote retention and academic success among these students. This \nlegislation increases funding for on-campus child-care to help \nnontraditional students with children. Additionally, we propose an \nincrease in funding for Student Support Service programs, GEAR UP and \nCollege Assistance Migrant Programs. These programs provide counseling, \nmentoring, tutoring and other services to help non-traditional students \nsucceed.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Non-Traditional Student \nSuccess Act. This legislation contains a variety of common sense \nprovisions that make college more affordable and success more probable \nfor non-traditional students. By supporting the Non-Traditional Student \nSuccess Act, you help bring the American dream within reach for a large \nsegment of our Nation's undergraduate population.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 2361. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance \nresearch, training, and health information dissemination with respect \nto urologic diseases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Training and \nResearch in Urology Act--or the TRU Act. During my career in the U.S. \nSenate, I have supported the successful effort to double NIH research \nfunding and have provided a strong voice for our children. This bill \ncomplements my past and continued efforts. It helps provide urologic \nscientists with the tools they need to find new cures for the many \ndebilitating urologic diseases impacting men, women, and children. This \nlegislation is important to my home State of Ohio and would impact \npositively many families in Ohio and nationwide who are afflicted with \nurologic diseases.\n  Ohio is a leader in urologic research. Researchers at the Children's \nHospital of Cincinnati, the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve, and \nOhio State University have made great strides toward achieving \ntreatments. The fact is that urologic conditions affect millions of \nchildren and adults. Urology is a physiological system distinct from \nother body systems. Urologic conditions include incontinence, \ninfertility, and impotence--all of which are extremely common, yet \nserious and debilitating. As many as 10 million children--more than \n30,000 in Ohio--are affected by urinary tract problems, and some forms \nof these problems can be deadly. At least half of all diabetics have \nbladder dysfunctions, which can include urinary retention, changes in \nbladder compliance, and incontinence. Interstitial Cystitis (IC), a \npainful bladder syndrome, affects 200,000 people, mostly women. There \nare no known causes or cures, and few minimally effective treatments. \nAdditionally, there are 7 million urinary tract infections in the U.S. \neach year.\n  Incontenence costs the healthcare system $25 billion each year and is \na leading reason people are forced to enter nursing homes, impacting \nMedicare and Medicaid costs. Urinary tract infection treatment costs \ntotal more than $1 billion each year. Many urologic diseases, \nincontinence, erectile dysfunction, and cancer, increase in aging \npopulations. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, \nand African-American men are at a greater risk for the disease. \nMedicare beneficiaries suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), \nwhich results in bladder dysfunction and urinary frequency. Fifty \npercent of men at age 60 have BPH. Treatment and surgery cost $2 \nbillion per year.\n  Research for urologic disorders has failed to keep pace. Further \ndelay translates into increased costs--in dollars, in needless \nsuffering, and in the loss of human dignity. Incontinence costs the \nhealthcare system $23 billion each year, yet only 90 cents per patient \nis spent on research--little more than the cost of a single adult \nundergarment. In 2002, only $5 million of the $88 million in new \ninitiatives from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \nKidney Diseases (NIDDK) was designated to urologic diseases and \nconditions. Of that $5 million, no new initiatives were announced for \nwomen's urologic health problems. In 2001, we spent less than five \ncents per child on research into pediatric urologic problems. The \nmedications currently used are very expensive and have unknown, long-\nterm side effects.\n\n  The TRU Act establishes a Division of Urology at the NIDDK--the home \nof the urology basic science program--and expands existing research \nmechanisms, like the successful George O'Brien Urology Research \nCenters. This will give NIH new opportunities for investment in efforts \nto combat and vanquish these diseases.\n  This legislation is necessary to elevate leadership in urology \nresearch at the NIDDK. When the Institute was created in its current \nform nearly 20 years ago, Congress specifically provided for three \nseparate Division Directors. Regrettably, the current statute fails to \nprovide the NIDDK with the flexibility to create additional Division \nDirectors when necessary to better respond to current scientific \nopportunities. This prescriptive statutory language is unique to the \nNIDDK. For example, the National Cancer Institute and the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute do not have any statutory language \nregarding Division Directors.\n  The basic science breakthroughs of the last decade are literally \npassing urology by. A greater focus on urological diseases is needed at \nthe NIDDK and will be best accomplished with senior leadership with \nexpertise in urology as provided in the TRU Act. This legislation is \nsupported by the Coalition for Urologic Research & Education (CURE)--a \ngroup representing tens of thousands of patients, researchers and \nhealthcare providers. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of \nthe TRU Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise and extend the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nreauthorization of the Boys and Girls Club of America, legislation that \nSenator Leahy and I introduced today. Congress first granted the Boys \nand Girls Club of America a charter in 1991, but the Club existed for \nover 90 years before that. There are currently 3,500 Clubs across \nAmerica and around the world on our military bases serving over 3.6 \nmillion children, ages 6-18.\n  Over 70 percent of those children who benefit from the Boys and Girls \nClub of America live in America's inner cities. Almost half of the Club \nmembers come from single parent homes. The Club offers young people a \npositive alternative to roaming the streets as well as a positive adult \ninfluence. These children are able to find a safe place to learn and \ngrow in the Boys and Girls Clubs. Most importantly, the Clubs offer \nhope and opportunity to millions of young people who would otherwise \nface disadvantaged circumstances.\n  This reauthorization will allow the Boys and Girls Club of America to \nexpand their clubs even more. The bill authorizes the Club to receive \nfunds through 2010 and increases the number of clubs in existence. By \n2010, there will be 5,000 Clubs nationwide serving over 5 million young \npeople.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this small but important \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today as a long-time supporter of \nthe Boys & Girls Clubs of America to join Senators Hatch, DeWine, Kohl, \nand Biden in introducing this legislation, S. 2363, to revise and \nextend the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n  Senator Hatch has been one of the best friends and supporters Boys \nand Girls Clubs could ever have and I have been privileged to work with \nhim on issues that matter to the Boys & Girls Clubs. Too often the \npublic sees Republicans and Democrats disagreeing. From time to time, \neven Senator Hatch and I disagree on important issues. But when it \ncomes to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America there is no doubt that we \nsee eye-to-eye: Today we\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nintroduce this bill to show the unified support of Republicans and \nDemocrats for Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide.\n  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility \nto make sure they are safe and secure. I know firthand how well Boys & \nGirls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a \nprosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys & \nGirls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of \nprograms. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was \nsuch a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys & Girls Club in his \ndistrict rather than helping him get a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys and Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime \nand supporting our children. The first Club was established in \nBurlington 62 years ago. Now we have 22 club sites operating throughout \nthe State: seven clubs in Brattleboro, one in Springfield, two clubs in \nBurlington, one in Winooski, two clubs in Montpelier, five clubs in \nRandolph, one club in Rutland, two clubs in Vergennes and one in \nBristol. There are 10 additional project sites that will be on board \nand serving kids by the end of 2005: one in Bennington, two in \nBurlington, one in Duxbury, one in St. Johnsbury, one in Hardwick, \nthree in Randolph and one in Ludlow. These clubs will serve well over \n10,000 kids statewide.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys and Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased Federal support for Boys and Girls Clubs from \n$20 million to $80 million in this year. Due in large part to this \nincrease in funding, there now exist 3,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 \nStates serving more than 3.6 million young people. Because of these \nsuccesses, I was both surprised and disappointed to see that the \nPresident requested a reduction of $20 million for fiscal year 2005. \nThat request will leave thousands of children and their Clubs behind \nand we cannot allow such a thing to happen.\n  In the 107th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass \nthe 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct, which included a provision to reauthorize Justice Department \ngrants to establish new Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide. By authorizing \n$80 million in Justice grants for each of the fiscal years through \n2005, we sought to establish 1,200 additional Boys and Girls Clubs \nnationwide. This was to bring the number of Boys and Girls Clubs to \n4,000, serving no less than 5 million young people. The bill we \nintroduce today will build upon this: We authorize Justice Department \ngrants at $80 million for fiscal year 2006, $85 million for fiscal year \n2007, $90 million for fiscal year 2008, $95 million for fiscal year \n2009, and $100 million for fiscal year 2010 to Boys and Girls Clubs to \nhelp establish 1,500 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across the nation \nwith the goal of having 5,000 Boys and Girls Clubs in operation by \nDecember 31, 2010.\n  If we have a Boys & Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in our \ncountry would have a lot less work to do because of the values that are \nbeing instilled in children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \nEach time I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, \neducators, teachers, grandparents, and law enforcement officers who \ntell me ``Keep doing this! These clubs give our children the chance to \ngrow up free of drugs, gangs, and crime.''\n  You cannot argue that these are just Democratic or Republican ideas, \nor Conservative or Liberal ideals--they are simply good sense ideas. We \nneed safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can learn \nand grow up free from the influence of drugs, gangs, and crime. That is \nwhy Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to expand Federal support \nfor the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. We all know instinctively that \nour country's strength and ultimate success lies with our children. Our \ngreatest responsibility is to help them inhabit this century the best \nway possible and we can help do that by supporting the Boys & Girls \nClubs of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2364. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to grant a \nFederal charter to the Irish American Cultural Institute; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am proud to be introducing a \nbill, along with Senator Collins and Senator Lautenberg, to grant a \nFederal Charter to the Irish American Cultural Institute, an \norganization that promotes appreciation and recognition of the \nimportant contributions Irish-Americans have played throughout the \nhistory of the United States. A longstanding goal of the Irish American \nCultural Institute has been to establish a museum of Irish American \nhistory and culture in Washington, DC, and I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that could represent a positive step towards achieving that \ngoal.\n  The Irish American Cultural Institute is a national organization \nfounded in 1962, with local chapters in 17 States. The Institute has \nspent the last 40 years fighting to promote, preserve and interpret \nIrish and Irish-American culture. Those involved with the Institute do \nthis, in part, by fostering strong cultural and educational ties \nbetween the United States and Ireland: sending American high school \nstudents to Ireland, and bringing Irish scholars, musicians, craftsmen, \nactors, and artists to the Untied States. They also fund academic \nresearch projects that provide insights into Irish-American history, \nand provide fellowships for American professors to spend a year as a \nvisiting scholar at the National University of Ireland. In short, the \nIrish American Cultural Institute serves as an important educational, \ninformational, and financial resource for key initiatives important to \nthe Irish and the Irish-American community in the United States.\n  Irish-Americans comprise more than 17 percent of the population of \nthe United States, and have made enormous contributions to our Nation \nin countless ways. A Federal charter will help the Irish American \nCultural Institute continue and expand activities that recognize and \ncelebrate the heritage of Irish-Americans. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been seven long years since \nCongress last acted to raise the minimum wage. The cost of living keeps \ngoing up, and these workers keep falling farther and farther behind, \nbecause the minimum wage they're paid buys less and less.\n  The current minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. You can't work hard, raise \na family, and pay for food and rent and clothing, on $5.15 an hour--\n$10,700 a year--$5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. \nThe minimum wage is too low.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2004, which I introduce today, will \nraise the minimum wage by $1.85 to $7.00 an hour. The raise to $7.00 \nwould be carried out in three moderate steps in just over two years. \nMore than 7 million workers would directly benefit from this minimum \nwage increases.\n  Let me be clear about who we're talking about here--the janitors who \nclean our great buildings late into the night; the school aides who \nsupport our kids and their teachers; home healthcare workers caring for \nour elderly parents in their home; the children whose parents can't \nafford to give them more than a single slim meal a day.\n  There is one thing that stands in the way of a decent minimum wage--\none thing--and that's the Republican Party.\n  If this President and the Republican Party really cared about working \nAmericans--about minimum wage workers--why would they oppose a decent \nwage for a hard day's work? But for seven long years, they have blocked \nevery effort in this Congress to raise the minimum wage.\n  Why would they oppose unemployment benefits for the 8 million out-of-\nwork Americans? Why would they oppose overtime pay if you have to work \nmore than 40 hours a week? Why would they support shipping your jobs \noverseas?\n  A fair increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. We should all be \nable to agree on the principle that no one who works for a living \nshould have to live in poverty. How can Congress keep saying no, when \nmore and more workers can't make ends meet? I plan to be back on the \nSenate floor offering this bill as an amendment over and over again \nuntil Congress agrees to give low-wage workers the raise they have \nearned.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Harkin, Ms. Milkulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2371. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to expand coverage under the Act, to increase protections for \nwhistleblowers, to increase penalties for certain violators, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nProtecting America's Workers Act.\n  This week, on Workers' Memorial Day, we remember and honor those who \nhave died or been injured on the job in the past year. We remember and \nhonor their families. And we pledge to do more to end the unsafe and \nunhealthy conditions that still plague so many workplaces across \nAmerica.\n  We have made significant progress in protecting worker safety since \n1970, when we passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act. But there \nis still a tremendous amount to be done. Every year, over five thousand \nworkers are killed and nearly five million others become ill or are \ninjured on the job. That's an average of 15 deaths and 13,000 injuries \nor illnesses each and every day.\n  Too many companies are doing too little to deal with this crisis. \nThey blatantly ignore the law, but they never\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\ngo to jail--even when their actions or lack of action kill loyal \nemployees who work for them. Criminal penalties are so low that \nprosecutors don't pursue these cases. Employers who violate safety laws \nagain and again pay only minimal fines--which they treat as just \nanother cost of doing business.\n  We cannot let these shameful practices continue. We cannot allow \nemployers to put millions of workers at risk in our factories, nursing \nhomes, construction sites, and many other workplaces every day.\n  We need to hold this Administration accountable--require them to act, \ninstead of sweeping serious violations under the rug. We also need to \nprotect workers with the courage to speak out against health and safety \nviolations in the workplace.\n  That is why we are today introducing the Protecting America's Workers \nAct.\n  It will protect millions of workers not covered by current safety \nlaws. By extending the Occupational Safety and Health Act, we will \ncover 8 million public employees and millions of transportation and \nother workers.\n  The bill imposes jail time--up to ten years, instead of only six \nmonths under current law--on those whose blatant violation of safety \nlaws leads to a worker's death. We also increase civil penalties, to \nprovide additional deterrence for employers.\n  We require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to \ninvestigate more cases, and we give workers and their families more \nrights in the investigation process.\n  We provide stronger protections for workers who report health or \nsafety violations.\n  I know it will be an uphill battle to get this legislation through \nthis Republican Congress. But I'm committed to the fight. I'm committed \nto fighting for people like Jeff Walters, whose son Patrick was killed \nwhen a trench collapsed on him two years ago. His employer was known to \nbe violating critical safety rules. We will fight for people like Ron \nHayes, whose son Patrick suffocated in a grain elevator. Ron is now \nhelping families throughout the United States deal with the grief of \nhaving a family member killed at work.\n  We intend to do everything we can to keep other working families from \nthat grief. These deaths and injuries aren't accidents they're crimes, \nand it's time we started treating them like crimes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this fight for a safe workplace for \nall of America's workers. We can take a major step forward by the \nProtecting America's Workers Act.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Protecting America's Workers Act introduced by Senator Kennedy. \nI am proud to join him as a cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  Yesterday, this country recognized Worker Memorial Day. Created in \n1989 to remember workers who have been killed or injured in the \nworkplace over the past year, Worker Memorial Day has been designated \nApril 28 as a tribute to the anniversary of the enactment of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act. In my view, there is no better \ntribute to the lives that have been lost than to think about how we can \nprevent future losses of this kind.\n  The facts tell a grim story: an eight-month examination of workplace \ndeaths by The New York Times found that, over a span of two decades, \nfrom 1982 to 2002, OSHA investigated 1,242 horrific instances in which \nthe agency itself concluded that workers had died because of their \nemployer's ``willful'' safety violations. Yet in 93 percent of those \ncases, OSHA declined to seek prosecution.\n  Employees have a fundamental right to a safe work environment, and \nmore needs to be done to ensure that businesses that deliberately put \nthe lives of their workers at risk are held accountable for their \nactions. This legislation would go a long way to strengthen our \nworkplace safety system in a variety of ways.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes provisions \nto shore up a fundamental weakness in American workplace safety law: \nthe shockingly inadequate penalties associated with crimes under the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act. This legislation includes the \nprovisions of the Workplace Wrongful Death Accountability Act, S. 1272, \nlegislation that I introduced to increase the maximum criminal penalty \nfor those who willfully violate workplace safety laws and cause the \ndeath of an employee.\n  It is unbelievable to me that, under existing law, that crime is a \nmisdemeanor, and carries a maximum prison sentence of just 6 months. \nThese provisions would increase the penalty for this most egregious \nworkplace crime to 10 years, making it a felony. They also increase the \npenalty associated with lying to an OSHA inspector from 6 months to 1 \nyear, and increase the penalty for illegally giving advance warning of \nan upcoming inspection from 6 months to 2 years.\n  In recent times, Congress has focused on a shocking succession of \ncorporate scandals: Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, to name a few. These \nrevelations of corporate abuse raised the ire and indignation of the \nAmerican people. But corporate abuses can sometimes go further than \nsquandering employee pension funds and costing shareholder value. \nSometimes, corporate abuses can cost lives.\n  The provisions are based on the simple premise that going to work \nshould not carry a death sentence. Annually, more than 6,000 Americans \nare killed on the job, and some 50,000 more die from work-related \nillnesses. Many of those deaths are completely preventable.\n  While many factors contribute to the unsafe working environment that \nexists at certain jobsites, one easily remedied factor is an \nineffective regime of criminal penalties. The criminal statutes \nassociated with OSHA have been on the books since the 1970s, but, over \ntime, the deterrence value of these important workplace safety laws has \neroded substantially. With the maximum jail sentence of 6 months, \nFederal prosecutors have only a minimal incentive to spend time and \nresources prosecuting renegade employers. According to a recent \nanalysis, since the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted, \nonly 11 employers who caused the death of a worker on the job were \nincarcerated.\n  The logic behind increasing criminal penalties in these cases is \nsimple. It will increase the incentive for prosecutors to hold renegade \nemployers accountable for endangering the lives of their workers and, \nthereby, help ensure that OSHA criminal penalties cannot be safely \nignored. This will provide the OSHA criminal statute with sufficient \nteeth to deter the small percentage of bad actors who knowingly and \nwillfully place their employees at risk.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this landmark \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 2372. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 regarding identifying \ntrade expansion priorities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise along with several of my \ncolleagues, the esteemed Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and my colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Lautengerg, to introduce legislation that will \nstrengthen trade enforcement efforts, open foreign markets to U.S. \nexports, reduce the trade deficit, create export-based jobs, and \nprovide a lift to America's economy.\n  This legislation would restore the so-called ``Super 301'' process, a \ntool that has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to \nexpand access for U.S. exporters to foreign markets. Super 301 requires \nthe Office of the United States Trade Representative to negotiate with \nforeign countries that have established burdensome trade barriers in \norder to open those markets to U.S. exports. The legislation also \nrequires the USTR to identify, and eliminate, the illegal protectionist \ntrade barriers that most adversely effect American businesses and \nworkers.\n  With more than 8 million Americans out of a job, we need to take \nstrong action not only to get people back to work, but to get them into \nwell-paying jobs. Unfortunately, in recent years, even when unemployed \nAmericans have found new jobs, too often they've been forced to take a \npay cut. That's one reason why so many middle class families are \nfeeling the squeeze, and are having such a hard time making ends meet.\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n  One of the areas hardest hit by job loss under this administration is \nthe manufacturing industry. 2.9 million manufacturing jobs have been \nlost. In many ways, we are witnessing the slow decimation of the U.S. \nmanufacturing industry. And the Bush administration has done little \nabout it.\n  One way to deal with the decline in manufacturing--and the problems \nin our economy, more generally--is to do a better job of enforcing our \ntrade agreements. U.S. businesses generally are the best, most \ncompetitive in the world. But, too often, they're not playing on a \nlevel playing field. Instead, they're being forced to contend with a \nwide variety of trade barriers that make it difficult or impossible for \nAmerican businesses to compete. The end result is lost opportunities, \nlost jobs, and lost income for American workers.\n  Let's be clear. Trade is a good thing for America. And as a global \nleader we must be engaged in the global economy. Trade doesn't just \nhelp grow our own economy. It helps build the world economy, which, in \nturn, promotes democracy and greater security for everybody. I'm not \narguing for building walls around the United States. To the contrary, I \nwant to tear down protectionist walls that keep U.S. businesses out, \nand that destroy jobs here in our own country.\n  The Bush administration likes to advocate for free trade agreements. \nBut it's not enough to sign a trade agreement and trust our trade \npartners to honor their end of the deal. Those deals need to be \ncomplied with. And if they're not, we need to be aggressive in ensuring \ncompliance.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to enforcing trade agreements, the Bush \nadministration, as Senator Kerry said recently, has been ``asleep at \nthe wheel.'' And there's no excuse for it.\n  After all, we face a trade deficit of nearly $500 billion, and a \ndeteriorating fiscal situation that has led to increasing reliance on \nforeign creditors. Under the circumstances, you would have thought that \nthe administration would be doing all it could to address these \nproblems. But it's not.\n  There's a stark difference between the commitment of this \nadministration to enforce trade compared to that of the Clinton \nadministration. Between 1995 and 2000, the Clinton administration filed \nan average of 11 cases a year with the World Trade Organization to \nbattle foreign protectionism. By contrast, the Bush administration has \nfiled only 3 per year.\n  The White House also has repeatedly refused to respond when the \nbipartisan International Trade Commission has recommended remedies for \nU.S. businesses facing floods of imports from China--even when the ITC \nrulings have been unanimous. The President's determination to overrule \nthe ITC has had a dramatic impact on many small businesses, including \nsome in my State of New Jersey.\n  The administration also continues to sit idly by while China, and \nother Asian countries, manipulate their currency, to the detriment of \nU.S. exporters.\n  The administration's refusal to enforce our trade agreements, and the \npassive approach they have taken to problems like Asian currency \nmanipulation, helps explain why we're now facing such massive trade \ndeficits. In fact, the Bush administration is the first since the \nHoover administration to preside over a decline in real exports.\n  Again, what we need is a commitment to let U.S. businesses compete on \na level playing field. That is why we need to reestablish the Super 301 \nprocess.\n  Super 301 may sound like a technical legal mechanism. But it would \nhelp open up new markets, boost our economy, strengthen our export-\nbased manufacturing sector, help reduce our trade deficit, and create \nnew, well-paying domestic export-based jobs here in America.\n  Under the legislation, the USTR would, within 30 days of the release \nof the National Trade Estimate, submit a Super 301 report to Congress, \nlisting the foreign trade barriers that most adversely affect U.S. \nexports.\n  Within 21 days of submitting the report, the USTR would be required \nto seek consultations with each trading partner identified in the \nreport in order to resolve the issue. If consultations do not succeed \nin eliminating the trade barriers within 90 days, USTR would be \nrequired to take action that could lead to sanctions either by the U.S. \nor, ultimately, by the WTO.\n  As I said earlier, Super 301 is not new. It was signed into law by \nPresident Reagan, and renewed throughout the '90s by President Clinton. \nIt was a tool that worked. The threat alone of being on the Super 301 \nlist has, and will, force countries who have erected barriers to U.S. \nexports come to the table.\n  Some will argue that this is protectionism. Some will argue that it's \nunilateralism. In fact, it's the opposite. It's intended to protect \nU.S. businesses and workers from protectionist foreign trade barriers--\nto knock down walls, not erect them. It's intended to encourage our \ntrade representatives to engage in a constructive dialogue with those \nwho have erected barriers to U.S. products. It equips the \nadministration with a needed tool to fight for the rights of American \nworkers and businesses against those countries who are unwilling to \nremove those barriers.\n  In a word, Super 301 would make trade more fair. And when trade is \nmore fair--when U.S. companies are playing on a level playing field--\nAmericans win. American workers win. And when America's workers win, \nAmerica's economy wins.\n  It is my ardent hope that we can get this much needed bill passed, \nand I urge my colleagues to give it their support.

A bill to modify the prohibition on recognition by United \nStates courts of certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, \nor commercial names; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nseveral of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, legislation that \nwill protect U.S. trademarks and their legitimate owners from the \neffects of the confiscations decreed by the Cuban government.\n  My colleagues and I believe in the fundamental principle that \nproperty rights must be respected and that it is wrong for governments \nto take property from individuals and companies, whether nationals or \nforeigners, without payment of prompt, adequate and effective \ncompensation. We uphold the firmly established principle of our law and \npublic policy that foreign confiscatory measures must never be given \neffect on property situated in the United States.\n  When the Castro regime took power in Cuba, it engaged in a program of \nwholesale confiscation of property in Cuba, including property owned by \nCuban nationals as well as by U.S. and other non-Cuban nationals. The \nCuban government also purported to extend the effects of the \nconfiscation to property, such as trademarks, that the confiscation \nvictims owned in other countries, and took other actions in an attempt \nto seize control of such assets.\n  To protect U.S. trademarks and their legitimate owners from the \neffects of the confiscations decreed by the Cuban government, Congress \nenacted Section 211 of H.R. 4328 (PL 105-277) in 1998. This law, \nreferred to as Section 211, prohibits enforcement of U.S. rights to \ntrademarks confiscated by the Cuban government, except with the consent \nof the legitimate owner. Section 211 simply made it clear that the \nuniversal U.S. policy against giving effect to foreign confiscations of \nU.S. property applies with equal force in the case of U.S. trademarks \nconfiscated by Cuba.\n  Section 211 was challenged in the World Trade Organization (WTO) by \nthe European Union (EU). In January 2002, the WTO Appellate Body \nfinally resolved that challenge by finding in favor of the United \nStates on all points except one. The Appellate Body made a narrow \nfinding that, because Section 211 on its face does not apply to U.S. \nnationals, it is inconsistent with the national-treatment and most-\nfavored-nation principles under the TRIPs Agreement. The Appellate Body \nfully supported the principle embodied in Section 211, that is, the \nnon-recognition of uncompensated confiscations and the protection of \nintellectual property ownership rights. The revision required to \nbroaden the application of Section 211 to include U.S. nationals \namounts to no more than a minor, technical fix.\n  The legislation that we introduce today makes it clear this well-\nfounded law applies to all parties claiming rights in confiscated Cuban \ntrademarks, regardless of nationality. Such a technical correction will \nsatisfy the WTO ruling and prevent the EU from applying trade sanctions \nagainst the United States at the end of this year. Moreover, this \nlegislation does three things: it maintains protection for original \nowners of confiscated Cuban trademarks; it applies to all people, \nregardless of nationality; it clarifies that trademarks and trade names \nconfiscated by the Cuban Government will not be recognized in the \nUnited States when the assertion is being made by someone who knew or \nhad reason to know that the mark was confiscated.\n  This bill does not in any way decide which party owns a Cuban \ntrademark in the U.S. nor does Section 211 prevent the Cuban government \nor its various entities from having access to our courts or from \nregistering legitimate trademarks in the U.S. As long as the trademark \nwas not confiscated, the Cuban government can legally register any \ntrademark it desires. Moreover, even if the Cuban government stole a \ntrademark in the 1960s, it can still register the trademark in the U.S \nas long as the original owner has consented.\n  Once revised, Section 211 is consistent with all of our international \ntreaty obligations including the Inter-American Convention on \nTrademarks. The Inter-American Convention expressly in Article 3 allows \nnon-recognition of a trademark when such recognition would be contrary \nto the public order or public policy of the state in which recognition \nis sought. There is no doubt whatsoever that allowing title to U.S. \nproperty to be determined by a foreign confiscation violates U.S. \npublic policy. Section 211 simply makes it clear that the universal \nU.S. policy against giving effect to foreign confiscations of U.S. \nproperty applies with equal force in the case of U.S. trademarks \nconfiscated by Cuba. Nothing in any treaty or in international law is \ninconsistent with that rule of U.S. law.\n  I believe this piece of legislation is a simple technical corrections \nbill which will ensure that a fairly simple, but important, U.S. law is \nWTO-compliant.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Burns, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Allen, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Alexander, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Frist, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S.J. Res. 36. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Feinstein, \nMcCain, Leahy, Brownback, Daschle, Dole, Mikulski, Burns, Clinton, \nAllen, Edwards, Nickles, Corzine, Biden, Feingold and Santorum, am \nintroducing today a joint resolution renewing import sanctions against \nBurma. My colleagues may recall that these sanctions--along with \nseveral other restrictions against the State Peace and Development \nCouncil (SPDC) in Rangoon--were included in the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act, which was signed into law by President Bush on July 28, \n2003.\n  The act received broad support in the Senate. Sixty-one members \ncosponsored the bill which passed in record time by a vote of 97-1. Our \nquick action last year sent an unequivocal message to the SPDC that its \nambush and attack on the National League for Democracy (NLD) and \nfreedom in Burma would not go unpunished.\n  Today, we need to send the same strong message. America must continue \nto lead the world's democracies in supporting the struggle for freedom \nin Burma.\n  My colleagues will be dismayed to learn that since last year's \nhorrific SPDC-orchestrated massacre there has been no progress toward \nreconciliation and democracy in Burma. Thirteen-hundred prisoners of \nconscience continue to suffer in squalid Burmese prisons for advocating \nfreedoms that most of us take for granted--including thought, speech \nand association.\n  Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders \ncontinue to be under house arrest and surveillance by the SPDC, and the \nmajority of NLD party offices remain\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\nforcibly closed; United Nations and Thai efforts at engagement with the \njunta--through repeated visits to Rangoon and the so-called ``Bangkok \nProcess''--have predictably failed; according to the White House, Burma \n``failed demonstrably'' in counternarcotics efforts, allowing drug \ngangs to freely operate inside Burma and amphetamine-type stimulants to \nproliferate throughout the region, posing a ``major threat to national \nsecurity and public health''; and, finally, the repressive and \nabhorrent SPDC policies of murder, rape, forced labor, forced \nrelocation and child soldiers continue unabated.\n\n  Just yesterday, we learned from credible sources that 11 NLD \nsupporters arrested in the wake of last year's premeditated attack were \nsentenced by the regime from 7 to 22 years in prison. This is in \naddition to the death sentences given to a Burmese sports writer who \ncomplained about soccer related corruption and to three Burmese men for \nhaving contact with the United Nations International Labor \nOrganization.\n  Should my colleagues need a second opinion, let me quote Secretary of \nState Colin Powell in a March 10 Congressional hearing: ``I see no \nimprovement in the situation. Aung San Suu Kyi remains unable to \nparticipate in public, political life in Burma and we will not ignore \nthat.'' When I asked Secretary Powell in an April 8 Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee hearing whether he supported the continuation of sanctions \nagainst Burma, his answer was straightforward and clear: ``Yes.''\n  The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act denies Burma 13 percent of its \nexport market (according to CIA figures), visas for SPDC officials and \ntheir families, and, above all, legitimacy. In addition, $13 million \nworth of financial transactions to Burma have been blocked by the \nTreasury Department. While palpable impacts, these sanctions alone will \nnot push the SPDC in the direction of meaningful reconciliation with \nthe NLD and ethnic minorities.\n  South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu--no stranger to the struggle \nfor freedom and justice--said earlier this year: ``To dismantle \napartheid [in South Africa] took not only commitment, faith and hard \nwork, but also intense international pressure and sanctions. In Burma, \nthe regime has ravaged the country, and the people, to fund its illegal \nrule. Governments and international institutions must move past \nsymbolic gestures and cut the lifelines to Burma's military regime \nthrough well-implemented sanctions.''\n  Amerca already cut that lifeline; it is time for other democracies to \ndo the same. For freedom's sake, our allies and the European Union must \nimpose targeted sanction regimes on Burma. If they are unwilling to \ntake such action in support of the courageous and determined people of \nBurma, they should act for the sake of the security and stability of \nthe region. Burma's exports to its immediate neighbors include illicit \nnarcotics, HIV/AIDS, refugees and trafficked women and children. \nFurther, Rangoon's connections with Russia and North Korea, in \nparticular, deserve closer scrutiny by foreign capitals and the United \nNations.\n  If my colleagues haven't done so already, they should read Monday's \nWashington Post op-ed entitled ``A Need to Act on Burma'' by our \ncolleague from Arizona and former-Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright. I agree with their assertion that we should not be duped by \nSPDC window dressing in the weeks leading up to the May 17 \nconstitutional convention charade. Even if Suu Kyi is released before \nthat date it is not sufficient, as there are no guarantees for her \nsecurity, no assurances that she will be able to freely express her \nviews to the nation or to meet with ethnic leaders, and no sure bet \nthat the junta will grant visas to journalists to travel to Burma.\n  The op-ed also raises the question of repercussions for the continued \nperpetuation of the status quo in Burma by China, Thailand, India, and \nother Asian nations. I look forward to exploring with my colleagues the \nmost appropriate and effective ways that we can encourage those \ncountries to support the legitimately elected leaders of Burma. If no \nchange is in the offing, Burma's chairmanship of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations in 2006 will be a tremendous loss of face to \nthat organization and each individual member state.\n  Let me close by saying that sanctions must remain in place until \nBurma embarks on an irreversible path toward reconciliation and \ndemocracy. I intend to work closely with my colleagues--particularly \nthe chair and ranking member of the Finance Committee--to ensure that \nthe Senate acts just as decisively and expeditiously as we did last \nyear. To do anything less would be to betray Suu Kyi and all those \nstruggling for freedom and justice in Burma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in the \nRecord: A copy of the referenced Washington Post op-ed; a copy of a \nBoston Globe editorial entitled ``No Compromise on Burma'' dated March \n29, 2004; a copy of a Washington Post op-ed by the Chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee entitled ``Seeds of Trouble from \nBurma'' dated September 28, 2003; a copy of a tribute to Suu Kyi \nauthored by rock star Bono in Time Magazine's recent special edition on \nthe world's 100 most influential people; and a letter supporting the \nrenewal of import sanctions by the President and CEO of the American \nApparel and Footwear Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2003]\n\n                      Seeds of Trouble From Burma\n\n                         (By Richard G. Lugar)\n\n       The military junta that rules Burma has long been known as \n     a group committed to retaining power at cost. The price has \n     been paid mainly by Burma's citizens, but the consequences \n     may now spread well beyond Burma's borders.\n       The generals have killed thousands of democracy supporters \n     since the student protests in 1988 and waged war on ethnic \n     insurgents. To tighten their grip on the population, over the \n     past 15 years they have doubled the size of the military, \n     which now consumes 40 percent of the budget, at the expense \n     of spending on health and education.\n       Consequently, hundreds of thousands of their citizens have \n     died as a result of the broken-down health care system. The \n     generals who run the country are notorious for their \n     widespread use of forced labor, which the International Labor \n     Organization calls ``a contemporary form of slavery.''\n       The junta has maintained these abhorrent policies despite \n     sanctions, aid cutoffs and repeated denunciations by many \n     Western countries, including the United States.\n       Yet it makes the headlines only when it commits an \n     especially acute outrage, such as that of last May 30, when \n     pro-government militia crashed a political rally near \n     Mandalay and murdered several bodyguards and supporters of \n     Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the fearless democracy \n     crusader who had been freed only last year from a lengthy \n     house arrest.\n       The junta rearrested Suu Kyi, shut down offices of her \n     political party and detained her at a secret location. She \n     returned home Friday for a new stint of indefinite house \n     arrest.\n       I am pleased that the Senate reacted quickly in June to put \n     pressure on the junta by voting for a ban on all Burmese \n     imports. Until now this record of bloody repression and \n     economic ruin has primarily victimized the long-suffering \n     Burmese people, and world attention has often drifted away \n     from what some consider an internal problem. But it is time \n     to take a closer look. Burma's generals are quietly moving in \n     new directions that could make that dismal country a source \n     of instability throughout South and Southeast Asia.\n       Strategically situated between regional rivals India and \n     China, Burma is seeking to leverage the two powers' battle \n     for influence.\n       China is the regime's major arms supplier and has assumed \n     significant economic power over the country, recently \n     extending debt relief and a $200 million loan to Burma, which \n     has been cut off from most other external funding. China, \n     reports indicate, has built a port and shipyard south of \n     Rangoon to help export products from China's landlocked \n     western provinces.\n       India, concerned about China's rising dominance, has \n     stepped up its relations with Burma. Indian Prime Minister \n     Atal Bihari Vajpayee met with the Burmese foreign minister \n     earlier this year, the highest-level contact between the two \n     countries in more than a decade, and India is also reportedly \n     building a port on Burma's coast.\n       Improving ties with regional powers is not necessarily a \n     bad thing, especially if they would push Burma toward more \n     civilized behavior.\n       But neither Beijing nor New Delhi has shown any such \n     inclination. Instead the two huge neighbors are using Burma \n     as a pawn in their rivalry, making it a potential source of \n     friction, not a buffer. Japan is increasingly concerned about \n     China's penetration of Burma, and it was to counter China's \n     influence that the regional grouping of smaller\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n     countries, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n     (ASEAN), decided to admit Burma as a member several years \n     ago. These countries see now that the junta was cynically \n     using them to try to gain legitimacy.\n       More troubling is the news that Burma, one of the poorest \n     countries on earth, has contracted with Russia for a nuclear \n     reactor. Both sides insist it is for medical research \n     purposes, but even if that's true, it would add an \n     unnecessary proliferation risk to a world where terrorists \n     are on the prowl for nuclear material. Some 300 Burmese have \n     been in Russia receiving training to operate the facility, \n     and Burma has also bought 10 MiG-29 fighter jets from Russia.\n       Most disturbing of all Burma is renewing ties with North \n     Korea that were cut off after North Korean agents in 1983 set \n     off a bomb in Rangoon that killed 21 people, including four \n     visiting South Korean cabinet members. Besides possibly \n     reestablishing formal diplomatic relations, the two have held \n     high-level discussions on military cooperation.\n       The link-up of these two parish states can only spell \n     trouble. North Korea's main export is dangerous weapons \n     technology, and there have been reports that Burma is getting \n     missiles and other arms from Pyongyang.\n       These developments have been largely overlooked as we \n     concentrated on the war in Iraq, challenges in the Middle \n     East and unpredictable developments on the Korean peninsula. \n     But they are the seeds of a major threat to Asian security \n     and stability. The world should take notice, and the United \n     States needs to make Burma a priority in its relations with \n     Russia, China, India and ASEAN so that we can forge a \n     multilateral plan to turn the generals from their dangerous \n     course.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 29, 2004]\n\n                         No Compromise on Burma\n\n       The brutal criminality of the military junta ruling Burma \n     has unified disparate elements along the American political \n     spectrum. In hearings on Burma held by subcommittees of the \n     House International Relations Committee last week, a rare \n     solidarity among both Democrats and Republicans was on \n     display.\n       The current regime in Rangoon is complicit in narcotics \n     trafficking, ethnic cleansing, forced labor, gruesome abuse \n     of ethnic minorities, and the violent suppression of free \n     speech and political opposition.\n       In response to a deliberate massacre of fellow democrats \n     traveling last May with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San \n     Suu Kyi, the Bush administration last July signed into law \n     tough sanctions that ban imports from Burma. The House \n     hearings were in preparation for renewal of those sanctions.\n       Without mincing his words, Lorne Craner, the State \n     Department's assistant secretary for human rights, told the \n     lawmakers that notwithstanding hints about democratization \n     dropped by the junta's chairman, Than Shwe, and his \n     accomplices, the outlaw regime in Rangoon has not taken steps \n     that would justify the lifting of sanctions. ``For all the \n     hype about a `road map for democracy,' nothing has changed \n     for the better for democracy or human rights in Burma,'' \n     Craner said.\n       The junta has intimated it might release Suu Kyi from house \n     arrest in April. This would be a gesture the people of Burma \n     would welcome, as would everyone around the world who \n     cherishes human rights and democracy. Suu Kyi narrowly \n     escaped being killed in the assault that the regime staged \n     last May. Over the years she has accepted painful personal \n     sacrifices for the sake of democracy in Burma--without ever \n     deviating from her devotion to the principles of nonviolence.\n       As much as her compatriots long for the release of Suu Kyi, \n     however, that will not by itself be enough to justify the \n     lifting of U.S. sanctions on the junta. Her party, the \n     National League for Democracy, won 80 percent of the seats in \n     Parliament in a 1990 election--a popular verdict the military \n     regime still refuses to accept. Until Than Shwe and the other \n     uniformed thugs on the junta complete what assistant \n     secretary Craner called ``an irreversible transition to \n     democracy,'' sanctions should remain in place.\n       Suu Kyi's fellow Nobel peace prize winner Desmond Tutu has \n     written: ``As in South Africa, the people and legitimate \n     leaders of Burma have called for sanctions . . . To dismantle \n     apartheid took not only commitment, faith and hard work, but \n     also intense international pressure and sanctions.''\n       Tutu's wisdom should be heeded not only by Washington but \n     also by the European Union, which is currently considering \n     targeted sanctions on timber and gems, direct sources of \n     junta revenue.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 27, 2004]\n\n                         A Need To Act on Burma\n\n                (By John McCain and Madeleine Albright)\n\n       ``Apathy in the face of systematic human rights abuses is \n     immoral. One either supports justice and freedom or one \n     supports injustice and bondage.'' So said Archbishop Desmond \n     Tutu, the South African Nobel laureate and anti-apartheid \n     leader, who knows something about the struggle for human \n     freedom in the face of tyranny.\n       The world's democracies have a common moral obligation to \n     promote justice and freedom. In few places is this obligation \n     more acute than in Burma, a country in which a band of thugs, \n     led by Gen. Than Shwe, controls the population through \n     violence and terror. The regime has a record of unchecked \n     repression. It has murdered political opponents, used child \n     soldiers and forced labor, and employed rape as a weapon of \n     war. Nearly one year ago the Burmese military junta launched \n     an orchestrated, violent attack against democracy leader Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and hundreds of her supporters. Since then the \n     regime has kept more than 1,000 political activists \n     imprisoned, including elected members of parliament. It \n     recently sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for \n     contacting representatives of the International Labor \n     Organization.\n       The Burmese junta, with the cynical support of neighboring \n     governments, has announced a ``road map to democracy,'' \n     beginning with a constitutional convention in May. The \n     convention is expected to be stage-managed by the junta, \n     which has offered no meaningful participation to Suu Kyi's \n     National League for Democracy, no timetable for progress \n     toward a political transition, no release of political \n     prisoners and no guarantee that the military will cede \n     control to democratically elected leaders. Instead, the \n     junta's proposals seem designed to institutionalize military \n     control by creating a veneer of civilian authority, while \n     meeting only the minimum expectations of Western democracies \n     in order to avoid further sanctions.\n       The Burmese regime's recent actions demonstrate that years \n     of international engagement and patience have not made the \n     dictatorship more humane, reasonable or open to accommodation \n     with its political opponents. On the contrary, it is only in \n     response to international pressure that the regime has made \n     even the smallest moves toward a political settlement with \n     the democratic opposition. The lesson is clear: The world's \n     democracies and Burma's neighbors must press the junta until \n     it is willing to negotiate an irreversible transition to \n     democratic rule.\n       The legitimacy, authority and commitment of Burma's \n     democratic leaders to govern their country is not in doubt. \n     But the international commitment to Burma's democratic \n     transformation remains uncertain. The Western democracies and \n     Burma's neighbors should immediately take three steps to \n     bolster Burma's legitimate democratic leaders.\n       First, Congress should promptly renew, and the president \n     should sign into law, the ban on Burma's imports enacted into \n     law last July. These sanctions, which are set to expire \n     after a review period beginning Friday, are supported by \n     Burma's National League for Democracy. The restrictions \n     have made it more difficult for the Burmese military to \n     tap financial assets abroad, travel or accumulate revenue \n     through trade. The European Union, whose member \n     democracies care deeply about protecting human rights, and \n     whose trade and assistance programs give it critical \n     leverage in Southeast Asia, is set to announce a new \n     Common Position on Burma on Thursday. As part of this new \n     policy, the EU should also initiate targeted sanctions \n     against the regime.\n       Second, the EU and the United States, with support from \n     Asian nations, should urge the junta to implement immediately \n     the provisions of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights and \n     the U.N. General Assembly resolutions--including democracy, \n     the rule of law and respect for human rights. The United \n     States and the EU should also formally place the issue on the \n     agenda of the U.N. Security Council, and work urgently toward \n     a resolution threatening credible sanctions against the \n     Burmese regime unless it initiates meaningful progress toward \n     democracy.\n       Third, China, Thailand, India and other Asian nations \n     uncomfortable with a tougher response to the junta's crimes \n     must understand that diplomatic obfuscation and obstruction \n     on Burma will profoundly affect their broader bilateral \n     relationships with the Western democracies. Thailand in \n     particular should consider this point when it convenes its \n     planned international conference to discuss what it \n     optimistically calls ``Burma's progress toward democracy.''\n       Beyond these steps, the United States, Europe and Asian \n     countries must demand the unconditional release of Aung San \n     Suu Kyi and her fellow political prisoners, but make clear \n     that the releases, while necessary, are insufficient. In \n     addition, they should continue calls for a political \n     settlement that reflects the results of the free and fair \n     elections held in 1990. This settlement must include a \n     central, determinative role for the National League for \n     Democracy.\n       In another era, a dissident playwright named Vaclav Havel \n     wrote of the ``power of the powerless'' to overcome rule by \n     fear and force, at a time when such a revolution in human \n     freedom seemed impossible. The international community today \n     has the power to help the powerless inside Burma throw off \n     the shackles of tyranny. It is time to assume this moral \n     responsibility. It is time to act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Aung San Suu Kyi--Unbearable Choices\n\n                               (By Bono)\n\n       It's hard not to become a monster when you are trying to \n     defeat one. Aung San Suu Kyi is the moral leader of Myanmar, \n     the country more correctly known as Burma. She has been, in \n     effect, under house arrest since 1989.\n       Why? First, because of the military juntas who came to \n     power in a bloody coup in 1962, and have been running the \n     country with a truncheon ever since. Second, because of us.\n\n[[Page S4705]]\n\n     There has been no real roar against these human rights \n     abusers, just the odd bark. Yet even single-party democracies \n     check their mail. They're not just muscle; they're vain. Even \n     juntas measure just how many boos and hisses they can get \n     away with. Suu Kyi's peaceful bloody-mindedness is driven by \n     courage, but her captors' bloody bloody-mindedness is driven \n     by fear--fear of losing the business they are running for \n     themselves.\n       Suu Kyi is a real hero in an age of phony phone-in \n     celebrity, which hands out that title freely to the most \n     spoiled and underqualified. Her quiet voice of reason makes \n     the world look noisy, mad; it is a low mantra of grace in an \n     age of terror, a reminder of everything we take for granted \n     and just what it can take to get it. Thinking of her, you \n     can't help but use anachronistic language of duty and \n     personal sacrifice.\n       U2 wrote the song Walk On to honor this amazing woman who \n     put family second to country, who for her convictions made an \n     unbearable choice--not to see her sons grow and not to be \n     with her husband as he lost his life to a long and painful \n     cancer. Suu Kyi, with an idea too big for any jail and a \n     spirit too strong for any army, changes our view--as only \n     real heroes can--of what we believe to be possible. The jury \n     is still out on whether we deserve the faith she has put in \n     us.\n       Walk On won record of the year at the Grammys, a very proud \n     moment. But in front of an audience of millions, I did what \n     I've begged others not to do. I forgot to say thank you to \n     the woman in front of the song. Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                American Apparel &\n\n\n                                         Footwear Association,\n\n                                                    April 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Last year, you were instrumental in \n     an effort that led to the successful enactment of the Burmese \n     Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to send a clear and \n     unmistakable message that the United States is not interested \n     in doing business with regimes such as the one that brutally \n     enslaves the people of Burma. The American Apparel & Footwear \n     Association in proud to have supported this historic measure.\n       This landmark legislation included a total ban on imports \n     from Burma. As you may recall, the import ban will expire \n     unless Congress passes, and the President signs into law, a \n     one-year renewal by the end of July.\n       Since this law took effect, the ruling military junta in \n     Burma has shown no willingness to address the many problems \n     that made these sanctions necessary. Indeed, as the most \n     recent State Department Human Rights report (in what appears \n     to be an echo of more than a decade of similar reports) \n     states, ``The Government's extremely poor human rights record \n     worsened [in 2003], and it continued to commit numerous \n     serious abuses.'' Moreover, last week, State Department \n     officials told the House International Relations Committee, \n     ``Sanctions are a key component of our policy in bringing \n     democracy to Burma and have been a key source of support for \n     the morale of many democracy activists.''\n       Now is the time to reinforce our sanctions tools against \n     this regime, and, more importantly, to actively seek similar \n     steps from other countries. Accordingly, we urge you to \n     introduce as soon as possible the legislation necessary to \n     renew this import ban, as articulated in Section (9)(b)(2) of \n     the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.\n       We look forward to working with you to see this renewal \n     swiftly considered and enacted.\n       Please accept my best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kevin M. Burke,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to provide my \ncolleagues with insights into how serious and dedicated those who \nsupport the struggle for freedom in Burma remain.\n  Since the enactment of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act in July \n2003, numerous colleagues and I have written to the administration and \nthe United Nations in support of democracy in Burma. The following is a \nlist of those letters that I have initiated or signed--but it is by no \nmeans an exhaustive list as it does not include any letters individual \nmembers may have sent themselves:\n  August 1, 2003: a letter to President Bush signed by myself and \nSenators Feinstein, Brownback, and Leahy expressing concern with \nThailand's lack of support for the struggle of freedom in Burma.\n  September 12, 2003: a letter to Secretary Powell signed by myself \nencouraging him to bring up the plight of Suu Kyi and other Burmese \ndemocracy activists with the United Nations and all Security Council \nmembers, particularly China.\n  September 30, 2003: a letter to President Bush signed by myself and \nSenators Feinstein, McCain, Hollings, Santorum, Graham, Allen, Dodd, \nSessions, Mikulski, Campbell, Clinton, Smith, Murray, Collins, \nFeingold, Edwards, Bennett, Landrieu, Burns, Cantwell, Corzine, Wyden, \nBrownback, Lautenberg, Kohl, Murkowski, Bunning, Lieberman, Sarbanes, \nHarkins, Dayton, Voinovich, Leahy, and Durbin urging his support for \nThailand to play a more constructive role within ASEAN to promote \ngenuine national reconciliation in Burma.\n  November 24, 2004: a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan \nsigned by myself and Senators Feinstein, McCain, and Brownback calling \non the U.N. to assume a leadership role to enforce the will of the \ninternational community in recognizing the results of the 1990 \nelections.\n  March 1, 2004: a letter to President Bush signed by myself and \nSenators Feinstein, McCain and Representatives Lantos, King and Pitts \nurging continued sanctions against Burma and increased engagement with \nthe EU.\n  March 29, 2004: a letter to Secretary Powell signed by myself urging \nhim to use the Berlin donor conference on Afghanistan to work the Burma \nissue with the EU and Japan.\n  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the support and leadership \nof Senators Feinstein and McCain. Both have stood steadfastly with the \npeople of Burma. They are champions of freedom in that country, and I \nam pleased and proud to once again work with them on this issue.\n  The partnership between Congress and senior members of the \nAdministration on Burma has been productive and commendable. I look \nforward to working with President Bush, Secretary Powell and others on \nthis important issue throughout this calendar year.\n  This joint resolution will renew sanctions against Burma for an \nadditional year.\n  Roughly a year ago, Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein, and I came to \nthe Senate floor to talk about the arrest and reincarceration of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, the hero of the Burma democracy.\n  To refresh everyone's memory, she and her party won an overwhelming \nlandslide election back in 1990 when the military thugs who run the \ncountry--mistakenly, from there point of view--allowed an election. The \nNLD and Suu Kyi won virtually 80 percent of the vote and were never \nallowed to take over. She was then essentially put under house arrest \nand has been mostly under house arrest all these years. Here we are \nsome 14 years later.\n  During that time, her husband passed away while living in England. \nShe didn't get to visit him because she knew if she went to England, \nshe would never be allowed back into the country. She is the symbol of \nBurmese freedom and democracy and has been under house arrest all these \nyears.\n  A little over roughly this month last year, she was allowed to go out \nand go around the country. Her motorcade was attacked and a number of \npeople were killed. She was injured and was sent into confinement once \nagain--raising the issue again in the public mind, which, \nunfortunately, has not been in the forefront as often as it should have \nbeen over the years. Burma for many people has been sort of out of \nsight and out of mind. It has not enjoyed the kind of international \nattention that repression deserves.\n  What Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein, and I have been trying to do \nis lead the United States to have a more proactive interest in this. \nThat is what the Burma sanctions bill is about. It passed last June and \nwas signed by the President Last July. Secretary Powell was before the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee a few weeks ago, and he indicated that \nthe administration supports renewal of these sanctions for an \nadditional year. That is what the joint resolution I just introduced on \nbehalf of Senator Feinstein, Senator McCain, and others will do.\n  Sanctions have had some impact. We all know sanctions have mixed \nresults in bringing down regimes. Frequently, they do not work, but \nthere is one really classic example of a place where international \nsanctions made a difference, and that was changing the regime in South \nAfrica. In that particular instance, the United States led and the rest \nof the world followed, and the sanctions became so widespread and the \npressure so intense that it actually brought about a change in the \nregime in South Africa, and the majority there was allowed to take \npower.\n  We have had a difficult time getting the kind of international \ncooperation\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\non sanctions on Burma we would like to see, but we have started down \nthat path.\n  This bill, which was signed last year, this Burma sanctions bill, \nspurred other nations to toughen their stance against Burma, denied the \nmilitary regime 13 percent of its export market, and blocked $13 \nmillion in financial transactions to Burma. That is not a huge amount \nof money but it is a start. If the other countries in that area of the \nworld, the ASEAN countries, and the Europeans, would give the attention \nto this that it deserves, we could have meaningful international \nsanctions that really bite.\n  The European Union and the U.N. will, frankly, have to be much more \nsupportive of freedom in Burma. Both need to be much more proactive \nthan they have been if this is going to work.\n  Bishop Tutu, with whom we are all familiar, the South African bishop, \nbelieves if we had the kind of international pressure and cooperation \non Burma sanctions that we had on South African sanctions, it could, \nindeed, bring about a change in the regime in Burma.\n  My friend Senator McCain and I have had an opportunity to discuss \nthis issue off and on over the years. He had a unique opportunity, \nwhich I have never experienced. I have gotten notes from Aung San Suu \nKyi but never actually had a chance to meet her. I know Senator McCain \nhad that opportunity. He and I both have been inspired by the example \nshe has set. I believe, am I not correct, Senator McCain, you dealt \nwith her in your most recent book as an example of the kind of courage \nthat should be widely applauded?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Kentucky and I be allowed to engage in a \ndialog.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator McConnell, I thank you and Senator Feinstein for \nyour leadership on this issue. What you have done last year is \nimportant. It is very important again this year.\n  Senator McConnell, you put your finger on one of the real tough \naspects of this. People all over Burma, including the members of the \nNational League for Democracy, the party that was overwhelmingly \nelected to take power and run the country of Burma, are grateful to us. \nIt is very tough for opposition within a country to support sanctions \nwhich hurt that country economically. Yet this organization, which she \nleads, supports sanctions because of the terrible things this group of \ngangsters have done to their country.\n  Senator McConnell, you point out very importantly, apartheid was \noverthrown in South Africa because of a united front which the United \nStates led, an issue in which you were heavily involved. Now the \nEuropeans seem to be dragging their feet.\n  We have quite often heard--sometimes justified, sometimes \nunjustified--criticism from our European friends about our lack of \nattention to human rights, too much attention to politics, et cetera. \nThis is an opportunity for our European friends to join us and bring \nabout the freedom of the Burmese people--I refuse to call it Myanmar--\nthe Burmese people, free this great Nobel Peace Prize winner and spread \ndemocracy and freedom through the world.\n\n  I thank again Senator McConnell for his leadership. This legislation \nwould not have been passed without the leadership of you and Senator \nFeinstein. I am very grateful.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you very much, I say to my friend from Arizona.\n  He was mentioning the fact that we, this country, is frequently \ncriticized because it does not take a multilateral approach to \ndifficult issues. What we have been advocating as aggressively as we \ncan is a widespread multilateral, multinational approach to dealing \nwith this Myanmar regime, which no one defends but seems to be allowed \nto continue to operate because they are out of sight and out of mind. \nHere we are advocating a multilateral approach. As the Senator from \nArizona points out, where are the Europeans?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think we need to make this a very high priority both in \nthe United Nations and with the European Union and with others. I know \nSenator McConnell is very familiar with this brave woman and her \nfollowers. A lot of Americans, unfortunately, are not.\n  Three Burmese citizens were recently sentenced to death for \ncontacting representatives of the International Labor Organization. \nThey were sentenced to death for contacting members of the \nInternational Labor Organization. This woman has been kept under house \narrest. Her followers have been beaten and killed. The cruelties, the \nunspeakable cruelties that have been inflicted on the Burmese people by \nthese thugs are incredible.\n  Senator McConnell, recently we were talking about Iraq and freeing \nthe people of Iraq. We celebrated the 10-year anniversary of Rwanda and \nwe said never again. Eight hundred thousand people were killed in \nRwanda and we said never again. After the Holocaust, we said never \nagain. Are we going to look back on Burma and say never again after \nthousands of people have been tortured and murdered and imprisoned and \nmistreated?\n  Security forces, according to national organizations, continue to \ncommit extrajudicial killings, rape, forcibly relocate persons, and the \nuse of forced labor. It is going on. Are we some years from now going \nto say never again? Are we internationally going to exert the pressures \nof which we are capable--by the way, including our friends in ASEAN who \ntook Burma into ASEAN with the announced intention of reforming this \ngang of thugs?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the ASEAN meeting is scheduled to be in Burma in a \nfew years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Remarkable in itself. What kind of an organization can \ncall itself an advocate of freedom and democracy and have a meeting in \nthe center of a repressive outrageous gang of thugs?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was a stunning decision to schedule the meeting \nthere. And now, if they stick with the schedule, I wonder how ASEAN can \nexplain their tolerance of this regime? Give this regime nuclear \nweapons and it would look very much like North Korea, would it not, I \nask my friend?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is an excellent point. One of the reasons, perhaps, \nwe do not pay as much attention to them is because they do not have \nweapons of mass destruction. The only difference between them and \nPyongyang is that they do not and the North Koreans do. That is a heck \nof a comment on the attention of us.\n\n  I don't want to take too much time, but I will relate a story with \nwhich Senator McConnell is familiar. Aung San Suu Kyi was married while \nin England to a wonderful man and has two sons. A few years ago, a very \nshort time ago, her husband was dying in England. This gang of thugs \nsaid that she could, of course, go with her husband--he was not allowed \nto come to Burma--to be with her husband while he was dying but she \ncould not come back. So these unspeakable characters would not allow \nher to go be with her husband as he died.\n  This is a remarkable statement of her courage and dedication and also \nremarkable commentary on the kind of people with whom we are dealing. \nThe next time the delegate from the U.N., the special delegate--they \ncall it Myanmar--come to see us, our European friends come to see us \nand talk about powers of persuasion, remind them of that story. I think \nit would be very difficult to argue that these people are rational or \nwilling to listen to reason.\n  Again, I thank Senator McConnell for all of his hard work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could say to my friend from Arizona, staff \nreminds me, Burma takes the chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006. They \nactually take the chairmanship. That is a completely absurd and \nunacceptable result.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Americans are great people. We are providing a service \ntoday with your and Senator Feinstein's legislation to bring attention \nto the plight of the people halfway around the world and their noble \nand courageous leader who has been a Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n  Every once in a while we do something very worthwhile around here and \nI thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and \nthe Senator from Arizona for their words. I had hoped to join them on \nthe floor earlier, but I was in the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\nCommittee. So I am very pleased to be able to be here now to say a few \nwords in support of this effort.\n  I first became involved in the Burmese, or Myanmar, dilemma back in \n1995-1996 with then-Senator William Cohen, and we offered some \nlegislation at that time. So we have had the opportunity to follow this \nsituation. I then worked with Senator McConnell a year ago on this \nlegislation. And now I am very pleased to support the renewal of the \nsanctions imposed on Burma by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003.\n  Last year, in response to a brutal and vicious coordinated assault by \nprogovernment paramilitary thugs on members of the National League for \nDemocracy (NLD), and the arrest and detention of NLD's leader, the \nNobel Peace Price winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, the U.S. Congress \noverwhelmingly passed this act. The purpose was to impose a complete \nimport ban on products from Burma.\n  Working together, the Congress and the administration demonstrated \nour determination to put pressure on the ruling State Peace and \nDevelopment Council--that is the military junta formerly known as the \nSLORC--to release Suu Kyi, and also to respect the 1990 elections \ndecisively won by the National League for Democracy party in Burma and \nput Burma on an irreversible path of national reconciliation and \ndemocracy. One year later, it is clear that the SPDC has failed to make \nsubstantial and measurable progress toward implementing a democratic \ngovernment to have those sanctions lifted.\n  The junta has failed. The world has condemned the arrest of Aung San \nSuu Kyi. They have called for her unconditional release. She still \nremains under house arrest. NLD Vice-Chairman U Tin Oo also remains in \ncustody.\n  Last August, the junta proposed a seven-point ``roadmap'' to \ndemocracy. That included a national convention to take place the \nfollowing month to draft a new constitution. Yet there is no timetable \nfor restoration of democracy, no assurance that the junta will give up \npower, and no meaningful participation for Suu Kyi and her party.\n  Numerous human rights abuses, including torture, forced labor, rape, \nand sex trafficking continue unabated.\n  The most recent State Department report indicates that:\n\n       The Government's extremely poor human rights record \n     worsened [in 2003] and it continued to commit numerous \n     abuses.\n\n  Recently, the junta sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for one \nthing: for meeting with representatives of the ILO, the International \nLabor Organization. That is how repressive this regime is. If you meet \nwith an organization not favored by the government, you could be \nsentenced to death.\n  Mr. President, 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail, many of \nthem elected parliamentarians. According to the State Department, three \npolitical prisoners died in custody last year.\n  The government engages in the production and distribution of opium \nand methamphetamine.\n  The Thai-sponsored ``Bangkok Process''--designed to mediate a \nsolution to the political situation in Burma--collapsed after one \nmeeting with the SPDC's refusal to attend further sessions with ``like-\nminded'' countries. The regime said it was ``too busy'' to attend this \nweek's session.\n  For years, we have been working with ASEAN nations to put pressure on \nthe military junta to make changes. But these nations were reluctant to \ndo so. The Thailand-sponsored Bangkok Process aimed to do the same \nthing. However, what is clear is that the military junta has ignored \nthose efforts.\n  So over the past several months, the regime has gone to great lengths \nto rehabilitate its standing with neighbors and the international \ncommunity. Some thought this was evidence that the junta was committed \nto national reconciliation, that engagement works, and that the \nsanctions and other pressures on Rangoon should be eased to facilitate \nthe implementation of this new roadmap.\n\n  But I think they are mistaken because I think we have learned \nsomething now about this regime's intentions. So what we need is \nsubstantive and meaningful action, not more promises and empty \nstatements and failure to deliver on commitments.\n  For over 15 years, this junta has engaged in a systematic campaign to \nwipe out the democratic movement in Burma and the NLD's 1990 election \nvictory.\n  For over 15 years, we have listened to assurances that the junta was \ncommitted to national reconciliation and a dialog with all parties on \nrestoring democracy, and still nothing has happened.\n  I was actually cautiously optimistic when Suu Kyi was first released \nfrom house arrest 2 years ago. Yet sure enough, 1 year later, she was \nback in custody. The regime showed its true colors in orchestrating and \ncarrying out a brutal attack. After her release, Aung San Suu Kyi had \ngone on the road. She was greeted with enormous popularity. The junta's \nforces attacked her caravan. Many of her people were killed; many were \narrested; and she was shoved back into house arrest for doing nothing \nmore than what she was elected originally to do.\n  So whatever the regime might say about ``roadmaps'' and ``national \nconventions,'' their actions have clearly demonstrated they are \nuninterested in restoring democracy to the Burmese people and, more \nimportantly, they are going to take any steps they can to hold on to \npower.\n  Even if, as we all hope, Aung San Suu Kyi is released and is invited \nto take part in a national convention, I think we should maintain the \npressure on this junta and keep the sanctions in place.\n  Now, earlier this week, the junta allowed members of the NLD, the \ndemocratic party, to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi to discuss their \nparticipation at the convention. But this is hardly progress.\n  ``Substantial and measurable'' progress is just that, and we should \nnot settle for lofty pronouncements when they have a record of breaking \ntheir word on virtually every statement they have made.\n  So I am very pleased that Secretary of State Colin Powell has \ntestified that the administration supports reauthorizing the sanctions. \nHe recently stated:\n\n       I have seen no improvement in the situation. Aung San Suu \n     Kyi remains unable to participate in public political life in \n     Burma, and we will not ignore that. We will not shrink from \n     the strong position we have taken.\n\n  So now is not the time to reduce our support for this brave leader. \nNow is the time to stand with her side by side, to buttress her, to \nreinforce her, to point out, over and over again that she is the \nelected democratic leader of that country; now is the time to show the \nSPDC that America is not going to stand by and see members of the \nparliament jailed, not going to stand by and see her people continually \nattacked, and not going to stand by and see every promise the junta \nmade violated.\n  So I feel very strongly and am very pleased to join with the \ndistinguished Senators from Kentucky and Arizona in supporting this \nextension legislation.\n\n                              S.J. Res. 36\n\n       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has \n     failed to make substantial and measurable progress toward \n     implementing a democratic government in Burma;\n       Whereas the courage and determination of the people of \n     Burma in their struggle for freedom and justice remains \n     steadfast and strong;\n       Whereas import sanctions and other restrictions against the \n     SPDC and its affiliated entities should remain in force until \n     Burma embarks on an irreversible path of reconciliation that \n     includes the full and unfettered participation of the \n     National League for Democracy and ethnic minorities in the \n     country; and\n       Whereas the Department of State supports the continuation \n     of sanctions against the SPDC: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n     2003.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators McConnell \nand Feinstein for introducing legislation that will renew sanctions \ncontained in last year's Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I am proud \nto be an original cosponsor of this resolution.\n  The world's democracies have a common moral obligation to promote \nhuman rights. In few places is the lack of freedom and justice more \nappalling than in Burma, a country in which a band of thugs, led by \nGeneral Than Shwe, controls the population through\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\nviolence and terror. The Burmese regime has a record of unchecked \nrepression. It has murdered political opponents, used child soldiers \nand forced labor, and employed rape as a weapon of war. Nearly one year \nago the Burmese military junta launched an orchestrated, violent attack \nagainst democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of her \nsupporters. Since then the regime has kept more than 1,000 political \nactivists imprisoned, including elected members of parliament. It also \nrecently sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for contacting \nrepresentatives of the International Labor Organization.\n  And Aung San Suu Kyi remains a captive. Because she stands for \ndemocracy, this heroic woman has endured attacks, arrest, captivity, \nand untold sufferings at the hands of the regime. The junta fears Aung \nSan Suu Kyi because of what she represents--peace, freedom and justice \nfor all Burmese people. The thugs who run Burma have tried to stifle \nher voice, but they will never extinguish her moral courage. Her \nleadership and example shines brightly for the millions of Burmese who \nhunger for freedom, and for those of us outside Burma who seek justice \nfor its people. The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the \nNational League for Democracy must be the world's work.\n  In recognition of this, last year the Congress overwhelmingly passed \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. In doing so, we took active \nsteps to pressure the military junta, and we sent a signal to the \nBurmese people that they are not forgotten--that the American people \ncare about their freedom and will stand up for justice in their \ncountry.\n  The State Department released just this week a new report on U.S. \ntrade sanctions against Burma. This report notes that the Freedom and \nDemocracy Act encouraged ASEAN nations to take a critical stance on \nBurma, and that these pressures were likely a factor behind the junta's \nAugust announcement of a ``roadmap'' toward democratic transition. \nWhile this roadmap is sorely lacking, it does point to the tangible \neffect that our efforts are having inside the country.\n  Yet since we passed our bill last year, the ruling State Peace and \nDevelopment Council has failed to make substantial progress toward \nimplementing a democratic government in Burma. The new State Department \nreport indicates that Burma's ``extremely poor human rights record has \nworsened over the past year, and it continued to commit serious \nabuses.'' Pro-democracy activists remain in detention, the National \nLeague for Democracy offices remain closed, and citizens do not have \nthe right to change their government. Security forces continue to \ncommit extrajudicial killings and rape, forcibly relocate persons, and \nuse forced labor. The military junta refuses to tolerate any form of \npolitical opposition. On top of this, the dismal economic polices \nimplemented by Burma's rulers have led to widespread poverty and the \nflight of most foreign investors.\n\n  Sadly, the picture is clear. So long as this band of thugs rules \nBurma, its people will be never be free. They will remain mired in \npoverty and suffering, cut off from the world, with only their \nindomitable spirit to keep them moving forward.\n  For this reason I stand in support of the joint resolution that will \nrenew the import restrictions contained in last year's legislation--\nsanctions that are supported by the National League for Democracy. \nThese restrictions must remain until Burma embarks on a true path of \nreconciliation--a process that must include the NLD and Burmese ethnic \nminorities. I note, however, that while the American people have spoken \nwith one voice in support of freedom in Burma, it is past time that the \nleaders of other nations do the same. No other country has yet \nimplemented U.S.-style economic sanctions. The Europeans should reject \nhalf measures and join the United States in targeted sanctions against \nthe military regime. China, Thailand, India and other Asian nations \nuncomfortable with a tougher response to the junta's crimes must \nunderstand that diplomatic obfuscation and obstruction on Burma will \nprofoundly affect their broader bilateral relationships with the \nWestern democracies.\n  Mr. President, this week I co-authored with former Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright an editorial on Burma for the Washington Post. This \narticle enumerates several of the points that I have made here, and \nillustrates the bipartisan consensus that we must act to promote \ndemocracy and human rights in Burma. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of our editorial be printed in the Record at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection; it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. In this article, we quote Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a man \nwho knows quite a bit about life under tyranny and oppression. The \nArchbishop said that ``Apathy in the face of systematic human rights \nabuses is immoral. One either supports justice and freedom or one \nsupports injustice and bondage.'' Mr. President, today we support \njustice and freedom.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 27, 2004]\n\n                         A Need To Act on Burma\n\n       ``Apathy in the face of systematic human rights abuses is \n     immoral. One either supports justice and freedom or one \n     supports injustice and bondage.'' So said Archbishop Desmond \n     Tutu, the South African Nobel laureate and anti-apartheid \n     leader, who knows something about the struggle for human \n     freedom in the face of tyranny.\n       The world's democracies have a common moral obligation to \n     promote justice and freedom. In few places is this obligation \n     more acute than in Burma, a country in which a band of thugs, \n     led by Gen. Than Shwe, controls the population through \n     violence and terror. The regime has a record of unchecked \n     repression. It has murdered political opponents, used child \n     soldiers and forced labor, and employed rape as a weapon of \n     war. Nearly one year ago the Burmese military junta launched \n     an orchestrated, violent attack against democracy leader Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and hundreds of her supporters. Since then the \n     regime has kept more than 1,000 political activists \n     imprisoned, including elected members of parliament. It \n     recently sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for \n     contacting representatives of the International Labor \n     Organization.\n       The Burmese junta, with the cynical support of neighboring \n     governments, has announced a ``road map to democracy,'' \n     beginning with a constitutional convention in May. The \n     convention is expected to be stage-managed by the junta, \n     which has offered no meaningful participation to Suu Kyi's \n     National League for Democracy, no timetable for progress \n     toward a political transition, no release of political \n     prisoners and no guarantee that the military will cede \n     control to democratically elected leaders. Instead, the \n     junta's proposals seem designed to institutionalize military \n     control by creating a veneer of civilian authority, while \n     meeting only the minimum expectations of Western democracies \n     in order to avoid further sanctions.\n       The Burmese regime's recent actions demonstrate that years \n     of international engagement and patience have not made the \n     dictatorship more humane, reasonable or open to accommodation \n     with its political opponents. On the contrary, it is only in \n     response to international pressure that the regime has made \n     even the smallest moves toward a political settlement with \n     the democratic opposition. The lesson is clear: The world's \n     democracies and Burma's neighbors must press the junta until \n     it is willing to negotiate an irreversible transition to \n     democratic rule.\n       The legitimacy, authority and commitment of Burma's \n     democratic leaders to govern their country is not in doubt. \n     But the international commitment to Burma's democratic \n     transformation remains uncertain. The Western democracies and \n     Burma's neighbors should immediately take three steps to \n     bolster Burma's legitimate democratic leaders.\n       First, Congress should promptly renew, and the president \n     sign into law, the ban on Burma's imports enacted into law \n     last July. These sanctions, which are set to expire after a \n     review period beginning Friday, are supported by Burma's \n     National League for Democracy. The restrictions have made it \n     more difficult for the Burmese military to tap financial \n     assets abroad, travel or accumulate revenue through trade. \n     The European Union, whose member democracies care deeply \n     about protecting human rights, and whose trade and \n     assistance programs give it critical leverage in Southeast \n     Asia, are set to announce a new Common Position on Burma \n     on Thursday. As part of this new policy, the EU should \n     also initiate target sanctions against the regime.\n       Second, the EU and the United States, with support from \n     Asian nations, should urge the junta to implement immediately \n     the provisions of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights and \n     the U.N. General Assembly resolutions--including democracy, \n     the rule of law and respect for human rights. The United \n     States and the EU should also formally place the issue on the \n     agenda of the U.N. Security Council, and work urgently toward \n     a resolution threatening credible sanctions against the \n     Burmese regime unless it initiates meaningful progress toward \n     democracy.\n       Third, China, Thailand, India and other Asian nations \n     uncomfortable with a tougher\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\n     response to the junta's crimes must understand that \n     diplomatic obfuscation and obstruction on Burma will \n     profoundly affect their broader bilateral relationships with \n     the Western democracies. Thailand in particular should \n     consider this point when it convenes its planned \n     international conference to discuss what it optimistically \n     calls ``Burma's progress toward democracy.''\n       Beyond these steps, the United States, Europe and Asian \n     countries must demand the unconditional release of Aung San \n     Suu Kyi and her fellow political prisoners, but make clear \n     that the releases, while necessary, are insufficient. In \n     addition, they should continue calls for a political \n     settlement that reflects the results of the free and fair \n     elections held in 1990. This settlement must include a \n     central, determinative role for the National League for \n     Democracy.\n       In another era, a dissident playwright named Vaclav Havel \n     wrote of the ``power of the powerless'' to overcome rule by \n     fear and force, at a time when such a revolution in human \n     freedom seemed impossible. The international community today \n     has the power to help the powerless inside Burma throw off \n     the shackles of tyranny. It is time to assume this moral \n     responsibility. It is time to act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it saddens me to rise today to speak about \nthe situation in Burma. Burma is a beautiful country with a rich \nhistory. Regrettably, this great nation, with so much potential, is \nbeing destroyed by the despotic junta, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC.\n  Natural resources are pillaged, ethnic minorities are brutally \nrepressed, and most notably, Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, is under \nhouse arrest--denying her the right to help lead her nation.\n  For more than a decade, the brutal and autocratic regime, the SPDC \nhas played an outrageous ``game'' with Aung San Suu Kyi. It goes \nsomething like this: pretend to allow Aung San Suu Kyi freedom to move \naround the country; when her movements become too threatening, put her \nunder house arrest; keep her there until international pressure becomes \ntoo intense; eventually let her out, starting it all over again. In \nother words, isolate Aung San Suu Kyi and stall for time, while looting \nthe country of its resources.\n  Once again, we find ourselves in this situation. About a year ago, \nthe SPDC launched a vicious, pre-meditated attack against Aung San Suu \nKyi and other members of the NLDF. The SPDC then placed Aung San Suu \nKyi under house arrest, using the absurd justification that it is for \nher own safety. Virtually nothing has changed since that time. Aung San \nSuu Kyi remains under house arrest and the outrageous activities of the \nSPDC continue unabated.\n  It is for this reason that I join Senators McConnell and Feinstein \ntoday in introducing the joint resolution to extend the sanctions \nprovided for in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. The senior \nSenators from Kentucky and California have already discussed the \nsituation in Burma and made the case why this legislation is so \nimportant. I want to associate myself with their remarks and will be \nbrief here today.\n  The message that we are sending to the ruling junta in Burma is \nclear: its behavior is outrageous. Aung San Suu Kyi is the rightful \nleader of the democratic opposition in Burma. She and other opposition \nleaders must be immediately released.\n  But, as important as U.S. leadership is on this issue, we all know it \nis not enough. Burma's neighbors--India, Thailand, and China--must also \nact. For too long, the silence of these key nations has been deafening. \nTo obtain real change in Burma, these and other nations in the region \nmust change course, speak out and disavow the failed policies of \nengagement.\n  I know that the sponsors of the legislation recognize this. I have \nheard Senator McConnell speak frequently of the need for a ``full court \npress'' by the international community on this issue. While I am not so \nnaive as to believe that this legislation will instantly cause a change \nof heart among the SPDC, I am hopeful that constant pressure U.S. \npressure and others will, one day, lead to a breakthrough.\n  Everyone in the Senate would like to see the SPDC tossed on the ash \nheap of history, but there is widespread recognition that this regime \nis well entrenched and will not go away overnight. The immediate goal \nshould be to get Aung San Suu Kyi out of house arrest and give her and \nthe NLDF an equal seat at the table. Considering that the NLDF was \ndemocratically elected to lead Burma, this is a modest goal indeed.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters have been denied for too long. It \nis time for a change in Burma. I hope that this is the beginning of the \nend for the SPDC and the start of a new era in Burma, allowing that \ncountry and its people to achieve the democracy and progress they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4709-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4709-S4710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 346--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA GOLDEN \n    GOPHERS FOR WINNING THE 2003-2004 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n     ASSOCIATION DIVISION I NATIONAL COLLEGIATE WOMEN'S ICE HOCKEY \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. DAYTON (for himself and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, throughout the day we have had discussion \nregarding the short-term highway extension. My colleague, Senator Bond, \nhas been here throughout the day, working hard and discussing the \ncritical importance of having this body move forward on the 6-year \nauthorization measure on transportation that has passed both Houses.\n  Obviously, there is a frustration that there has been an objection \nfrom the other side to our request to appoint conferees to move this \nbill to conference. We will do a short-term extension in a moment. \nHowever, as majority leader, in the absence of an agreement to move \nforward on the transportation bill, I am committed, after talking to \nand working with Senator Bond over the course of the day, to use our \nprocedural options to put the Senate on record next week with regard to \ngoing to conference on the highway bill.\n  The distinguished minority whip is on the floor, and he has been very \nengaged in this issue as well.\n  I do thank our colleague, Senator Bond, and all the others involved, \nfor allowing us to move on this short-term extension at this time. \nAgain, I believe it is time for us to follow the regular order and send \nthe 6-year authorization bill to conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also extend my appreciation to Senator \nBond. This is not a time to declare winners or losers. This is part of \nthe legislative process. Senator Bond is an experienced legislator. He \nis a former Governor. He knows the importance of the highway bill. I am \nconfident the resolution of this matter that we have worked out in the \nlast several hours will be good for the country and certainly will be \ngood for the 5,000 people who work at the Department of Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4717-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2004, PART II\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small \nBusiness Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2267 \nand that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2267) to amend section 29(k) of the Small \n     Business Act to establish funding priorities for women's \n     business centers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 2267, the ``Women's \nSustainability Recovery Act of 2004'' which I recently introduced. \nThere is today a critical need to preserve the operations of existing \nthe Women's Business Centers currently serving women entrepreneurs in \nalmost every State and territory. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senators Domenici, Chafee, Bond and others. Buy adopting this \nbill today, the Senate is signaling its intention to preserve much-\nneeded funding for the business centers currently in operation.\n  Todaay, more than 10.6 million women-owned small businesses are \nhelping to fuel our economic recovery: they employ over 19 million \nAmericans and contribute $2.46 trillion in revenues. In my home State \nof Maine, there are more than 63,000 women-owned firms, generating more \nthan $9 billion in sales. Numbers like these speak for themselves, \nclear evidence of the success of the Women's Business Centers Program, \nwhich helps women achieve their dreams of owning a small business, and \nother programs like it. As chair of the Small Business Committee, I am \ncommitted to a wide range of efforts designed to assist women business \nowners, so that they, in turn, can continue to make a significant \ncontribution to our economy.\n  The Women's Business Center program was introduced through the \nWomen's Business Ownership Act of 1988,and it was made permanent in \n1997. Congress has demonstrated its support for this program time and \ntime again; its appropriations have grown from $2 million in 1989 to \n$12.5 million in 2004, and the results of this investment have been \nimpressive. In fiscal year 2002, centers reported clients realized a \nreturn of $161 in gross receipts for every dollar invested in the \nprogram.\n  Even more remarkable is the fact that the SBA's Women's Business \nCenter have helped to create or retain almost 7,000 jobs in the United \nStates, a success attributable to the centers unique training and \ncounseling programs. In fiscal year 2003, the Women's Business Center \nprogram increased its expected level of delivered services by 17 \npercent, providing counseling and assistance to more than 106,600 \nclients and thereby exceeding its initial goal of 88,540 clients. To a \nlarge degree, this increased productivity has been triggered by the \nsuccess of sustainability grants, which extend funding to eligible \nwomen's business centers.\n  This year, insufficient funding for the sustainability grant program \nmay force 53 Women's Business Centers to close their doors. While \ncurrent legislation reserves 30.2 percent of the Women's Business \nCenter appropriation for the sustainability grant program, this amount \nis not enough to support the 53 centers in jeopardy. By supporting this \nbill, S. 2267, which increases the reserve forth sustainability grant \nprogram by 48 percent, Congress will ensure that each of the 53 Women's \nBusiness Centers eligible for sustainability has the opportunity to \ncompete for a sufficient pool of funding for fiscal year 2004, and that \ncenters will be able to effectively provide valuable technical \nassistance to women entrepreneurs.\n  Without this legislation, many of the center may be in jeopardy of \nclosing their doors. This would be a significant loss given that some \nof these centers have been part of the program for as long as 9 years \nand, during that time, have proven themselves powerful engines of \neconomic development in communities and States across the Nation.\n  These centers have been extraordinarily successful in providing \nassistance to women in all walks of life. Women who once received \npublic assistance are now operating businesses and creating jobs. Other \nwomen are transitioning from employee to small business employer, and \nestablished business owners are creating and manufacturing products for \nsale at home and abroad. The centers nurture women entrepreneurs \nthrough business and financial planning and assist women business \nowners who need help securing funding for startup and expansion. \nFurthermore, this legislation requires no additional appropriation, \njust a reallocation of current funds.\n  I am committed to resolving the women's sustainability funding crisis \nthrough this bill, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to \nensure the continued success of women-owned businesses.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator \nSnowe, chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, in passing legislation to safeguard Women's Business \nCenters funded through the Small Business Administration. This \nlegislation is identical to the Women's Business Center provision I \nintroduced as part of S. 2186, the SBA Emergency Authorization \nExtension Act of 2004, on March 9, 2004, and it fixes a funding gap \nthat exists for meritorious Women's Business Centers that are \ngraduating from the first stage of the program and entering the \nsustainability portion.\n  I would first like to thank Chair Snowe for working very closely with \nme on this issue, as we have for the past year and a half. Senator \nSnowe has long been an advocate of the Women's Business Centers and was \na cosponsor of the original legislation that created the sustainability \npilot program in 1999. Now, her support for continuing the nationwide \nnetwork of Women's Business Centers has been the catalyst for success \nin the Senate. I commend Chair Snowe for her strong leadership for \nwomen in business across this country. I would also like to thank all \nof the cosponsors of this legislation and of S. 2266, all of whom have \nshown resounding support for women entrepreneurs and recognize the \npositive impact the Women's Business Centers have on promoting and \nsupporting women in business and on strengthening our national economy.\n  Second, I want to comment on the Bush administration's proposals to \neliminate experienced, efficient, and effective Women's Business \nCenters in favor of new and untested centers. Unless this legislation \ncan be enacted quickly, the administration will move forward with its \nproposal, which places in jeopardy experienced Women's Business Centers \nin 39 States and eliminates assistance for thousands of women in \nbusiness. While, as this bill demonstrates, I support opening new \ncenters to help women entrepreneurs who do not currently have access to \nthis important assistance, this should\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nonly occur when the existing centers, whether in their initial or a \nlater funding period, are fully funded. Women entrepreneurs and their \nbusinesses are critically important to our economy and to U.S. job \ncreation, and Women's Business Centers help them succeed. Passing S. \n2267 today will send a strong message to the House of Representatives \nthat time is of the essence with respect to this important program, and \nI hope the House leadership will allow immediate passage of this \nmeasure when they are next in session.\n  I would also like to express my dismay that, despite bipartisan \nsupport from members of this committee, the Republican majority has \nopposed helping women entrepreneurs and blocked the provisions of this \nbill from being included in the two extensions of all SBA programs that \nhave already passed the Senate. Those who favor blocking enactment of \nthese provisions in hopes of closing the most experienced existing \nWomen's Business Centers are potentially depriving thousands of women \nin business access to much needed assistance. This bill is a bipartisan \ncompromise intended to maintain an effective Women's Business Center \nnetwork throughout this fiscal year--a compromise that was agreed to by \nChair Snowe, myself, and the bipartisan leadership of the House Small \nBusiness Committee. It is supported by women's groups across the \ncountry.\n  This legislation contains a small adjustment to the Women's Business \nCenter program that updates an outdated funding formula, without added \ncost to the Treasury. The adjustment changes the portion of funding \nallowed for Women's Business Centers in the sustainability part of the \nprogram to keep up with the increasing number of centers that will need \nfunding this fiscal year. Currently there are 88 Women's Business \nCenters. Of these, 35 are in the initial grant program and 53 will have \ngraduated to the sustainability part of the program in this funding \ncycle. These sustainability centers make up more than half of the total \nWomen's Business Centers, but under the current funding formula are \nonly allotted 30 percent of the funds. Without the change to 48 \npercent, all grants to sustainability centers could be cut in half--or \nworse, 23 experienced centers could lose funding completely. In short, \nthis change directs the SBA to reserve 48 percent of the appropriated \nfunds for the sustainability centers, instead of 30 percent, which will \nallow enough funding to keep open the most experienced centers, while \nstill permitting the establishment of new centers and protecting \nexisting ones. In the interest of compromise and prompt enactment of a \nworkable solution, I fully support the formula change to 48 percent, \nalthough a change to 54 percent--as introduced as part of my Women's \nBusiness Center Safeguard Act, S. 2266--would be needed to fully fund \nall sustainability centers.\n\n  I have serious concerns regarding an amendment to our original \nlegislation by the Republican leadership. The amendment would allow the \nSmall Business Administration to award grants at arbitrary and \ndisproportionate levels, instead of following precedent and awarding \nWomen's Business Center grants equally to all qualified and \nsuccessfully performing centers. I am deeply concerned that the \nadministration may use this authority to shortchange some existing \ncenters in order to use part of the 48 percent reserve funding to open \nnew centers. While this is within the language of the amendment, it is \nclearly the opposite of the legislation's intent, which is to increase \navailable funds for the most experienced Women's Business Centers so \nthat they remain in operation. To that end, it is my recommendation \nthat the administration use the full 48 percent for sustainability \ncenters and that the Agency award grants at equal, or close to equal, \namounts. The committee has been told that providing any sustainability \nWomen's Business Center with a grant less than the minimum grant \nawarded to sustainability centers in fiscal year 2003 would impede its \nability to operate effectively and successfully under the current \nrequirements established by the administration. I am willing to make \nthis compromise because it will give all Women's Business Centers the \nopportunity to receive funding; however, it is not intended to undercut \nthe funding to any center that has met the SBA's performance standards.\n  As the author of the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999, I can tell you that when the bill was signed into law, it was \nCongress's intent to protect the established and successful \ninfrastructure of worthy, performing centers. The law was designed to \nallow all graduating Women's Business Centers that meet certain \nperformance standards to receive continued funding under sustainability \ngrants. This approach allows for new centers to be established--but not \nby penalizing those that have already demonstrated their worth. It was \nour intention to continue helping the most productive and well-equipped \nWomen's Business Centers, knowing that demand for such services was \nrapidly growing.\n  Today, with women-owned businesses opening at one-and-a-half times \nthe rate of all privately held firms, the demand and need for Women's \nBusiness Centers is even greater. Until Congress makes permanent the \nWomen's Business Center Sustainability Pilot Program, as intended in \nthe Senate-passed legislation, an extension of authority and increase \nin the portion of appropriated funds available to sustainability \ncenters is vital--not only to the centers themselves, but to the \nwomen's business community and to the millions of workers employed by \nwomen-owned businesses round the country.\n  This bill is urgently needed now to continue the good work of the \nSBA's Women's Business Center network, and I urge all of my colleagues \nin the Senate and the House of Representatives to show their support \nfor the growing number of women in business by supporting immediate \npassage of this bill.\n\n\n                    women's business center program\n\n  Mr. President, as we pass our legislation, S. 2267, the Women's \nSustainability Recovery Act, I ask my colleague from Maine, the \nchairwoman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, \nhow the SBA is to implement these changes to the Women's Business \nCenter program? I know she has been a leader on this issue, and it is \nmy understanding that she encourages the SBA to fully support \nsustainability centers at a level that will enable them to operate \nsuccessfully, before opening new centers.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question. \nAs is evident in S. 1375, the bill to reauthorize the Small Business \nAdministration, which passed the Senate last September, it is the \nintention of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee and of \nthe full Senate to continue funding eligible Women's Business Centers \nbefore opening new centers. This legislation supports that important \nobjective. To that end, I expect the SBA to award Women's Business \nCenter grants for the coming fiscal year to each Women's Business \nCenter that is properly meeting performance standards. Congress has \nappropriated $12.5 million in fiscal year 2004 for the Women's Business \nCenter program. If the amount reserved for sustainability centers under \nthis legislation is insufficient to award the full amount of $125,000 \nto each sustainability center that meets those standards, I expect the \nSBA to adequately fund eligible centers.\n  Mr. KERRY. The committee has been told that many of the Women's \nBusiness Centers would be unable to meet minimum performance standards \nwith a significant reduction in grant funding. Does the chairwoman \nagree that the funding for the sustainability centers last fiscal year \nwould be an appropriate funding level for sustainability centers this \nyear?\n  Ms. SNOWE. To ensure that each center that meets the SBA performance \nthresholds continues to serve women entrepreneurs in every state and \nterritory, I expect the SBA to fully expend all the funds reserved \nunder this bill for women's sustainability grants. This amount should \nbe sufficient to provide funding to eligible women's business centers \nin the sustainability program at or above the minimum grants awarded in \nfiscal year 2003 to women's business centers.\n  Mr. KERRY. I commend Chairwoman Snowe for her persistent efforts on \nbehalf of this legislation and the more comprehensive SBA \nReauthorization legislation. Without her strong support and hard work \non this issue, the future success of this important assistance for \nwomen entrepreneurs would be in jeopardy.\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 347) to commend the Senate Enrolling \n     Clerk Thomas J. Lundregan on Thirty-Six Years of Service to \n     the United States Government.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. ``Reserved, low key, self-deprecating, totally \nprofessional, and devoted to the Senate,'' that is how assistant \nenrolling clerk Joe Monahan describes his colleague Tom Lundregan, who \nretires tomorrow from his post as the Senate's enrolling clerk.\n  For 15 years in the Office of the Secretary, Tom has had the crucial \ntask of ensuring that the written copy of the legislation we pass in \nthis body is thoroughly accurate before it is sent on to the House and \nto the President. As Tom explains, ``We cannot make mistakes. The final \npaper that is sent to the White House is being signed by the President \nand is going to become the law of the land.'' He says the \nresponsibility can be ``a little scary.''\n  Despite the stress, Tom has maintained an impeccable record and \nearned the admiration of all of his colleagues. Not once on his watch \nhas a piece of legislation been sent back from the House or from the \nPresident because of an error.\n  Through work weeks that have stretched up to 90 hours, sometimes even \n50 hours straight, Tom has shown total focus, dedication and commitment \nto the integrity of this institution.\n  Says his colleague Joe, ``There are darn few people who can do \nthat.'' He is right. The Senate has been incredibly fortunate to have \nsuch a meticulous and hard working member of the team.\n  Tom says his most vivid memory of working in the Senate is 9/11, and \nrealizing that a plane was heading this way. September 11 reinforced \nhis idea of the importance of every Senate job, from clerks to staff to \nelected officials. ``This is the finest institution in the world that \nrepresents democracy to everyone in the world. To have an opportunity \nto work in this building has been a tremendous honor.''\n  Tom and his wife plan to spend their retirement years where it is \nwarm all year round. They hope to travel throughout the States, \nstarting this spring with Yosemite, Lake Tahoe and the Grand Canyon. \nTom also anticipates after 15 years of grueling and unpredictable hours \nfinally being able to spend quantity time with his four grandsons.\n  I thank Tom for his extraordinary service to the Senate and to the \nAmerican people. I wish him safe travels and all the best in his well-\nearned retirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a couple of \nminutes because I want to thank a man who is a fixture in this \ninstitution.\n  Tom Lundregan is the Senate's enrolling clerk and as fine a public \nservant as you will find anywhere. Today marks his last day in the \nSenate, and I know that I speak for all of us when I say we are going \nto miss him.\n  Tom began his Government service 36 years ago as a printing \napprentice with the Government Printing Office.\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\n  Over the next 21 years, he was detailed a number of times to both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  Fifteen years ago, the Senate was fortunate enough to convince Tom to \njoin us full-time, as member of the Office of the Senate Enrolling \nClerk. Since 1995, he has headed that office and served this \ninstitution with great distinction.\n  ``Enrolling clerk'' is one of those curious Senate titles that even \ndevoted C-SPAN watchers might have a hard time defining.\n  It is the enrolling clerk's responsibility to proofread and prepare \nfor printing every page of legislation the Senate passes, and then \ntransmit those pages to the House of Representatives, the National \nArchives, the Secretary of State, the United States Claims Court, and \nthe White House.\n  It is also the enrolling clerk who transmits Senate messages to the \nHouse, and arranges for the delivery of all Senate-enrolled bills and \nresolutions to the White House.\n  The job demands diligence, intelligence, enormous attention to detail \nand often incredibly long hours.\n  When legislation needs to be moved quickly to the House, or prepared \nfor preconferencing, the enrolling clerk and his staff work until the \njob is done.\n  I know that, many times, Tom has had only enough time to go home and \ntake a shower before coming right back to face another workday. He and \nhis staff have also worked through weekends, recesses, and holidays, \nand they have done so without a word of complaint.\n  As enrolling clerk, Tom worked closely with the Secretary of the \nSenate and the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office to establish \npolicies regarding the proper form and language of legislation.\n  He also worked with the Legislative Counsel's Office to develop \nsoftware that will soon allow the enrolling clerks and legislative \ncounsel offices to share data electronically. These projects--and \nothers--will ensure that Tom's influence will continue to be felt in \nthe Senate for years to come.\n  As some know, Tom was actually scheduled to retire 16 months ago but \nhe stayed on to help train his successor and ensure a smooth \ntransition. That's how committed he is to this Senate.\n  More than once in these last 16 months, Tom has reminded his \nsuccessor, ``We need to be 100 percent right, not just 99.9 percent.'' \nIn 36 years of service to the people of the United States, Tom \nLundregan has held himself to that same high standard. With Tom, there \nis no such thing as ``good enough for government work.''\n  We could not have a Government ``of the people, by the people and for \nthe people'' without the extraordinary devotion and skill of people \nsuch as Tom. He is a public servant in the best sense of that term and \nan important and valued member of our Senate family.\n  Today, on the occasion of Tom's well-deserved retirement, I joint the \nrest of the Senate family in thanking Tom. I also want to thank Tom's \nwife Yanjie Xu for sharing her husband with the Senate at least 16 \nmonths longer than she had planned.\n  We wish them well as they finally begin those travels they have \nlooked forward to for so long, and we want them to know that they take \nwith them the thanks, admiration, and best wishes of the entire Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also like to spread across the \nRecord of the Senate our congratulations and appreciation for the work \nthat Tom has contributed to this institution. Especially late in the \nsession, when we are at home, he and the other enrolling clerk are \nworking long, long hours after we have left, long after we have left, \nvery tedious, very difficult, but a very important job to make sure the \nwork we do here winds up in the final record--in the law books, in \neffect--the way it is supposed to be. It is an art that has been \ndeveloped over these many years, and we are very appreciative of all \nthat Tom Lundregan has done for not only the Senate but the country.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 347) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 347\n\n       Whereas in 1967, Thomas J. Lundregan became an employee of \n     the Government Printing Office, and since then has devoted \n     his career to the service of the United States Government;\n       Whereas in 1989, Thomas J. Lundregan joined the Office of \n     the Enrolling Clerk in the Office of the Secretary of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas in 1995, Thomas J. Lundregan became the Enrolling \n     Clerk of the Senate and has always performed the duties of \n     that office with great dedication, perseverance, and humor;\n       Whereas Thomas J. Lundregan has performed a critical role \n     in ensuring the technical accuracy and legal sufficiency of \n     legislation passed by the Senate;\n       Whereas Thomas J.

Lundregan has faithfully discharged the \n     difficult duties and responsibilities of Enrolling Clerk of \n     the United States Senate with great pride, energy, \n     efficiency, dedication, integrity, and professionalism;\n       Whereas Thomas J. Lundregan has earned the respect, \n     affection, and esteem of his colleagues and the United States \n     Senate;\n       Whereas Thomas J. Lundregan has for 36 years ably and \n     faithfully upheld the high standards and traditions of \n     service to the United States Government; and\n       Whereas Thomas J. Lundregan will retire from the United \n     States Senate on April 30, 2004, with 36 years of Service to \n     the United States Government and 15 years Service to the \n     United States Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends Thomas J. \n     Lundregan for his exemplary service to the United States \n     Senate and the Nation, and wishes to express its deep \n     appreciation and gratitude for his long, faithful, and \n     outstanding service, and extends its very best wishes upon \n     his retirement.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Thomas J.

There will be no rollcall votes \non Monday, but Senators are encouraged to come to the floor to offer \nand debate their amendments. Any rollcall votes ordered on Monday will \nbe set aside to occur on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, we began this week 4 days ago with the objective of \ntaking up the Internet bill and, indeed, several hours ago passed a 4-\nyear extension of an expired moratorium with protection of DSL and \nprotection of broadband. In this bill, we address voice over Internet \nprotocol. Also in the bill we reserve the right of States to collect \nthe traditional telecom taxes.\n  It was a long 4 days in order to accomplish this end, but it really \ntook a lot of work from both sides of the aisle. There were a number of \nour colleagues who participated. I will mention a few, recognizing that \nthere are many that I leave out. We tried once before to bring this \nbill to the floor and had to come back to it, but we were successful \nthis time under Senator McCain's tremendous leadership. I will mention \nSenators Allen, Wyden, Lott, Alexander, Voinovich, Enzi, Feinstein, \nDorgan, Sununu, and Stevens, and the list goes on.\n  I appreciate the manner in which everyone handled this bill and \nallowed for the issues to come forward.

Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence for a few \nminutes to say a few quick words about a fellow Alaskan.\n  It will come as no surprise to anyone in this body that I have \nexpressed some concerns about the feasibility of implementing the No \nChild Left Behind legislation in the remote villages of rural Alaska. \nDescendants of the first peoples of Alaska, Eskimos, Indians and \nAleuts, make up most of the inhabitants of these villages.\n  Last year, I brought Secretary Paige to rural Alaska so that he could \nfully comprehend the challenges of educating children in the villages. \nIt is clear to me, and I believe it became clear to the Secretary, that \nour national education policy must be informed by the experiences of \nparents, teachers, and school administrators on the ground if it is to \nbe effective. The Secretary must not only know what is going on in the \nclassrooms of our largest cities but also in the farthest corners of \nour Nation. When it comes to educating our children, one size does not \nfit all, and nobody knows this better than an experienced classroom \nteacher.\n  I was pleased to learn that President Bush has selected an exemplary \nAlaska classroom teacher to work with Secretary Paige in the \nimprovement of educational opportunities for American Indian and Alaska \nnative students. I am speaking of Carol Lee Gho, of Fairbanks, AK, who \nwill soon join the National Advisory Council on Indian Education.\n  Carol was raised in the rural Alaska villages of Lake Minchumina and \nManley Hot Springs. Her mother was Inupiaq Eskimo from the village of \nWainwright. After graduating from Brigham Young University with a major \nin mathematics, she began her teaching career at the junior high school \nlevel in California, Utah and Arizona.\n  In 1984, 11 years after leaving the classroom to raise a family, \nCarol resumed her teaching duties in the Fairbanks North Star Borough \nSchool District. She taught in the Fairbanks district continuously \nuntil her retirement in June 2003.\n  Carol loved teaching and she is fondly remembered for her work as a \nmath teacher at Lathrop High School. However, she also takes great \npride in the 3 years she taught at Howard Luke Academy, an alternative \nhigh school. During those 3 years, the performance of her students in \nmathematics improved dramatically.\n  Carol has been actively involved with the Association of Interior \nNative Educators. She served on their Board of Directors for over 7 \nyears and was President from 1999 until 2002. She has also been a \nleader of the Fairbanks Native Association and has served as an advisor \nto the Alaska Department of Education.\n  Carol dreamed that after retirement she would have an opportunity to \nfocus more of her attention on making classroom curriculum relevant to \nNative students. I am gratified that the President has made it possible \nfor Carol to fulfill this desire. As a member of the National Advisory \nCouncil on Indian Education, Carol will have an opportunity to \ninfluence the quality of education enjoyed by American Indian and \nAlaska Native students for generations to come.\n  I wish Carol great success in her new role and look forward to \nworking closely with her on matters of education policy in the coming \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/29/senate-section/article/S4723-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 3, 2004 AT 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
