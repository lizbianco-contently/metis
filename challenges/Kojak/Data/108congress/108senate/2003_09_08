The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Wyoming is absolutely \ncorrect. We will not agree to setting aside any amendments. As I \nannounced last week, we on this side want to move this bill. Last \nTuesday, when we started after the August break, we said we would like \nto have a day where we could have a vote on overtime. We said last \nTuesday we thought the best time would be Tuesday, a week from that \nday. We spoke to the majority leader. Of course, we spoke to Senator \nSpecter on many occasions about that. We do not want anyone to think we \nare scheduling the Senate's business around four Democratic Senators \nwho are running for President. Since the Presidential process started, \nwe never asked any special favors. We thought we were doing everyone a \nfavor here by telling--in fact, telegramming them--when we thought that \nvote should take place.\n  It is possible there can be an effort made to table the Harkin \namendment on overtime. This is an important piece of legislation. This \none appropriations bill is, I think, about $30-odd billion. It deals \nwith issues of extreme importance.\n  We want to move this legislation. But also for the men and women of \nthis country, we feel it is so important to have an up-or-down vote on \novertime. The President has made a decision that he wants to change the \nway overtime is paid to the men and women in this country. It is only \nthe American way that we would simply have a vote as to whether or not \nthe President is right.\n  We believe people of good will will vote with us. It is clear the \nreason we have suddenly not been able to have a vote is because the \nmajority leader recognizes they will lose and we will win, but that \nshouldn't be a cause to bring down a whole bill. But in fairness, we \nbelieve we should have a vote on this issue.\n\n  I am only speaking for myself. It is hard for me personally to \ncomprehend. These bills go to conference. There will be a conference \nwith the House. Of course, if we don't like what comes out\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nof conference, we will see what happens.\n  But this is a very important bill. I think people will have to look \nvery closely at what they want to do once this bill comes out of \nconference.\n  I understand why they are not allowing us to vote on that. It is \nsimply because they don't have the votes. But you can't win everything \naround here. We are entitled to win once in a while. Don't simply take \naway our ability to vote. That, in effect, is what is happening. It is \nreally too bad. I hope when the conference is held with Republican \nSenators, they will see that.\n  We should be able to vote tomorrow. We contemplated finishing this \nbill tomorrow, Tuesday. That is what we had contemplated. We have a lot \nof amendments. The managers could agree to some of those. Some of them \nsimply won't come up. Of course, one of the reasons there are a lot of \namendments by both sides, if they offer them, is in effect to protect \ntheir sides in case something comes up they don't understand.\n  I believed we could finish this bill tomorrow. Having gotten nothing \ndone on Friday, and now nothing today, it is really too bad. I don't \nbelieve we will be able to finish the bill on Tuesday.\n  Senator Domenici and I have worked on the Energy and water bill for \nmany years. We have a good idea how quickly that bill will move along. \nIt is certainly not as big dollarwise as this bill, but it is $25-plus \nbillion. It deals with issues that are important. The difference \nbetween our bill and the Labor-HHS bill is that all of the money we \nhave in our bill is discretionary spending.\n  I hope we can get to that, move along and get the appropriations \nbills done. I hope we don't have a situation where we have nine bills \nin an omnibus bill. We tried that. It wasn't the best way to go. We had \n11 bills in the omnibus bill. We have nine bills we still have to \napprove.\n  I am disappointed the majority leader has taken this tack. I hope \nafter meeting with colleagues this evening there will be a change.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, speaking purely on my own behalf but \nhopefully reflecting some of the feelings of the leader, we are \nterribly disappointed that until the time is set exactly as the time \nthe Presidential candidates want to have the vote, no other business \ncan happen in this Chamber. That isn't how this ought to work. We ought \nto be proceeding on other amendments. We ought to be wrapping this \nthing up and getting down to what evidently could be the last vote. It \nneeds to happen.\n  I am terribly disappointed the overtime rule has been made into such \na political hot issue. It is a proposed rule. The way rules work around \nhere is they get published so there can be comments. There have been \n80,000 comments. This amendment doesn't stop the rule. At this point, \nit stops the review of those comments. The Secretary of Labor can't \neven look at the 80,000 comments to see if she made a mistake in the \nrule.\n  It appears there are some concerns about the rule and the way it is \nwritten. But it can't even be rewritten, if this amendment passes. This \namendment takes away the right of the Secretary to review those 80,000 \ncomments so changes can be made, if needed, to the rule. That is how we \ndo rules around here.\n  To take the money away and stop that process I don't think is the \nright way to do it. We have a process in place. We even have a process \nfor overcoming the process. That is the Congressional Review Act. If \nthe Secretary does not pay the attention needed to it, we have the \nright to overturn the rule. In fact, we have the obligation to overturn \nrules. That is why we did a Congressional Review Act.\n  I hope we will let her go ahead and read the 80,000 concerns and see \nwhat changes need to be made, see what people are thinking about the \nrule. Obviously, there are people with concerns. I hope the rule can be \nrevised to take care of those concerns. It has not been revised in 50 \nyears. Tell me that business has not changed in 50 years. Tell me that \nemployment has not changed in 50 years. It has.\n  One of the provisions of this is raising the amount you have to be \ncovered by overtime from $8,600 to $22,000. That needs to be done. \nPeople make a lot more money now than in 1950.\n  I hope we can go ahead with the rule. I hope we can go ahead with \nother amendments as we have been doing for the last week, setting aside \namendments so we can debate amendments. All the amendments are still in \na queue and we still have to take care of those amendments. It does not \nkeep them from being voted on but keeps them just from being voted on \nin that necessary order, although you can call for regular order and \nput it right back in the queue in the same place. It is possible to get \nvotes. In fact, it is impossible to avoid votes around here.\n  As stated, if there were a motion to table, it could be brought up \nagain. There will be a vote. Now, whether the leader gets to set the \nexact time for the vote or whether the minority sets the exact time for \nthe vote evidently is the question for debate. I hope we can get past \nthis little rift and move on and cover some more amendments. I was \nhoping we could have some votes today so tomorrow we could finish up. \nIf we were going to finish anyway tomorrow, we could finish early \ntomorrow so we could move on to the other bills. I hope that wedge will \nnot remain in there and we can make some progress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Chair wants to report the bill, \nbut let me say we did not want an exact time. We put something in the \nproposed unanimous consent agreement. We just said Tuesday. We thought \nit would be better to do it after the party conferences. Anytime \nTuesday would be fine with us.\n  I certainly understand the Congressional Review Act. Senator Nickles \nand I wrote that. That is our legislation now in the law. It has been \npassed and used several times, and it will be used this week, also, on \nthe TV ownership. It is an important piece of legislation and one of \nthe things I am very proud I have been able to work on during my tenure \nas a Member of Congress.\n  I say to my friend, for whom I have the greatest respect, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, we have worked together on a number of issues on a \nbipartisan basis. We recognize overtime has been paid by virtue of a \nstatute in this country for more than 50 years. We think that is \nappropriate.\n  If the President wants to change this, he should change it by asking \nthe committees of Congress to do that. We could have hearings and go \nforward on that basis. To have the President act as if he is the king \nof this country and just set rules any way he wants, we do not agree \nwith that. That is why the men and women of this country are really \nupset and why we had 80,000 comments.\n  The Senator from Wyoming and I are not going to make that decision. \nWe are not in a position to do that. We are here representing others. I \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Wyoming this afternoon, as \nalways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/08/senate-section/article/S11174-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, America, of course, is the land of \nopportunity. Americans know that if we are willing to work hard, we can \nrealize our dreams.\n  Hard work has built America. Hard work is what has enabled \ngenerations of us to own a home, make a stronger community, and give \nour children a good education.\n  Americans have always been willing to work hard to reach their goals, \nand they are working longer hours today than ever before. About one-\nthird of the labor force regularly works longer than a 40-hour week, \nand 20 percent work longer than 50 hours.\n  Fifty years ago, we established the principle of overtime pay which \ncame as a result of passing the Fair Labor Standards Act. Basically, \none of the provisions of that act was the establishment of overtime pay \nrules, and it was for those who work more than 40 hours a week. This \nprinciple recognized that the normal workweek would be five 8-hour \ndays. This principle recognized the value of hard work and rewarded \nthose who worked the hardest.\n  Families who work hard depend upon overtime pay. For the families who \nearn overtime, it makes up one-fourth of their total salary.\n  Having said all this, I can't understand, as I indicated earlier \ntoday, why the President is proposing to change the rules on overtime \npay. What this legislation we would like a vote on does is prevent the \nPresident from changing the rules as to the number of people who are on \novertime; that is, he cannot lower the number of people on overtime. \nThe rules could increase the number but he could not lower the number. \nThat is simply what the amendment does.\n  The President's proposal would eliminate overtime wages for 8 million \nworkers, among whom would be nurses, firefighters, police officers, \nflight attendants, preschool teachers, cooks, secretaries, and fast \nfood shift managers.\n  The proposal would amount to a pay cut for those hard-working people \nand others. It would mean fewer jobs because companies would simply \nforce their employees to work longer hours without paying overtime \ninstead of hiring new workers. In the current economic situation, when \nmillions of Americans are out of work, it doesn't make sense to do \nsomething that will stifle the creation of new jobs.\n  Even for the workers who would still qualify for overtime, this is a \nbad rule. Why? Because big companies will just force the overtime-\nexempt workers to put in longer hours and cut the hours of those who \nqualify for overtime.\n  The rule is bad for so many reasons. It punishes working families by \ncutting their pay, it prevents the creation of new jobs, and I think it \ndishonors hard work, which is one of the things that made America \ngreat.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are presently on the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill which is the funding \nbill for next year for all three of those Departments plus others--NIH, \nfor basic medical research, and for a number of other independent type \nagencies, libraries, and things such as that.\n  Perhaps the biggest part of this bill in terms of where we ought to \nfocus our energies and our attention is in the area of education. We \nknow that without a good education, our hopes for the future of this \ncountry are much dimmer if we do not provide a class 1, world class \neducation for all of our kids. Our future will be bleak indeed if in \nfact we start leaving some kids behind.\n  Thus, when the President talked a couple years ago about his proposal \nto leave no child behind, that sounded like something we could support \nand move ahead on because we do not want to, nor can we afford to, \nleave any children behind.\n  Now that we are here this week after Labor Day, it is back to school \ntime. Back to school time means one thing: More claims from President \nBush that he is serious about leaving no child behind.\n  When the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act nearly 2 years \nago, he promised to give schools the money they need to improve. He \nsaid:\n\n       We are going to spend more money, more resources, but they \n     will be directed at methods that work.\n\n  Most people probably believed him. I know I did. There were long \nnegotiations. I also serve on the authorizing committee that worked out \nthe agreements with the White House on the No Child Left Behind Act. \nOne of the major reasons I voted for it was that I trusted the \nPresident. I took him at his word that in fact we were going to have \nthe resources.\n  In the No Child Left Behind Act, we made a major departure from what \nwe had been doing in the past in terms of Federal funding for \nelementary and secondary education. This was the biggest mandate ever \nput upon local public schools by the Federal Government. The biggest \nmandate ever put on our local public schools by the Federal Government \nwas Leave No Child Behind.\n  So I believed then, and I believe now, that if we are going to \nmandate certain performance levels for our schools, and we are going to \npenalize these schools for failing to make adequate yearly progress--if \nwe are going to do that--then we must, by all rights, give them the \nmoney they need to meet these mandates and to improve.\n  President Bush seemed to agree. We took him at his word. But ever \nsince he signed that law, the President's record on education has been \nlong on spin and woefully short on spending. Saturday was a \ncharacteristic example of what I am talking about. The President used \nhis radio address on Saturday to boast about how much funding he has \nprovided for schools since he became President. He said--and again I \nquote; this is an exact quote from his radio address on Saturday--\n\n       My budget for next year boosts education funding to $53.1 \n     billion, an increase of nearly $11 billion since I took \n     office.\n\n  Keep these figures in mind: $53.1 billion, his budget for next year; \nand he says: ``an increase of . . . $11 billion since I took office.''\n  Well, first, the statement is factually correct. The education budget \nhas increased $11 billion during the Bush administration. And it is \nfactually correct that next year's budget does call for $53.1 billion. \nBut let's take a look at those two. The $11 billion increase during his \nadministration has taken place, but no thanks to President Bush. The \nbudgets increased $11 billion because Democrats in Congress insisted on \nit over the White House's strong objections. It is like I was saying \nlast week about the weather, it has rained a lot around here during \nPresident Bush's administration, sometimes it has been hot during his \nadministration,\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\nsometimes it has even snowed during his administration, but his \nadministration did not actually have anything to do with the weather.\n  The same thing with education funding: President Bush deserves as \nmuch credit for the recent education funding increases as he does for \nthe weather outside. This chart will explain what I mean.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the last budget of the Clinton administration, \neducation funding was at $42.2 billion. The next year, President Bush's \nfirst year, in his budget he asked for an increase to $44.5 billion. \nThat would be about an increase of $2.3 billion.\n  Now, at the end of the day, at the end of the year, the actual \nfunding went up to $49.9 billion. Why? Did President Bush come down \nhere and ask for more money? No. Education got up to $49.9 billion \nbecause we Democrats insisted on it during the negotiations for the No \nChild Left Behind Act. We said, if you are going to have these \nmandates, let's get the money in there. And since the President wanted \nto get votes for his bill, he agreed. But he never asked for it. We \ninsisted on it. So the next year we went up to $49.9 billion.\n  Now, the next year, President Bush asked for $50.3 billion. That was \nan increase of only $400 million from the previous year, seven-tenths \nof 1 percent. That is what he asked for. That is all he asked for. \nAgain, we got it up to $53.1 billion. Again, why? Because Democrats \ninsisted on it. We fought for it hard. We fought for it on the floor of \nthe Senate, and we got it up to $53.1 billion.\n  Now, the real kicker is this: In his radio address, the President \nsaid:\n\n       My budget for next year boosts--\n\n--``boosts,'' ``boosts''--\n\n     education funding to $53.1 billion. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we are already at $53.1 billion. You have asked for \n$53.1 billion for next year. That is not a boost. That is the same as \nwe spent last year.\n  Well, actually I want to be factually correct. His budget would \nincrease funding by $26 million, .05 percent over last year. It is such \na minuscule amount it does not even show up on a chart.\n  As I said before, it is true education spending has risen $11 billion \nduring the Bush administration, but President Bush has only asked for \n$2.7 billion of that $11 billion. All the rest resulted from Democrats \nhere in Congress pushing for and fighting for increased education \nfunding. So I wanted to make that record clear.\n  Now, what is more, the President is trying to take credit for these \neducation increases at the very same time the White House, this \nPresident, is working to defeat Senator Byrd's amendment, one of the \npending amendments on this bill, that would fully fund title I at the \nfiscal year 2004 authorized level. The title I program is the key to \nthe success of No Child Left Behind because title I helps the students \nwho need the help the most, the millions who are now being left \nbehind--low-income, poor kids, kids from low-income areas. It is the \nprogram also, under the No Child Left Behind Act, that will hold \nschools accountable for improving student performance. So title I is a \nprogram that has been in existence for a long time, and it funnels \nFederal funding to those most in need, the kids who are now being left \nbehind.\n  In the No Child Left Behind Act we put in there the mandates that \nwill hold schools accountable, that will penalize schools if they do \nnot improve student performance.\n  President Bush and Members of Congress spent a lot of time \nnegotiating over how much money was needed year by year for title I. \nThis was part of the negotiations process when we passed No Child Left \nBehind. What we settled on was a figure of $18.5 billion for fiscal \nyear 2004. That is the second year after the law went into effect. That \nis the authorized level.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us provides $12.35 billion for title \nI. That is the amount requested by President Bush. Again, some on the \nother side want to play games with the numbers. They argue title I \nfunding has risen by $2.9 billion during President Bush's \nadministration, again, as if the President deserves the credit for it. \nThe fact is, President Bush requested only $1.3 billion of the $2.9 \nbillion title I has increased between 2001 and 2003. Again, the only \nreason title I increased more than he asked for was we Democrats here \nin Congress insisted on it.\n  Again, this chart shows the story. In fiscal year 2001, title I got \n$8.8 billion. In fiscal year 2002, the President requested a minuscule \nincrease of just $300 million to $9.1 billion. The authorized level was \n$13.5 billion. Again, we Democrats in Congress fought hard, and we got \nit up to $10.35 billion.\n  Some on the other side have said, well, the Democrats ran the Senate \nfor fiscal year 2002, and they didn't fund title I at the authorized \nlevel. Well, that is true, but remember, we only controlled the Senate, \nwe did not control the House, and we did not control the White House \nlike the Republicans do now, and we managed to get more for title I \nthan the President requested.\n  In fiscal year 2003, the year we are in right now, the President \nrequested $11.35 billion for title I, when the authorization level had \nrisen to $16 billion. Again, thanks to Democratic pressure here in \nCongress, we got it up to $11.7 billion.\n  Now for fiscal year 2004, the President has requested $12.35 billion, \n$6 billion short of the authorized level of $18.5 billion.\n  People have said: That is the authorized level. We hardly ever fund \nto the authorized level.\n  In most cases that is true. But in this case, we have a different \nsituation. We have mandates. Schools, you have to do this, this, this. \nYou have to meet annual yearly progress of this, this, and this. We \nhave now mandated it. We never did before. And, in the negotiations on \nNo Child Left Behind, we agreed on these figures: $13.5 billion for \n2002, 16 for 2003, and 18.5 for 2004, and so on. So this is not just \nlike something else. This is the biggest Federal mandate ever on our \npublic schools.\n  The biggest part of No Child Left Behind is title I, and the \nPresident has shortchanged it by over $6 billion this next year. I \nthink we need to help President Bush keep the promise he made when he \nsigned the No Child Left Behind Act by approving Senator Byrd's \namendment. The Byrd amendment, more than any other, will show the \nNation how serious we are about leaving no child behind. Do we give the \nschools the money they need to improve? Or do we just give them a bunch \nof mandates and hang them out to dry? That is what is at stake with the \nByrd amendment.\n  I emphasize, the Byrd amendment is not just about dollars. If you \nwant to hire good teachers, it takes money. If you want to reduce class \nsizes so teachers can teach, it takes money. This Byrd amendment would \nprovide enough funding to hire more than 100,000 highly qualified \nteachers for the students who are at most risk of being left behind. \nThat means over 2 million disadvantaged students would be taught in \nsmaller classes. They would receive the full range of instructional \nservices called for under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  In his radio address on Saturday, the President said:\n\n       Schools are getting the Federal resources and help they \n     need to improve.\n\n  I am sorry, Mr. President. That is factually incorrect. They are not \ngetting the Federal resources. They are not getting what you promised 2 \nyears ago when you signed this bill into law. So I say let's help the \nPresident keep his promise. I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd \namendment when it comes up for a vote. All we are asking for is $6.2 \nbillion to get it up to the authorized level.\n  The President says he doesn't have the money for that. We have this \nhuge deficit. We don't have the money to get out to these schools to \nfully fund this. We don't have the money.\n  Last night when I turned on my television set to watch the President \naddress the country, he said he is going to send up a supplemental \nappropriations request for $87 billion for reconstruction in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--mostly Iraq. We had an earlier bill this year that was $79 \nbillion, of which $70 billion was for Iraq and Afghanistan. So 70 and \nnow 87; in the space of 6 months this President has asked us to take \ntaxpayers' dollars and put $157 billion into Iraq and Afghanistan. And \nwe don't have $6 billion to leave no child behind, the poorest kids in \nthe poorest areas, the low-income areas. We don't have it. Somehow we \ndon't have that.\n  Mr. Bremer is talking about rebuilding schools in Iraq. They are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\nrebuild schools or build schools. I don't think we bombed schools in \nIraq. Maybe we are going to build new schools. I don't know. What about \nthe schools here in America? What about our kids here who are being \nleft behind?\n\n  One hundred fifty-seven billion dollars? At the beginning of the Iraq \nwar, the Department of Defense estimated we were going to be spending \nabout $2.2 billion a month after the war. In June, that went to $3 \nbillion. As of July, they said they were spending about $3.9 billion a \nmonth in Iraq, and another $1 billion in Afghanistan. Well, if I am not \nmistaken, there are 12 months in a year. If we assume that is the end \nof it for the whole year, 12 months, $87 billion, it seems to me that \ncomes down to more than $7 billion a month. And they told us earlier it \nwas going to be $2.2 billion for Iraq, and going down quickly. And now \nit is up to $6 billion in Iraq and $1 billion in Afghanistan, if we \nassume they are not going to ask for any more. And I would not make \nthat assumption. So in 1 year, $7 billion a month for Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  In February, the administration said Iraq's oil reserves would help \nshoulder much of the burden for its own reconstruction. Mr. Wolfowitz \nsaid on April 6:\n\n       There are enormous resources available from other sources \n     than just the American taxpayer to help the Iraqi people in \n     reconstructing their country. And the oil revenues of Iraq \n     now for the first time in decades will be dedicated to the \n     welfare of the Iraqi people.\n\n  Well, it sure looks like the American taxpayer is footing the bill to \nme. I don't know when those oil drills are going to start coming back \nagain and when we are going to start making money off that. Right now \nit is the American taxpayer.\n  My point is, for Iraq and Afghanistan they have asked for $157 \nbillion in 6 months. Yet we can't fund title I. That doesn't make sense \nto me at all. We should have--we do have the resources. Quite frankly, \nif we don't meet those needs and if we don't fund No Child Left Behind, \nthen obviously children are going to be left behind. And they are going \nto be the kids of the poorest, low income, because their schools will \nnot meet the annual yearly progress reports, the mandates that are out \nthere. We are going to lose teachers because schools won't be able to \npay them what they are worth. Yet we are going to ask the American \ntaxpayer to keep coughing up money for this quagmire that we are in now \nin Iraq.\n  A lot of people have said: This isn't Vietnam.\n  I am one of those who lived through Vietnam. I was in the military \nduring the Vietnam war. This may not be Vietnam, but, boy, it sure \nsmells like it. Every time I see these bills coming down for the money, \nit is costing like Vietnam, too. No one wants this country to be \nvulnerable to terrorists. We want to take all reasonable diligent steps \nthat may be necessary to protect the American people. That is the duty \nof the Commander in Chief. But the Commander in Chief, being an elected \nperson, also has to be accountable for how he has gone about ensuring \nthe security of the American people. At what cost? At what impact on \nour society?\n\n  So the President has to be held accountable for this. I don't pretend \nto have all the answers for what ought to be done in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, but I do know something--that if we as a nation decide to \ngo it alone in the world in anything--but especially in the war on \nterrorism--if we decide to go at it alone, in our way and only in our \nway, without the concurrence of and the help and support of our allies, \nold and new, and of our friends in democratic countries around the \nworld, then I think that two things will happen. One, we will not \naddress the scourge of terrorism as fully and all-encompassing away as \nit needs to be done--globally--because we are going to need the help of \nother countries in finding terrorists, locating them, breaking up their \ncells, giving you advance warning and giving themselves advance \nwarning. That will be the first. We will do it in a military rifle-\nshot-type of manner. You may accomplish something for a little bit but \nthat doesn't wipe out the terrorist network or the nests. That is the \nfirst result of our going it alone. The second result is what is quite \nobvious right now--the American taxpayer will foot the bill for \neverything.\n  Those are the two things I see happening right now in the world. So I \nthink it is time to have an accounting.\n  Quite frankly, I think it is time we begin to reach out to other \nnations--our friends and our allies--to enlist their aid and support, \nand to vow that never again are we going to go marching off with just \nthe word of the President of the United States. The threat of terrorism \nis not just at us; it is at people all over the world. It is not just \nup to our President--any President--to decide when and how to go after \nthese terrorists. It is up to us globally. It is up to the United \nNations. It is up to NATO, our allies and us working together to decide \nhow and when to go after these terrorists.\n  I say this because in this bill now there is a shortage of funding \nfor education, for health care, for medical research. We are even \nshortchanging the National Institutes of Health on medical research. I \nthink Senator Specter will have an amendment later on that, which I \nwill support. But we are told we simply don't have the funds. But we do \nhave $157 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, it is all a matter of \npriorities. I think we have to get our priorities back in order.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BURNS). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have heard my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, talk about the funding on Iraq and the war on \nterrorism, and I agree with him about the desirability of involving \nother nations. I believe the President is trying to do just that right \nnow at the United Nations.\n  The decision to authorize the use of force was a tough decision back \non October 11 of last year. The vote was 77 to 23. I don't want to, if \navoidable, get into an extensive discussion about members of the \nDemocratic Party who supported that authorization but they were \nconsiderable. It was a very substantial vote, with more than three-\nfourths of the Senate voting in favor of the use of force. I supported \nthe use of force and the objective of deposing an authoritarian \ndictator who had committed brutal acts against humanity, murdering tens \nof thousands, really hundreds of thousands, of his own people.\n\n  Saddam Hussein conclusively had weapons of mass destruction in \nDecember of 1998, and there was never an explanation as to what he did \nwith them. He had chemical weapons. He used them in the Iran-Iraq war. \nHe used chemical weapons against the Kurds. He had bioterrorism. Now \nthere are efforts to establish a democracy in Iraq and it is very \ndifficult, admittedly, to secure law and order and maintain the peace \nthere. The President is reaching out to other countries with the U.N. \nresolution, and I think the prospects are good that there will be a \nresolution.\n  It is difficult to deal with the French and Germans. The French have \nalways been difficult when it comes to a matter of U.S. leadership. The \nFrench backed out of NATO militarily decades ago. Behind the French and \nGerman opposition is an eye on the Iraqi oil. I think Russia will come \nalong. I think China will not object. I think we will have a U.N. \nresolution and we will have a chance to get Muslim countries, Pakistan \nand Turkey, in and give more confidence to the Arab world and a broader \nbase, perhaps ultimately in Egypt and other countries. We are working \non that.\n  If we can establish a democracy in Iraq, it will go a long way toward \nchanging the complexion and face of the Middle East. I think there have \nalready been significant changes in the attitude of Iran and other Arab \ncountries with the tremendous demonstration of military power that the \nUnited States put on in winning the war so rapidly. And now the harder \npart, as it has eventuated, is to secure order in Iraq and move it \ntoward democracy.\n  We will have to wait and see the specifics of the President's \nproposal, and I will be interested in the vote of the Senator from Iowa \nand others. It will\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\nnot be an easy vote to put up very substantial sums of money in Iraq \nbut it will not be easy either way.\n  The President is saying we have to stay the course, and I believe \nthere is a very strong presumption in support of what the President \nwill want to do as a matter of executive leadership when he comes \nforward with the specification as to how much money he wants and what \nhe wants to use the money for.\n  We will see. It is certainly true that at any time on the budget of \nthe United States, whether President Clinton, President Reagan, the \nfirst President Bush, the current President Bush or President Carter is \nin the White House, if either Democrats or Republicans did not spend \nmoney on defense, we could spend more money on education. There is no \ndoubt about that.\n  We have a budget. It is a large budget. It is $2,200,000,000,000. So \nwe make allocations. We allocate so much for various areas. When the \nargument is made that President Bush should not be given credit for \nincreases in the education budget, I think that simply belies the \nfacts.\n  The support for President Bush is really present in the request he \nhas made on the budget, and when the budget for the fiscal year was at \n$40 billion for 2001 and the first request was made by President Bush, \nhe asked for $44.5 billion. The next year, 2003, he asked for an \nincrease to $50 billion. This year, the administration's request is for \n$53 billion, slightly in excess. So from the 2001 budget, which was the \nlast year of his predecessor, to this year, 3 years, there has been a \n33 percent increase.\n  If we take a look at the first 3 years of President Clinton, or the 3 \nyears from fiscal year 1996, when the budget was $26 billion, through \n1999, it went up to $32, a 23 percent increase. If we take the 3 years \nfrom 1998 through 2001, from $29 billion to $40 billion, there is a 33 \npercent increase.\n  There has not been any characterization that President Clinton \nshortchanged education, and I think similarly there ought not to be the \naccepted argument that President Bush has shortchanged education.\n  When it comes to the question of money for title I, I think it is \nfair to note--and I called attention to these facts when Senator Byrd \noffered this amendment last Tuesday--that when the Democrats controlled \nthe appropriations process in the year 2001, looking for the 2002 \nbudget, the authorization for title I was $13.5 billion. The \nappropriation made by the Democrats was $10,350,000,000, or \n$2,950,000,000 under what the authorization was. It is well known that \nthe authorizations are characteristically much higher than the \nappropriations.\n  When the argument is made that the authorization for title I is $6 \nbillion higher today than the appropriation requested by the President, \nthat is right in line with what was done when the Democrats controlled \nthe appropriations process for fiscal year 2002 on the authorization \nbill, which passed on December 18, at $13.5 billion, and the \nappropriations bill which passed 2 days later, on December 20, at \n$10.35 billion.\n  So I believe there has been a recognition of the education needs. It \nis my hope that we will spend more time talking about the substantive \nneeds of schoolchildren than the issue of attaching political blame.\n  It is my hope that we can move ahead with the completion of this \nbill. Last Wednesday and Thursday, we were talking about compiling a \nlist, a list has not been compiled, and there was also talk about \nhaving a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa on \novertime pay with a request by the Democrats that the vote be scheduled \nfor Tuesday. We were trying to work toward that objective. At least in \nthe early stages of that discussion, they were not tied together, as I \nrecollect the discussions. Senator Harkin and I have very infrequently \ndisagreed. I cannot remember any disagreements on the facts. If we do \nhave different recollections, we are usually very gentle about it and \ndo not press the point on what could be misunderstandings.\n\n  I see we are heading for a tough stalemate that is going to boil down \nto what occurs from time to time as to who is running the Senate, to \nput it bluntly. Is there a Republican majority leader or is it a \nmajority leader in name only? I would very much like to work it out.\n  I must say I am not pleased to have to arrange the Senate schedule \naround the availability of Senators who are running for President. I \nhave considerable sympathy for Senators who run for President. There \nare three Senators in the Chamber today, plus the Chair, and two of the \nfour have run for President. So it is a matter where it is not uncommon \nfor Senators to run for President.\n  In one of the first columns I read by John Kilpatrick when I came to \nthe Senate after the 1980 election, he wrote--I thought it was in jest \nbut I think he was serious--that when somebody rises and addresses the \nChair of the Senate and says ``Mr. President,'' 35 heads turn, which is \nthe way the Senate operates.\n  It is a little disconcerting, to be mild about it, to have to arrange \nour schedule on voting for when the aspirants are in town. I am not \nunaware that if any one Senator wants to start to talk, the Senate will \nnot conduct any other business and we could go to regular order. I have \nexamined the procedures and we could vote on the Byrd amendment on a \nmotion to table, which would not get us too far. We could vote on \nanother amendment on a motion to table. We have to have unanimous \nconsent to set anything aside. We had hoped to vote this afternoon on a \nseries of amendments.\n  I received a call this morning, when I was in Pittsburgh--I have a \nday job in Pennsylvania--from the floor leaders, and it appeared we \nwould not be able to vote this afternoon and we should make that known \nso that people would not be rushing back to an empty Senate Chamber \nwithout any votes.\n  Let me inquire, if I may, through the Chair, to my learned, \ndistinguished, eminent colleague from Iowa, what are we going to do \nabout our schedule?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, if the Senator will yield without losing his right \nto the floor, I will try to respond to his question about the schedule. \nI do want to respond also to my friend's earlier comments on education \nfunding, but I will do that when I get the floor in my own right.\n  To respond to the inquiry about the schedule, I say to my friend from \nPennsylvania, there are two observations on who is running the Senate. \nThe Senate right now is 51 Republicans, 48 Democrats, and 1 \nIndependent. The Independent, Mr. Jeffords, caucuses with the \nDemocrats, although he maintains an independent status. So it is not \nthe case where we have a dictatorship. It is a case where the Senate is \nvery closely divided and where there should be a comity in which people \nwork together--as the Senator from Pennsylvania and I have done for 13 \nyears, by the way, I would note for the record--in terms of \naccommodating and trying to reach reasonable accommodations on votes.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I mentioned last week I was \ngoing to offer an amendment on overtime. It was no secret. I read it \ninto the Record. It was not my side, nor was it this Senator's \ndecision, saying that we would only have two votes on Friday morning \nand then go home. We could have stayed Friday and voted. It was not \nthis side or this Senator's decision to have one vote on Monday and \nthen later cancel it and not even have any votes on Monday.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania knows as well that on Fridays there is \na vote or two in the morning, everybody takes off, and then we have \nmaybe a vote at 5 or 5:30 on Monday--what we call a bed check vote. It \nwas this Senator's judgment that most of the votes--and we have a \nfinite list of amendments for this bill, I say to the Senator. We \nagreed. Senator Reid, our assistant leader on this side, got a finite \nlist of amendments, which is very important because that tells us we \ncan bring closure to this bill.\n\n  So it became clear that the big voting day was going to be Tuesday. \nEveryone is going to be here. It will be a long day. We can wrap up. We \ncan have a whole series of votes on Tuesday, maybe bring this bill to a \nclose by Wednesday--certainly Thursday at the latest.\n  I say further to my friend from Pennsylvania that the record shows \nthat in the last several years about the average length of time spent \non this bill, whether it has been in Democratic hands or Republican \nhands, has been\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\nabout 5 to 7 floor days because this is such a big bill. There is a lot \nin it. There are a lot of amendments, and usually a lot of debate on \ndifferent aspects of this bill. So it would not be unusual for this \nbill, under the leadership of my friend, and very good leadership I \nmight say, that we would be on the Senate floor for 5 or 6 days on this \nbill.\n  We were on it Wednesday. We had no votes Tuesday--again not our \ndecision. The decision was made by the majority leader that we would \nnot vote on Tuesday. We were on it Wednesday and Thursday. That is 2 \ndays. We had two votes on Friday. Today, we are here talking but no \nvotes. So Tuesday and Wednesday, that would give us about 5 legislative \ndays that we would be on it. We can probably finish this bill by \nWednesday night, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  So that is the schedule. I am not holding up anything. We couldn't \nvote today anyway. We couldn't vote on anything. The majority leader \nmade the decision that we were not going to have votes on this bill \ntoday.\n  When I heard that, I said, OK, I am going to offer my amendment, and \nI will object to going off of my amendment for anything else until we \nvote on it because we can vote on it first thing tomorrow morning. We \ncan come in tomorrow morning and vote on it, or tomorrow afternoon we \ncould vote on this amendment. We will vote on it.\n  I did not mean to go on. I yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It was my understanding the Senator took the position \nFriday morning there would not be any unanimous consent to setting \naside the pending amendment until there was an agreement to vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa on overtime pay on Tuesday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That was on Tuesday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So this morning when the floor staff was considering the \nmatter, in the absence of any agreement to set aside the Harkin \namendment so we could vote on other matters or take up other matters, \nit was not possible to do.\n  There is not agreement on this side of the aisle to give a time \ncertain. My view is to do so, as a matter of comity.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree. I appreciate that. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As a matter of power, in other contexts, in prior \navocations, there were stronger terms which were used as to the \nsituation. But I would call it concessions of power. That is a nicer \ncharacterization than others might be.\n  But anger flares around this place pretty fast. There are a hundred \nSenators. This Chamber is barely big enough to contain the egos when \npeople are calm, let alone when tempers flare. Right now there is a lot \nof flare over here, although you can't see it.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a hard time seeing it over there.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The other 49 Republican Senators are not here. But in \nabsentia. They are flaring, invisible flares all around the Senate \nChamber.\n  So we are heading for a tough time, I am afraid.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't understand why there is a flareup. This bill, we \nare moving ahead on it. Wednesday and Thursday we had good debates. We \nhad amendments. We voted. We brought up amendments, most on our side. I \nthink there were a couple on the Republican side that came up.\n  I don't know why there should be a flareup. We have the amendments \npending. We said let's set a time to vote on it. We can move ahead. \nThat is the sort of comity you work out. We will work out a time. We \nknow we are going to vote on it, so let's find a time that is \nagreeable. In fact, in the well Thursday night, I thought there was an \nagreed-upon time, for the afternoon, for two. I said that is fine; I \ndon't care. Then when I came in Friday morning, I found out that had \nbeen blown out of the water--not by our side but by the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator from Iowa will yield, there is a flareup \nbecause some people on this side of the aisle think they are being \ndictated to. I heard the terrible word ``blackmailed'' used in the \nSenate cloakroom, and I rushed out of the cloakroom. I didn't want to \nbe subject to listening to that kind of language. But there is a \nfeeling that we are being told what to do.\n  I do believe it is accurate and fair to say that when the Senator \nfrom Iowa and I, and the Senator from Nevada and I, were negotiating on \nthe list, that it was a sea change to say we are not going to go ahead \nwith the list and we are not going to go ahead with the Dodd amendment \nFriday morning. The Senator from Connecticut was waiting to give the \namendment unless we have a commitment from Republicans on voting on the \nHarkin amendment on overtime pay on Tuesday. That was the proposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thursday night--you don't have to take my word for it. We \nwere in the well with the majority leader----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will take your word for it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The minority leader on our side, Senator Reid. I was \ninvolved in the discussion. We were just talking about moving ahead and \ngetting a vote on this amendment on Tuesday.\n  I wouldn't say that hands were shaken and it was agreed, but someone \nsaid 3 or 3:15 on Tuesday. I said--someone said that to me. I didn't \nsay that--I said, fine, OK, let's work it out. We will have a time on \nTuesday we can work.\n  The Senator is right. Some of this does have to do with the fact that \nthere are a number on our side running for President. We know that. \nThey have been out. But everyone is going to be here tomorrow. The \npoint is, not everyone is here today, Monday, not even on your side or \nour side, but everyone is going to be here tomorrow; so that Thursday \nnight there was sort of a gentlemen's agreement--the assistant leader \nwas there, too--that we would set a time on Tuesday to vote on this. \nThat is the kind of thing we work out here.\n\n  If I could just finish? Then, when we come in Friday, I find that has \nbeen yanked away from us, that we can't have a time agreed upon to \nvote.\n  That is when this Senator decided, I am going to lay down my \namendment and I am going to object to going off it until we get some \nkind of agreement worked out. It is not blackmail. It is just trying to \nmove this process forward.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield--I think I still have the \nfloor, but in any event I will make the next statement. I think we were \nheading to a situation where we would have worked out a Tuesday vote \nhad there not been the sea change with the articulation of your \nposition, the Senator from Iowa, about not going ahead unless there was \na commitment. We were talking about it and we were working on it, but \none of the great problems we have to avoid around here, so the so-\ncalled cooler heads will prevail, is trying to get it in concrete, \ntrying to get it worked out so we can move this process along.\n  Here we are, 3:30 on Monday afternoon, and it looks to me it is very \ndifficult to iron out this issue at this time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my friend will yield further, I say why not? Tomorrow \neveryone is going to be here. If you want to agree on a time, you and I \ncould agree on a time. I don't care. Everyone is going to be here \ntomorrow. We will agree on a time and we will move forward. There is no \nreluctance or resistance on our part to doing that. I don't know what \nthe blocking is.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield--as our expression goes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator from Iowa would agree to set aside his \namendment, he and I could agree on that and in the absence of objection \nwe could then proceed with other amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be glad to set it aside. I would be willing to \nagree on a time tomorrow and set it aside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am saying agree to setting it aside without agreeing \nto a time tomorrow.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What happens to the amendment? Will the Senator \nabsolutely assure me if I set it aside that we will vote on this \namendment tomorrow afternoon?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do not have that authority to make that assurance, as \nI think the Senator from Iowa knows.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, there you go.\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think we have aired it thoroughly. We will try to see \nif the world's greatest deliberative body can undertake some \ndeliberation. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, we will work it out. I am sure it \nwill be worked out.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know my friend from Louisiana wishes to \nspeak. I want to take a couple of minutes to respond to the remarks of \nmy friend from Pennsylvania about the education bill.\n  I am constrained to, once again, point out some facts, as I did with \nthis chart. I want to hold it up again. Perhaps my friend wasn't on the \nfloor when I held this chart up before. This is education funding from \nfiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2004. In his radio address on Saturday, \nPresident Bush was boasting about the fact that he had an $11 billion \nincrease in funding in his administration. That is true. It went from \n$42 billion to $53 billion. That is $11 billion. But no thanks to him.\n  As I pointed out before, in fiscal year 2001 it was $42.2 billion, \nand in 2002 Bush asked for $44.5 billion--a very slight increase.\n  In negotiations with the President on the No Child Left Behind Act, \nDemocrats insisted and got it up to $49.9 billion. The next year \nPresident Bush asked for $50.3 billion--a $400 million increase, a .05-\npercent increase.\n  We Democrats fought hard and got it up to $53.1 billion. Now the \nPresident said in his radio address that he has a boost in education \nfunding for next year. As I pointed out, this year it is $53.1 billion, \nand he asked for $53.1.\n  Those are the facts. Facts are stubborn things. You can have all the \nrhetoric and dress up your words but facts are stubborn things. The \nfact is, of the $11 billion increase for funding in education since \nthis President came to office, the President has only asked for $2.7 \nbillion of that increase. That is the fact. Facts are very stubborn \nthings.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania dresses it up. But as we say in Iowa, you \ncan put an apron and a pink ribbon on a pig but it is still a pig. You \ncan dress this up in all kinds of fancy language. Quite frankly, we are \nleaving education funding behind.\n  I wanted to, again, bring out the facts and make sure that people had \nthe facts in education funding and why we need to get the Byrd \namendment agreed to on title I.\n  Again, when we negotiated No Child Left Behind, the President and the \nCongress agreed on these funding levels for title I. Now we are $6 \nbillion less than what we agreed upon earlier.\n  Facts are very stubborn things.\n  That is why we need to adopt the Byrd amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her patience. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support Senator \nHarkin in his call for additional funding to support the reform \nunderway for education.\n  I would like to speak a minute about the reforms, the importance of \nliving up to our promises and meeting the requirements of the quite \nhistoric act of Leave No Child Behind, as well as to support Senator \nHarkin in his call to scuttle an unneeded, untimely, and in many ways \nunsettling and disappointing rule that the Labor Department is \nproposing to strip away overtime pay for 8 million workers.\n  Since the Senator spoke in just the last moment on education, let me \nstart with that. I listened during the last several weeks to so many \ndifferent speeches about the level of education funding. Let me be the \nfirst to say as a Democrat that I am proud to have led the effort to \ncome up with a bipartisan bill that holds out hope and promise to every \nchild in our country for a better education.\n  I tire of the criticism this side of the aisle receives when people \nsay all the Democrats care about is more money and more money. Let me \nremind people about the fact that many of us on this side of the aisle \nrejected the call for more funding just being dumped on the same old \nsystem. We stood our ground and argued with some Republicans--not all--\nwhose initial efforts were in many ways to just abandon the public \nschool system, eliminate the Department of Education, remove all \nFederal involvement in education, walk away from our Governors, walk \naway from our legislators, and say: Fine. The school system is yours. \nBut luckily there were enough Republicans so we rejected that wrong-\nheaded thinking. We came together and said it is not a straight voucher \nsystem that is going to solve public education and we don't need to \nabandon public schools. Then some Democrats said it is not just more \nmoney which we need. It is accountability with added investment and an \nexpectation of results that are going to work.\n  People would ask me: Senator, how do you know this? Why do you feel \nso strongly about it? How can you be so confident about it? It is not a \nconcept for me and for Senator Breaux who represent the State of \nLouisiana that it would be 3 years down the road of reform and \naccountability before we passed the Federal law. We started out--along \nwith about five other States--pioneering this new effort to identify \nthrough strong testing the schools that are working and those that \naren't; when we identify those that aren't, to give added resources, \nwhether they are urban areas or rural areas, to help them turn around \nand improve; when they can and when they fail.\n  Then we have the power at the State and Federal levels to close those \nschools or reconstitute those schools so we can provide better \nleadership, a better framework, and better opportunity so the children \nin those schools, along with better qualified teachers, more committed \nadministrators, and more involved parents and communities can learn and \nget the job done.\n  But all of those new requirements for every child to take a test and \npass, for teachers to have certification and not willy-nilly \ncertification--not the old-fashioned certification but the new kind of \ncertification--obviously a college degree but also nontraditional \ncertifications such as teachers and executives who have been successful \nand perhaps retired and want to come into the classroom--new and \ninnovative ways but still a standard to be met and teachers coming into \nthe classroom with good skills and good requirements. We said if we are \ngoing to raise the bar and increase the mandates and require \naccountability and certification, then we will fund those efforts.\n\n  The other side of the aisle wants to keep saying that all Democrats \nwant is more money. We don't just want more money. But we do want this \nadministration and we want the President to commit and live up to the \npromises he made to fund the reforms.\n  Yes, the amount of money for education has increased, but it does not \nincrease because the President has asked for enough money to meet the \nnew and rigorous demands that he and we are expecting from our school \nsystem. We have deadlines in the bill to require States such as \nLouisiana--and in some parishes 40 percent of the teachers are \nunqualified and uncertified, not because people do not want to teach \nbut because the salary levels are so low; because of the underfunding \nand the traditional ways we fund education, which is not at all \nequitable throughout this Nation--for any number of reasons we are not \nable to keep those teachers' salaries up. Yet the new law which we all \nsupported requires that we have certified teachers.\n  While we have doubled, tripled, and quadrupled the mandate, or the \nexpectation, or the standards--however you want to define them--we have \nnot quadrupled or tripled funds. Therein lies the problem.\n  As we raise the standards and expect higher accountability and, as \nSenator Byrd from West Virginia has pointed out a number of times on \nthis floor, refuse to step to the plate and fund that level, we leave \nour schools and our local communities--whether it is out in the \nmountains of Montana in big sky country or the bayous, flatlands and \nlowlands of Louisiana, or whether it is an urban center like New York \nor Chicago, we leave our schools and our administrators struggling with \na mighty task and limited resources. It is wrong.\n\n  Finally on education funding, several decades ago we said to the \nStates, we will help you identify special-needs children. The deal is \nif you put up X amount of dollars we will put up X amount of dollars \nbecause we believe even if children are visually impaired, hard of \nhearing, or have some mental\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\nincapacities, they still should receive a quality education. We submit \nto the States, if we identify these special-needs children, we will \npick up the tab. Again, that was an empty promise because today we are \npicking up much less than the 40 percent we promised--I think perhaps \n10 percent when we promised 40, 50, or 60 percent.\n  Yes, we do need a higher level of commitment from this President and \nfrom the administration, not to throw money at the old system but to \nhelp build the new system he and the Republican leadership helped to \ncraft. But it is like putting up the framework of a skyscraper and not \nproviding the rest of the money necessary to make those changes real \nand to make them stick.\n  I know Governors and administrators are struggling. I want them to \nknow that at least this Senator and many Democrats, some Republicans, \nare in Washington trying to do what we can to squeeze out additional \ndollars to live up to the promise we made.\n  A final point. I am tired of the other side saying, we never meet \nauthorization levels. What are you talking about? We authorize X in \nhousing, yet we only fund X. We authorize X in research but we only \nfund X. I know that is normally what we do. But Leave No Child Behind \nis not just routine business. It is not just another day at the office. \nIt is not just, we will do it when we get to it, and when we don't, we \ncan't. This is a national priority this Congress resolved to commit to, \nsaying yes, we believe it is an American birthright not just to be able \nto walk into a school but to be able to walk out with a diploma that \nmeans something. It is in the family's interest, the individual's \ninterest, and in the Nation's interest to have that kind of school \nsystem. We will fund it. And then the next year we didn't.\n  The President and the administration deserve and should stand up and \ntake the criticism they deserve for not funding it fully as was \nimplied, if not directly promised.\n  It brings me to, interestingly, in this debate over education \nfunding, which the underlying bill helps to focus on, another \ninteresting fight or debate about the District of Columbia. This is a \nschool system of 500,000 people, a school system with about 75,000 \nchildren. We have been debating in Washington a proposal by the \noriginal sponsors, Republican leaders in the House. Their basic \nsolution to the fact this school system is not quite doing what it \nshould do was not, why don't we fully fund what we promised in Leave No \nChild Behind? Why don't we fully fund Title I for the District of \nColumbia? Why don't we fully fund special education? Why don't we \nreally hold these teachers and the school system accountable and make \nsure these schools that are failing are closed?\n  No. Before the ink was dry on the Leave No Child Behind Act, there \nwas a group that said, Vouchers are the answer.\n  With all due respect to well-meaning colleagues, vouchers are not the \nanswer to education challenges in America. Full funding for Leave No \nChild Behind, funding teacher certification, smaller classroom size, \nfunding to repair dilapidated school systems, and funding research and \ninnovation, and giving flexibility at the local level is what will help \nour local school system.\n\n  If there was an opportunity under Leave No Child Behind, if a school \nwas identified as needing reform and it had to be closed and there are \nseveral hundred children or perhaps even 1,000 in some of these \nschools--it is allowable now, permissible now at the local level, \nwithout any action Congress might take with that local school system, \nto use a voucher proposal; not federally mandated, not federally \nrequired, not contingent upon getting any new funds, but it is allowed \nnow for those students in failing schools to opt out to either higher \nperforming public schools or charter schools or to a private school \nthat is accredited with that money. And that maybe if it is designed \nspecifically for children in failing schools, if there is the same \naccountability requirements--in other words, children in public schools \nhave to take certain tests to make sure the public dollars being spent \nare being spent well--if those accountability measures are followed by \nthe accountable voucher proposal, then perhaps that is something that \nshould be considered, but in the context of more full funding for Leave \nNo Child Behind and in the context of supporting other admirable reform \nefforts in the schools like charter schools and the transformation of \nsome of the public schools that are going on today.\n  I was recently criticized by the Wall Street Journal for my position \nin this particular debate. Although it is not worth putting it into the \nCongressional Record, the article was factually incorrect on so many \ndifferent points, including criticizing me for changing my position. My \nposition on this has been constant over the last several years. Again, \nI don't believe a mandate in public schools of going to a system of \nvouchers helps to strengthen the public school system. However, I \nbelieve when failing schools are identified, children from families \nwith limited resources should be allowed but not required, if the \nvouchers meet the same accountability standards as Leave No Child \nBehind allowed, to be able to move to a higher performing school.\n  My position has been consistent. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a beautiful letter written by the head of the \nGeorgetown Day School, Peter M. Branch, where my children attend. This \nletter is in response to the Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 5, 2003.\n       Dear Editor: In a Wall Street Journal editorial on \n     September 5, 2003, you described Georgetown Day School of \n     Washington, D.C., which is attended by Senator Mary \n     Landrieu's children, among many others, as ``one of the \n     district's toniest private academies.'' It is clearly \n     purposeless to quarrel with the media's generic description \n     of independent schools as ``tony'' or ``elite,'' but the not \n     so subtle comparison to private segregationist academies that \n     arose post Brown vs. Board of Education (1954) is repulsive \n     in view of the well known history of our school. Founded in \n     1945 by black and white parents who did no want their \n     children to attend the legally segregated public schools in \n     the District of Columbia, Georgetown Day was the first \n     integrated school in our Nation's capital. That commitment to \n     a quality education for a diverse student population has been \n     central to the mission of GDS throughout our history. It is \n     the reason that Thurgood Marshall, Walter Washington, Harry \n     Belafonte, Roger Wilkins, Walter Fauntroy, and, I believe, \n     Senator Mary Landrieu have sent their children to this \n     school.\n       As a school that is nearly one third students of color and \n     provides financial aid to 17 percent of our students, GDS is \n     a strong supporter of school choice for all children. \n     However, the proposed vouchers for D.C. will not cover our \n     tuition without financial aid, will require us to forfeit any \n     selection process, and will subject us to governmental \n     interference which will jeopardize the independence of action \n     that enabled us to exist in the first place. For perhaps \n     2,000 district students, this bill may give them an \n     opportunity to move out of the public schools. But there is \n     no indication that there will be sufficient space in the non-\n     public sector or that the schools willing to sacrifice their \n     independence will offer greater quality. And this bill will \n     be of no help to the 64,800 students who will remain in the \n     public schools of D.C. which still require reform and \n     adequate funding. Your editorial described the voucher bill \n     as ``the bill to liberate D.C. children.'' I fear that \n     description is as inaccurate as your description of \n     Georgetown Day School.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter M. Branch,\n                            Head of School, Georgetown Day School.\n\n  This letter is from Mr. Peter Branch, a very dignified and able \nadministrator in the District. My husband and I are proud to send our \nchildren to a school that was formed specifically to fight segregation. \nTo this day, it is one of the most integrated schools in the District \nof Columbia.\n  All of us who pay a pretty steep tuition to send our children there \nare pleased and proud that a portion of that tuition goes to one of the \nmost aggressive scholarship programs that allows other families who \ndon't have the same kind of economic opportunity to send their children \nto a school of this quality.\n  I can tell you, there is not a day I walk into that school that I \ndon't say thank goodness I can finally see what excellence really is. \nIt gives me a view and a vision for what can be accomplished in our \npublic schools, in our public charter schools. And through the Leave No \nChild Behind Act--if followed, if implemented, if funded, and if \nadhered to by our Governors and by our superintendents, and embraced by \nour teachers and our administrators, and\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nembraced by our parents, and followed through on behalf of our \nchildren--we can indeed provide a quality public education, a charter \neducation, a magnet school education; and then, in the event those \noptions fail, yes, a private school or parochial school choice for \nchildren who are in schools that are absolutely not working.\n  This approach provides more choice and more opportunity and more \ncompetition for people of all stripes and backgrounds and situations. \nThat is what this debate is about. It is about full funding--not just \nthrowing more money at the system but full funding of the reforms and \nthe promises we made. It is about making the right decisions when it \ncomes to choice and to scholarships. And if we are going to have \naccountability in the public school sector, then let's most certainly--\nbefore we take a step in the direction to have accountability in our \nvoucher proposal for failing schools and designed specifically--if it \nis truly meant to help children in failing schools, then let's at least \nhave the proposal directed to children in failing schools and not the \nbroad sweep as currently under the Gregg-Feinstein language.\n  So I join my colleague Senator Harkin in his plea for stronger \nfunding, better policies, and more and better implementation of the \nLeave No Child Behind Act in this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1580\n\n  In addition, Mr. President, I want to say a word about another \namendment that is pending on this bill. It does not have to do with \neducation, but I guess it does have to do with the health of our \nworkers, the health of the American people. That has to do with the \novertime regulation the Bush administration is putting forward.\n  I really couldn't think of a more wrongheaded change of a law at a \nworse time than this particular regulation, which seeks to undermine \nthe 40-hour workweek for 8 million workers, most of those workers being \nwomen, but affecting many workers--white, black, Asian, and Hispanic. \nAs I say, the way the rule is proposed and crafted, many women would be \naffected.\n  Right now, if you make the minimum wage--and this administration and \nthe Republicans have refused to raise the minimum wage. Although plea \nafter plea has been made to raise the minimum wage, they have refused. \nThe minimum wage is still $5.15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week at \nthe minimum wage, you make the whopping salary of $10,400. How someone \nin America is to send their children to the doctor, send their children \nto school, buy groceries, pay rent, or buy a house on $10,400 a year, I \ndon't know. But the Republican administration, led by the President, \nrefuses to agree to a gradual increase in the minimum wage. Luckily, \nminimum-wage workers are exempt from this draconian rule the \nadministration is proposing.\n\n  But for workers making between $30,000 and $65,000 a year, many of \nwhom are nurses, policemen, firemen, dental hygienists, postmasters, \nmotor service carriers, preschool teachers, welfare eligibility \nworkers, agricultural inspectors, zoning inspectors, conservation \nagents, white-collar workers--because of this rule, because of the \nLabor Department's insistence or determination that these workers no \nlonger need or deserve the protection of the 40-hour workweek, they \nwill be stripped of their ability to earn overtime.\n  I don't know what the Labor Department was thinking. When they wake \nup in the morning, the administrators, do they read the headlines of \nthe paper? Are they following the situation where many people are out \nof work? As an example, perhaps in a particular family, one spouse is \nout of work. The Republican administration is saying, well, we know \nyour wife is out of work or your husband is out of work, and you are \nnow basically making ends meet with overtime, but our new rule in \nWashington says we are going to take the overtime from you.\n  I don't even understand why we would be considering a rule at this \ntime. We should be encouraging small businesses to expand opportunities \nfor workers. If they can pay these workers the same amount of money for \n60 hours as 40 hours, there is no need to hire additional workers. If \nwe take this overtime requirement away, there is no reason why a small \nbusinessperson would go out and hire a new worker. So it does not help \nus increase the number of jobs in this country. It is unfair to the \nworkers who are earning the overtime. And it is very unfair to the \nmiddle class, particularly women--in many instances single women \nraising children.\n  In conclusion, I find it very ironic that just last Friday, September \n5, we adopted a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, S. Res. 210. This \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution expresses that October should be \ndesignated as National Work and Family Month. It is a resolution that \nwas submitted by Senator Hatch and several other Members. We \nunanimously adopted this resolution last week. It expresses ``the sense \nof the Senate that supporting a balance between work and personal life \nis in the best interest of national worker productivity. . . .''\n  It says:\n\n       Whereas the quality of workers' jobs and the supportiveness \n     of their workplaces are key predictors of job productivity, \n     job satisfaction, commitment to employers, and retention;\n       Whereas there is a clear link between work-family policies \n     and lower absenteeism;\n       Whereas the more overworked employees feel, the more likely \n     they are to report making mistakes, feel anger and resentment \n     toward employers and coworkers, and look for a new job;\n       Whereas employees who feel overworked tend to feel less \n     successful in their relationships with their \n     spouses, children, and friends, and tend to neglect \n     themselves, feel less healthy, and feel more stress. . . .\n\n  And it goes on and on. And it says:\n\n       Resolved, That--it is the sense of the Senate that--\n     reducing the conflict between work and family life should be \n     a national priority; and the month of October should be \n     designated as ``National Work and Family Month''. . . .\n\n  So I guess in honor of National Work and Family Month, we now decide \nit is going to make people less cranky if they can work 60 hours a week \nand not get paid overtime for 20. They are working 40 hours, and we \nwould pay them for that, but now we are to require them to work 60 \nhours and not pay them overtime and expect them to be happier, less \ngrumpy, and more fulfilled at work and at home.\n  May I suggest we stop adopting resolutions such as this if we are \ngoing to start promoting rules such as the one that is proposed by the \nLabor Department, and let's just be honest with ourselves.\n  So I hope we won't go to another amendment. I hope we won't vote on \nanything else until we either withdraw this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, which makes no sense considering we are just about ready to \npass a rule that says you can work but we are not going to pay you \novertime, we are going to require that you work and we are not going to \npay overtime, and we want you to be happy doing it--that is basically \nwhat we would be saying--I suggest we either repeal the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution or not pass the overtime rule that is being proposed \nby the Bush administration and by the Secretary of Labor at this time.\n  So for all these reasons, let's stay on this bill. It is an important \nbill for education. It is an important bill for our children. It is a \nvery significant issue I hope we can resolve. If we do give the \nopportunity for children in failing schools to move to a higher \nperforming school, let's do it the right way, with accountable \nvouchers, remove the Federal mandate, and not be sidetracked with a \nsiren song about how supporting a few children in schools is going to \ncorrect the fact that President Bush refuses to fund Leave No Child \nBehind.\n\n  Let's not pass this new labor amendment which would strip overtime \nfrom 8 million workers. That paycheck for overtime that many of those \nworkers are picking up is helping them to pay a mortgage and make ends \nmeet at a time when the economy is not as strong as it should be and \ncould be with different leadership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Rebuilding Iraq\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last evening President Bush addressed the \nNation about the situation in Iraq. I\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nwish to comment briefly about his request for $87 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2004 request that he will \nsoon send to Congress.\n  I believe every single penny requested to support the troops who are \nnow serving in Iraq ought to be appropriated by the Congress. When \nAmerica sends its sons and daughters to war, it should provide all that \nis necessary for them to do their job, to protect themselves, and to \ncarry out their missions. So speaking for myself, I believe every \nsingle penny requested and necessary for the soldiers who represent \nthis country in the Iraqi theater and in Afghanistan and other areas \nmust be made available.\n  There are not a lot of good choices in Iraq. We understand that. This \nis a difficult situation. But this country cannot now leave Iraq. We \nare opening mass graves, football-field-size graves with 10 to 12,000 \nskeletons in them. We know that what happened in Iraq was genocide. We \nalso know that if we leave today, there will immediately be massive \nnumbers of murders and revenge killings. We simply cannot allow that to \nhappen. We are faced with a circumstance in which there are not a lot \nof good choices, but we must be there at this point.\n  That said, it seems to me that the Administration ought to \naggressively seek assistance from the United Nations, from NATO, and \nfrom other countries and get them to supply the troops and resources to \nhelp us carry out this mission. The U.S. military is stretched too thin \nto stabilize Iraq by themselves.\n\n  Part of the $87 billion that the President is going to request from \nCongress will be for the reconstruction of Iraq. There need to be some \nsignificant questions asked about that. It is not that I question the \nneed for reconstruction in Iraq. It is a precondition for the \ndevelopment of a new democracy in that country. But Iraq has the second \nlargest oil reserves in the world next to Saudi Arabia. One question \nis, What kind of support shall these oil reserves provide in the future \nfor reconstruction? How will the Iraqi oil now under the sands--again, \nthe second largest oil reserves in the world--contribute to the \nreconstruction? And what kind of support will other countries provide \nfor reconstruction? Who will provide what resources? Who will make what \ncontributions?\n  I ask all of those questions on behalf of the American taxpayer \nbecause I don't believe Americans should have the sole responsibility \nfor paying to reconstruct Iraq. This in fact is a situation that \naffects not only our country but the entire world. Again, we need to \nseek aggressively the assistance of the United Nations, NATO, and other \ncountries in meeting these obligations. It is important for us to ask \nthe administration for detailed plans and an aggressive approach to \naddress the issues with respect to future reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Then the final question with respect to all of this is, how do we \nreconcile the President's request for $87 billion in additional \nspending for Iraq with last week's announcements that the President \nwould like additional tax cuts? We know this year the Federal deficit \nwill be somewhere around $475 billion, and next year it is expected to \ngrow to over $500 billion. If we are talking, on the one hand, with \nthis President, about additional tax cuts and, on the other hand, about \nadditional spending, $87 billion at a time when we have the highest \ndeficits in the history of our country, it is important to ask: How \ndoes this add up? How do we find this money? Where does it come from? \nWhat do we do to achieve the resources to do the job in Iraq?\n  Again, stating the obvious, we must spend every penny requested to \nsupport the troops. Those men and women who have been called to serve \nour country do so willingly. They protect our liberty and our freedom, \nand this country can do no less than provide all that is necessary for \ntheir support.\n  But, it is important for the people of America to ask the larger \nquestions about what is the economic plan that provides the resources \nand the strength for the economic engine that makes all of this \npossible. What is happening in this country? How do we produce the \nrevenue, restart the economic engine in order to make all of this \npossible?\n  I noticed this weekend, on Saturday in the New York Times, ``Job \nLosses Mount for the Second Straight Month,'' 93,000 fewer jobs in this \nmonth than in the previous month. We have roughly 11 million people \nlooking for work; some say 9 million. There are a couple million more \nat least who have been part of the unemployment rolls who have actually \nstopped actively searching, having not found a job for some long while.\n  The question is, How do they find work? How do we employ those in \nthis country who need employment?\n  This headline suggests, once again, that while the economy seems to \nbe growing, perhaps slowly--more slowly than we would like--it may also \nbe the case that this is a ``jobless'' recovery. If that is the case, \nthat is very troublesome. Paul Gregg Roberts, who was a Reagan \neconomist in the 1980s, has written about the prospect of a jobless \neconomy, and he said, in fact, that this economy is growing some and it \nis producing jobs--it is just that the jobs are not being produced in \nthe U.S.\n  There is something called ``offshoring.'' That means companies are \ndeciding increasingly to move jobs offshore--jobs that used to be \nAmerican jobs, used to be jobs inside this country, which provided a \nliving for a family with decent pay, decent benefits, working in a safe \nworkplace, all of those things the American people have come to expect \nif you work hard and play by the rules. The fact is, too many jobs are \nnow being sent offshore because you can perform these jobs much less \nexpensively offshore.\n  If offshoring is a way to export American jobs, even as the American \neconomy expands some, the question is, What kind of an economy do you \nhave in the future? Jobless recoveries do not solve the problem we face \nin this country. The reason it relates to the question that I think the \nPresident has raised last evening and last week of $87 billion in \nadditional spending, at the same time that we increase the tax cuts or \nprovide additional tax cuts at the request of the President, the \nquestion is, How does this add up?\n  The fact is, our economy has a cycle called the business cycle. No \none--no economist can repeal the business cycle.\n  The business cycle means you have an expansionary phase of the \neconomy and a contractionary phase. That is just as inevitable as the \ntides. What causes that? Is it because there are a bunch of economists \nwho talk about monetary and fiscal policy and this ship of state of \nours is somehow moving on the high seas and there is someone in the \nengine room and they are fine-tuning this, that, and the other thing--\ndials, levers, gauges, M(1)(b) investment tax credit, accelerated \ndepreciation, monetary and fiscal policy? No, that is not what causes \nthe ship of state to move forward. There is, in my judgment, an \noverblown sense of self-importance among economists who talk about what \nthey know or don't know--mostly about what they think they know. Our \neconomy moves forward when the American people are confident in the \nfuture.\n  The expansion side is people being confident about the future. When \nthey are confident, they do things that manifest that confidence--buy a \nhouse, buy a car, take a trip. That is the expansion side of the \neconomy.\n  When they are not confident about the future, they do the exact \nopposite. They decide not to buy the car, not to buy the house, not to \ntake a trip because they are not certain about the future. That is the \ncontraction side of the economy. As it is now, they see an economy with \nvery large deficits--the biggest deficits in the history of our country \nby far. They see an economy that 3 years ago had very large surpluses \nthat were predicted to exist for the next 12 years. In fact, the \nFederal Reserve Board--God bless them, they always have a great sense \nof humor--the Federal Reserve Board worried that the surpluses were \ngoing to be far too large and that would create a drag on the economy. \nI guess they are not so much worried about that these days because in 3 \nyears the largest surpluses in the history of this country have turned \ninto the largest deficits for as far as the eye could see. There is \nnothing in the next 10-year projections that show us reaching a \nbalanced budget.\n\n  The reason this is important is, the people need to be confident \nabout the future of this economy to expand, and this expansion of the \neconomy must not be just in numbers, it must be in\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\njobs as well. This offshoring must be abated somehow so that the \nexpansion of jobs is also an expansion of jobs in this country.\n  That is the only way this great economy of ours--the strongest on the \nface of the Earth--is going to provide the resources to sustain and \nprovide that which we need to do what the President talked about last \nevening. So I just think it is very important for us at this point to \nbegin thinking seriously about the larger questions of fiscal policy \nand confidence as well.\n  In conclusion, I am going to support every single dollar requested \nthat will support the troops we have sent abroad to fight for this \ncountry. However, that does not mean I am going to support every dollar \nthe President requests for the Pentagon. For example, I expect we will \nsoon have the opportunity to offer some amendments to save money by \ncancelling some new nuclear weapons that the administration has \nproposed in the budget.\n  Let me describe a couple of them. These are things I will not support \nand hope to cut funding for. We have some people downtown in the \nadministration who believe nuclear weapons should be treated like any \nother weapon and that we should have a policy to use them in certain \ncircumstances. That is a very dangerous way of thinking. We have never \nused nuclear weapons, with the exception of at the end of the Second \nWorld War. Up to now, American policy has been to have nuclear weapons \nin order to prevent nuclear weapons from ever being used. That is \ncalled the mutually assured destruction concept, which we have lived \nwith for 40 to 50 years. Now we have people who see them as any other \nweapon. They talk about using them, and they are suggesting we might \nneed to use them first.\n  Some would like to begin testing nuclear weapons again. We have not \ntested nuclear weapons for over a decade. The President's budget \nrequests research and development money for the development of new \nearth penetrator, bunker buster nuclear weapons. The President has \nrequested money for what are called low-yield nuclear weapons. \nApparently, they are designer nuclear weapons that can be used more \neasily on the battlefield. I think this is horribly dangerous for this \ncountry. What kind of a signal do we send to other countries that have \nor want to acquire nuclear weapons? That nuclear weapons can be usable \nif you just design them in a different way? That if you want to find \nsomebody holed up in a cave, you should just build a designer bunker \nbuster nuclear weapon--not so little really--that you can lob in to \ndestroy the cave.\n  This is terribly destructive to this country's public policy. I think \nit is hard for me to find the adjectives to describe how shortsighted \nand dangerous I think this is. I intend to offer an amendment--and I \nknow some of my colleagues will as well--to take some of that money out \nthat would produce these designer nuclear weapons. We don't need them. \nAfter all, there are around 30,000 nuclear weapons on the face of this \nearth. A couple of years ago, there was a flurry of anxiety in the \ngovernment when there was a rumor that terrorists had stolen one \nnuclear weapon. One stolen weapon would cause a seizure, and there are \nroughly 30,000 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  We don't need to build more nuclear weapons. And, as the leader in \nthe world, we ought to be striving to use our prestige to prevent the \nspread of nuclear weapons and to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. \nThe last thing we ought to do is undermine nonproliferation efforts by \nsaying that we need to build nuclear weapons to bust bunkers and for \nother uses.\n  I think that is horribly dangerous and destructive. That is one area \nwhere we might save a little money and begin ratcheting down this \ndeficit that we and the President have to come to grips with.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Denver, \nCO. On November 6, 2001, a 35-year-old Middle Eastern man was attacked \nby two men while on an evening walk. One of the men attacked the victim \nwith a soda can, knocking him to the ground. Once on the ground, the \nsecond assailant kicked the victim in the ribs and threw soda cans at \nhis head. The assailants also yelled obscenities and racial slurs at \nthe victim ordering him to ``Go back to his country.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/08/senate-section/article/S11184-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11184-S11185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

James was pulled from the \nwreckage after having been submerged in the water for an estimated five \nto seven minutes. He was unconscious and near death, with a broken bone \nin his upper arm and nerve damage. But thanks to swift emergency care \nfrom his fellow soldiers he was kept alive until he could be evacuated \nto a hospital. James was in a coma for a month afterward. He was \nhospitalized in Kuwait, Germany, and Washington, and spent time in a \nrehabilitation facility in Tampa.\n  In July, SGT James Sides returned home to a richly deserved hero's \nwelcome in Wynne. We're all glad to have him back home, but not more \nthan his loving family: His parents, Carter and Leslie Sides; his wife, \nRebecca Sides and his two sons, James Jr. and Devin.\n  Upon his homecoming, James was interviewed by his local newspaper.

He also noted \nthat he's not a hero: ``If I'm a hero, where would that put the guys \nwho are still over there? We can't forget them. They are the ones we \nshould be thinking about.'' Well, James Sides may be too modest to call \nhimself a hero, but the rest of us recognize him as just that--a man of \ntremendous courage, commitment, and patriotism whose service to his \ncountry has been exemplary.\n  I ask that all my colleagues in the Senate join me in thanking SGT \nSides for his service and for his sacrifice, which we can never \nsufficiently recognize or repay.

A bill to require negotiation and appropriate action with \nrespect to certain countries that engage in currency manipulation; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if you should find yourself hankering \nfor a hamburger, may I respectfully suggest that you go to Beijing? \nThat's where you'll find the world's cheapest hamburgers.\n  I have this useful information courtesy of the good people at The \nEconomist magazine, who for over 15 years have periodically compiled \ntheir ``Big Mac'' index to chart the relative values of national \ncurrencies. The index is based on what it costs to buy one of the \nworld's most ubiquitous commodities.\n  Now the recipe for a Big Mac is pretty much the same everywhere, and \nin a perfect world it would presumably cost about the same everywhere. \nThe Economist uses this observation to gain an insight into currency \nvaluations. But we find that instead of costing about the same, as one \nwould expect, in Chinese yuan a Big Mac costs about 56 percent less \nthan it would in the average American city. This differential is \ngreater than that for any other country in the most recent Big Mac \nindex in April. Such a bargain.\n  Why does this massive price differential exist? It exists because the \nyuan has been systematically kept at low value--an artificially low \nvalue--pursuant to intervention by the Chinese government in currency \nmarkets. The yuan been systematically undervalued by a lot. Fifty-six \npercent--the differential in the April index--is probably a bit high. \nMany experts put the figure at closer to 40 percent. That's plenty.\n  That's why China has the world's cheapest hamburgers. The Chinese \nhave held the yuan at a nearly fixed value relative to the dollar since \n1994, and that value is about 40 percent lower than it should be in an \nunfettered currency market.\n  How has China achieved this unnatural and non-market result? The \nChinese maintain the yuan's low value through mandatory foreign-\nexchange purchases by their central bank, and since 1994 they have \nbought almost 300 billion U.S. dollars to keep the yuan's value low.\n  What is so bad about cheap hamburgers in China and this intervention \nin the currency markets? If we were only dealing with hamburgers, I \nwould not object, but the Big Mac Index explains a good deal about why \nwe have seen a catastrophic and growing trade deficit with China and \nwhy this is causing massive layoffs in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n  The undervalued currency is driving the Chinese export machine and \nsimultaneously smothering U.S. manufacturing. China has some very real \ncompetitive advantages in international trade, including a low-cost, \nhard-working labor force. But their exports start out with a 40 percent \nprice advantage based purely on their artificially undervalued \ncurrency. This is artificial and unfair.\n  To keep the yuan's value down China is buying dollars at a rate of \nabout $120 billion a year, which happens to be about the same amount as \nour trade deficit with China.\n  And we're seeing the results of this undervalued yuan on a daily \nbasis here in the Untied States. The results are vanished jobs in our \nmanufacturing industries, closed plants, a hollowing out of our \nmanufacturing sector. Last week we learned of an additional 44,000 \nmanufacturing jobs lost in August alone, and that was a continuation of \na sad, sad trend.\n  Manufacturing employment has fallen monthly for 37 consecutive \nmonths.\n  Two point seven million manufacturing jobs have been lost since July \n2000. Manufacturing job losses have accounted for as much as 90 percent \nof our total job losses in this so-called ``jobless recovery''. In \nConnecticut we've lost more than 14 out of every 100 manufacturing jobs \nthat we had in July 2000.\n  And it's clear that trade plays a major role in this. Manufacturing \nis deeply dependent on trade--manufactured goods make up 80 percent of \nall U.S. merchandise exports. Our manufacturing trade deficit with \nChina is the worst bilateral manufacturing deficit in the world. Not \nsurprisingly,\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\nwhen you consider that 40 percent price advantage, we have a trade \ndeficit with China in every major manufacturing industry except \naircraft, with electronics, machinery, textiles and apparel the worst.\n  I've used China as an example of this pernicious manipulation of \ncurrency values, but it does not stand alone in this black art. Last \nmonth Japan outdid China in currency market intervention, spending $11 \nbillion to defend the yen, which is estimated to be undervalued by \napproximately 20 percent. Central banks in Taiwan and South Korea have \nbeen purchasing dollars aggressively as well, holding down the values \nof their currencies. Together those four countries hold about $1.21 \ntrillion in currency reserves, and the vast majority of these reserves, \nperhaps as high as 90 percent, are thought to be in dollars. \nSignificantly, those same four countries--China, Japan, Taiwan and \nSouth Korea--account for about 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit in \nmanufactured goods.\n  To date the Bush Administration response to this assault on our \nmanufacturing sector has been belated, tepid and ineffectual. It tried \nto ignore it. Lately, when it became clear even to the Administration \nthat they could no longer ignore the depressing job losses, Treasury \nSecretary Snow traveled to Beijing to try his hand at persuading the \nChinese to let their currency rise to its natural market level. He got \nthe brush off. Why should the Chinese government take this \nAdministration seriously about the currency issue when it is clear that \nthe Administration isn't, in fact, serious about it? Why should this be \na priority to China when it's not a priority of the United States?\n  We can no longer afford to make gestures regarding these issues. We \nhave to be serious to be taken seriously. To this end, I am today \nintroducing legislation to require prompt and firm action against those \nnations that most egregiously manipulate their currencies to achieve an \nunfair trade advantage.\n  The Bush Administration has options under the international trade \nlaws to deal with this situation, options it is not yet willing to \npursue. Under my legislation the Administration will be pressed to \ndefend legitimate U.S. interests and avail ourselves of our rights and \nauthority under a variety of international trade agreements.\n  These options include taking action under the articles of the \nInternational Monetary Fund that prohibit currency manipulation by \nmember states in order to achieve an unfair competitive advantage. They \ninclude action under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the \nWorld Trade Organization that members will not use currency exchange \nrates to frustrate the organization goals of reciprocal and mutually \nadvantageous trade. We also have rights under U.S. trade law and our \nbilateral agreements, including Section 301 and Section 406.\n  I introduce this legislation knowing full well that these are complex \nissues and that trade policy decisions does occur in a vacuum. \nCertainly some in the U.S. receive benefits from cheaper imports. If \nnot cheaper hamburgers than certainly cheaper electronics, cheaper \nclothing, and cheaper machinery are flooding our markets. What we gain \nat the checkout counter, however, we are losing at the payroll window. \nWhen some here gain from cheap imports because of illegal and unfair \nmanipulation of currencies, the gains are not worth the price that they \nextract from U.S. companies seeking a fair opportunity to compete with \nthese imports or to export U.S. products. They are not worth the price \nwe pay in terms of U.S. credibility in standing up for our legitimate \nrights and interests.\n\n  I am well aware that China, like Japan, deploys its massive currency \nreserves to buy up U.S. debt. This helps us finance the U.S. debt at \nlow interest rates. Given the Bush Administration fiscal policy, we are \nnow headed towards doubling the national debt, making us more dependent \non foreign funding of our debts. This is a form of dependency that \ncomes at a price, much like our dependency on foreign oil. If the \nAdministration were to become serious about currency manipulation, it \ncould strengthen its hand; it would adopt a fiscal policy that reduces \nour dependence on foreigners to finance our national debt. While I am \nconcerned about our ability to finance our government debt, I believe \nthat there are ample reasons why China, Japan and others will maintain \nthese investments even if they abandon their intervention in the \ncurrency markets.\n  I am also aware that the United States maintains a multifaceted \nstrategic relationship with China and Japan. We and the rest of the \nworld would benefit, for example, from China's assistance in \nnegotiations with North Korea. But again, this is no reason not to be \nforceful with these countries when they transgress the international \nnorms and laws for international trade.\n  There are many vital and strategic issues at stake in our \nrelationships with China and Japan, but when all is said and done we \ncannot afford to turn a blind eye to these illegal and unjustified \ncurrency manipulation games. We simply cannot give away our \nmanufacturing sector and manufacturing jobs.\n  If we tolerate these manipulations, we lose credibility in dealing \nwith other policy issues that arise in these relationships.\n  I believe that everyone in this chamber recognizes that I am strongly \ncommitted to free trade. But I cannot defend free trade unless it is \nalso fair. And what we have today with these currency manipulations is \nnot fair trade. It's manipulation, it confers an unfair competitive \nadvantage, and it is hurting Americans. It is long past time to act, it \nis time to take this challenge seriously, and it is time to defend \nlegitimate American interests. We are acting assertively in pursuit of \nour national interest in Iraq, and it is time to do the same with \ncountries that seek to secure an unfair competitive advantage in \ninternational trade.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Currency Enforcement \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The manufacturing sector is an important driver of the \n     United States economy, contributing almost 30 percent of our \n     economic growth during the 1990's, and twice the productivity \n     growth of the service sector during that period.\n       (2) The manufacturing sector contributes significantly to \n     our Nation's development of new products and technologies for \n     world markets, performing almost 60 percent of all research \n     and development in the United States over the past two \n     decades.\n       (3) The manufacturing sector provides high quality jobs, \n     with average weekly wages in 2002 nearly 26 percent higher \n     than jobs in the service sector.\n       (4) The manufacturing growth creates a significant number \n     of jobs and investments in other sectors of the economy, and \n     this ``multiplier effect'' is reckoned by economists to be \n     larger (2.43 to 1) than for any other significant sector of \n     the economy.\n       (5) The ``jobless recovery'' from the recent recession has \n     witnessed the worst job slump since the Great Depression and \n     the weakest employment recovery on record.\n       (6) The manufacturing sector has been hit the hardest by \n     the jobless recovery, with more than 2,700,000 jobs lost \n     since July 2000, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the \n     total United States jobs lost.\n       (7) A significant factor in the loss of valuable United \n     States manufacturing jobs is the difficulty faced by United \n     States manufacturers in competing effectively against lower \n     priced foreign products.\n       (8) A significant obstacle to United States manufacturers \n     in competing against foreign manufacturers is the practice of \n     some governments of intervening aggressively in currency \n     markets to maintain their own currencies at artificially low \n     valuations, thus subsidizing their export sales and raising \n     price barriers to imports from the United States.\n       (9) Certain Asian countries exemplify this practice. China, \n     Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan together have accumulated \n     approximately $1,200,000,000,000 in foreign currency \n     reserves, about \\1/2\\ of the world's total reserves. The vast \n     majority of these reserves, perhaps as high as 90 percent, \n     are in dollars. These same 4 countries account for 60 percent \n     of the United States world trade deficit in manufactured \n     goods. These reserves are symptomatic of a strategy of \n     intervention to manipulate currency values.\n       (10) The People's Republic of China is particularly \n     aggressive in intervening to maintain the value of its \n     currency, the renminbi, at an artificially low rate. China \n     maintains this rate by mandating foreign exchange sales at \n     its central bank at a fixed exchange rate against the dollar, \n     in effect, pegging the\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\n     renminbi at this rate. This low rate represents a significant \n     reason why China has contributed the most to our trade \n     deficit in manufactured goods. The United States trade \n     deficit with China increased from $57,000,000,000 in 1998 to \n     $103,000,000,000 in 2002, while China accumulated dollar \n     reserves totaling over $345,000,000,000 as of June 2003, \n     keeping the value of the renminbi essentially flat since \n     1994.\n       (11) Economists estimate that as a result of this \n     manipulation of the Chinese currency, the renminbi is \n     undervalued by between 15 and 40 percent, effectively \n     creating a 15- to 40-percent subsidy for Chinese exports and \n     giving Chinese manufacturers a significant price advantage \n     over United States and other competitors.\n       (12) Japan held foreign currency reserves worth \n     $526,600,000,000 as of June 2003, and for the previous 6 \n     months increased its reserves by an average of \n     $12,500,000,000 per month. Experts estimate that the yen is \n     undervalued by approximately 20 percent or more, giving \n     Japanese manufacturers a significant price advantage over \n     United States competitors.\n       (13) In addition to being placed at a competitive \n     disadvantage by foreign competitors' exports that are \n     unfairly subsidized by strategically undervalued currencies, \n     United States manufacturers also may face significant \n     nontariff barriers to their own exports to these same \n     countries. For example, in China a complex system involving \n     that nation's value added tax and special tax rebates ensures \n     that semiconductor devices imported into China are taxed at \n     17 percent while domestic devices are effectively taxed at 6 \n     percent.\n       (14) The United States has the right and power to redress \n     unfair competitive practices in international trade involving \n     currency manipulation.\n       (15) Under section 3004 of the Omnibus Trade and \n     Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury is \n     required to determine whether any country is manipulating the \n     rate of exchange between its currency and the dollar for the \n     purpose of preventing effective balance of payments \n     adjustments or gaining unfair advantage in international \n     trade. If such violations are found, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury is required to undertake negotiations with any \n     country that has a significant trade surplus.\n       (16) Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the \n     International Monetary Fund prohibits currency manipulation \n     by a member for the purposes of gaining an unfair competitive \n     advantage over other members, and the related surveillance \n     provision defines ``manipulation'' to include ``protracted \n     large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     market''.\n       (17) Under Article XV of the Exchange Agreements of the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, all contracting \n     parties ``shall not, by exchange action, frustrate the intent \n     of the provisions of this Agreement, nor by trade action, the \n     intent of the Articles of Agreement of the International \n     Monetary Fund''. Such actions are actionable violations. The \n     intent of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Exchange \n     Agreement, as stated in the preamble of that Agreement, \n     includes the objective of ``entering into reciprocal and \n     mutually advantageous arrangements directed to substantial \n     reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade,'' and \n     currency manipulation may constitute a trade barrier \n     disruptive to reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade \n     arrangements.\n       (18) Deliberate currency manipulation by nations to \n     significantly undervalue their currencies also may be \n     interpreted as a violation of the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures of the World Trade Organization (as \n     described in section 101(d)(12)) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act, which could lead to action and remedy under \n     the World Trade Organization dispute settlement procedures.\n       (19) Deliberate, large-scale intervention by governments in \n     currency markets to significantly undervalue their currencies \n     may be a nullification and impairment of trade benefits \n     precluded under Article XXIII of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, and subject to remedy.\n       (20) The United States Trade Representative also has \n     authority to pursue remedial actions under section 301 of the \n     Trade Act of 1974.\n       (21) The United States has special rights to take action to \n     redress market disruption under section 406 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 adopted pursuant to the provisions of the United \n     States-China Bilateral Agreement on World Trade Organization \n     Accession.\n       (22) While large-scale manipulation of currencies by \n     certain major trading partners to achieve an unfair \n     competitive advantage is one of the most pervasive barriers \n     faces by the manufacturing sector in the United States, other \n     factors are contributing to the decline of manufacturing and \n     small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in the United States, \n     including but not limited to non-tariff trade barriers, lax \n     enforcement of existing trade agreements, and weak or under \n     utilized government support for trade promotion.\n\n     SEC. 3. NEGOTIATION PERIOD REGARDING CURRENCY NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall begin bilateral and multilateral negotiations \n     for a 90-day period with those governments of nations \n     determined to be engaged most egregiously in currency \n     manipulation, as defined in section 7, to seek a prompt and \n     orderly end to such currency manipulation and to ensure that \n     the currencies of these countries are freely traded on \n     international currency markets, or are established at a level \n     that reflects a more appropriate and accurate market value. \n     The President shall seek support in this process from \n     international agencies and other nations and regions \n     adversely affected by these currency practices.\n\n     SEC. 4. FINDINGS OF FACT AND REPORT REGARDING CURRENCY \n                   MANIPULATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 90-day negotiation period \n     described in section 3, the International Trade Commission \n     shall--\n       (1) ascertain and develop the full facts and details \n     concerning how countries have acted to manipulate their \n     currencies to increase their exports to the United States and \n     limit their imports of United States products;\n       (2) quantify the extent of this currency manipulation;\n       (3) examine in detail how these currency practices have \n     affected and will continue to affect United States \n     manufacturers and United States trade levels, both for \n     imports and exports;\n       (4) review whether and to what extent reduction of currency \n     manipulation and the accumulation of dollar-denominated \n     currency reserves and public debt instruments might adversely \n     affect United States interest rates and public debt \n     financing;\n       (5) make a determination of any and all available \n     mechanisms for redress under applicable international trade \n     treaties and agreements, including the Articles of Agreement \n     of the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization Agreements, \n     and United States trade laws; and\n       (6) undertake other appropriate evaluations of the issues \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (5).\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the International Trade Commission \n     shall provide a detailed report to the President, the United \n     States Trade Representative, the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     and the appropriate congressional committees on the findings \n     made as a result of the reviews undertaken under paragraphs \n     (1) through (6) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CURRENCY \n                   MANIPULATION.\n\n       At the end of the 90-day negotiation period provided for in \n     section 3, if agreements are not reached by the President to \n     promptly end currency manipulation, the President shall \n     institute proceedings under the relevant provisions of \n     international law and United States trade laws including \n     sections 301 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to \n     those countries that, based on the findings of the \n     International Trade Commission under section 4, continue to \n     engage in the most egregious currency manipulation. In \n     addition to seeking a prompt end to currency manipulation, \n     the President shall seek appropriate damages and remedies for \n     the Nation's manufacturers and other affected parties. If the \n     President does not institute action, the President shall, not \n     later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     provide to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     detailed explanation and accounting of precisely why the \n     President has determined not to institute action.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       (a) National Security.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     a detailed report to the appropriate congressional committees \n     evaluating the effects on our national security of countries \n     engaging in significant currency manipulations, and the \n     effect of such manipulation on critical manufacturing sectors \n     such as semiconductors.\n       (b) Other Unfair Trade Practices.--Within 90 days of the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the United States Trade \n     Representative and the International Trade Commission shall \n     evaluate and report in detail to the appropriate \n     congressional committees on other trade practices and trade \n     barriers by major East Asian trading nations potentially in \n     violation of international trade agreements, including the \n     practice of maintaining a value-added or other tax regime \n     that effectively discriminates against imports by \n     underpricing domestically produced goods.\n       (c) Trade Enforcement.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative \n     and the International Trade Commission shall report in detail \n     to the appropriate congressional committees on steps that \n     could be taken to significantly improve trade enforcement \n     efforts against unfair trade practices by competitor trading \n     nations, including making recommendations for additional \n     support for trade enforcement efforts.\n       (d) Trade Promotion.--Within 90 days of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretaries of State and Commerce, \n     and the United States Trade Representative, shall prepare a \n     detailed report with recommendations on steps that could be \n     undertaken to significantly improve trade promotion for \n     United States goods and services, including recommendations \n     on additional support to improve trade promotion.\n\n     SEC. 7. CURRENCY MANIPULATION DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``currency manipulation'' means--\n       (1) large-scale manipulation of exchange rates by a nation \n     in order to gain an unfair competitive advantage as stated in \n     Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International \n     Monetary Fund and related surveillance provisions;\n       (2) sustained, large-scale currency intervention in one \n     direction, through mandatory foreign exchange sales at a \n     nation's central bank at a fixed exchange rate; or\n       (3) other mechanisms, used to maintain a currency at a \n     fixed exchange rate relative to another currency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/08/senate-section/article/S11189-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1589.
