Madam President, what I wish to talk about this \nmorning is the overall issue of marriage, and I will go through some \ncharts, factual information, and some data. It is a current topic. It \nis one of great interest in the country. What I want to do is back up \nand say, Why is this institution even significant to us as a country? \nWhy would a governing body be interested in marriage at all? Isn't this \njust simply a private matter?\n  What I want to do is go through, on a factual basis, and outline and \nmake clear why marriage is so important to a government. At the end of \nthe day, it comes back to raising children in a society to be \nproductive, good, strong, healthy citizens, and the best setting to do \nthat in is between two married biological parents, if at all possible, \nmale and female. That is what all the statistical studies show. That is \nwhat the sociological studies show. I want to go through that because \nit lays the groundwork for why we are interested in marriage in a \ngovernmental body.\n  It turns out that if you have strong families, at the end of the day \nyou are going to need less government infrastructure and support for \nthem. If you have a very weakened family structure, you are going to \nneed a lot more governmental structure to surround that child to make \nup for the lack of two dedicated male-female biological parents.\n  This is not to say people cannot raise good children outside of that \nsetting, because people do, and they struggle sometimes heroically to \nget it done, and they get it done. I want to recognize and honor them \nas well.\n  I want to talk about the macropicture as a broad society. As a \nsociety of millions of people, why are we interested in it? The reason \nis that, by and large, it produces stronger, more capable citizenry.\n  In the wake of all the recent debates about defending marriage from \nsome of the new and unique challenges it faces and promoting marriage \nas an essential component in addressing some of our more intractable \nsocial problems in this country, I think it is important we come back \nto some fundamental questions: What is marriage? Why is it important to \nthe health and continuance of our society? Why is the Government \ninterested in marriage at all?\n  The answers to these fundamental questions are no longer so obvious \nor self-evident, as is apparent from the fact that many today question \nour civilization's traditional understandings of the institution of \nmarriage, its purpose, its necessity for society, and its role in \npreventing social breakdown.\n\n  Before we can argue fruitfully about what marriage is not, we have to \nhave a good understanding of what it is, why it is valuable, and why it \nmust be defended as an essential bulwark of this great Nation of ours. \nThe stronger the marriages we have between a man and woman in this \ncountry, bonded together for life, the stronger the country is going to \nbe.\n  Marriage has been central to the understanding of family in Western \nculture from the beginning, and central to our historical concept of \nmarriage has been the rearing of and orientation toward children. It is \nin this setting that children have the most likelihood of coming out \nsuccessfully. This traditional understanding is a far cry from a \npostmodern deconstruction of marriage by a large number of sociologists \nand academics today, many of whom hold that the unique character of \nmarriage is simply ``public approval and recognition.'' In other words, \nmarriage is whatever controlling public authority says it is, whatever \ncurrent public opinion is.\n  Our civilization's historical understanding of marriage and the \nconsequent recognition by the State of the unique nature of this one \nrelationship reflect the fact that the public recognition of the \ninstitution of marriage is not primarily about the granting of rights \nand liberties but about the imposition of burdens.\n  Under the law, marriage limits rather than increases individual \nfreedom. As family scholar Allan Carlson points out, marriage laws \ncommonly mandate the sharing of earnings and debts, compelling \nobligations of mutual support, and limit rights to terminate the \nrelationship. These are all limitations on the two people involved.\n  Why is it that governments leave all other relationship between \nindividuals free but continue to register and in a sense burden these \nheterosexual unions? The answer--and I will go through this in a number \nof charts and statistics--is children, beings at once highly vulnerable \nand essential for the future of every community. Strong and stable \nmarriages receive public approbation because it is a source of citizens \nable to practice ordered liberty. So children are the key to the puzzle \nabout the unique treatment of heterosexual unions and traditional \nmarriage.\n  As author Maggie Gallagher has written:\n\n       Marriage is the place where having children is not only \n     tolerated but welcomed and encouraged, because it gives \n     children mothers and fathers.\n\n  That should seem very basic. This is not to say that marriage is not \nimportant to society for a host of other reasons as well. Traditional \nmarriage is a boon to society in a variety of ways, and Government has \na vital interest in encouraging and providing the conditions to \nmaintain as many traditional marriages as possible.\n  Marriage has economic benefits, not only for the spouses but for the \neconomy at large. Even in advanced industrial societies such as ours, \neconomists tell us that the uncounted but real value of home \nactivities, such as childcare, home carpentry, and food preparation, is \nstill at least as large as that of the official economy. Not least of \nthe reasons marriage is a positive social good is the fact that in the \nmarried state, adults of both sexes are vastly healthier, happier, \nsafer, wealthier, and live longer.\n\n  Here is an instance where social science, viewed honestly, confirms \nwhat common wisdom has always told us: Traditional marriage between a \nman and a woman is a good thing. It is not only good for the spouses, \nit is absolutely vital for the children.\n  Now again, we know from study after study that the children of intact \ntraditional marriages are also much healthier in body, spirit, and \nmind, more successful in school and life, and much less likely to use \nillegal drugs, abuse alcohol, or engage in crime. That is not to say \npeople cannot raise healthy children in other settings. They can and \nthey do, and they struggle mightily to get it done. This is the best \nsetting.\n  As a result, though, one can always confidently conclude that \ntraditional marriage is also a social good because it dramatically \nreduces the social costs associated with dysfunctional behavior. \nSupporting and strengthening marriage significantly diminishes public\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nexpenditures on welfare, raises Government revenues, and produces a \nmore engaged responsible citizenry.\n  On the other hand, as seen today, most dramatically in modern \nsocieties such as ours, where the institution of marriage has been \nthreatened and under attack for decades, with high rates of divorce and \ncohabitation, combined with low birthrates, there is a real question \nabout the vibrancy of future societies that do not uphold traditional \nmarriage. It is ironic, then, that the very governments that benefit \nfrom intact traditional unions have in recent years seemed determined \nto follow policies that have the effect of weakening marriage.\n  There is a clear consensus about the benefits of stable marriages to \nchildren, and that consensus is growing. Child Trends, a mainstream \nchild welfare organization, has noted that:\n\n       Research clearly demonstrates that family structure matters \n     for children, and the family structure that helps the most is \n     a family headed by two biological parents in a low-conflict \n     marriage. Children in single-parent families, children born \n     to unmarried mothers, and children in stepfamilies or \n     cohabiting relationships face higher risks of poor outcomes. \n     . . .\n\n  Not that they do not have in many cases very good outcomes, but they \nface higher risk of poor outcomes.\n\n       There is thus value for children in promoting strong, \n     stable marriages between biological parents.\n\n  It is not just any relationship between any two adults that provides \nchildren with the stability and nurture they need to thrive; it is a \nstrong, stable marriage between biological parents. Again, social \nscience seems to confirm what our common sense tells us: Children need \na mom and a dad.\n  We cannot lose sight of the importance of fathers in this discussion \nof marriage. While it has become fashionable to champion a wide variety \nof alternative family forums, it is abundantly clear that children are \nmuch less likely to thrive in the absence of their biological father. \nChildren who grow up without their fathers are two to three times more \nlikely to fail at school and two to three times more likely to suffer \nfrom an emotional or behavioral problem. They are five times more \nlikely to be poor. Nearly 80 percent of all children suffering long-\nterm poverty come from broken or never-married families.\n\n  This is the first chart I wanted to show about developmental problems \nare less common in two-parent families, the red chart being single-\nparent families and the second one being two-parent families. Virtually \nhalf the level, the lower half of class academically, developmental \ndelay, emotional or behavioral problems--all of those problems are \nnearly cut in half in a two-parent family.\n  I want to show next, on the child poverty issue, nearly 80 percent of \nall children suffering long-term poverty come from broken or never-\nmarried families. This is the number of children, total population, \nthat are in the situation of poverty. Twenty-two percent are children \nof intact married couples, and the rest in the various other areas are \nchildren born in marriage subsequently divorced; children born out of \nwedlock, mother subsequently marries; children of never-married \nmothers. Virtually 80 percent are those involved in poverty.\n  The crisis of child poverty in this country is, in large degree, a \ncrisis of marriage. That is why in the welfare reform bill there has \nbeen so much push on the issue of marriage, because with marriage comes \na much better chance that this child is not going to be in a situation \nof poverty. It is not saying that is going to be in all circumstances; \nit is not. But the odds get much improved. The percentage of children \nof intact families living in poverty is very small compared to those in \nfamilies where the father is not present.\n  Marriage has the effect of lifting families and children out of \npoverty. After the birth of a child out of wedlock, only 17 percent of \npoor mothers and children remain poor if the mother marries the child's \nfather. More than half of those mothers and children remain poor if the \nmother remains single.\n  I am saying this, and some people may be uneasy about what the facts \nsay, but this is what the situation is. We have had this vast social \nexperiment of fathers being removed from families or leaving families \nin an increasing amount over the past number of decades and we have the \ndata now. It is important for governments that we have a two-\nbiological-parents traditional family.\n  This chart indicates the impact of marriage on poverty based on the \nnonmarried father's actual earnings, percentage of mothers and children \nwho are poor. If the mother remains single, it is 55 percent; if the \nmother marries the child's father, it is 17 percent. Divorce, on the \nother hand, impoverishes families and children. It has been estimated \nthe average income of families with children declines by 42 percent \nafter divorce. Divorce has hit my family. It has hit many families--\nmost families across this country. I know the impact of it, in siblings \nin my family.\n\n  Children who grow up fatherless are also at a much increased risk of \nserious child abuse. A child whose mother cohabits with a man who is \nnot the child's father is 33 times more likely to suffer abuse than a \nchild living with both biological parents in an intact marriage. What a \ntough situation for that child.\n  Married mothers are also half as likely to be victims of domestic \nviolence than mothers who have never been married. As teenagers, \nfatherless children are more likely to commit crime, engage in early \nand promiscuous sexual activity, and to commit suicides.\n  It is clear both children and societies as a whole pay an enormous \nprice for fatherless homes. The American people realize this. There is \na Gallup poll from several years ago that showed almost 80 percent of \nthe public agrees with the proposition that ``the most significant \nfamily or social problem facing America is the physical absence of the \nfather from the home.''\n  It is a problem that requires urgent attention in our country. Nearly \n25 million children today reside in a home where the father is absent--\n25 million children. Half of these children have never stepped foot in \ntheir father's home--12.5 million have never stepped foot in their \nfather's home.\n  Less than half of all teenagers currently live with their married \nbiological mothers and fathers. On this chart, that is the point I just \nmade: Less than half of all teenagers live with their married \nbiological mothers and fathers.\n  This year, approximately 1 million children will endure the divorce \nof their parents and an additional 1.2 million will be born out of \nwedlock. Altogether the proportion of children entering broken families \nhas more than quadrupled since 1950.\n  This is a crisis for both our children and our country, the fact that \nso many children are growing up without dads. It has been exacerbated \nby the decline of the institution of marriage.\n  In the year 2000, the proportion of never-married women between the \nages of 25 to 29 reached 39 percent; in 1965 it was less than 10 \npercent. Among men, the proportion who have never married from that age \ngroup went from 18 percent to 44 percent in the same time period. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, the number of cohabiting couples has \nincreased from half a million to almost 5 million in the last 30 years. \nThe number of households with neither marriage nor children present has \ngone from about 7 million in 1960 to just under 41 million in 2000. \nWhile married-couple families were 76 percent of all households in \n1960, they constitute barely 50 percent today. Divorce rates have \ndoubled every decade between 1960 and 1990, and while now they appear \nto have leveled off, they are still at historically high levels.\n\n  This is the percentage of adults in the population that is married \ncompared to the percentage of the population that is divorced. You can \nsee what it was in 1970: married 72 percent, divorced 3 percent; in \n2002, 59 percent married, 10 percent divorced.\n  Public policy must focus on reinforcing the institution of marriage \nif we are to make progress in addressing many of the most difficult \nproblems we face as a society. While welfare reform, for instance, has \nbeen an undeniable success in cutting half the caseloads, it is clear \nthe next step must include addressing what is the core issue, the \ndecline of marriage and the absence of fathers from families. We \ncertainly cannot mandate the involvement of biological fathers with \ntheir families, but we can do everything possible to support the most \nproven and effective\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\npathway to responsible parental engagement, and that is marriage. We \nmust continue to work to change the policies that in effect punish the \ndecision to marry, such as welfare rules that make it more difficult \nfor married couples with children to qualify in comparison to single-\nparent families.\n  We must work to address the decline of traditional marriage. Unless \nwe provide, as a society, cultural reinforcement for the often \ndifficult path of loyal, committed, monogamous, heterosexual unions, we \nshould not expect to see the institution of marriage thrive.\n  If society says the family structure does not matter, what is the \nincentive to get or to stay married when the road gets rough, which it \noften does? As one marriage expert has said, ``If marriage is just a \nway of publicly celebrating private love, then there is no need to \nencourage couples to stick it out for the sake of children. If family \nstructure does not matter, why have marriage laws at all? Do adults or \ndo they not have a basic obligation to control their desires so that \nchildren can have mothers and fathers?''\n  That, my colleagues, is the real question in the marriage debate. \nThat is why we have a vital interest in defending the institution of \ntraditional marriage from attempts to define it out of existence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to say a few words regarding some \nof the accusations we have seen in recent times coming out of the 9/11 \nhearing and the Richard Clarke allegations in his book. I think it is \nimportant, through all the clutter, for the American people to \nunderstand one point, if they understand anything, about all the debate \nand the politics and the political rhetoric and posturing that is going \non surrounding this issue. That is a question that was asked during the \ncourse of the Commission hearing by Commissioner Gorton.\n  I think it is absolutely critical for the American people to \nunderstand both this question and this answer by Mr. Clarke. The \nquestion is from Commissioner Gorton of the 9/11 Commission, inquiring \ninto the causes and circumstances giving rise to 9/11:\n\n       . . . Assuming that the recommendations that you made on \n     January 25th of 2001 . . . which had been an agenda item at \n     this point for 2\\1/2\\ years without any action . . . assuming \n     that that had all been adopted say on January 26th, [when \n     President Bush came to office] year 2001, is there the \n     remotest chance that it would have prevented 9/11?\n\n  Mr. Clarke answered, ``No.''\n  I believe the American people need to understand that Mr. Clarke is \nnot assigning blame to President Bush or his administration for what \nhappened on 9/11, nor could he. As a matter of fact, we had seen, \nduring the preceding years of the Clinton administration when Mr. \nClarke held the role of counterterrorism chief, a number of attacks \nagainst the United States of America and against our soil.\n  In 1993, Osama bin Laden directed al-Qaida's first successful \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil, blowing up a car bomb in the basement \ngarage of the World Trade Center in New York City killing 6 and \nwounding 1,000. In 1996, there was another attack on the U.S. Air \nForce's Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia killing 19 Americans and \nwounding 515 Americans and Saudis. In 1998, U.S. embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania were attacked by al-Qaida suicide bombers who killed 234 \npeople and wounded more than 5,000. In 2000, al-Qaida attacked the USS \nCole killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39.\n  So it is clear that during the preceding 8 years that Osama bin Laden \nhad been terrorizing America and taking American lives in the process.\n  It is simply unfair for Mr. Clarke, or anyone else for that matter, \nto suggest that during the 8 months President Bush was in office that \nhe should have or could have somehow done anything more than was done \nto try to prevent the events of 9/11. And, indeed, Mr. Clarke in a \nflash of candor through all of the attempts he has made to try to \npromote his new book--and, by the way, he has been very successful; I \nsee on Amazon.Com his book is the No. 1 or No. 2 most ordered book. He \nhas been very successful in promoting his book--but in a flash of \namazing candor, we see that he now admits there is nothing the Bush \nadministration could have done in 8 months that the Clinton \nadministration had not done in 8 years to prevent the tragic events of \n9/11.\n  Some in Washington, DC, I guess we have all come to learn, are world-\nclass second guessers. Now armed with the benefit of hindsight, there \nare those who want to pick through the rubble, through e-mails, and \nthrough memos to try to assign blame.\n  But we ought to be clear about this: The blame for what happened on \n9/11 lies squarely with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida--not on the \nAmerican people, not on President Clinton and his administration, and \nnot on the President or his administration. These are good, patriotic \nAmericans who I am confident were doing everything they knew of that \nthey could possibly do to prevent the terrible tragedy this Nation \nsuffered on 9/11.\n  It is insulting that anyone would suggest this administration or the \nprevious administration, now with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, might \nhave done something to stop this unfathomable horror.\n  It is important to place responsibility where it lies; and that is \nwith al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden.\n  We also find ourselves in a strange new dimension where on the one \nhand President Bush is criticized for acting too decisively to take out \nal-Qaida, to take down the Taliban government in Afghanistan and then \nremove a bloodthirsty tyrant in Saddam Hussein, and now, on the other \nhand, these same critics want to complain that he should have done \nmore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was told that the Senator from Texas \ndidn't understand what I said. What I said earlier was that Senator \nDaschle wanted to speak and that is why I objected. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time on both sides be extended for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  We ought to be very clear about where the blame lies for the events \nof September 11.\n  But I point out one thing: President Bush has acted as decisively as \nany leader could have possibly acted in removing the Taliban from \nAfghanistan, by disrupting the training camps of al-Qaida in that \ncountry and then acting decisively against Saddam Hussein. The United \nNations issued 14 different resolutions threatening him with the use of \nforce if he did not comply with those resolutions, which he had never \ncomplied with during the entire course of the post-gulf-war period from \n1991.\n  I think most Americans would be a little surprised to learn we never \nhad a peace treaty after 1991, because Saddam Hussein continued to defy \nthe\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nUnited Nations and the free world by his continued acts of avoiding \nUnited Nations inspections. He played a game of cat and mouse. Just \nwhen he thought we were developing the courage--the United Nations and \nothers--to take him to task, he would relent temporarily only to kick \nthe inspectors out and continue to defy the United Nations inspections.\n  My final point is there are some, including the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who have called the war in Iraq ``another Vietnam.'' The \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, I think did as good a job as possibly \ncould have been done--certainly a person who has enormous credibility \non that issue, having served so ably in Vietnam and, unfortunately, \nhaving been a prisoner of war there for a time--I think he did a very \ngood job of refuting that and really showing the truth about that sort \nof scurrilous accusation. It is the kind of speech I worry has the \npossibility of a tremendously negative effect on our war on terror.\n  Our enemies should not be confused about our commitment to follow \nthrough, win the war on terror and crush our enemies in the process.\n  I grew up during the course of the Vietnam war. I remember what it \nwas like in this country when our men and women in the field returned \nto this country only to find the American people did not support them \nas they should have and where America lost its resolve and strength of \nwill. We should never let that happen again. It was a terrible American \ntragedy. For anyone to suggest that America is going to suffer loss of \nwill or resolve in winning this war on terror is simply wrong.\n  I think we should not be fooled into thinking when Senators or any \ngovernment official or anyone stands up and equates what is happening \nin Iraq and what is happening in Afghanistan and what is happening \ngenerally in the war on terror with Vietnam--they are providing fodder \nfor our enemies. They are encouraging our enemies to think that perhaps \nwe will lose our resolve and give rise to, I think, increased attacks \nagainst our troops on the ground and undermining our war effort \ngenerally.\n  I certainly don't suppose anyone is doing that intentionally. But I \nthink we need to be careful about the words we use.\n  I know a short time remains in our morning business. I see the \ndistinguished majority whip on the floor.\n  I would say in closing that words are important. Words have meaning. \nThe words that are said today won't be remembered just in the context \nof election year and partisan politics; they will stand in history for \nfuture generations to read and study with a critical eye. In the end, \nwe must focus on the battle with our common foe and not on each other.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S3963-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, there is no question the terrorists \nare at war with us. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly apparent \nin Washington we are at war with each other.\n  The September 11 Commission is holding hearings right now. It has an \nadmirable goal of investigating the reasons that our immigration, \nintelligence, law enforcement, military, and legal systems failed to \nprevent 19 Islamic radicals from hijacking planes and using them as \nweapons of terror so we can prevent such lapses in the future.\n  Already the Bush administration and Congress have acted to reform \nnumerous agencies and procedures to deter and to prevent future \nterrorist attacks on our country. What have we done? We have responded \nto terrorism vigorously by attacking the terrorists where they live and \nconfronting the regimes that support them, rather than by lobbing a few \ncruise missiles at an empty desert tent.\n  We created the Department of Homeland Security to put all domestic \nsecurity agencies under one roof. We overwhelmingly passed the USA \nPATRIOT Act which provides law enforcement agencies the tools they need \nto monitor, apprehend, and convict terrorists. We have cracked down on \nterrorists' financing at home and abroad by shuttering sham charities \nthat fund terror and by freezing terrorists' assets. We have \nstreamlined and reformed the intelligence agencies and are working to \nimprove coordination among the many agencies responsible for protecting \nAmerica.\n  Hopefully, the Commission will identify additional methods to improve \nU.S. security, but forgive me for not being terribly optimistic. I fear \nthe Commission has lost sight of its goal and has become a political \ncasualty of the electoral hunting season.\n\n  Sadly, the Commission's public hearings have allowed those with \npolitical axes to grind, such as Richard Clarke, to play shamelessly to \nthe partisan gallery of liberal special interests seeking to bring down \nthe President. These special interest groups have undeniably exploited \nthe Commission for political gain. Moveon.org, for example, the ultra \nliberal organization that opposed America's liberation of both Iraq and \nAfghanistan--Moveon.org opposed the liberation of Afghanistan as well \nas Iraq--is funding TV ads that use Clarke's voice to accuse President \nBush of not doing enough to stop terrorism. Moveon.org will launch a \n$200,000 ad campaign that restates this claim during CNN's coverage of \nDr. Rice's testimony before the Commission this morning.\n  Clarke himself, publicly and under oath, has said he believes that \neven had the President implemented every single one of the suggestions \nhe made to the President when he came into office, we would still not \nhave been able to prevent the September 11 attacks. Let's take a look \nat that again. Mr. Clarke himself has said that even if President Bush \nhad done everything he recommended to the President, we could not have \nprevented the September 11 attacks.\n  Before deciding to profit from his revisionist history, Clarke argues \npersuasively that President Bush's policy to combat terrorism was more \naggressive than that of his predecessor. Clarke noted that President \nBush expressed frustration with the previous policy of ``swatting at \nflies'' and that the President authorized a fivefold increase for \ncovert operations against terrorists in Afghanistan.\n  The Washington blame game has distracted us from the important task \nat hand: Winning the war against the terrorists. The only entity \nresponsible for September 11 was al-Qaida. We need a real debate in \nAmerica about how to prosecute the war against terrorism because there \nare two fundamentally different schools of thought about how to win \nthis war, two fundamentally different philosophies about how to win \nthis war.\n  On the one hand, there are the President's critics who define \nterrorism so narrowly as to include only the terrorists directly \nresponsible for September 11, and not the many other terrorist groups \ncurrently plotting attacks against America and her allies. They believe \nthis war can be fought under the auspices of the U.N., if only America \nwould yield to the French or the Russians or the Chinese. They are \nunwilling to act alone when others refuse to confront by force those \nwho choose death over life and violence over peace.\n  On the other hand, there are those who believe that al-Qaida is \nmerely one head of the hydra and that to kill the beast of terrorism \nyou must drain the swamp in which the beast lives and the terrorists \nthrive. We have done that in Afghanistan, we are doing that in Iraq, \nand we must do it everywhere terrorism thrives.\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\n  Some critics, such as the junior Senator from Massachusetts, have \nargued that the war in Iraq is a distraction and that the global war on \nterrorism has actually been set back as a result of draining the swamp \nin Iraq. Senator Kerry's reversal on Iraq was wrong and his refusal to \nsupport $87 billion for U.S. troops for reconstruction in Iraq and \nAfghanistan stands as a stark rebuttal to President John F. Kennedy's \ncall to ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support \nany friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success \nof liberty.''\n\n  This war is not an isolated fight against al-Qaida but a global \ncompetition with a shadowy evil that lurks on every continent. It is a \nfight against the very enemies of freedom. We must never ever shrink \nfrom that fight. Terrorists do not reside in Afghanistan alone. It \nwould be dangerously irresponsible to focus single-mindedly on al-Qaida \nwhile neglecting the other real threats facing our Nation. There is no \ndoubt that terrorists reside in Iraq. We see evidence of this fact \nevery single day on television.\n  Those who claim that Iraq is a distraction in the war against \nterrorism have very short memories, conveniently short memories. They \nhave already forgotten that the Clinton administration State Department \nlisted Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism--that is the Clinton \nadministration: Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism--and that Saddam \nHussein provided safe haven to international terrorists. We all know he \nmade cash payments to families of suicide bombers among Palestinians.\n  Now the terrorists are currently making a desperate stand to prevent \nthe establishment of an oasis of freedom in the heart of the Middle \nEast. If we fail to eradicate the terrorists in Iraq, we will fail to \ndefeat terrorism anywhere.\n  Waffling on our commitment to Iraq would convince the terrorists that \nAmerica is little more than a paper tiger, and it would undermine our \nglobal efforts to deter other rogue states, such as Iraq and North \nKorea, from supporting terrorism.\n  We must not allow Iraq to become another Somalia. Going home early is \nthe surest way to embolden the terrorists and to ensure the failure of \nour efforts to bring peace and security to the Middle East.\n  It was said the other day that Iraq is Bush's Vietnam. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. It may be Japan or Germany or Korea, but it \nis not Vietnam. We face lingering threats and challenges in those \nconflicts, but by staying the course we heralded in decades of freedom \nand prosperity in places such as Japan, Germany, and Korea. That is \nwhat will be done in Iraq.\n  Victory in Iraq is now central to our war against terrorism, and not \nonly because it is preferable to fighting terrorists in Iraq rather \nthan in New York. A free Iraq represents a mortal blow to the \nterrorists' goal of a radicalized Middle East.\n  Until you change the politics of the Middle East, Islamic \nfundamentalists are going to keep trying to kill Americans, and not \neven the best defenses will be able to prevent every conceivable attack \nagainst us here at home.\n  Establishing a democratic and economic beachhead in the backyard of \nradical Islam is itself a major success in the war against terrorism. \nIndeed, that is precisely why foreign terrorists are so committed to \npreventing the Iraqis from building a democracy in the heart of the \nMiddle East.\n  The war against terrorism must be fought outside of Afghanistan, and \nit must continue after bin Laden is dead or behind bars; otherwise, we \nwill find ourselves as vulnerable as we were on September 10. We cannot \nkeep America safe by distinguishing between terrorists who have \nattacked us and terrorists who want to attack us.\n  In conclusion, I close with a quote from Michael Kelly, who died a \nyear ago in Iraq while covering the war from the tip of the spear as an \nembedded journalist with the Third Infantry Division. He wrote in \nFebruary before our liberation of Iraq about our cause in Iraq and the \nchallenges we would face. Here is what Michael Kelly had to say:\n\n       There is risk; and if things go terribly wrong it is a risk \n     that could result in terrible suffering. But that is an \n     equation that is present in any just war, and in this case \n     any rational expectation has to consider the probable cost to \n     humanity to be low and the probable benefit to be tremendous. \n     To choose perpetuation of tyranny over rescue from tyranny, \n     where rescue may be achieved, is immoral.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would say I agree with my friend that \nthe situation in Iraq is not a Vietnam. But it is Iraq. I would hope \nthe comparisons made to Korea and Japan and Germany do not apply.

Madam President, we have worked very hard on this side of \nthe aisle to pass S. 1637, which is the bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code to comply with World Trade Organization rulings, the so-\ncalled FSC bill. I want everyone to understand on our side of the aisle \nand on the other side of the aisle that Senator Daschle made to the \nmajority leader, last night, I think, a proposal that should have been \naccepted last night; that is, from the 75 amendments that have been \nproposed on our side, that has been reduced to approximately 20 \namendments, with very short time agreements on the 20, nothing more \nthan 30 minutes, and one amendment is for as little as 5 minutes.\n  I also suggest that if we look at what has happened with this piece \nof legislation, there has been nothing on our side that has been \ndilatory. We have wanted to move forward on this bill, but in the \nentire time we have worked on this bill we have voted once. If you go \nback to years past, when a tax bill comes before the Senate, it is not \nunusual to have more than 100 amendments offered and disposed of here \nin the Senate.\n  I think the good-faith offer made by the Democratic leader to the \nRepublican leader is something that should be accepted. This is a \nproposal that would be good for the country, and it is in keeping with \nwhat we have tried to do on this piece of legislation--let the Senate \nact in accordance with the traditions of the Senate. It is a far cry \nfrom what we should have been doing this past 2 weeks. We could have \nworked our way through all of these amendments, but that has not been \ndone.\n  I would suggest it would be in the best interests of the country that \nthe offer made by the Democratic leader to the Republican leader be \naccepted at the earliest possible date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Madam President, in 2 weeks, this Nation will celebrate \nEarth Day. The first Earth Day was in 1970, 34 years ago. For three and \na half decades, people from all walks of life have gathered on April 22 \nto celebrate the environment.\n  Since the first Earth Day, our Nation has had seven Presidents, \nincluding our current leader, President Bush. Four of the six former \nPresidents were Republicans: President Nixon, President\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nFord, President Reagan, and former President Bush.\n  Each of these former Presidents has left their mark on our Nation's \nenvironment. For the next 10 minutes, I want to review the major policy \nand legislative accomplishments--and there were many--of these former \nPresidents.\n  At the same time, I will point out what the administration--the \ncurrent Bush administration--is doing to that legacy left by four \nformer Presidents.\n  That contrast is stark. Many of you would be surprised to learn that \nPresident Nixon's lasting policy legacy may well be on the environment. \nPresident Nixon signed into law some of the most comprehensive and \nsweeping environmental laws. Here is a list on this chart: National \nEnvironmental Protection Act, which was the basis for a lot of these \nsituations; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; Endangered Species \nAct; Marine Mammal Protection Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  We would all agree this is an impressive list. For the sake of time, \nI will not read the list for each of the subsequent three Republican \nPresidents. But the list is, in some cases, equally impressive.\n  Let's look at President Ford. The chart shows his greatest \nenvironmental accomplishment may be the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act. The bill helped reduce our Nation's solid waste output \nand has increased reuse and recycling.\n  Now let's go to President Reagan's list on this chart. This is \namazing to some of us who didn't think we necessarily were doing much. \nThe list includes: the Endangered Species Act; Safe Drinking Water Act; \nClean Water Act reintroduced; Hazardous and Solid Waste Act, amending \nRCRA; Safe Drink Water Act amended; Superfund Amendments and \nReauthorization Act; Nuclear Waste Policy Act; Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, and the Lacy Act amended.\n  They all built great environmental records that make all of us proud. \nI was Republican at the time, and we were proud of the environmental \nrecord these Presidents produced.\n  Now I want to go back to President Bush, senior, for a moment. His \nlist was fairly solid. His greatest environmental achievement may have \nbeen the Clean Air Act. Being on that committee at the time, I was \ninvolved in negotiating these changes. It wasn't easy. Sometimes we all \nhave to give a little to get a lot. But there were results from his \nefforts.\n  Now we come to the current President Bush. Remember, we are simply \nlooking at Republican Presidents and their significant environmental \nrecords. We are not going to the Democratic Presidents. Let's look at \nhis chart. There it is. There is nothing there. It is blank. There is \nnot one legislative accomplishment of importance on the environmental \nissue. None.\n\n  I bet you would like to know what they have been doing for the last 4 \nyears on environmental policy. Or maybe you would not. I will tell you \nanyway.\n  The Bush administration has been at war with the Clean Air Act. The \nBush administration has proposed to gut the Clean Water Act. The Bush \nadministration has bankrupted Superfund, ending the cleanup of toxic \nwaste sites. The Bush administration has slashed funding for drinking \nwater and wastewater. The Bush administration has slowed and almost \nshut down environmental enforcement.\n  The next chart--need I continue?\n  Here is President Bush's record. What are these on the chart? These \nare environmental rollbacks. If we can take a look at this chart, it \nsays: Weakening the new source review section of the Clean Air Act; no \nFederal oversight on the cleanup of nearly 300,000 miles of rivers and \n5 million acres of lakes; delays in requiring national pollutant \ndischarge elimination system permits; opens more public land for toxic \nwaste dumps; loosens regulations on mercury emissions; exempts Pentagon \nfrom the ESA and MMPA rules; exemptions from Montreal Protocol for the \npesticide methylbromide; withdrew the TMLL rule set to take effect \nunder the Clean Water Act; increased fuel efficiency standards by a \nmere 1.5 miles per gallon over 3 years; capped wilderness designation \nat 22.8 million acres nationwide, no more; Clear Skies plan curbs \nmercury emissions to only 2 to 14 tons reduction by 2010; does not \npursue legal investigations of polluting facilities accused of \nviolating Clean Air Act and water standards; also, they have \nunderfunded Superfund.\n  The administration has a growing credibility gap, maybe even a \ncredibility chasm on air pollution policy and environmental policy in \ngeneral. I believe the President has lost the trust of the American \npeople when it comes to the environment.\n  There are opportunities for him to rebuild this trust, but I doubt \nthat any of the suggestions that have been given will be taken \nseriously.\n  When this President came into office, I had the greatest hopes that \nwe could all work together to solve the problems facing the American \npublic. But to put it mildly, I have been greatly disappointed.\n  The former Presidents I mentioned earlier built a legacy of \nenvironmental progress. This legacy is being dismantled. We can only \nhope that a future President will look back and work to rebuild our \nenvironmental protections to make sure this Nation can go on to a \nbetter and a healthier future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have had months of bipartisan \nnegotiations on legislation to enact a national trust fund for victims \nof asbestos-related diseases. I am concerned that our distinguished \nmajority leader and Senator Hatch have now introduced a partisan \nasbestos bill. We all agreed over the past couple of years of hard work \non this issue that only a bipartisan bill will pass.\n  I held the first hearing on the problem of asbestos litigation a \ncouple years ago. We worked closely with Republicans and Democrats, and \nI had hoped the bipartisan dialog over the past year would yield a fair \nand efficient compensation system that we could, in good conscience, \noffer to those suffering today from asbestos-related diseases and also \nto victims yet to come. But I am afraid the Senate majority has decided \nto walk away from those negotiations and to report to unilateralism by \nintroducing a partisan bill.\n  I have offered, as has Senator Daschle, to work very hard on this \nissue. When I heard one was going to be introduced yesterday, I \nactually tried very hard to see if I could get a copy of it. Hours \nafter it was introduced, we were finally given one.\n  We have all learned a great deal about the harms wreaked by asbestos \nexposure since that first Judiciary Committee hearing I talked about \nthat I convened in September of 2002.\n  Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the \nworkplace. Between 1940 and 1980, more than 27.5 million workers in \nthis country were exposed to asbestos on the job. Nearly 19 million of \nthem had high levels of exposure over long periods of time. Even with \nall that, unbelievably, asbestos is still used today.\n\n  What we face is an asbestos-induced disease crisis--hundreds of \nthousands of workers and their families have suffered debilitating \ndisease and death due to asbestos exposure. These are the real victims \nof the asbestos nightmare, and they must be the first and foremost \nfocus of our concern and effort in this body. These are people who, by \nsimply showing up for work, now must endure lives of extreme pain and \nsuffering and often early death.\n  Not only do the victims of asbestos exposure continue to suffer, and \ntheir numbers to grow, but the businesses involved in the litigation, \nalong with their employees and retirees, are suffering from the \neconomic uncertainty created by this legislation.\n  More than 60 companies have filed for bankruptcy, and their \nbankruptcies have a devastating human and economic effect. Those \nvictims who deserve fair compensation, of course, cannot get it from a \nbankrupt company.\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\n  I worked with Senators Daschle, Dodd, Frist, Hatch, and Specter. We \nasked representatives from organized labor, from the trial bar, from \nindustry to help us reach a consensus on our national trust fund to \nfairly compensate asbestos victims and to provide financial certainty \nfor asbestos defendants and their insurers.\n  A successful trust fund--one that will give fair and adequate \ncompensation, would bring reasonable financial certainty to defendant \ncompanies and insurers--includes four essential components: appropriate \nmedical criteria, fair award values, adequate funding, and an efficient \nexpedited system for processing claims.\n  During the markup session of the first FAIR Act, we unanimously \nadopted the Leahy-Hatch amendment on medical criteria. During the \nmediation process established by Senator Specter and Judge Edward \nBecker, the interested stakeholders focused on crafting a streamlined \nadministrative process and both Judge Becker and Senator Specter \ndeserve credit for the enormous amount of work they put in on this. But \nwe have not reached consensus on two other essential components: fair \naward values and adequate funding.\n  Although the changes made to a few award values by Senator Frist \nmoved in the right direction, the bill introduced last night does not \nmove far enough. In fact, seriously ill victims will receive less \ncompensation, on average, under the current version of the FAIR Act \nthan they would in the tort system.\n  Actually, the FAIR Act, as I say on this chart, is not fair. Victims \nwith asbestos-related lung cancer with at least 15 weighted years of \nasbestos exposure could receive only $25,000 in compensation, basically \na crude joke of the victims, especially given most lung cancer victims \nare going to die within 2 years. It is a cruel joke also on their \nfamilies.\n  Not only that, we find they may have their awards reduced or even \neliminated to repay insurance companies. That is so contrary to most \nexisting compensation programs. For example, the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act, and the Ricky Ray Hemophiliac Relief Fund Act \nall contain strong antisubrogation language to protect awards to \nvictims under these compensation programs.\n  Our bipartisan medical criteria have already eliminated what \nbusinesses contended were the most troublesome claims. We all say we \nneed to compensate the truly sick, but fair compensation is not free \ncompensation.\n  Our bipartisan agreement on medical criteria is going to be \nmeaningless if the majority, in effect, rewrites the categories by \nfailing fairly to compensate those who fall within them. We need a \nbalanced solution. We need one that can be supported by all Members in \nthis body.\n  Even with consensus on medical criteria, if the award values are \nunfair, the bill will be unfair and unworthy of our support, which \nsadly is the case with this partisan bill.\n  Since the first hearing on this issue, I have emphasized one bedrock \nprinciple: The solution we reach must be a balanced solution. I cannot \nsupport a bill that gives inadequate compensation to victims. I will \nnot adjust fair award values into some discounted amount to make the \nfinal tally come within a predetermined, artificial limit. That is not \nfair.\n  We have been told, however, the majority will support a bill that \ncontains funding with a goal of raising $109 billion over 24 years. But \nit is clear from projections of future claims this funding is \ninadequate to pay fair award values to present and future asbestos \nvictims. Indeed, it is a cut of more than $40 billion from the total \nfunding approved in the Judiciary Committee under contingency funding \namendments by Senators Feinstein and Kohl. It is not fair. All \nreflections show it is not enough.\n  The partisan emphasis in this bill on the interests of the industrial \nand insurance companies involved, to the detriment of the victims, has \npredictably produced an imbalanced bill. This bill is a reflection of \nthe priorities that went into it. For us to succeed in reaching the \nconsensus solution we have sought for so long, a workable bill should \nfairly reflect, and not discount, the significant benefits a fair \nsolution indisputably would confer on the companies involved. A trust \nfund solution would offer these firms reasonable financial security. \nEven a casual glance at the way the stock values of these firms have \nclosely tracked the Senate's work on this issue is enough to make this \nfact crystal clear.\n  Given all of these serious problems, I believe forcing this new \nasbestos bill through the Senate in its present form would prove \ncounterproductive, even fatal, to the legislative effort. The near \nparty-line vote within the committee on the earlier bill is more of a \nsetback than a step forward even after all of our work. Proceeding \nfurther without consensus would be another mistake.\n  Instead, we should go back to work, build on those areas where we \nhave bipartisan consensus, and then produce a bill that will help the \nasbestos victims in this country, will bring certainty to the companies \nthat are laboring under possible liability, and will let the country go \non with its business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use my leader time under the \norder of the day, and I would make a note I will designate Senator \nKennedy to control the time once we move to the pension conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont for his statement on asbestos. I do not know of anybody in \nour caucus, perhaps in the Senate itself, who has done more and has \nbeen more engaged on this issue for a longer period of time than has \nSenator Leahy. We would do well to listen to his sage advice and his \ncritique of the asbestos legislation that is now working its way on to \nthe Senate calendar.\n  As our Nation continues to grapple with the terrible consequences \nwrought by the use and distribution of asbestos, Senators from both \nsides of the aisle have been working diligently to negotiate a \ncompromise. With each passing day, more victims face serious illness \nand even death, and more workers and companies face the threat of \nbankruptcy.\n  Approximately 1.3 million Americans are still exposed to asbestos at \nwork. Ten thousand Americans die from asbestos-related illnesses each \nyear. That is more than from drownings and fires combined.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, asbestos liability has been a major \nissue for businesses and individuals. In the cities of Aberdeen and \nBrookings, I have talked with the leadership team at 3M to discuss the \nimpact this issue is having on their business.\n  3M employs 1,300 workers whose livelihoods are tied to the company's \nfinancial stability and strength. The corporation's management has told \nme how asbestos lawsuits have begun to overwhelm 3M, as over 300,000 \nsuits have already been filed against their company, even though they \nwere not in the business of producing or manufacturing asbestos.\n  At the same time, there are many South Dakotans who have become sick \nor died because of their exposure to asbestos. For instance, Jack \nArcher from Sioux Falls was a career electrician for 47 years working \non dams along the Missouri River, and in aluminum plants and paper \nmills. After a long day of work, he would often come home covered in \nasbestos, and would shake off the dust and change clothes away from his \nhouse so his children and wife, Maurine, would not be exposed. In \nJanuary 2000 he was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\n  Jack had seen many of his co-workers and friends die from the \ndisease, and knew the illness that awaited him. Once diagnosed, Jack's \nbody deteriorated rapidly, and each day brought more pain than the \nlast. He died in July 2002. His wife now tries to remember his vitality \nand zest for life, rather than the years when cancer got the better of \nhim.\n  Asbestos has created havoc all across the country, in homes and \nneighborhoods, mines and manufacturing plants, financial markets and \nboard rooms. One study states that 300 companies were sued in the \n1980s, while approximately 8,400 companies have been sued as of \n2002. In addition, at least 70 companies have sought bankruptcy \nprotection due to asbestos litigation.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n  Clearly, a solution is needed. For years, I have expressed my strong \ndesire and commitment to find one. As I have said repeatedly, there is \na way for us to craft legislation that could enjoy the overwhelming \nsupport of the Senate, if we put partisan differences aside and develop \na true compromise that adequately compensates victims and provides \nfinancial certainty to companies and insurers.\n  Creating a national asbestos trust fund is an extraordinarily complex \nundertaking. There are a number of issues that all sides agree must be \naddressed: The creation of a no-fault administrative system; the \nequitable allocation of contributions; the establishment of reasonable \nmedical standards; the resolution of pending claims and settlements; \nthe creation of fair compensation values; and ensuring transparency of \nthe system for both victims and corporate stakeholders.\n  Last July, the Judiciary Committee narrowly reported out a bill that \nwas opposed by the American Insurance Association and the AFL-CIO. \nSince that time, there has been much work invested to try to develop a \ncompromise and bridge the differences between the stakeholders. \nHowever, while much progress has been made, there are still several \nvital issues that have yet to be resolved.\n  During the committee markup, a compromise was reached on one of the \nmajor issues, medical criteria. Then, in the past few weeks, a \ncompromise was reached on creation of the administrative structure \nwithin the Department of Labor. Yesterday, a new asbestos bill was \nintroduced. This legislation incorporated some of the agreed upon \ncompromises, and included some improvements.\n  However, it also takes a step backward in other areas. The new \nlegislation dramatically altered or dropped altogether several of the \nkey committee-adopted amendments. For example, the new bill restricts \nthe amendment that would have restored current legal rights to victims \nif the fund runs out of money, adding new obstacles to access to the \ncourts.\n  In addition, the new legislation failed to improve provisions that \ncould limit recovery to only $25,000 for lung cancer patients who were \nexposed to asbestos at work for at least 15 years. That is in the bill. \nThe so-called FAIR bill actually has a provision that says victims with \nasbestos-related lung cancer and 15 weighted years of asbestos exposure \nwould receive only $25,000 in compensation. I literally cannot imagine \nhow anybody could support legislation that says that is all they are \nentitled to. Fifteen years of weighted asbestos exposure, you have \ncancer, there is a connection, and your award under this bill is \n$25,000?\n\n  Finally, it puts the overall funding at $109 billion. Some \nRepublicans argue investment income would boost that up to $114 \nbillion, but this is far from certain. Even $114 billion is grossly \ninadequate.\n  Clearly, there are several fundamental areas that have not been \nresolved. These issues are not new. In fact, before, during, and after \nthe committee markup, Democrats have raised some of these same \nconcerns. For over 6 months we have been clear that $114 billion is \ninsufficient. While we recognize that Republicans are reluctant to \naccept the committee-supported bill of $154 billion, we have expressed \nour willingness to work out a compromise.\n  Time is short. The majority leader has stated his interest to bring \nthe bill to the floor immediately following the April recess. We can \nand should develop a solution.\n  But let me be clear: Securing a bipartisan compromise on asbestos is \none of our top priorities. I stand ready and willing to work with my \ncolleagues to address this important issue. But we will not support and \nwe will do all we can to avoid passing legislation that is not fair, \nthat does not address the problem, that will only compound the problems \nof those who are victims today.\n  I continue to believe that if we work together, we can develop \neffective reform legislation to provide appropriate compensation to the \nvictims of asbestos, while providing a measure of certainty and \nsecurity to American industry.\n  If, however, the Senate proceeds with legislation that does not \nreflect the middle ground, as I have said, we will have missed an \nopportunity to address this vital issue. I think we could all agree the \nstakes are too high to let it slip away.\n  Madam President, how much of my leader time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have another matter I would like to \naddress in the time I have remaining of my leader time, if I could.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S3967-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3967-S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I recently learned the story of a young \nIndian girl from South Dakota. Last year, when she began to lose weight \nand feel stomach pains, she traveled to a nearby Indian Health Service \nclinic. She was diagnosed with heartburn, and since IHS clinics often \ndon't have the resources to treat patients unless their lives are at \nimmediate risk, she was told to go home.\n  Over the course of the next several months, as her condition \nworsened, she returned to the clinic several times only to be turned \naway each time. Because she was never given a full checkup, the clinic \nfailed to discover that her symptoms were not caused by heartburn but \nby stomach cancer. By the time her condition became critical, it was \ntoo late. Her cancer had spread, and there was nothing any doctor could \ndo. Not long afterward, she died.\n  Perhaps the saddest aspect of this story is that it is another \nexample of what happens each and every day. For Native Americans and \nother minority communities across the country, the miracles of modern \nmedicine--and sometimes even the most basic primary care--are beyond \ntheir reach. The disparities within our health care system have reached \na crisis point, and the consequences for America's minority communities \nare staggering.\n  The death rate for African American cancer patients is 30 percent \nhigher than for whites. African Americans are also one-and-a-half times \nmore likely to have coverage for an emergency room visit denied. \nHispanic Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to die from \ndiabetes. American Indiana are 670 percent more likely to die from \nalcoholism and 650 percent more likely to die from tuberculosis.\n  This sad litany of statistics goes on and on and it tells a story of \na health care system that, for a significant and growing portion of our \nNation, is simply broken.\n  This week is National Public Health Week. Appropriately, the American \nPublic Health Association has chosen to focus the Nation's attention \nthis week on the disparities in our health care system and how we can \nfix them.\n  I am grateful for its efforts. America faces few more important or \ncomplex challenges than building a world-class health care system for \neveryone, regardless of race, income, or geography. There are no quick \nfixes. The factors that have led to this two-tiered health system are \ncomplex and interrelated.\n  Minorities are far less likely to have health insurance or a family \ndoctor, making regular preventive visits less likely. And many of those \nwho do have insurance report having little or no choice in where they \nseek care. Minority communities are more frequently exposed to \nenvironmental risks, such as polluted industrial areas, cheap older \nhousing with lead paint, or asbestos-laden water pipes.\n  For Hispanics, Native Americans, and others who do not speak English \nas a first language, the lack of translators and bilingual doctors \nmakes it more difficult to communicate with doctors and nurses. The \nAmerican Indian community has been forced to cope with a system \nsuffering from decades of neglect and underfunding of the Indian Health \nService.\n  The IHS has consistently grown at a far slower rate than the rest of \nthe HHS budget, and at only a fraction of health care inflation. As a \nresult, sick people are turned away every day from IHS hospitals and \nclinics in this country unless they are in immediate danger of losing \ntheir life or a limb.\n  Life or limb isn't a figure of speech at IHS clinics. It's an actual \nstandard of care. IHS's funding crisis is not just in clinical \nservices. Prevention efforts, facilities, personnel, mental health \ncare, substance abuse programs, and contract support costs are all \ndrastically underfunded, too.\n  I have said this on the floor many times. Our country spends an \naverage\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nof $5,100 for every man, woman, and child in America. In every Federal \nprison, we spend an average of $3,800 for every prisoner. On every \nIndian reservation, we will spend $1,900 total for every man, woman, \nand child, one half of what we spend for Federal prisoners. So it is no \nwonder that people die at a rate hundreds of times greater on the \nreservation than they do anywhere else.\n  America is obligated, by law and by treaty, to provide free health \ncare for American Indians--a commitment the U.S. Government made to the \nIndian people in exchange for their lands. America is not honoring that \ncommitment.\n  The White House's budget this year included only $2.1 billion for IHS \nclinical services. That is more than 60 percent below the bare minimum \nneeded to provide basic health care for people already in the IHS \nsystem.\n  The problems run still deeper. Even when both groups have roughly the \nsame insurance coverage, the same income, the same age and the same \nhealth conditions, minorities receive less aggressive and less \neffective care than white Americans.\n  The racial and ethnic disparities in our health care system are not \nmerely a minority issue or a health care issue. The high incidence of \ndiabetes, asthma and other diseases among minorities as a result of \nthis health care gap costs our Nation billions of dollars every year.\n  But most importantly it is a moral issue. A health care system that \nprovides lesser treatment for minorities offends every American \nprinciple of justice and equality. We have been promised that we would \naddress these issues at some point in the future, but we have seen no \naction whatsoever. We have attempted to pass the Healthcare Equality \nand Accountability Act of 2003, and no action has yet been taken.\n  This legislation would reduce health disparities and improve the \nquality of care for racial and ethnic minorities. The bill would expand \nhealth coverage by expanding eligibility and streamlining enrollment in \nMedicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program; it would \nremove language and cultural barriers by providing additional funding \nfor cultural and language services; it would offer incentives to \nimprove health workforce diversity; it would offer new funding to \nState, local, and tribal initiatives that take innovative approaches to \nreducing the disparities; and it would increase minority health \nresearch and data collection.\n  The bill would also strengthen and hold accountable the government \ninstitutions responsible for ensuring health care equity. And finally, \nthe bill would provide adequate funding for the Indian Health Service--\nso that we can finally reach some adequate funding level and stop the \nshameful underfunding of Indian health needs.\n  This legislation would represent a strong first step, moving us \ncloser to the goal of ensuring equal access to quality health care.\n  Last year, the majority leader said:\n\n       Inequity is a cancer that can no longer be allowed to \n     fester in health care.\n\n  I agree completely. We know what happens when cancer is allowed to \nspread.\n  Too many Americans in minority communities have lost their lives \nbecause they are subjected to a two-tiered health care system that \nkeeps them from getting the care they need. We cannot afford to wait \nany longer to confront the minority health gap in our country. \nAmericans are asking for our leadership on a challenge that is quickly \nbecoming a national emergency. We have an obligation to answer their \ncall.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S3968-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLOTURE VOTE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday, for the third time in this \nCongress, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto a one-sided, take-it-or-leave-it medical malpractice bill.\n  Last year, the majority leader tried to bring up a comprehensive \nbill. The Senate did not invoke cloture. Rather than sit down with the \nother side to craft a reasonable bill that could be brought up, \ndebated, and amended, the majority leader took the same flawed bill, \napplied it to only one sector of the health industry, and attempted to \nbring it up again, just a few weeks ago.\n  At that time, I voted for cloture, not because I agreed with the \nunderlying legislation, but because I had hoped for a legitimate \ndebate, a serious look at the issues that are part of the growing \nmedical malpractice crisis. I recognize that there are serious problems \nwith medical malpractice in this country, and specifically with the \navailability of OB/GYN services in my home State of West Virginia. I \nvoted to end debate on the motion to proceed to that bill. But, again, \ncloture was not invoked.\n  After two unsuccessful cloture votes, one would think that, if they \ntruly wanted to pass legislation on this important issue, the \nRepublican leadership would sit down with their Democratic colleagues \nand negotiate a bill that was less partisan. But there has been no such \neffort. Instead, the majority continues to add physician groups here \nand there, trying to rack up more political points. This is not a \nserious effort to address a real challenge. This series of votes is not \ndesigned to advance legislation. Instead, this is choreographed \npolitical theater, played for the benefit of core supporters of the \nRepublican party. This is not a successful strategy for advancing \nlegislation, or for solving serious problems facing our Nation, and I \ncan not lend my support to this charade.\n  I do hope that the Senate can reach a consensus on this issue. \nDoctors and, most importantly, patients need stability in this system \nand the peace of mind that comes with a reliable, high-quality health \ncare system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S3968-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n3108, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     3108 to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to temporarily \n     replace the 30-year Treasury rate with a rate based on long-\n     term corporate bonds for certain pension plan funding \n     requirements and other provisions, and for other purposes, \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees \n     on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House of \nthe Record of April 1, 2004.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding there are 4 hours equally divided; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is an important piece of legislation which deals with \nthe solvency of a large number of companies and benefits that are paid \nto those companies' employees. The core, the essence of this bill is \nthe fact that traditionally, companies have been required to fund their \ndefined benefit plans in relationship to the rate of return that is \naccounted for on a 30-year Treasury bond. That affects how much money \nthey must pay into these plans.\n\n  Unfortunately, for companies that have such plans, the 30-year bond \nno longer exists as a viable benchmark. That is because we as a \ngovernment are not issuing 30-year bonds. Therefore, when people value \na 30-year bond, it has become, in the last few years, an understated \nvalue. It is not reflecting what the true interest is, the true rate of \nreturn is, in the marketplace any longer.\n  If we continue to use the 30-year bond as a benchmark, an inflated \npayment is required by those companies which come under this rule.\n  The effect of that is a large amount of money--it is estimated to be \n$80 billion--would flow inaccurately or inappropriately as a result of \nthe fact that the decision as to that payment is\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nbased on the 30-year bond which no longer exists and is understated. It \nunderstates returns.\n  That $80 billion, if it is artificially moved around, becomes a \nproblem because it means companies actually have to come up with the \nmoney. When they do, they are taking money away from investments which \ncreate jobs. If a company is planning to create a new plant or buy new \nequipment to create new efficiencies or simply to pay its people more--\nthe people who work with that business with that activity--find they \ncan't do that. As a result, the jobs which would be created through \nthat $80 billion infusion of money will not be created. And it will \nhave a fairly significant chilling effect on the economy generally, if \nwe do not make this change in the calculation of the interest rates.\n  This bill replaces the 30-year bond with a market basket of high-\ngrade corporate bonds as a reflection of what the appropriate interest \nrate should be. I think there is general consensus on that part of the \nbill, and it is the most important part of the bill.\n  The bill also has a series of rifleshot changes for some single-\nemployer plans and for a small number of multiemployer plans.\n  That is where the contest over the bill occurs most intently because \nthose single-shot changes affect a few industries, a few airlines, a \ncouple of steel companies, and a large multiemployer plan in the \nMidwest.\n  But that was not my reason for aggressively pursuing this piece of \nlegislation. I wanted to fix the 30-year bond rate. I have been trying \nto do that now for almost 9 months. I feel very strongly if we don't do \nit we will end up losing jobs in America. We will end up making \nourselves less competitive. We will end up with less investment, and we \nwill end up with fewer people in our country working for businesses \nwhich are efficient and, therefore, can compete internationally.\n  I think it is critical that we pass this piece of legislation.\n  These other items which are part of this legislation are obviously \nimportant to those employees who participate in those different areas--\nthe airlines, the steel companies, and the multiemployer plans that are \nimpacted.\n  But for me, the core of this bill is fixing the 30-year bond rate and \nthe problem it has in artificially affecting the playing field as to \nwhere investment flows in America.\n  It is very critical in a market economy that you allow dollars to be \ninvested where they can be most efficiently used. When you have a \nsystem which creates an artificially inaccurate benchmark or how these \nvarious funds must be funded by using the 30-year bond, you undermine \nthe ability of the marketplace to adequately discipline through market \nforces the investment of dollars. The practical effect of that is to \nproduce inefficiency, less capital investment, and less jobs.\n\n  This is a very important bill. In fact, it is the ultimate jobs bill. \nEighty-billion dollars of investment is a lot of investment which is \ngoing to create lots of jobs. There are important jobs bills, but \namongst the jobs bills we are taking up in Congress, this is certainly \none of the most important. It is subject to some significant time \nrestraints. If we don't do this by April 15, then some of this \nmiscalculation of resources begins to occur, and we end up losing the \ninvestment in jobs we need.\n  That is the essence of this bill.\n  As I understand it, Senator Kennedy, who is the senior Democrat on \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, intends to speak \non the bill. A number of other folks also wish to make points on the \nbill.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime and hope we can get to a vote fairly promptly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would welcome the opportunity to yield \nsuch time as our friend and colleague from Louisiana would care to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we have about 2 hours on \nthe Democrat side to debate this important bill. I appreciate the \nSenator from Massachusetts giving me such time as I might use. It will \nprobably be 15 or 20 minutes, perhaps longer but hopefully not.\n  I want to start by asking my colleague from New Hampshire--I \nappreciate his work on this important piece of legislation. I actually \nagree with him. The people who are covered in this bill need relief in \nthe pension provisions which we govern through our laws covering ERISA \nas well as in our Tax Code. I don't disagree with him that we have \nprovided much needed and extremely important relief. But I want to ask, \nbefore I start my remarks, if he could comment on the approximately 9.5 \nmillion Americans who seem to be left out of this act and are working \nin the construction industry. If we seek to create jobs in America, \nthat is one of the sectors we have the potential--as the economy \nbegins, hopefully, to recover--where we could see some people actually \ngoing back to work.\n  I was wondering if maybe the Senator could comment about the \nmultiemployers. I think there are about 9.5 million. Would he care to \ncomment about why they have been left out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have a right to propound \nquestions to other Senators who do not have the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will leave the question out there. I \nappreciate the clarification.\n  As we debate for the next 4 hours, I hope someone might come to the \nfloor who is arguing that this bill is as good as it can get. I happen \nto believe this bill was pretty good when it left the Senate, and it \nhas come back fairly effective. I would like to leave that question \nopen to any of my colleagues who would care to come to the floor and \nexplain in front of the cameras and for all to review why when it left \nhere everyone was covered--all of the single employers and \nmultiemployers--and as it has come back, why they have only received \npartial relief.\n  I have a reason, but I am not sure my reason is correct. I am going \nto leave that question out there and hopefully my good friend from \nMassachusetts and I can get an answer to that question before this \ndebate concludes in 4 hours.\n  I am going to begin by refreshing our collective memory about what \nthe President said. When President George Bush was elected in one of \nthe closest elections ever in our Nation, he said it was time to rise \nabove a house divided and to move together to create economic \nopportunity and economic hope.\n  When this bill had as its core very good purposes, when it left the \nSenate we were united. It had 86 votes, a majority of both the Democrat \nand Republican caucuses to give relief to every pension. Times have \nbeen tough. There were certain rules that were in place that prevented \nsome of these multiemployer pension plans from stashing away money in \nthe good times. They were prevented from doing that by our laws, rules, \nand regulations. When the market turned down and they started losing \nsome of their investments, they had to kick in extra contributions, \nwhich caused them to take money away from employment and put it into \ntheir pension plans.\n\n  They asked for relief. Our Senate Republicans and Democrats said that \nlarge corporations as well as multiemployer pension systems deserve \nthat relief. It left here with 86 votes a couple of months ago. It has \ncome back, however, with only one group included and the other group \nleft out.\n  I am concerned and worried. I am not confused. The answer is not \npretty. I am told by the experts there is no economic justification for \nthis. There is no cost to the Treasury to have those plans included. \nAlthough their plans are not run the same way, they deserve the same \nhelp and same relief because they are invested in the same stock \nmarket. I don't think there are two separate stock markets, one where \nthe large corporations are invested and then another for everyone else. \nThey have suffered the same up-and-down swings of the market.\n  However, I have to believe, unless my question is answered, the only \nreason they did not get help is simply because the White House did not \nwant to help them. It would not cost the Treasury anything to give help \nto these plans. It would not cost the Treasury a nickel. It is a change \nin the law that buys them additional time that the actuaries and the \nexperts believe would be\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nresponsible and safe, that would still make sure the pensions are safe \nand the money is there.\n  The bill left the Senate, with Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether. It went to what is seeming to be every day the most \npolitically driven White House, where they were simply eliminated from \nthe bill.\n  I ask, during the four hours we are discussing this, if any Member \nwould be willing to come to the Senate and state why this has happened \nto 9.5 million workers, many of whom are union workers but not all, and \nsome businesses that are affected, that are employing people, not \nminimum-wage workers?\n  These are workers who wake up early before the sun comes up, \nconstruction workers. Even when the temperatures go below freezing, \nthey put their gloves on and an extra jacket and they go out and work. \nThese are the workers we see on tops of buildings. These are the \nworkers we see digging deep holes under the ground, driving electric \nlines, making sure the infrastructure in this country is what it should \nbe, making sure when buses go over a bridge, the bridge does not \ncollapse.\n  I ask anyone in the Senate to tell me why these workers have been \nleft out. The only reason I am given is it is a political directive \nfrom the White House. These are evidently Americans who the President \neither does not like, does not want to help, does not think they \ndeserve it, does not think they need help. If this is the kind of \nadministration we are a part of, then I don't want to be a part of this \nkind of administration. I want to be part of an administration that \nhelps everyone when everyone can be helped unless there is some real \ngood reason not to.\n  I can understand we cannot afford to give everybody the same kind of \ntax cuts when there is money coming out of the Treasury. I understand \nabout making priorities. It is my understanding that does not cost the \nTreasury a penny. It is my understanding, having served as State \ntreasurer of my State for 8 years and served on my pension boards, and \nhaving some knowledge of the way pensions are made and the estimates \nand assumptions actuaries make in terms of pensions that control how \nmuch contributions are put in and taken out of a pension plan, it is my \nunderstanding the experts agree everyone could use some help.\n  One plan is helped, which is included in this bill, making a \ntemporary adjustment to the rate of return to give them some relief. \nAnother group said, We do not operate exactly that way, but we could \nuse some help just stretching out our payments for 3 years so we could \ncreate more construction jobs. This White House, for some reason, said \nno to 9.5 million Americans.\n  Maybe we are getting to a point--I hope my colleagues will come down \nhere and correct me--maybe we are getting to some ridiculous point in \nthis Capitol where before you can get relief you have to show your \nvoter registration card. When Democrats are in control, if you are a \nRepublican, if you do not show a Democratic card, you do not get \nrelief. Most of the people who were left out were union members. Not \nall of them, but most of them were union members. Again, there are \nbusinesses that were affected.\n  If it was the White House's intention to punish this group of people \nbecause they are not overwhelmingly supportive of administration \npolicies, this is not an administration I want to be a part of. I would \nnot for 1 minute walk to the Senate and say some of the corporations \nthat are getting help in this business, because they are not \noverwhelmingly supportive of Democrats, do not deserve a fair shake by \nthis body. They got a fair shake when it left the Senate.\n  We had Democrats and Republicans come to the Senate and say, yes, \nthese large corporations that have suffered terrible losses in the \nstock market--and we all did; whether you were a little or big \ninvestor, everyone took a big loss--yes, we want to create jobs. Yes, \nthey deserve relief. Democrats came down. Senator Baucus from Montana \nargued passionately for this bill and 87 Members voted for it. It comes \nback with 9 million people missing, and they just happen to be part of \nmultiemployer pension plans, most of whom are union but not all, and \nsome small businesses have been cut out with no explanation.\n  It is a very ugly way to do the people's business and it flies in the \nface of what this administration promised: to unite us and not divide \nus, to give help to everyone who needed it when it was in our power to \ndo so, whether they were a little fry or a big fry, whether they were a \nlittle fish or a big fish, whether they were a union company or not.\n  I don't know how others feel, but people in my State, whether they \nare for or against unions, are for jobs. We have lost almost 3 million \njobs since this administration took office. I remind my colleagues that \npeople want good jobs. They do not want jobs that pay $5.15 an hour. \nYou cannot feed your children, pay rent, and put gasoline in your car \nfor $5.15 an hour.\n  We want to create construction jobs. My construction workers make \ngood money. They usually build darn good buildings and they build them \nfor little towns and big cities in Louisiana. They came up here asking \nfor help--not a lot of help. It does not cost a dime. Not a dime. They \nare turned away because they might be Democrats? They might be union \nmembers?\n  I have been to the Senate before on a number of other issues in my \ndisappointment with this administration. Across the hall in some other \nbuilding, Condoleeza Rice is testifying. We have marines being killed \nin Iraq. If the President were leading in the right direction, I think \nhe would use every opportunity, even small ones such as this. This is \nnot a huge deal, but it is a big deal to the 9.5 million workers who \nhave been left out.\n  I would think he would be using every opportunity to unite this \ncountry, to create jobs at home, to create goodwill so we can get \nthrough maybe one of the toughest times in recent history. But, oh, no, \nthe bill leaves the Senate with 87 votes--of Republicans and \nDemocrats--and comes back with Republican-only fingerprints all over \nit, taking 9.5 million workers out because they dared to ask for help \nin times of tough economic downturn.\n  I have to hear the rhetoric coming out of the White House: They are \ntrying to create jobs. Well, let me tell you, here is a good chance to \ncreate jobs, to help save those pension plans people have contributed \nto, to give them a little help that does not cost anything--and they \nwere sent away emptyhanded.\n  So I am going to sit here for 4 hours. I may have to leave for a few \nminutes, but I want my colleague from Massachusetts to know I am going \nto sit on this floor until I get an answer to my question: Why were 9.5 \nmillion workers left out, when it does not cost us a red penny to help \nthem? If it was not done for political retribution reasons, I would \nlike a good explanation as to why it was done. If I can get a good \nexplanation, then I will change these remarks and I will acknowledge \nperhaps I was mistaken about the reason.\n  But I know the way pension funds work. I know what they asked for was \nnot much to ask. I know it would not cost us any money to do it. I know \nthe experts said we could help them, if we had the will to. But we just \nwilled a different way. We made other choices.\n  Finally, I am going to tell you, these choices--we all make these \nchoices. Choices have consequences. The choices the White House made to \nleave these 9.5 million workers out--and the businesses that employ \nthem--are going to cost us jobs. They are going to make people more \ncynical. They are going to raise the anger level in this country, when \nwe need to be pulling people together and not tearing people apart. For \nthe little it would have cost to keep them in, I think there is going \nto be a big price to pay for taking them out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, until some other Members come to the \nfloor, I want to add for the Record that, for\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nLouisiana, there are 56 electrical contracting companies that \nparticipate in the National Electrical Workers Plan that will receive \nno relief in this bill. There are 18 Louisiana sheet metal contracting \ncompanies that have joined the Sheet Metal National Plan that will have \ntheir pensions in jeopardy, perhaps. But whether their plans are in \ngood shape, they came here to ask for relief that would not have cost a \npenny, and they were turned away.\n  There are 1,200 Louisiana workers who belong to the grocery store \nworkers plan. They perhaps need to start worrying about when they will \nbe able to retire because they were left out of this plan.\n  Mr. President, 32,000 construction workers in Louisiana who have \nmultiemployer pension plans have been excluded.\n  Let me repeat, all of these workers--the thousands--the 18 Louisiana \nsheet metal contracting companies that employ thousands of people; the \n32,000 construction workers; the 1,200 grocery store workers; and the \n56 electrical contracting companies, which probably together employ, I \nam going to estimate, at least over 5,000 workers--all of those workers \nwere included, along with these multinational corporations and large \nbusinesses. They were all included because they all need help. They all \nhave legitimate requests that could be given by the Senate. When we \ndebated this in the Senate, they were all included. And 87 of us--\nRepublicans and Democrats--voted to keep them in.\n  So I am going to be on the floor. If someone would come to tell me \nwhy these thousands of workers in Louisiana have been left out, I would \nbe happy to know the answer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I now suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 minutes.\n  The issue, as my friend and colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, \nand the Senator from New Hampshire, pointed out, is the issue of \npensions that are facing a very challenging time due to the economic \nchallenges we are facing now in this particular time, and the efforts \nof Congress to try to give these pension programs some time to be able \nto recover. As the Senator from Louisiana pointed out, that is a very \nworthwhile goal we should embrace.\n  As she pointed out in an excellent presentation, we had passed \nbipartisan legislation to help all those at risk, those workers who \nwere going to be in single-employer plans and those who were going to \nbe in the multiemployer plans. We passed legislation 86 to 9. Rarely \ndoes the Senate, particularly in the present climate, come together and \nrecognize there is an immediate problem and then begin to face up to \nit.\n  As we were listening to the Senators from Louisiana and New \nHampshire, and thinking about points to be made regarding this \nlegislation, I am once again reminded Senators' pensions are not at \nissue. All our pensions are adequately funded. I dare say, if the issue \narose where we were going to leave over 20 percent of the Members of \nthe Senate out, as this bill does for workers, there would be more \nMembers in this Chamber right now than there are.\n  The American people understand the pensions the Members have here are \nadequately funded. What we are talking about is a proposal that has \nbeen advanced, with the support of the White House, that is going to \ntake care of about 80 percent of those who are in trouble and leave \nover 20 percent out.\n  The Senate, in a bipartisan way, included everyone. This proposal \nexcludes over 20 percent. This doesn't mean we are not for the remedies \nthat are available to the other 80 percent. We are. We are strongly in \nfavor of those. But we do think fairness demands we also include the \nother 20 percent. We understand if we were able to defeat this \nparticular proposal today, it would take about 5 minutes to remedy this \nin a way that would provide fairness and equity for all those who are \nvulnerable. The House of Representatives would take that so fast, \npeople's heads would turn. It would be on the way down to the White \nHouse as well.\n  That is the question, whether we believe we ought to have a solution \nthat takes care of not only workers in the Fortune 500, but workers who \nare in the fortune 10,000. That is the issue. The issue is fairness. \nThe issue is workers.\n  I will mention very briefly, to set the stage, what the challenges \nare with regard to pensions nationally at the present time. The \ntroubled economy is jeopardizing workers' retirement. There are 3.3 \nmillion Americans who have lost pension coverage since the year 2000. \nOnly 53.5 percent of the Nation's workers are participating in a \nretirement program, the lowest level in over a decade. The declining \nquality of jobs in our country also means declining benefits for \nAmerican workers. Part-time and low-wage workers are far less likely to \nhave a pension than full-time workers. This is what is happening in the \nreal world.\n  We don't have enough pensions to cover all workers, and many of the \nworkers who are covered are losing it. The pension system is in crisis. \nRather than addressing the whole problem, our Republican friends say: \nWe are not going to do that; we are only going to take care of some.\n  We believe everyone who is part of a pension system ought to get fair \nand equal treatment.\n  This chart points out the issue. We have 35 million Americans who are \ncovered by single-employer defined benefit programs. These workers will \nbe protected. The Senator from Louisiana and I are for giving that kind \nof protection. But we don't understand why, if we are going to give the \nprotection to 35 million Americans, we leave out the 9.7 million \nAmericans who are covered by multiemployer defined benefit pension \nprograms.\n  The Senator from Louisiana asked exactly the right question. Why are \nwe taking care of 35 million and leaving out effectively 10 million. \nThere is absolutely no other answer than the White House decided it was \ngoing to be punitive and pulled the strings on the conference--of which \nI was a member, and I will go through that shortly--and said: We are \nnot going to do it because so many of these are union members and we \ndon't like unions.\n\n  That is telling us something new in the Senate, when we know what has \nbeen happening recently?\n  Before I get into that, this chart shows what has been happening with \nregard to general benefit pensions. We have what you call a perfect \nstorm of factors hurting pension plan funding levels: The prolonged \ndownturn of the stock market during the Bush administration, the \nlongest since the Great Depression; extremely low 30-year Treasury bond \ninterest rates; weak economic conditions which mean companies cannot \nafford to make the additional payments and pay excise taxes imposed by \npension laws.\n  These factors have affected the single-employer and the multiemployer \nthe same. That is why the Senate decided to deal with both single and \nmultiemployer plans. But not the conference committee. Although we made \nreal progress, the fact is, we are facing an administration that at \nbest is indifferent and at worst hostile to working families.\n  I don't make that statement lightly. But you cannot look at the \nrecord of this administration with regard to working families and not \ncome to that conclusion. If you look at what has happened with the \ncreation of jobs, we have an administration that said, yes, we are \ngoing to create 5.2 million jobs. They made that statement in 2001. But \nwe have seen the loss of 2 million jobs because of their economic \npolicies.\n  This chart shows there are 2.4 million more unemployed workers now in \n2004 than there were in 2001. Workers are\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nlosing their jobs, and there are 10 million workers who are in the \nmultiemployer plans who are going to get shortchanged as well. They are \nlosing their jobs. If we look at the job growth over the last 3 years, \nas compared to other economic recoveries, from 1991, this shows the \nexpansion of jobs, the recovery from 1991 to 1993. This chart indicates \nthe current recovery is virtually flat.\n  How are workers reacting to this? American workers are working longer \nand harder than ever before. Look at this chart that shows what is \nhappening for workers in industrial nations. These bars represent \ndifferent countries. These are mostly the European countries: Denmark, \nFrance, Ireland, United States, Italy, and Germany. Look at the United \nStates, about 400 hours more per year than any other industrial nation. \nWorkers are working longer. They are working harder. More and more of \nthem are losing their jobs. Of the new jobs that are being created, \nthey are paying 21 percent less than the jobs that were replaced.\n  The average wage in 2001 was $44,000 a year. Now it is $35,000, a 21-\npercent loss. Workers working longer, harder. And if they lose their \njob and come back into the market, look what happens to them. They are \nsuffering under this administration's economic policies.\n  We ask, I wonder why that is happening?\n  Well, Mr. President, the answer is it is very easy to see why it is \nhappening. If you look at the recoveries from the early nineties and \nbefore, when you had an expansion of the economy and coming out of the \nrecession, what you had with the new investments, 60 percent went to \nworkers' wages and 39 percent went to corporate profits. In today's \nrecovery, you have 86 percent going to corporate profit and 13 percent \ngoing to workers' wages.\n  This system is stacked against workers. We have an administration \nthat has the opportunity to help American workers in with multiemployer \npensions--they won't do it, again. This is what is happening. \nCorporations are doing very well. Under this bill, they are going to do \nvery well, too. But not the smaller companies. We have seen this--if \nyou look at what has happened, we have gone through this on \nunemployment compensation. Under President Clinton, even at a time when \nwe were coming out of the recession of the early nineties, they kept in \nthe unemployment compensation until we had seen the growth of 3 million \nnew jobs.\n  We have seen now the early loss of over 2 million jobs and this \nadministration cuts off the unemployment compensation. What is the \neffect of that to those workers? The effect of that is there are 90,000 \nAmericans a week losing their unemployment compensation. That is 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes the capacity of Fenway Park in Boston. And they say that this \nadministration is concerned about workers, concerned about the \nexpansion of jobs, concerned about the unemployment compensation. They \nare opposed to the increases in the minimum wage. We have had that \nbattle. When you look over the value of the increase in the minimum \nwage, the administration says thumbs down; we are not going to go for \nthe increase in the minimum wage. If we don't have an increase in the \nminimum wage, the minimum wage will be at almost its lowest purchasing \npower ever in the history of the minimum wage. When we offered that \namendment, the current Republican leadership pulled the bill rather \nthan having a vote on an increase in the minimum wage.\n  No increase in the minimum wage, no unemployment compensation, \nproposals to eliminate overtime, which is going to affect the \nfirefighters and policemen and nurses in this country. That is their \nrecord. These are the groups that are going to be affected with the \nproposal under the administration to eliminate overtime.\n  I make this point because what we are facing today is a continuum of \nthe administration's indifference and opposition and hostility to \nworkers, and primarily union workers, who are affected by this.\n  Let me point out what is happening across this country. We are \nfinding out as a result of these conditions, there are real people and \nfamilies who are hurting. More than half of the unemployed adults have \nhad to postpone medical treatment, 57 percent; or cut back on spending \nfor food, 56 percent; 1 in 4 has had to move to other housing or move \nin with friends or relatives; 38 percent have lost telephone service or \nare worried they will lose their phone; more than one-third--36 \npercent--have had trouble paying their gas or electric bills. That \nisn't even the beginning.\n  I want to take a minute or two to talk about what is happening out in \nthe countryside in terms of hunger. I don't know how many saw this. \nThis is last week's Parade Magazine. ``How can we help end childhood \nhunger?'' Imagine that in the United States of America, childhood \nhunger. How can we avoid that? The Agriculture Department reported \n300,000 more families are hungry today than when President Bush first \ntook office. That is going to increase. Let me read some of this \narticle. This is from the Parade Magazine:\n\n       Last year, according to the Department of Agriculture, 34.9 \n     million Americans . . . were ``food insecure,'' the \n     Government's term for those who must survive on a diet not \n     nutritious enough to keep a child healthy. More than 13 \n     million of those people were children. The U.S. Conference \n     of Mayors expects that requests for emergency food for \n     families with children will increase to 91 percent of the \n     Nation's cities this year. They also document that \n     emergency food outlets in 56 percent of the Nation's \n     cities turned away hungry families last year because they \n     ran out of resources. The safety net that most Americans \n     presume is there to catch children before they sink too \n     far is torn in too many places, leaving too many in free \n     fall. ``Food is a basic right for every American child,'' \n     says Bill Schorr, executive director of Share Our \n     Strength, the anti-hunger organization that works with \n     Parade and other partners to sponsor the Great America \n     Bake Sale. ``This is the wealthiest Nation on Earth. We \n     have the resources to wipe out child hunger in our time. \n     All it takes is the political will to make the welfare of \n     children one of the Nation's top priorities. The first \n     step is coming to terms with the shattering effect the \n     unstable economy has had on the families.''\n       ``Despite a recent report that the economy has rebounded, \n     our pantry soup kitchens are trying to serve a surging number \n     of families,'' says Robert Forner, CEO of America's Second \n     Harvest, a network of more than 200 regional food banks. \n     Second Harvest distributed nearly 2 million pounds of food \n     last year to 23 million hungry Americans, 9 million children. \n     ``Millions of people have used up their unemployment \n     insurance benefits, spent their savings, sold off their \n     assets, and come to us because they have no way to feed their \n     families.''\n\n  This is happening, Mr. President. So we have a thumbs down on minimum \nwage, thumbs down on unemployment compensation, overtime, and now an \nundermining of the pension system.\n  I want to mention who is being affected by the decision to exclude \nthe multiemployer pension programs. By cutting the multiemployer relief \nplan, President Bush--I will review the bidding. We went to the \nconference and we had 5 days of hearings. We basically had agreed we \ncould not do 100 percent because the House didn't do it, so we were \ngoing to do 20 percent. That was reported in the newspapers. They all \nshow we had an agreement. The conferees understood that, until the \nWhite House said, no, no, we are not going to do that. They said you \nare going to take 3 or 4 percent. We said that is not a bargain, that \nis an insult. They said you can take it, and effectively they wrote the \nconference report, submitted it to the conference, and then during the \nfinal conference, Senator Grassley, to his credit, tried to find common \nground. He said, OK, we won't take the 20 percent, but let's go to 8, \nor 10, or 9 percent on this. Many of us supported that. It was not a \ngreat proposal, but it was at least targeted on the neediest \nmultiemployer programs. That was rejected under the orders of the White \nHouse--not the conferees. We worked it out at 20 percent. Now we have \nthe proposal, according to the Wall Street Journal today, that \neffectively eliminates all--except perhaps 2 percent of the \nmultiemployer programs.\n  Let's find out what this is all about. The 9\\1/2\\ million people--who \nare they? Millions of workers could find themselves in the same \nsituation as 500 retired ironworkers in Buffalo, NY, whose plan is on \nthe verge of collapse because of stock market losses, economic \ndownturn. These retirees could lose half of their pensions if their \nplan fails. Four hundred workers from Rockford, IL, whose employers \nhave drastically increased contributions, cannot guarantee future \nbenefits, so workers are paying for a pension they may never receive. A \nthousand workers in Connecticut, who have 50 employers\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nwho contribute to their pension fund--these employers are facing \ncollapse if the pension fund fails. Workers across the country, from \ncement masons in Missouri, to sheet metal workers, to carpenters in \nWisconsin, and electrical workers in Alaska are seeing their benefits \ncut as they and their employers are trying to save their plans. The \nproblem is growing too rapidly. They are seeing the collapse of the \npensions under the multiemployer system, and we are putting a death \nknell to them with this proposal before us.\n  Low-wage workers are also being hurt. Hundreds of thousands of \ngrocery store workers across the country are seeing the rate at which \nthey earn their pensions slashed, sometimes cut in half. Many of these \nworkers' only pension is a few hundred dollars a month. They are \nearning only half of that, so they will never have enough to retire. We \nare talking about grocery store clerks and cashiers around the country \nwho are facing a threat to their pension.\n  These workers earn from $10 to $15 an hour. Their average pension is \nonly $500 a month. They cannot afford to see those pensions cut. Mr. \nPresident, 30,000 grocery store clerks and cashiers in the Seattle area \nhave pension funds that are hitting a funding deficiency, where their \nemployers owe excise taxes that drastically reduce the contributions, \nputting that whole program at risk. Workers agreed to cut their future \npensions in half to save the plan. They are still facing a crisis in \ntheir plans.\n  They did not need to face this crisis. All we need is to give \nconsideration to the multiemployer plans, as we did to the single-\nemployer plans, and at what risk to the Pension Guaranty Corporation? \nVirtually zero, as the Senator from Louisiana pointed out. Virtually \nzero risk. All they need is time. But, no, because these are workers \nand many of them belong to unions.\n  In southern California, 70,000 workers have had the rate at which \nthey earn pensions slashed. They are facing an imminent funding crisis. \nIn the Southeast, 40,000 workers at Kroger and Bruno grocery stores in \nGeorgia and neighboring States have had their pensions cut by a third. \nIn Portland, OR, 20,000 workers had the rate at which they earn \npensions cut in half. But this is not nearly enough to avert what is an \nimminent funding crisis.\n  All these funds are in serious crisis, with companies facing \nincreased contributions, penalties, and workers having their pensions \ncut. Not a single one of these funds is eligible for relief from the \nnarrow bill dictated to the Congress by the White House in the \nconference report. These are basically the small businesses that are \naffected.\n  Just a week ago, the President claimed the small business agenda is \nvibrant and foremost on his agenda. He says it is important to reduce \ntaxes to small businesses so they will have more money to invest, while \nat the same time he was saying this, the staff at the White House was \npulling the rug out from under thousands of businesses in multiemployer \nplans.\n  Over half of the 65,000 multiemployers are small businesses. Small \nbusinesses, family businesses are the ones that will be hurt. They will \nnot be able to use their money to invest and expand, and they will be \npaying excise taxes imposed by the IRS on the pension plans. These are \njust a few examples.\n  Acme Industrial Pipefitting in Chattanooga, TN, which has 50 workers, \nis going to see their annual contributions to its pension plan more \nthan double from $200,000 to $500,000. We had their president, Jim \nBailey, say: I am not asking for a nickel from the Federal Government; \njust give me the time you are giving to the big boys. No, we are not \ngoing to do that, not for Acme Pipefitting in Chattanooga.\n  The Coghlin Electrical Contractors, a fourth generation family \nbusiness, faced increased payments of millions of dollars. Mr. Coghlin, \nand other contractors in the area, say this is catastrophic.\n  Procaccio Painting in the Chicago area: Mr. Procaccio tells us he \njust cannot participate in any economic recovery.\n  You know what they are basically saying, although they will not \nannounce it. They are going to terminate the pension programs, and this \nis completely unnecessary. This is what we are facing.\n  That is where we find ourselves. This conference report provides $80 \nbillion--$80 billion--for single-employer plans and $1.6 billion for \nairlines and steel, but less than $250 million for a handful of \nmultiemployer plans. These provisions are punitive, unfair, and \ndiscriminatory. Clearly, President Bush cares more about hurting the \nunion workers than helping small businesses.\n  This chart shows who gets the relief. Here it is: $81.6 billion for \nthe single-employer; less than $250 million for the multiemployer. That \nrepresents effectively 10 million workers. I can show just who they \nare.\n\n  The multiemployer plans allow workers to earn pensions under \ndifferent employers. This helps workers in short-term or seasonal \nemployment--construction, hospitality, entertainment or retail--to earn \na pension. Many could not earn pensions in the single-employer system.\n  The multiemployer plans provide pensions to low-wage workers, \nincluding hotel workers, restaurant workers, and janitors. \nMultiemployer plans are a critical source of pensions for employees of \nsmall businesses. Without these plans, small businesses could not \nafford to provide pensions.\n  This chart shows the percentage of workers in construction, about 38 \npercent; truck transportation, 10 percent; services, 15 percent; retail \ntrade, 14 percent; and manufacturing, 15 percent. These are workers in \nsmall businesses.\n  As I pointed out earlier, this chart shows what has happened in this \nlegislation. The Senate bill provides 100- percent relief for the \nsingle-employer plans. The conferees agreed to provide relief for 20 \npercent of those who need it the most in multiemployer plans, and the \nWhite House insisted the final conference comes out with less than 4 \npercent. It is wrong, Mr. President. We are talking about the same \nworkers who have been the most vulnerable in the job market, who have \nlost their jobs, and if they get reemployed, they will be paid less. \nThey are the ones who depend on unemployment insurance when they lose \ntheir jobs. That is being terminated. Many of them depend upon an \nincrease in the minimum wage. That has been lacking. Many of them \ndepend on overtime, and this administration is threatening them. \nFinally, they may just have been able to have something put away for a \npension, and that is being destroyed. That is wrong. It is unfair.\n  The bill that applies to the single-employer plan should give the \nsame coverage to multiemployer plans. That is all we are asking. We \nhave fought for the single-employer, but we also fight for the \nmultiemployer. All we are asking is fairness to both. This bill does \nnot provide it.\n  If we were able to defeat this proposal, as I said, it would take 5 \nminutes to readdress it, the House would pass it, and we would have a \nbill on the President's desk. That would be fair. That would be just. \nThat is the way we should proceed.\n  I will be glad to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my colleague from New Jersey \nwishes to speak on this issue for 2 minutes. I thank the Senator for \nhis generous yielding of time. I yield 2 of my 10 minutes to Senator \nCorzine, and I will then take the other 8 myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague from \nMassachusetts to say this is an extraordinary failure to deal with \nsmall business employers across this country and their workers.\n  I find it difficult to believe that what is necessary for the Fortune \n500 is not necessary for the small grocery stores, construction \ncontractors, and others across this Nation. These pension funds are at \nrisk, and there is no reason we should not apply the same rules to the \nsmall companies and the workers who are at risk in their pensions as we \ndo for the large companies.\n  We spent in 2003 $5 million on these small companies we have \neliminated in this conference report. We spent billions on large \ncompanies--billions. Where is the sensibility, particularly from the \nadministration and from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho are so enamored with every economic argument they make that they\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nwant to support small business, and they are walking away from this.\n  This is absolutely outside the context of reasonableness. We can turn \nthis around and get this bill corrected and have it deal with small \nbusiness and multiemployer pension funds, as well as the Fortune 500. \nWe would make a major improvement. Thirty percent of the workers we are \ntalking about who are exposed--almost 10 million--are being left out. \nAs the Senator from Massachusetts so ably said, these are the same \npeople who are getting pressed over and over on property taxes, the \ncost of tuition, rising gas prices--the middle class, the hardest \nworking folks in America. We are turning our backs on them saying this \nis great.\n  By the way, I want this for major employers. We want it. Continental \nAirlines is headquartered in New Jersey. We need to do it. I support \nthis effort by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  We should oppose this conference report, fix it, and bring it back \nfor a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his generous yielding of time and for his leadership \non this issue.\n  There is no question about it, this is a sad day when we have to pit \nworkers who work for large employers versus workers who work for small \nemployers in terms of their pension.\n\n\n                     Testimony of Condoleezza Rice\n\n  I am not here to address that issue. As head of our Task Force on \nNational Security and Homeland Security, I am here to respond to the \ntestimony of adviser Condoleezza Rice. The hearings we have had and \nCondoleezza Rice's decision to testify is all to the good. To quote \nfrom the Scriptures, the truth shall set you free, and this \nCommission--half Democrat, half Republican--has endeavored, is \nendeavoring, will endeavor to find the truth.\n  The bottom line is the Commission is bipartisan. The people on it \ntend to be those who look at things not as Democrats or Republicans but \nas experts, and the Commission is needed. The bottom line, too, is we \nshould not look to this Commission for pointing fingers of blame. It is \nvery easy, in hindsight, to say this should be done or that should be \ndone, and I do not object to the fact this administration--or I \nunderstand the fact this administration and others made mistakes. \nEveryone in America made mistakes. So that is not the problem with the \ntestimony of Condoleezza Rice.\n  The problem is something else. Unfortunately, we did not hear from \nAdviser Rice three important words: We made mistakes.\n  Of course, we made mistakes. This administration made mistakes. The \nprevious administrations made mistakes. The inability of this \nadministration and of the National Security Adviser to admit mistakes \nwere made makes us fear we will make future mistakes because, after \nall, the only way we are able to understand what went wrong is to first \nacknowledge it and then say we are going to correct it.\n  We may not be dealing with al-Qaida in the future. We may be dealing \nwith Chechnyans or East Timorese or skinheads. Unless we realize what \nwent wrong and why we failed to pick up the warning signs, we are less \nlikely to pick up future warning signs that could create even greater \nterror than the terrible terror on September 11 that befell my city.\n  Is it for sure that had everything been done right we could never \nhave prevented 9/11, as Adviser Rice says? I doubt it. There are six \nfacts that, if they all were to be put together, would have clearly \npointed the arrow at what happened.\n  First, 12 intelligence reports throughout the 1990s showed terrorists \nwould use planes as missiles to attack American targets.\n  Second, upon entering office in January, Dr. Rice read a memo from \nDick Clarke indicating there were active al-Qaida cells in the United \nStates.\n  Third, in the summer of 2001, there was a threat spike about \nterrorist activities against American targets, including hijackings and \nwarnings that something very big was about to happen.\n  Fourth, on July 10, 2001, a document was sent to FBI headquarters in \nWashington from Phoenix, warning several Islamic militants had enrolled \nin flight schools in Arizona and positing that al-Qaida was trying to \ninfiltrate the U.S. aviation system.\n\n  Sixth, we missed warning signs from Special Agent Rowley in Minnesota \nabout Zacarias Moussaoui, an Islamic radical who was getting special \naviation training.\n  Finally, on August 6, a White House briefing memo to the President \nstated, ``bin Laden determined to attack in the United States,'' which \nwas specific examples from the FBI of al-Qaida moves against Americans.\n  If, if, if, if on August 6 word went from the White House out to the \nFBI and all of the intelligence agencies, go turn over every rock and \nfind out what al-Qaida is up to, it is very conceivable we would have \nbeen able to figure out what they might be doing, certainly disperse \nsome of the terrorists, two of whom were known to be in the United \nStates, from doing what they had done.\n  Is it a certainty? Absolutely not. Is it a possibility? For sure. To \nsay it would be impossible to add up these signs and figure out what \nhappened is dead wrong, as it would be dead wrong to say it is a \ncertainty you could figure that out.\n  So the bottom line is simple. It is not the fact this administration \ndid not try very hard on terrorism, because in the eyes of Security \nAdviser Rice they did. It is not the fact certain things were missed. \nThey were missed by this administration--and let me underscore previous \nadministrations--but it is the fact this administration, the President \nand his advisers, have this inability to say mistakes were made, under \nour watch and under previous watches. That leads to an attitude that we \ndo not correct the problems.\n  Every parent knows when their child makes a mistake, they try to get \nthe child to understand they made the mistake and maybe they will not \ndo it again, but somehow we have this stonewalling and that is the most \ndestructive fact.\n  Right now we hope and pray the messy situation in Iraq ends and ends \nquickly and that our Armed Forces can do the job against such bad \npeople as this Sadr leader, but if the eyes of the administration were \nmore open to what had been done wrongly in the past, maybe we would be \nbetter off in Iraq today. I say that as somebody who has been largely \nsupportive of fighting the war on terror, voting for the war in Iraq.\n  What bothers me most about the testimony of Condoleezza Rice and the \nactions of this administration is not that they did not do everything \nright. Who could ask anyone to do that in this brave, new, post-9/11 \nworld? But there is an inability to want to gather all the truth and \nfigure out from that truth what was done right, what was done wrong, \nand improve and make things better.\n  The one lesson we learned in Vietnam is when our leaders did not \naccept the truth, it made matters worse. When our leaders failed to \nadmit mistakes, it made things worse. Unfortunately, today's testimony \nshows an inability to admit mistakes were made and move forward and \ncorrect those mistakes and make America a more secure place in the \nfuture. I hope and pray it changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 112 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I had not thought this debate was going to \nenlarge itself into the issue of the testimony before the 9/11 \nCommission, but it appears the other side of the aisle has decided the \npension bill is not enough to debate today on this floor, even though \nthat is what it was to be limited to, but it raises this issue. So I \nthink it is appropriate to at least respond briefly, although the \nresponse could be much more extensive. However, I will try to return to \nthe pension bill at the appropriate time since that is what we are \ndebating.\n  I will respond briefly to the statements of the Senator from New \nYork,\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nwhich I found to be outrageous. Maybe the Senator from New York did not \nlisten to the testimony of Mr. Clarke. He very possibly did not, \nbecause he appears to have decided to make up his mind long before the \nNational Security Adviser, Ms. Rice, testified.\n  I think it was Mr. Clarke who said--in fact, I know it was Mr. Clarke \nwho said, in response to a question from Senator Gorton, if the \nadministration had put in place every recommendation you suggested to \nthe prior administration and to this administration, and which you put \nin your memos and your statements upon arrival of this administration \nin office in January, if the administration had done that--in other \nwords, if the administration had pursued every course which had been \nlaid out by Mr. Clarke, who was the guru of terrorism in the prior \nadministration, which I also wish to comment on, would that have \nstopped the 9/11 event? Would that have prevented the 9/11 event? A \none-word answer from Mr. Clarke: No.\n  Yet we have the Senator from New York say the opposite. I do not \nthink the Senator from New York has the expertise of Mr. Clarke, and \nmost certainly he has not presented himself as an expert on terrorism. \nMr. Clarke has presented himself as an expert on terrorism, was the \nexpert on terrorism in the Clinton administration, and did say \ndefinitively, in a one-word answer, no, 9/11 would not have been \navoided had everything gone into place I wanted in place--I being Mr. \nClarke.\n  The statement by the Senator from New York is excessive, to say the \nleast, when he says 9/11 could have been avoided.\n  Then when he goes on to accuse this administration of not learning \nfrom lessons of the past--I will tell you something. This \nadministration did learn from lessons of the past. The lessons of the \npast were the lessons of the Clinton administration, which were when \nour embassies were attacked in Africa and when our ship was attacked in \nYemen, what was the response of the prior administration? They lobbed a \nmissile into an empty terrorist camp in Afghanistan and then lobbed \nanother missile into the wrong factory in Sudan and then washed their \nhands of Mr. bin Laden and said they had accomplished their purpose of \ndefeating terrorism.\n  What we learned after 9/11 was that those sorts of marginal \nresponses, those sorts of tepid responses to terrorism do not work in \nthe present world and certainly this administration learned that.\n  I hesitate to think where we would be today had Al Gore been elected \nPresident. I suspect we would still be negotiating with the Taliban in \nAfghanistan.\n  This administration decided not to negotiate. This administration \ndecided to take action. It went into Afghanistan and it destroyed the \nbase of al-Qaida operations in that country and replaced a repressive \nregime that did not even allow women out of their houses and supported \nall forms of terrorism across this globe and especially the al-Qaida \nterrorism. They learned the lessons of the prior administration, which \nwere tepid response does not work.\n  Then we moved into Iraq. As a government, we voted to move in that \ndirection. Why? Because some of us understood that Saddam Hussein was a \nsignificant, dramatic threat to world peace and specifically was a \ndictator who had the capacity and had used weapons of mass destruction, \nwho was oppressive at a level which hadn't been seen since the times of \nNazi Germany, and who had the capacity to use his oppressiveness and \nhis megalomania and his criminal view of the world to our detriment. He \nwas a threat to us because of his ability to pass on that threat, the \ncapacity to pass on weaponry, the capacity to be a sanctuary, and the \ncapacity to be a feeding ground for people who caused us harm.\n  We are at war, there is no question about that, and we have, as a \ngovernment under this President, pursued that war with an \naggressiveness which was absolutely appropriate. We have chased these \npeople who wished to do us harm across the globe. We have kicked over \nthe rocks under which they live and we have brought them to justice so \ntoday their fear, their concern, is about where they sleep, not who \nthey are going to attack tomorrow.\n  That is the type of response we needed as a government and as a \nnation, in light of what happened to us on 9/11. For the Senator from \nNew York to come down here and say we did not learn the lessons of 9/11 \nand the lessons of the prior administration--which approached terrorism \nwith such tepidness--is an absolute misstatement.\n  For them to come down here and say, after Mr. Clarke, who they have \nheld up as the epitome of knowledge and expertise in the area of \nterrorism, testified in one word that 9/11 could not have been stopped, \nwhen he said ``no'' to that exact question, had all of his proposals \nbeen put in place--for the Senator from New York to come down here and \nmake the statement we could have avoided 9/11, in light of that \ntestimony, I find excessive to an incomprehensible degree.\n  I didn't intend to speak on this issue, but unfortunately it was \ndrawn into this debate and I think it required a response.\n  The National Security Adviser today went before the Commission and \ntestified under oath and made a clear and concise statement of how we \nas a nation are responding to terrorism, how we as a nation are \nfighting a war against people who have decided to try to destroy our \nculture and who have proven their willingness to kill Americans \nindiscriminately, whether they are men, women, or children.\n  We are using all our resources as a result of this President's \ncommitment, which is total and absolute, to bring these terrorists to \njustice. I do not think statements such as those of the Senator from \nNew York are constructive to the debate on that issue.\n  To return to the pension fund, a little less inflammatory subject, \nobviously not having the import of the fight for survival, which is \nwhat this war on terrorism is about for us as a culture, but still \nlegislation we need to address on the floor.\n  We have heard from a number of speakers on the other side of the \naisle how the bill, as it came back from conference, to use their \nphrase, is an attack on 9.5 million union workers who were not included \nin the multiemployer reform language of the bill.\n  My interest in this bill was to correct the interest rate question, \nwhich has been done. It was the essence of this bill. As I said \nearlier, it corrects the fact that $80 billion could be misallocated if \nwe did not correct it. If we did not correct it, we could undermine \ncapital investment and job creation.\n  But I do want to respond, not necessarily to the debate about how \nmany multi's should have been included, but to some of the language \nwhich was used as to why the ``multi'' language was limited in scope, \nbecause it was partisan, to say the least, especially from the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, who said that 9.5 million construction workers who are \nunion people would be left out of the ``multi'' reform bill as it was \nstructured.\n  That is hard to do, because there are only 8.5 million people who are \nin the private sector union membership rolls, so she must have found \nanother million people somewhere in the private sector union membership \nrolls to come up with that number. She must have assumed that none of \nthe people who were protected--whose concerns were addressed, as was \npointed out by the Senator from Massachusetts, where he had the number \nof 35 million people who would be positively impacted by the fix on \ninterest rates--that none of those people are union people and that \nnone of the people whose issues are addressed by the rifleshot DRC \nreform dealing with airlines are union people and that the White House \nsomehow, according to the Senator from Louisiana, just picked out union \npeople and decided to cut them out of this agreement.\n  But on the face of it that doesn't fly. First off, there are not 9.5 \nmillion people in the private sector union movement; there are only 8.5 \nmillion or 8. That is a lot of people, 8.5 million people. A large \nnumber of those folks are included in the DRC program, which is a \ntargeted program, which happens to be the reason the UAW supports this \nbill--another large group of these people who are included in the \ninterest rate fix, which is why the UAW supports this bill. A large \nnumber of the union people are pilot union people and other union \npeople who work for airlines who are included under the DRC\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nsection of this bill, so they are happy with this bill.\n  This bill is not broken down on the basis of whether you are union or \nnot union. To make that statement is totally disingenuous on the face \nof the fact that it can't be defended. In fact, it is so indefensible \nthat when Senator Kennedy spoke he talked about how the people impacted \nhere were small businesspeople and how the administration left out all \nof the small businesspeople by not including all the multi's because \nmost of those are small businesspeople. You can't have it both ways. \nYou can't say the White House is attacking the labor movement by \nleaving out a group of multi's in this bill claiming that was the \ncase--I will get to that in a second; it wasn't necessarily the White \nHouse--and at the same time say you are attacking the small business \nfolks by leaving out the multi's.\n  That is so inconsistent on its face that it brings a smile. \nObviously, small businesses, theoretically at least, traditionally have \nbeen considered to be very supportive of this President and of \nRepublican philosophy. If they are saying the White House, by not \nagreeing to the full multi language, was attacking small business, then \nat the same time you can't say the bill was structured to attack \nunions, which is exactly what they said. It is exactly what the Senator \nfrom Louisiana said, anyway. I think the Senator from Massachusetts \nalso had some comments in that vein.\n  The inconsistency of the argument on its face is so apparent that it \nholds no validity. I was not actively involved in this negotiation. \nObviously, I was in the conference, but I didn't, as they say, ``have a \ndog in this fight'' because I was focused on trying to get the interest \nrate fix through, which I think is a bigger part of the package. But \nthe reason the debate on multi's got shifted around was that--I would, \nagain, point this out to the Senator from Louisiana who asked why this \ndidn't happen, why didn't they get their way--it is two branches of \nGovernment. When it left the House, this bill had no multi's, none, \nzero, zip. The White House took the position there should be no \nmulticoverage. That is one-half of the legislative branch and all of \nthe executive branch saying they do not want any multicoverage. The \nSenate came out with language that said all multi's should be covered.\n  In the process of negotiation, compromise and conference, which \nhappens to be basically how you do things in a democracy, what is known \nas an agreement was reached which gave coverage to a certain number of \nmultiplans, about 50. It was a limited number; no question about it. It \nwas a very small number.\n  But the way that number was reached, as I understand it, there was an \nunderstanding that all multi's shouldn't be covered. There was a \ngeneral consensus on that.\n  Again, when the Senator from Louisiana came down here and said not \nall multi's had been covered, that this was an attack on multi's, that \nwas never the understanding when we reached conference. Everyone in \nthat room in the conference came to the conclusion that the multi's \nwhich should be covered were those at serious risk of defaulting. Those \nwere the ones we were going to try to take care of. We had a real issue \nfrom an actuarial standpoint of figuring out exactly which that was and \nhow you calculated it. It is not an easy issue to resolve.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts took the very legitimate position that \n20 percent of the multi's were probably at risk. That was a calculation \nwhich he reached through an actuarial firm that took a look at it.\n\n  The White House took the position there should be no multi's at all.\n  Remember, these multi's are small employers. It wasn't an attack on \nunions. It was both small employers and unions.\n  It wasn't a philosophical or a political decision, as the Senator \nfrom Louisiana said. If you have a union card, and you weren't allowed \nto play in the game, or Democratic card I think they said that is \nabsolutely ridiculous. The small businesses don't carry union cards, \nand hopefully not too many carry Democrat cards, either. But who knows?\n  As a practical matter, they did not divide on the issue of whether \nyou voted and why you voted. They divided on the philosophical position \nof whether multi's should be included in this 2-year reform package.\n  The impact of the White House position equally impacted union plans, \nunion members, and affected more significantly small businesses than it \ndid members of the union. It is quite obvious. I suspect there are more \nsmall businesses affected by the White House position that multi's \nshouldn't be included than there are members of unions. It was such a \nfallacious argument that it doesn't even stand up to the laugh test.\n  But the point is, when we got into the conference, there was a \ndifference between the Senator from Massachusetts who said 20 percent \nof the plans were at risk and the White House that thought no plans \nshould be included. The White House initially said no plan should be \nincluded, but then after a while, due to the strong and effective \nadvocacy of the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Iowa, a \nseries of different proposals were put on the table until they finally \ngot to a point where they could get a majority vote in the conference \nto support a position. It was a compromise position; no question about \nit. It was definitely a compromise position.\n  Senator Grassley did make another offer that was not accepted. The \noffer that was finally accepted--because we happen to be a government \nwhere you have to get the Senate and the House to agree and you have to \nget the White House to agree--was the package that is before us. The \npackage that is before us has the inherently good benefit, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts appropriately pointed out, of benefiting 35 \nmillion American workers by correcting the interest rate fix issue, and \nof benefiting, if you are so inclined, three major airlines which \npotentially would go under if this bill didn't pass, and two major \nsteel companies, which are integrated steel companies which would go \nunder if this bill didn't pass, and 50 multiplans, including the single \nlargest plan in the country, the Midwestern plan.\n  That is how we got to this point. It is not the perfect bill. Nothing \nthat ever comes out of conference is the perfect bill. We have \ncertainly proven that over and over again. I think judicial note can be \ntaken about that. But it is a bill that was reached by compromise \nthrough the process with a lot of different players at the table who \nhad a very strong opinion as to where we should go. It was not done on \nthe basis of any sort of retribution or attempt to single out an \ninterest group and negatively impact them. On the face of it, that \nposition cannot be defended because so many small businesspeople are \nimpacted by the multilanguage in this bill, and also because of the \nfact so many union members are benefited by the interest rate fix in \nthe bill and by the targeted rifleshot that goes into this bill dealing \nwith airlines and steel companies.\n  That, hopefully, puts to rest that side of the argument made on this \ncase.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts has other very legitimate concerns \nin this bill, I acknowledge the fact we didn't get the 20 percent he \nwanted on the multi's that were at risk which might go into default. \nThat is a legitimate reason to oppose this bill, if that is the \nposition. You cannot oppose this bill, as the Senator from Louisiana \ndid, on the basis that it is an attack on some group. That is simply a \nfunction of politics. It clearly isn't, and the facts and the debate \nfrom the other side prove it.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a list of the small business organizations and business \ngroups that are in strong support of the conference including the \nmultiemployer provisions. They include the Association of General \nContractors of America, the Cherne Contracting Group, Energab, Inc., \nthe Finishing Contractors Association, National Electrical Contractors \nAssociation, Printing Industries of America, Sheet Metal and Air \nConditioning Contractors' National Association, Schnuck Markets, Inc., \nthe Food Marketing Institute, the Mechanical Contractors' of America \nUnited Association of Journeymen and\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nApprentices of Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States \nand Canada, and the Washington Group International, as well as others. \nThis represents only part of the small business groups and associations \nthat believe if we are going to provide help and relief for the single \nemployer, we should do it for the multiemployer as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     American Federation of Musicians\n     American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n     The Associated General Contractors of America\n     Cherne Contracting Corp.\n     Construction Industries of Massachsuetts--Labor Relations \n         Division\n     Enerfab, Inc.\n     International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental \n         and Reinforcing Iron Workers\n     International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and \n         Asbestos Workers\n     International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \n         Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers\n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n     International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers\n     International Union of Electrical Workers\n     International Union of Elevator Constructors\n     International Union of Operating Engineers\n     Internatioinal Union of Painters and Allied Trades of the \n         United States and Canada\n     Laborers' International Union of North America\n     National Association of Construction Boilermaker Employers \n         (NACBE)\n     Finishing Contractors Association\n     National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans \n         (NCCMP)\n     National Electrical Contractors Association\n     NEA--The Association of Union Constructors Operative \n         Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association \n         of the United States and Canada\n     Plumbers' and Pipefitters' National Pension Fund\n     Printing Industries of America, Inc.\n     Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National \n         Association\n     Sheet Metal Workers' International Association of the United \n         States and Canada\n     Schnuck Markets, Inc.\n     The Food Marketing Institute\n     The Mechanical Contractors' of America\n     United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the \n         Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States \n         and Canada\n     United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America\n     United Food and Commercial Workers' International Union\n     United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers\n     Washington Group International\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I point out for the Record the fact \nthat when the Senate considered the pension reform bill, the provisions \nin the bill that provided for the multiemployers actually provided a \n$42 million favorable score for the Federal Treasury. They made money \nwhile the single-employer had a cost of $1.5 billion. The multiemployer \nactually made money for the Treasury.\n  The idea included in the White House letter opposing the inclusion of \nthe multiemployer because it was going to put the burden on the Pension \nGuaranty just does not measure up. That is the point of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. There has to be another reason. It is not because it \nwill cost the PBGC.\n  This chart says PBGC assistance to multiemployer plans is less than 1 \npercent of assistance to single-employer fans. This is the GAO finding \nrepresenting 35 million workers. This represents 10 million, except \nthese programs, although they have not been costly--$5 billion in \n2003--are excluded. That is what is unfair. The question is, Why are we \nexcluding them? It is not the additional burden. It could not be. The \nfacts do not justify it. There has to be another reason. The reason is, \nI believe, the fact they are the union members which the administration \nhas been strongly opposed to providing.\n  We say the White House is against it. The House is against it. \nTherefore, why should we include it? The fact is, the Senate had 100 \npercent, the House had nothing. You should have at least 50 percent.\n  The nature of the discussion in the course of the conference was, \nlet's find out what the real need is. That seemed to be a sensible and \nresponsible position, whatever the percentage. So we looked at what \nthey call the single corporation, which is accepted by Republican and \nDemocratic--certainly, the staffers, the professionals on this--as \nbeing a fairminded assessment. They found one in three of the \nmultiemployers are facing difficulty, but one in nine are facing severe \ndifficulty. We took the one in nine and tried to translate that into a \nformula that would help those in the most serious trouble. We all \nagreed on that--get a formula. It came out to approximately 20 percent.\n  That was in the newspapers. That is what the staff would certainly \nhave agreed Thursday, 2 weeks ago. That was the agreement. It was in \nthe Washington Post, not that that is the final word, but they have \nbeen following it closely. There is agreement that 20 percent of the \nworst-off plans should get assistance. That was my understanding. That \nwas reported. No one contested that.\n  Then we get a surprise. We are about to have a final meeting and the \nWhite House suddenly gets the word on this and says, no, no, we are not \ngoing to do that. They come up with language that will get us down to \napproximately 4 percent.\n  The rest is history. The efforts that were made to try to get it up, \nmove it from 20 down to 12 or 10, were all rejected as well. According \nto the Wall Street Journal, taking the language and going back to \nSegal, it is now probably 2 percent. The fact is, this is not going to \nput an additional burden on the Pension Guaranty Corporation. The \nemployer plans are more stable than single-employer pension plans \nbecause even if one employer goes out of business, the other employers \ncontinue to support the pension fund.\n  Of the thousands of multiemployer plans that have been insured by the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, only 33 multiemployer plans have \never received financial assistance from the PBGC, and the PBGC \nmultiemployer program has enjoyed a surplus for a 20-year history.\n  The idea is we have a fragile Pension Guaranty Corporation; we can \nonly do the single employer; we cannot afford to do the other. It does \nnot hold. So we have to ask, What is the other reason? Particularly \nafter we reached a fair compromise to only deal with those that were at \ngreatest risks. The answer was, we are not going to compromise on this. \nAs I mentioned at the time of the proposal, it was not a compromise, it \nwas basically an insult.\n  That is it. What the conference did was admirable with regard to \nsingle-employer plans. It is grossly unfair to the multiemployer plans. \nIt is basically excluding coverage for almost 10 million workers who \nare facing the same kind of economic challenges. The others, I \nseriously believe, we would have passed overwhelmingly, a proposal that \nwould have taken into consideration those that were at the greatest \nrisk in the multiple. They are the ones that are the pension programs \nthat deal with the smaller businesses. Some of those small business \nassociations strongly support the inclusion of the multiemployer and, \nof course, the large number of workers that will be affected.\n  I still believe we ought to take a position and a stand that says, \nlook, what we did for the single one makes sense. We are supporting. \nBut we also think it is grossly unfair to 10 million Americans to say \nwe are giving them the back of the hand when their expansion plans are \nunder the similar kind of pressure and they are representing workers \nwho are generally lower income and from smaller businesses and whose \npension plans are heavily stretched, given the economic times.\n  I talked to my friend from New Hampshire, and the Senator from \nWashington wanted some time. I believe the Senator from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, wanted a few minutes, and the Senator from New York. Then we \nwould be prepared to suggest to work out with the leadership an \nappropriate way to have a vote at an appropriate time and let others \nwho would like to speak on another subject be able to address the \nSenate. If there are other colleagues who want to speak, if they can \nlet us know forthwith, we will try to work out with the leadership and \nthe other side an appropriate time for a vote.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2236\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding \nsome time from this important debate on\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\npensions. Obviously it has been a busy day in Washington talking about \na variety of different issues important to our country.\n  One issue our colleagues ought to realize is pending business on our \ncalendar that could be brought up for discussion is, what should we do \nin light of the fact that we finally got a recommendation on reports \nabout the blackouts that happened in our country from New York through \nthe Midwest? We now have a report saying that liability legislation is \nneeded to ensure consumers can be protected from the transmission grid \nand the blackouts that have been occurring.\n  Many of my colleagues may think of the latest New York blackout that \nhappened just several months ago as a great catastrophe. Some of them \nmay have forgotten that since 1996, we have had many blackouts \nthroughout the United States. In fact, all of the States in black on \nthis map show the number of blackouts we have had in various regions. \nIn our Northwest region, in Washington, we had a blackout several years \nago that cost consumers not only inconvenience, but millions of dollars \nof impact.\n  The question is, What are we going to do to try to get consumers more \nreliability in electricity? While a lot of my colleagues would like to \nsay we will pass an energy bill, it has been clear for some time that \nthe Energy bill has gotten bogged down with a variety of items \ninvolving pork barrel spending. The most famous line my constituents \nremind me of in the Energy bill: Hooters, polluters and Enron looters. \nWhat are we doing about getting the energy policy this country needs \nand moving it forward?\n  One piece of legislation that has been hung up has been the \nreliability standards legislation. We have, this week, a report issued \nby the United States-Canada Power System Task Force, their final \nreport, asking, Why did the blackout happen in the United States and \nCanada and what do we want to do?\n  The No. 1 recommendation from the report is make reliability \nstandards mandatory and enforce them with penalties for noncompliance. \nThat was the No. 1 recommendation out of that report. Why don't we do \nthat? If we cannot agree on the rest of the Energy bill, why don't we \ntake this stand-alone piece of legislation and pass it so we can give \nconsumers the confidence that we have some rules and regulations in \nplace for reliability.\n  A lot of Americans woke up after the New York and Midwest blackout \nand said, geez, how did this happen?\n  I think a lot of people assumed there were rules and regulations in \nplace on reliability, but there are not. There is no rule in place that \nsays: This is how much electricity you have to have as a backup. There \nis no rule in place that says: This is how you need to make sure Akron, \nOH, or Toledo, OH, or someplace in New York has enough electricity, \ngiven the kinds of demands and the peak we are going to see in those \nareas. Those rules are not in place.\n  You can ask yourself why those rules are not in place, and what has \ntranspired on energy policy and been debated over the last several \nyears, as we moved towards deregulation. But the bottom line is, now \nthat a majority of States across the country since 1996 have had \nblackouts, we have had a demand for reliability legislation. We also \nnow have a task force that has said the No. 1 thing you need to do is \npass this legislation. Yet this legislation is being held hostage to \npassing a larger energy bill.\n  If my colleagues think I am overstating this case, I would like them \nto think about the legislative history here, because my predecessor, \nSlade Gorton, introduced similar legislation after Washington State had \na blackout. We had a blackout and said: Gee, this is crazy. How can you \nnot have reliability standards? How can you not have rules in place to \nmake sure there is enough power for consumers at peak times? He \nproposed reliability legislation that actually passed the Senate, and \ngot held hostage in the House of Representatives because people wanted \nto see more energy deregulation, so the legislation never passed. Now \nwe have been through two more Congresses where no reliability \nlegislation was passed.\n  The interesting thing is the majority of Members in both the House \nand the Senate actually support this bill, this stand-alone bill, that \nnow is sponsored by Senator Bingaman, Senator Snowe, Senator Clinton, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Schumer, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, and \nmyself. This legislation, I believe, does have the majority of support \nby both House and Senate Members. People want to see it pass, but it \ncontinues to be held hostage to getting a general energy bill.\n  I can tell my colleagues we have had enough of the energy debate, and \nI think even that this latest FSC/ETI bill, in which some of the energy \npackage was added to that legislation, is a sign of recognition by my \ncolleagues it is going to be very tough to get that comprehensive bill \nthis year. So why not do the responsible thing? Why not do the \nresponsible thing and have this energy legislation pass now as a stand-\nalone bill and give consumers the confidence there are rules and \nregulations in place before we have another blackout?\n  The issue has been clear for some time now, and has been debated and \nstudied by U.S.-Canada Power System Task Force. In fact, the task force \neven went on to say:\n\n       If reliability legislation had been enacted when first \n     proposed (in 1999), I believe that a blackout would not have \n     occurred.\n\n  That is a statement from the chairman of the North American Energy \nReliability Council. He testified before the Energy Committee. I asked \nhim this very question. I said: Do we need to pass this legislation? \nAnd should we pass it as a stand-alone? He said: Yes, we should. He \nwas, I think, then followed by the chairman of the committee, who said: \nWell, it is not time to do that yet. Let's keep pushing on the larger \nEnergy bill.\n  How many more weeks are we going to let go by with the American \nconsumer not having reliability standards in place, having their energy \nsupply in question about whether they are going to have reliability?\n  I know some people think: Well, gee, things happen. There is too much \ndemand.\n  You have an impact. Consumers, individuals, in various regions of the \ncountry have dealt with it. People should understand the New York \nblackout cost us between $4 billion and $10 billion for those days that \nbusinesses did not have power, when people could not conduct business, \nand could not continue with their livelihoods. That is merely what we \nended up losing in terms of revenue. Not only is it an inconvenience to \nconsumers and unsafe--an issue where we have left a lot of elderly \npeople without the resources and reliability they have counted on--we \nalso have negatively impacted our economy.\n\n  While we are here in Washington talking about national security and \nhow we make everyone more secure, the clearest answer is--at least with \nregard to the electricity grid--to pass this legislation, and pass it \nnow before we adjourn for another recess and leave these standards \nagain hostage to this Energy bill, saying we have to have a \ncomprehensive energy bill to pass it. It is not responsible to the \ncitizens of this country to leave them without these standards.\n  The legislation specifically gives the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission the authority to make sure, working with the North American \nEnergy Reliability Council, that these rules and regulations are in \nplace. Again, for some of my colleagues who may not be familiar with \nour electricity grid and how the system works, we do not have somebody \nright now who determines, in the various regions of the country, how \nmuch power supply an organization must have, or penalties for not \nhaving that supply.\n  The way regional transmission organizations have been formed, and the \nway they operate, is it is only one entity pushes the electricity out \nand puts more power onto the grid. These RTOs have no obligation or \nresponsibility to make sure there is reliability in the system.\n  I think that is shocking that our country, with a large economic \nengine and so many people depending on things such as e-commerce that \nare absolutely dependent upon electricity for millions of dollars, if \nnot billions of dollars, a day in transactions, can say that we have no \nreliability standards in place to protect consumers and businesses from \nthese kinds of outages that have occurred in the past.\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2236\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending bill be set \naside and that the Senate now turn to Calendar No. 465, S. 2236, a bill \nto enhance the reliability of the electric system; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in reluctant support, for the \nconference report in front of us.\n  The conference agreement makes great strides towards heading off an \nimpending crisis in private pensions. Requiring private companies to \nmeasure the solvency of their defined benefit plans with the 30-year \nTreasury bill as a benchmark has not been feasible for some time. Ever \nsince the U.S. Government stopped issuing these bonds, the market for \nthem, and the interest rates they pay, have been distorted. That forced \nbusinesses to contribute more to their pension plans than was really \nnecessary. During a time when private enterprise is under so much \npressure from foreign competition and a weak economy, these extra \ncontributions have been a tremendous strain on small and large \nbusinesses alike. Without the changes laid out in this bill, many \ncompanies would be forced to end their defined benefit plans.\n  Defined benefit plans are too scarce today, and we need to encourage \nand sustain their use by companies that have chosen to offer them. \nThese plans, which offer a set benefit usually based on how long an \nemployee has worked for a company, provide a kind of security for \nemployees that market-dependent 401(k)s and IRAs cannot.\n  Unfortunately, the benefits the bill handed out to all single-\nemployer plans were not given equally to multiemployer plans. There \nseems to be little reason for this decision, other than some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were unwilling to help out \nplans that benefit members of organized labor. There is some help for \nmultiemployer plans in this bill, but it is not nearly enough. I have \nheard from many unions, especially the construction trades, who \nstrongly oppose this bill because they believe it is mean spirited and \nwill force their members to make significant sacrifices. I am reluctant \nto vote against the men and women who build our homes and move our \ngoods, but I am not left much choice.\n  If we delay this bill beyond April 15, businesses across the country \nwill be forced to contribute large amounts of money to their pension \nplans to meet their quarterly obligations. Some of them will be unable \nto make those contributions and will be forced to withdraw the plan \nfrom their employees. To keep workers from losing their pension \nbenefits, and to remedy a long-overdue policy, I have to support the \nbill before us.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a section of the \nbill that will substantially benefit both businesses and consumers in \nWisconsin. Included in the pension legislation is a repeal of an \noutdated section of the Tax Code, section 809, which limits the ability \nof mutual life insurance companies to deduct a policy holder's \ndividends. The intent of the original legislation, as passed in 1984, \nwas to ensure equity between mutual and stock life insurance companies. \nWhile this concern has expired as the number of mutual life companies \nin the Nation has dramatically decreased, the damaging economic impact \nof the legislation remains. Mutual life insurers have been forced to \nreduce the amounts paid to policyholders as dividends or benefits, \nthereby increasing the cost of insurance.\n  Tax savings that will result from a repeal of section 809 will be \npassed on to policyholders in the form of increased dividends and lower \ninsurance costs. This comes at a critical time for Wisconsinites, where \nthe effect of repeal will be twofold. In addition to providing such \nbenefits to consumers, the mutual life insurance industry employs \nthousands of workers in my State. At a time when job loss across the \ncountry has been severe, this repeal will allow companies to avoid \ncost-cutting measures often resulting in job loss.\n  Unfortunately, the conferees were not as fair or reasoned in their \njudgment when they decided to include an antitrust exemption for \ngraduate medical resident matching program in this conference report. \nThis antitrust exemption was not reviewed or debated by either the \nSenate or the House, much less voted upon. The exemption will end many \nof the claims in an ongoing lawsuit brought by a number of medical \nstudents and residents that has already survived efforts to have it \ndismissed. The students contend that through the matching program, the \nhospitals depress wages and cause residents to work inordinately long \nhours to the detriment of patient care. This exemption appears to \neliminate all of the students' claims with the exception of their \nallegation of price fixing.\n  In general it is bad policy to provide exemptions to the antitrust \nlaws. It is certainly unusual to enact an exemption that ends part or \nall of an ongoing lawsuit. We should have had the opportunity to debate \nthis issue and determine whether there was any merit to the exemption, \nrather than see the exemption mysteriously appear on an unrelated bill. \nIt appears that this provision, enacted in this way, is nothing more \nthan a giveaway to one particular special interest. Without judging the \nmerits of the issue, we should have had an opportunity to explore it \nand make that decision for ourselves.\n  I have to agree with many of my colleagues who have argued that this \nconference report would have been greatly improved had Democratic \nconferees been allowed to participate fully in the conference. We have \na bill before us now that deserves support, but is not the good and \nfair work of which this body is capable, nor is it even near the \nquality of the bill passed overwhelming out of the Senate earlier this \nyear. I hope the Senate approves the measure today and continues to \nwork to address the inequities continued or created in the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I will vote in support of the \nPension Funding Equity Act conference agreement--although I do so with \nsome reluctance. On January 28, 2004, the Senate passed H.R. 3108 with \nbroad bipartisan support. The Senate-passed version addressed the \ncritical need to update the interest rate for the purposes of \ncalculating pension contributions. It also provided deficit reduction \nrelief for single-employer pension plans, and multiemployer plan \nrelief. It was a balanced bill which recognized that all companies \nholding defined benefit plans are suffering from the same market ills.\n  Apparently, because of heavy-handed pressure from the White House, \nthe conference agreement before us omits critical relief for all but 4 \npercent of multiemployer pension plans, to the detriment of thousands \nof union workers and small businesses that participate in multiemployer \npension plans. In my State of Connecticut, for example, the economic \ndownturn has been devastating for the Connecticut Iron Workers pension \nfund. This plan, which was fully funded a few years ago, now faces a \nfinancial crisis, and is desperately in need of the relief which is \ndenied under this bill, but which is being offered to 35 million \nworkers covered under single employer plans.\n  Senate conferees demonstrated an admirable willingness to reach a \nreasonable compromise on the multiemployer pension relief provision. \nThis compromise would have limited the multiemployer relief provisions \nto cover only 20 percent of multiemployer plans. I understand conferees \nwere willing to compromise even further. But the White House was \nadamant in their opposition to multiemployer plan provisions, which is \nhard to understand because, historically, multiemployer plans place \nvery little burden on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  I wish the President had taken a different stance. I understand that \nmy colleague, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, will soon introduce legislation to address the concerns of \nmultiemployer pension plans. I intend to support and cosponsor this \nlegislation, and would hope that Congress would act swiftly to pass \nsuch a measure.\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\n  In the meantime, I will vote for this bill, because I believe it is \nessential that we update the interest rate formula for pension \ncalculations prior to April 15, when the first quarterly payments of \nthe year become due. Without this relief, many pension plans will face \nunmanageable financial strains, and that will ultimately hurt workers. \nCompanies will be forced to grapple with decisions about layoffs, \npension cutbacks, and withholding critical investments. Like many \ncompanies around the Nation, Connecticut hospitals, for example, and \nother healthcare employers in my State, have been hard hit by poor \nasset returns, declining interest rates, and spiraling pension plan \ncosts. Without this replacement to the 30-year Treasury bond interest \nrate, I am informed that Connecticut hospitals will face financial hits \nthat they simply cannot absorb and will be forced to cut benefits.\n  I will vote in support of H.R. 3108 so that millions of current \nworkers covered by defined benefit plans will not see their benefits \nslashed, and so that additional resources will be available for \ninvestment and job creation. I urge my colleagues, however, to support \nlegislation to provide relief for multiemployer pension plans, and I \nurge the White House to listen to reason.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with so many baby boomers nearing \nretirement age, increasing the likelihood and availability of secure \nretirement savings is more important than ever. Strengthening our \nprivate, employer-based pension system is a critical component of this \neffort.\n  Right now, our Nation's companies are confronting real challenges in \nproviding adequate, guaranteed retirement benefits as the number of \nretired workers grows and global competition increases. This is a big \npart of the crisis that we are experiencing in our manufacturing \nsector. Across the Nation, 2.8 million manufacturing jobs have been \nlost during the Bush administration. Michigan alone has lost over \n180,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. Our States and our Nation cannot \ncontinue to sustain such losses, and action is needed on many fronts to \naddress the crisis.\n  This bill is a small, but important, step toward helping with our \nmanufacturing crisis. For the companies whose plans this bill helps, it \nwill free up resources for equipment upgrades, new hires, R, and \nother investments in the future.\n  I am troubled by the fact that the component of this bill dealing \nwith most multiemployer pension plans that had overwhelming support in \nthe Senate has been dropped out of this conference report. I am hopeful \nthat we can provide relief to those multiemployer plans soon. That is \nwhy I will cosponsor Senator Kennedy's bill that would do just that.\n  If I thought that defeating this bill would help the many pension \nrecipients whose plans were left out of this conference report, that \nwould be one thing. However, after careful thought, I have concluded \nthat defeating this bill would not achieve that goal but would only \nhurt those who do get the much-needed relief in the bill.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference \nreport for H.R. 3108, the Pension Funding Equity Act, which the Senate \nis now considering. The original version of this bill that the House \npassed last year changed the discount rate used by defined benefit \npension plans to calculate their pension liabilities from an interest \nrate based on the now defunct 30-year Treasury bond to an interest rate \nbased on the average rate of return on high-quality long-term corporate \nbonds for plan years beginning in 2004 and 2005. There is a strong but \nnot conclusive argument that the discount rate should be changed. \nAccording to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--PBGC, \nreplacement of the 30-year Treasury rate will allow companies to lower \ntheir pension contributions by $80 billion over the next 2 years.\n  When this legislation reached the Senate, however, it became a magnet \nfor giveaways to financially weak companies. The industries in which \nsome of these financially weak companies operate are notorious for \nhaving woefully underfunded pension plans. Furthermore, select \ncompanies were also given additional relief. Why these companies \ndeserve special breaks and others do not is not easily discernable. \nMulti-employer plans were also given a 2-year delay in recognizing \ninvestment losses. The most troubling section in the Senate version of \nthe bill provided that any company could apply with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to waive a portion of its deficit reduction contribution. \nFortunately for taxpayers, this provision was stripped from the bill \nduring conference.\n  While the House-Senate conference report produced a pension bill that \nis much more limited in increasing PBGC's deficit than the Senate \nversion, it still allows companies with underfunded pension plans to \nset aside less, thus increasing their pension deficits. According to \nthe PBGC, the deficit reduction contribution waivers, special breaks to \nselect companies, and the multi-employer plan relief, will allow \ncompanies to pay billions less into their pension plans, in addition to \nthe $80 billion less because of the discount rate change. In total, the \nconference committee report probably relaxes corporate pension funding \nrequirements by close to $90 billion over 2 years.\n  Allowing weak companies to pay less into their pension plans than is \nrequired by current law would be analogous to a credit card company \nallowing a financially distressed customer to pay less than his or her \nrequired monthly minimum payments. Just as credit card companies \nrequire minimum payments to ensure consumers do not fall too far behind \nin debt, the PBGC requires companies with defined benefit pension plans \nto make deficit reduction contributions to catch up on their funding. I \nthink all of my colleagues would agree, when you're in a hole, the \nfirst rule of thumb is to stop digging. Allowing companies with \nunderfunded pension plans to dig the hole deeper could cause premiums \nfor well-funded plans to rise, and retirees could face cuts in pension \nbenefits if their defined benefit pension plans are terminated.\n  I also am deeply concerned that the conference report does not \ninclude a ``hold harmless'' provision for the PBGC. The agency is \ncurrently in the worst financial condition in its history. Because it \ncontinues to absorb the losses of terminated pension plans, the PBGC \nreported a record deficit in its single employer program of $11.2 \nbillion for fiscal year 2003, and for the first time ever, its multi-\nemployer program ended the fiscal year in a deficit situation. The PBGC \ncurrently remains exposed to $85 billion in pension underfunding in \nplans sponsored by financially weak employers. I am thus concerned that \ntaxpayers may one day be forced to bail out the PBGC.\n  In September 2003, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on Financial Management, the Budget, and International \nSecurity, I held a hearing on the PBGC and defined benefit pension \nplans. While proponents of the deficit reduction contribution waiver \nand multi-employer plan relief claimed that funding rules are too \nstrict for companies in America, what I found was just the opposite--\nthat current funding requirements are inadequate to fully protect the \npensions of America's workers and retirees when their plans terminate. \nCompanies can stop making contributions when their plans are funded at \n90 percent of ``current liability.'' Trouble is, the definition of \n``current liability'' is the result of past legislative compromises, \nand does not reflect the amount of money needed to pay all benefits if \na plan terminates. ``Current liability'' assumes the company is an on-\ngoing business, and thus does not recognize the early retirements that \ntake place when an employer goes out of business and terminates its \npension plan. Nor does ``current liability'' recognize the full cost of \nproviding annuities as measured by group annuity practices in the \nprivate market.\n  Pension benefits are measured against ``termination liability'' if a \ncompany goes out of business and terminates its pension plan. \nTermination liability reflects an employer's cost to settle pension \nobligations in the private market. In the example of Bethlehem Steel, \nthe company reported that it was 84 percent funded on a ``current \nliability'' basis in its last filing prior to termination. When the \nPBGC took over the Bethlehem plan, however, it turned out that the plan \nwas\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nonly 45 percent funded on a termination basis. In my judgment, \ntherefore, further relaxing the already lax contribution requirements \nfor weak companies with underfunded plans is imprudent.\n  As members of Congress we should not pass laws that encourage \ncompanies to manage pension plans in an irresponsible manner. Companies \nwith underfunded pension plans will continue to run up deficits until \neveryone loses--workers, retirees, and taxpayers. We make a mistake \ntoday by giving weak companies the tools to dig their holes deeper.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to ask my colleague Senator Grassley, a \nfellow manager of the conference report and Chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, whether he shares my view that, notwithstanding the \nenactment of this legislation, all of the existing relief measures \napplicable to multiemployer plans under ERISA and the Internal Revenue \nCode will remain available to multiemployer plans. Specifically, the \nmultiemployer plan relief provisions in this legislation are in \naddition to, and not in lieu of, the existing relief measures \napplicable to multiemployer plans. Multiemployer plans that satisfy the \ncriteria for relief under the existing measures are not precluded from \nobtaining relief under the existing relief measures. Is that your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I share my colleague's understanding. Under \ncurrent law, the IRS is authorized to waive all or a portion of the \nminimum funding standard requirements for a given year or, \nalternatively, to allow plans to extend the period for amortizing their \nliabilities for up to an additional 10 years, so long as certain \nrequired showings are made. IRS regulations also include what is known \nas the ``shortfall funding method.'' The enactment of the short-term \nmultiemployer plan relief in this legislation is not in any way \nintended to foreclose the availability of any of these existing relief \nmeasures to multiemployer plans.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the conference \nreport on H.R. 3108. While there is much to commend in the measure, the \nconferees failed to include meaningful relief for the multiemployer \npension plans to which thousands of mostly small businesses and their \nworkers contribute. That was not the case when this measure left the \nSenate, nor was it apparently the case in the conference committee \nprior to the intervention of the Administration. Members of the \nconference committee have noted that bipartisan negotiations on this \nmeasure in committee had been productive prior to the insistence by the \nWhite House that the provisions extending relief to multiemployer plans \nbe greatly restricted, leaving thousands of businesses and 9.4 million \nworkers high and dry.\n  Particularly disturbing are reports that while multiemployer plan \nrelief was drastically reduced by the conferees, special consideration \nwas provided for at least one large corporation that contributes to a \nmultiemployer plan. The Wall Street Journal today reported that ``the \nfinal provisions also showed the remarkable influence'' of that \ncorporation, noting that it ``used the bill to pursue its own agenda'' \nand that the provisions in the conference report were ``tailored to \nprovide the most help'' to the fund to which the company contributed. \nThis tailored assistance stands in stark contrast to the lack of relief \nto the thousands of smaller employers and the workers they employ.\n  Mr. President, I supported the pension relief package that the \nFinance Committee crafted a few weeks ago. I am pleased that some of \nthe provision in that measure remain in the conference report, and that \nwith the expected passage of this legislation many plans will get the \nrelief they need. But I regret that while conferees reportedly tailored \nmultiemployer relief to help at least one large corporation, they \nabandoned the multiemployer relief that helps thousands of small \nbusinesses and their workers. I very much hope this body will act to \ncorrect that serious flaw without delay.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I spoke earlier about the conference \nreport to H.R. 3108. I wanted to discuss one additional provision of \nthe bill that has not received much attention in the debate because it \nwas not part of the bill until just a day or two ago.\n  I am very troubled by the eleventh hour addition to this conference \nreport of a provision that purports to grant an antitrust exemption to \nthe graduate medical resident matching programs. We have had no \nhearings on that issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and no \nlanguage has ever been presented to the Committee or to the Senate. For \nthe managers of this bill to insert a controversial provision with no \nSenate debate or discussion is the worst way to legislate, particularly \nin the complicated area of antitrust law.\n  I note, in addition, that Subsection (b)(3) of section 207 explicitly \npreserves the right to bring an antitrust lawsuit alleging any type of \nprice-fixing arrangement among two or more graduate medical education \nprograms. Therefore, the antitrust exemption that is described in \nsubsection (b)(2) apparently does not apply to the lawsuit pending in \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, although I rise in support of the \nconference report for the Pension Funding Equity Act, I have serious \nreservations about the lack of relief for multiemployer pension plans. \nThis provision is yet another instance of the White House undermining \nconference committee negotiations and shutting out fair and full \nparticipation by Democratic conferees.\n  During the 108th Congress, Democrats have been locked out of \nconference negotiations time and time again in an unprecedented manner. \nThis includes the energy bill, Medicare prescription drug benefit, and \nthe omnibus appropriations. Given the importance of addressing the use \nof the 30-year Treasury bond rate to compute pension liabilities, our \nside reluctantly agreed to a conference on this bill as a test case for \nbipartisan cooperation. Unfortunately, the Senate has failed that test.\n  The Senate version of this legislation, which passed by a vote of 86-\n9, would have provided relief to all 1,600 multiemployer pension plans \nand the 9.7 million workers who have such pensions. During the \nconference negotiations, there was a tentative agreement to provide \nrelief to 20 percent of the multiemployer plans and to reduce the \namount of relief that the Senate version would have provided by roughly \nhalf. But then the White House interfered and insisted that the relief \nfor multiemployer pension plans be dramatically reduced. Offers to \ncover 12 percent or even 10 percent of all multiemployer pension \nplans--only half of the original conference agreement--were rejected.\n  As a result, this conference report--approved by a party-line vote--\nprovides relief to less than 4 percent of all multiemployer pensions \nand provides less than one-third of the relief provided by the Senate \nversion.\n  In addition to my concerns regarding this procedural breakdown in the \nconference committee, I also am troubled by the substance of this \nprovision that the White House insisted be reduced. This conference \nreport provides only $250 million in relief to multiemployer pension \nplans. These plans receive no aid from the other provisions in this \nlegislation.\n  Without relief from Congress, these plans will remain in crisis. For \nexample, in Rockford, IL, the local iron workers union has a pension \nplan that covers more than 400 participants and has approximately 100 \nemployer contributors. This plan is in jeopardy. Although multiemployer \npension plans often are characterized as providing pensions for \n``unionized workers,'' bear in mind that more than 60,000 businesses--\nmostly small businesses--contribute to multiemployer pension plans. In \nRockford, if the iron workers' pension plan is not viable, the 100 \ncompanies and contractors that contribute to that plan and act as its \nsignatories may face collapse if faced with the plan's failure and its \nwithdrawal liability.\n  Therefore, we must provide aid to protect the millions of workers \ncovered by multiemployer pensions and the tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses that employ these workers. Today, I am joining with Senators \nKennedy, Baucus, Daschle, and others to introduce a bill that would \nprovide fair and equitable aid for these troubled multiemployer \npensions. I hope this measure will be enacted as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n  Despite my concerns regarding the lack of relief for multiemployer \npensions, I rise in support of the conference report because of its \ndeficit reduction contribution relief and its 30-year Treasury bond \nrate fix. For almost 6 months, I have worked to ensure that DRC \nrelief--especially for the airline and steel industries--would be \nincluded in any pension legislation enacted by this Congress.\n  The DRC relief in this conference report would provide more than $1.6 \nbillion in aid to the airline and steel industries over the next 2 \nyears for companies that had well-funded pension plans as recently as \n2000, but need assistance now. This aid would allow these industries to \nregain their financial footing by providing relief from DRC surcharges \nof up to 80 percent in 2004 and 2005. This assistance is vital for \nUnited Airlines, based in my home State Illinois. As a result, the \npensions of almost 130,000 participants in United's pension plans, \nincluding over 22,000 participants in Illinois, will be more secure.\n  I also support this conference report because it would provide a 2-\nyear replacement of the 30-year Treasury bond rate in computing pension \nliabilities. Nationally, this provision will provide $80 billion in \nrelief to the 31,000 companies that provide single-employer pension \nplans and cover nearly 35 million workers and retirees.\n  I have heard from many Illinois companies supporting this provision. \nThey include Caterpillar, Goodyear, John Deere, Smurfit Stone and the \nChildren's Memorial Hospital. Unless this provision is enacted before \nApril 15, the pension funding requirements for these companies will \ngrow by millions of dollars and the pensions of thousands of Illinois \nworkers will be in jeopardy.\n  Although this conference report is not perfect, I will vote in favor \nof it to provide aid to the airline and steel industries and to \ncompanies that provide single-employer pensions. However, I also look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nprovide adequate and equitable relief to multiemployer pension plans as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to express my great disappointment with this \nconference agreement and to explain why I will vote against it.\n  This legislation, H.R. 3108, was originally intended to provide a \ntemporary solution to a legitimate and serious problem facing all \ndefined benefit pension plans--the interest rate used to calculate \nfunding liabilities, the 30-year Treasury bond, is no longer being \nissued by the Federal Government, and consequently the rate has dropped \nto a point that companies would be forced to contribute far in excess \nof what is necessary to their pension plans if Congress does not \nprovide a remedy. I have always supported efforts to make this \nnecessary change to the interest rate and, in fact, I believe that \nPresident Bush put forward a reasonable permanent solution last year.\n  Because of disagreements over that permanent interest rate change, \nhowever, Congress was forced to seek a temporary solution to give us \nadditional time to resolve our differences. H.R. 3108, as originally \napproved by the House, only included temporary interest rate relief; \nand that is all it ever should have included.\n  When it came time for the Senate to consider H.R. 3108, it was viewed \nas a ``must do'' bill, and thus attracted additional items that I \nbelieve should not have been included.\n  My primary concern is that the Senate added relief from the ``deficit \nreduction contribution'' for certain severely underfunded plans. The \nDRC is a special catch-up contribution that seriously underfunded \nplans--generally, plans that are 90 percent funded or less--are \nsupposed to make to bring their plans back to full-funding. When the \nSenator began discussing adding DRC relief for airlines, steel \ncompanies, and possibly other industries, I expressed my opposition.\n  I believe that the DRC relief is harmful to workers, unfair to \nhealthy pension plans, unfair to competitors who are not receiving the \nrelief, and exposes taxpayers to unacceptable risks.\n  Underfunded plans are harmful to workers because they jeopardize \nexpected pension benefits--especially for workers who are to receive \nlarger pensions than the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporate--PBGC--\nwill guarantee, such as airline pilots. Companies should be required to \nfund their pension promises to their employees, they should not be \nexcused from these promises.\n  DRC relief is unfair to healthy plans because an underfunded plan \nthat fails will pay benefits using the insurance premiums paid to the \nPBGC by healthy plans. Further, many plans have made the difficult yet \nresponsible financial decisions to fully fund their pensions. It is \nunfair to excuse other companies, who may have been less responsible, \nfrom these same promises.\n  The DRC waiver in the conference agreement applies only to certain \nairline and steel companies. The DRC waiver is really a back-door \nbailout for some companies and is unfair to their competitors that \ncannot benefit from the waiver, either because they have fully funded \ntheir pension plans or because they offer a different kind of \nretirement benefit to their employees.\n  Finally, the DRC waiver exposes taxpayers to a greater risk that the \nPBGC will require a taxpayer bailout. The PBGC recently reported a \ndeficit of $11.2 billion in its single-employer insurance plan for \nfiscal year 2003--a record. While the PBGC estimates it will have \nsufficient assets to meet obligations for years to come, the failure of \nseveral large plans could change that.\n  Further, PBGC estimates that the sum total of all single-employer \npension plan underfunding is about $400 billion. And Congress--meaning \nthe U.S. taxpayers--would certainly bail out the PBGC, rather than \nallow the entire insurance system for defined benefit pension plans to \ncollapse.\n  Because the Senate was insistent upon providing some DRC relief, \nhowever, I worked with my colleagues in the Republican leadership and \non the Senate Finance Committee to scale back the relief so that it \nwould cause less damage to our pension system, would be less harmful to \ncompetition, and would expose the taxpayers to marginally less \nliability. I worked to reduce the DRC waiver to 80 percent of the DRC \nliability in the first year and 60 percent in the second year. The idea \nwas that by the second year, and with the interest rate relief, plans \nshould begin turning their finances around such that they can make a \ngreater percentage of the necessary payments to bring their plans back \nto full funding. This is what the Senate approved in its version of \nH.R. 3108 and I am very disappointed that the Senate position was \nabandoned during the conference negotiations.\n  I am also disappointed that we could not agree to protect the \ntaxpayers from increased liabilities that could occur as a result of \nthe DRC waiver. At a minimum, we should have stipulated that the PBGC \nwould be ``held harmless'' for any benefit increases that occur during \nthe waiver period. I believe we should have protected healthy plans and \ntaxpayers by adopting a ``hold harmless'' provision for the PBGC. One \nof the big dangers with the DRC waiver is that the plans claiming the \nwaiver will fail anyway in the near future, and by granting these plans \na DRC waiver their funding situation will be even worse when the PBGC \nassumes these plans. A ``hold harmless'' provision would have mitigated \nthis harm and limit the drain on healthy plans.\n  The DRC waiver is exactly the wrong thing to do. The system of DRC \npayments was devised because companies were habitually underfunding \ntheir plans. We should not aid and abet habitual underfunders by \nwaiving much of their DRC liability. I must vote against the conference \nagreement because the DRC waiver is more comprehensive than what was \napproved by the Senate; because it fails to protect taxpayers; because \nthe waiver is unfair to healthy plans that have responsibly funded \ntheir promises; and because the waiver provides a back-door bailout to \ncertain airlines and steel companies, which is unfair to their \ncompetitors. I agree that there may be problems with the DRC system and \nthat reforms may be in order. But we should make any reforms through a \nmore thoughtful and deliberate process, taking into consideration the \nexperience and recommendations of the PBGC.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my thoughts before this \nvery difficult vote on the Pension Funding Equity Act conference bill. \nThe bill arrives at a reasonable immediate solution to a very \ncomplicated problem.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nHowever, I do have concerns about the larger problem of pension funding \nrules in the US, and I have grave concerns about the treatment of \nmulti-employer plans in this conference bill.\n  I supported this bill when it passed the Senate in January by a vote \nof 86-9. That bill provided a reasonable approach to funding single-\nemployer plans--a 2 year corporate bond rate. I was especially \nsatisfied with the 2-year amortization of losses for multi-employer \nplans.\n  When the White House wanted this provision struck in conference, an \nagreement was arrived at by conferees to cover the 20 percent of multi-\nemployer plans most in need. The White House, however, held up these \nimportant negotiations and insisted on virtually eliminating multi-\nemployer relief.\n  Clearly, immediate funding relief is needed. We have known that this \nwas coming for well over a year. With the drop in the 30-year treasury \nrate corresponding directly with declining stock values, pension plans \nhave become drastically underfunded. This situation doesn't just hurt \nthe bottom line right now, it hurts the defined benefit system as a \nwhole and jeopardizes the retirement security of millions of workers.\n  I have been concerned as this bill has evolved that it represents a \nband-aid approach that addresses immediate funding obligations without \nfixing the larger problem. There are perverse incentives that actually \nprevent employers from keeping money in the pension plan when times are \ngood, so that we end up having to bail them out when times are bad. We \nneed to put serious effort in the coming years to work out defined \nbenefit pension plan funding in general.\n  I don't believe we take these long-term problems seriously enough. \nTwo years ago, when we came up with the initial readjustment of the 30-\nyear treasury rate, it was my hope that we would address these problems \nbefore the issue came up again. But, here we are--2 years later and no \nfarther ahead. I am afraid that unless we focus on this issue this \nCongress, we'll be looking at simply extending this rate again in 2 \nyears without any understanding of the impact of this rate on defined \nbenefit pensions, on the economy, or on the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation.\n  I am sure that it comes as no shock to my colleagues that the stock \nmarket actually falls from time to time. Sometimes, by more than 25 \npercent. Yet, we allow companies to transfer funds out of their \npensions when times are good, leaving only a 25 percent cushion for \nwhen times are bad. We offer little in the way of incentives to pad \nplans in the good years to carry them through the bad years.\n\n  Many advocates characterize this funding climate as the ``perfect \nstorm.'' I believe that it's a storm that could have been more easily \nweathered had companies been prepared for a rainy day. However, the \nonus is reasonably on Congress to establish tax and accounting policies \nthat create positive incentives to do so. I think we should consider \nincreasing the funding level required prior to a section 420 transfer, \nat the same time, increasing the amount of money that can be kept on \nhand receiving favorable tax treatment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to find a more precise \nsolution to this delicate balance between making defined benefit \npensions attractive for companies, while protecting workers. I share \nwith my colleagues the goal of ensuring the viability of the defined \nbenefit system.\n  Having said that, there is no other answer for the immediate problems \nfacing us than to provide the funding relief provided in this measure. \nI think we absolutely need to do something now for the companies we can \nhelp. We need to help the airlines, we need to help the machinists. \nEighty percent of this bill makes sense and is the right policy for the \nmoment. Unfortunately, the White House has chosen to play politics with \nthe income security of workers in multi-employer plans, and of the \nbusinesses that participate in those plans. There is no good reason for \ndropping these plans from the agreement, except to cause pain to \ncertain working families. I plan to work with Senator Kennedy and other \ncolleagues very soon to repair the harm done in this portion of the \nbill to members of the construction trades, the Teamsters, IBEW, \nPlumbers and Steamfitters, Sheet Metal, Finishing Contractors, \nOperating Engineers, Bricklayers and other participants in multi-\nemployer plans.\n  I am supporting this conference bill to help enact its truly \nnecessary provisions--the vast bulk of the legislation which will keep \nother plans from freezing in the face of the current funding situation. \nBut I will not drop my concern for those who are harmed.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like the record to show my \nviews on the conference on H.R. 3108, the Pension Funding Equity Act. \nThe conference report includes several provisions that I support. Most \nimportant among them is funding relief for single-employer defined-\nbenefit pension plans, which will aid 35 million workers. The \nconference report also closes a huge tax loophole utilized by the \nwealthiest Americans to shield investment income known as the small \ninsurance company loophole, or Section 501(c)(15). I applaud the work \nthat crafted these provisions. I am particularly pleased that the \npensions of hard-working Americans in the auto, steel, airline and \nother industries will have safer pensions and more secure retirements. \nI strongly support these provisions, and I can understand why many of \nmy colleagues will cast a vote for this conference report.\n  The problem, and the reason for my opposition to the overall \nconference report, is that it provides hardly any relief for millions \nof Americans participating in multi-employer pension plans, despite \nstrong bipartisan support for such relief in the original Senate bill. \nThe Senate bill provided relief to all multi-employer plans, and that \nbill passed the Senate by the overwhelming vote of 86 to 9. After that, \nthe conferees agreed on a bipartisan basis to limit relief to the 20 \npercent of plans that most needed it. But then, we have been told, the \nWhite House insisted that multi-employer relief be essentially gutted. \nI regret that the White House and the Republican conferees, on a \nstrictly partisan basis, have done this. It means that nearly 10 \nmillion Americans who participate in multi-employer pension plans have \nbeen cast aside for no good reason.\n  The Republicans' insistence that multi-employer relief be stripped \nfrom the legislation, despite overwhelming Senate support for more \nwidespread relief, also means that America's small businesses that \nparticipate in multi-employer plans will receive very little help. As \nranking member on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \nI believe that to ignore small business is to ignore the great engine \nof our economy. More jobs are created in America by small businesses \nthan any other sector of our economy.\n  Just a week ago, President Bush claimed that ``the small business \nagenda is vibrant and foremost on our agenda.'' He said that it's \nimportant to reduce taxes, so ``small businesses have got more money to \ninvest and to expand.'' But at the same time the White House was \npulling the rug out from under thousands of small businesses. More than \nhalf of the 65,000 employers in multi-employer plans are small \nbusinesses--real small businesses run by real families. So despite the \nPresident's rhetoric about small business, the White House has refused \nto help small business owners provide more secure pensions for \nthemselves and their workers. These small businesses won't be able to \ninvest and expand because they'll be paying excise taxes imposed by the \nIRS due to the crisis in their pension plans.\n  Mr. President, I support funding relief for single-employer plans. I \nam very glad that Congress has acted to help Americans participating in \nthose plans. I am also glad to see tax loopholes closed whenever \npossible. But I regret that the Senate, after voting 86 to 9 to help \nAmericans in both single-employer and multi-employer plans, is now \nleaving nearly 10 million Americans and thousands of small businesses \nout in the cold.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of this \nconference report today because many of the private pension systems in \nthis nation are on the verge of collapse.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n  Many companies are staring at an April 15 pension payment date. \nWithout this legislation many companies will not be able to make their \npayments because of the effect of both the recent economic recession \nand the requirement that they use a payment calculation that is based \non the discontinued 30-year Treasury bond.\n  I deeply regret the action taken by the conference committee to \nremove much of the assistance targeted toward multi-employer plans. I \nwill support steps to correct this grievous action.\n  It is critical, however, that we pass this legislation today because \n44 million pensioners are at risk of losing their hard-earned benefits.\n  While I wish the bill would do more, I believe it is important for \nseveral reasons:\n  One, this bill corrects several problems facing our private pension \nplans. These plans use the 30-year Treasury bond to determine the \ninterest rate they may assume when making their periodic pension \npayments.\n  Because the 30-year Treasury bond is no longer in use by the federal \ngovernment we must replace this mechanism and this bill does that.\n  Companies that have fallen behind in their pension payments are \nrequired under current law to make catch-up payments, or what we call \ndeficit reduction contribution payments. A company must make these \npayments in addition to its regularly scheduled pension payments.\n  These additional payments raise the possibility that many companies \nwill be driven into bankruptcy when it is discovered that they simply \ndo not have the cash available to make these payments. This bill gives \ncompanies 2 years of relief from these payments.\n  This 2-year relief period provides these companies with an \nopportunity to get back on solid financial ground before beginning \nthese payments again and it goes a long way in preventing the closure \nof pension plans by helping companies avoid bankruptcy.\n  Two, this bill targets much needed relief to the airline, steel, and \niron industries by allowing them to receive the deficit reduction \nrelief automatically unless they were subject to these catch-up \npayments in 2000.\n  These industries, more than most, have been reeling from the \nlingering effects of September 11, 2001 and the ensuing economic \ndownturn. I have received more than 280 phone calls from United Airline \npilots telling me that if this bill does not pass, United Airlines may \nhave to terminate their pension plan as they work through bankruptcy. \nManagement and labor at United Airlines are in total agreement on this \nissue and I have 35,000 United Airline pension participants in my home \nState of California.\n  It is clear that this bill provides more relief to single-employer \npension plans than those maintained by a multiple number of employers--\nthe so-called multi-employer pension plans. I would like to see us \naddress this issue in the near future and I will work with Senator \nKennedy to make sure this happens. But, today we have the opportunity \nto do something good for the 35 million pension plan participants who \nare participating in mostly single-employer plans.\n  This legislation is not perfect, but it represents a commonsense \napproach to help solve the problem facing the majority of pension \nplans. I supported the Senate version of this bill because it included \nbetter assistance for multi-employer plans and I continue to think that \nthe conference committee should have reported a bill that provided \nthese multi-employer plans broader coverage.\n  While the conference committee did not provide us a bill containing \nall that I had hoped for, it did report to us a bill that will provide \nreal support to real companies and labor groups.\n  We must do what we can before these faltering pension plans are \ndriven under by the impending April pension payments.\n  I cannot support a move to defeat the whole bill because it doesn't \naddress every need.\n  Thirty-five million pensioners will be assisted by this bill. \nCompanies like C Sugar located in Northern California will be helped \nand more than 35,000 United Airlines pension plan participants who live \nin California will be helped.\n  The men and women who have invested their careers in a company should \nnot lose the pensions they are due. But, if we do not pass this \nconference report, many will and this should not be allowed to happen.\n  While this legislation is not perfect, it represents movement in the \nright direction and I support it with the understanding that we need to \naddress the larger issue facing multi-employer plans.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am voting for this pension conference \nreport, but I do so with serious reservations.\n  There are 35 million workers nationwide who participate in single-\nemployer pension plans and who will benefit from this legislation. They \nneed help now. Many of their pension plans are in trouble. Some are \nteetering on the verge of bankruptcy. This bill will help ensure \ngreater retirement security for these hard working Americans.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not help all pension plans and all \nworkers. More than 9 million workers in multi-employer pension plans \nwill not be covered by this bill. All of these workers were covered in \nthe bill that passed the Senate, which I supported and which passed the \nSenate with 86 votes. Leaving them out was a partisan and ideological \ndecision that leaves us with a truly sub-par solution to the pension \nplan crisis in America.\n  There is nothing wrong with what is in the bill. The problem is what \nhas been left out. Senator Kennedy is absolutely right on the merits. \nWe should help all workers. We should not be picking winners and \nlosers. I will work with Senator Kennedy and the rest of my colleagues \nto pass the Senate provision on assisting multi-employer plans at the \nfirst and every available opportunity.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this afternoon I will vote to adopt \nthe pension reform legislation before the Senate. However, I do so with \nserious reservations. The reforms in this bill are critical for both \npension security and economic growth. Congress cannot allow April 15 to \npass without updating the interest rate on which pension liabilities \nare based. As constructive as this legislation is, it is incomplete. \nThis bill fails to address the needs of multi-employer pension plans. I \nwill support the pension improvements we have before us today, but I \nwill continue to fight for similar relief for the millions of employees \nwho were left behind in this unfortunately partisan process.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that the bill before us today is \ncritical. If the Senate fails to pass this legislation today, then next \nweek businesses will be required to make contributions to their pension \nplans based on an outdated interest rate. If we require companies to \nmake billions of dollars in overpayments to their pension plans, then \nwe are hurting economic growth and ultimately undermining the plans. I \ndo not want workers to lose their pension benefits, because their \nemployers determined that they could not comply with unreasonable \nfunding rules.\n  This conference report also provides much needed relief from deficit \nreduction contributions (DRC), especially for airlines and steel \ncompanies. The grace period provided here does not diminish employers' \nobligations to fully meet the promises they have made to their workers. \nIt simply provides some needed flexibility to help companies recover \nfrom the recent economic downturn. This relief is essential for the \nfinancial stability of the steel industry and the airline industry. \nProtecting the pensions of those workers while ensuring that their \nemployers have the opportunity to strengthen their businesses has been \none of my main priorities since this debate began. I am very pleased \nthat the DRC relief was included in the final legislation.\n  Mr. President, while there is much to support in this bill, there is \nalso a gaping whole in the pension security we are providing to \nAmerican workers. Almost 10 million workers, participants in multi-\nemployer pension plans, were abandoned by the conference committee. \nDespite strong bipartisan support for multi-employer relief in the \nSenate, the White House insisted it be dropped from the bill. I cannot \naccount for this insensitivity. Participants in multi-employer pension \nplans are typically lower wage, union workers who are employed by \nseveral small businesses over the course of their careers.\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nTo claim that these workers do not deserve the same pension security as \nother workers is unconscionable.\n  When the Senate voted on its own version of pension relief which \nincluded multi-employer plans, it garnered 86 votes in favor. Senators \nwere pleased to support a bill that is so important for businesses and \nworkers all across this country. The process by which the conference \ncommittee flagrantly disregarded the interests of 86 Senators is \nanother sad example of the partisan dysfunction that has come to \ncharacterize House-Senate conference committees. And it is a lesson \nthat this Senator will not forget.\n  So, Mr. President, today I will meet my responsibilities to update \nthe pension funding rules prior to the April 15 deadline for required \npension contributions. I will gladly support the DRC relief that this \nlegislation accords single-employer pension plans. But let my \ncolleagues be aware, I will continue to fight to provide similar \nsecurity to all of the workers who are participating in multi-employer \nplans. I am hopeful that in the near future Congress will live up to \nour obligations to those workers as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report on the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2003. The \nconference report the Senate is considering today is a hollow promise \nfor America's workers. This bill helps some companies and workers, but \nfails others. It provides relief for pension plans that cover 35 \nmillion American workers, including auto, steel and transit workers, \nand airline pilots. I support making sure their pension plans are safe.\n  But, this conference report fails to provide relief to the multi-\nemployer pension plans that cover 9.7 million unionized workers. Many \nof these Americans work for small businesses, including many in my \nstate. These workers are boilermakers, shipbuilders, electricians, and \ncarpenters. I want to stand up for these workers to make sure their \npensions are safe also.\n  I voted for a bill in the U.S. Senate in January, which was a truly \ngenuine, bipartisan effort, passing by an overwhelming vote of 86-9. \nThe bill I voted for wasn't perfect, but it was a solid, bipartisan \nbill.\n  Because of recent economic events, pension plans were hit by the \nperfect storm of a stock market crash, historically low interest rate, \nand a weak economy. So, many pension plans were in a crisis. Pension \nplans were calculating their liabilities based on an outdated rate that \nis no longer issued. By switching to a more accurate rate, pension \nplans will have lower funding needs which frees up money to buy plants \nand equipment and hire workers. This is a temporary fix while Congress \nreviews the issue and comes up with a permanent solution. I support \nthis move.\n  Large pension plans that were particularly hit hard by the downturn \nin the stock market and the weak economy also are given a temporary \nbreak on their ``catch up'' contributions to give them a break while \nthe economy recovers. I also support this provision.\n  Yet when I voted for the pension bill last January, there was pension \nrelief for all pension plans, the large pension plans and the multi-\nemployer plans which are common in small businesses, and used by \nplumbers, carpenters, shipbuilders, and truckers.\n  Some believe that the conference report we're considering today is \nthe best we can do. I believe we could have done better. We must do \nbetter. We make sure all workers pensions are safe.\n  I'm voting against this bill because of its impact on people, yet I \nhave to say something about the process. This was far from Congress's \nusual procedure. It was passed by the Senate by an overwhelming \nmajority. However, the Senate's views were disregarded in conference. \nWe were handed this conference report and told to take it or leave it. \nThis is legislation that will affect the lives of 44 million Americans, \nbut it fails to provide help for nearly 10 million of those Americans. \nI cannot support that.\n  I know that some in Maryland are asking, ``Why are you voting this \nway Barb?'' They're saying, ``We need help now. Our pension may be in \ntrouble.'' To these Marylanders, I want you to know that I want to help \nyou now. I want to ease your worry about your retirement security. But, \nI want to give you something real. Not all Marylanders will be helped \nby this bill.\n  So, I won't vote to pass this bill because I want to make sure all \nMarylanders have a safe and secure retirement. We can do better. We \nmust do better, and we must do better this year.\n  There are twenty weeks left in this session of Congress. During these \nweeks, we can make sure all workers are protected. That is why I will \nbe joining with my colleagues to fight to make sure that all pensions \nplans are safe.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from New Mexico suggested today in the debate \non the conference report to S. 3108 that the provisions of the \nconference report relating to Graduate Medical Education Residency \nMatching Programs were not intended to apply to antitrust litigation \ncurrently pending in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia.\n  That is not the case. The legislation applies to all anti-trust \nlawsuits, including pending and future lawsuits brought against \nGraduate Medical Education Residency Matching Programs which \nappropriately aligns the preferences of medical students and residency \nprograms.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I understand that the conference report \nto H.R. 3108 before us today includes a provision repealing Section 809 \nof the Internal Revenue Code. I support repeal of this arcane provision \nof the tax code relating to the taxation of mutual insurance companies. \nI also support the repeal of another equally arcane provision of the \ntax code--Section 815 which affects stock insurance companies. This \nprovision, which triggers a tax on a fictitious account under certain \ncircumstances and unduly ties up needed capital, is unnecessarily \ncomplex and antiquated. Repeal of this provision will allow the \naffected companies to gain access to these idle funds and use them to \nexpand their businesses and hire more employees. I am pleased that the \nJOBS Act, which we are also considering on the floor of the Senate, \ncontains a temporary repeal of Section 815 and I urge the Senate to \nconsider full repeal of this provision at the earliest possible \nopportunity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pension \nconference report that the Senate recently voted on.\n  I have long supported initiatives aimed at strengthening and \nprotecting individuals' employer-sponsored retirement plans. Pension \nbenefits are a critically important means of securing a measure of \ncomfort and self-sufficiency for retirees, and we should do all we can \nto ensure that pension plans are secure and viable.\n  The intent of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, H.R. 3108, is \nto provide temporary pension relief to businesses whose pensions have \nbeen hurt as a result of the economic downturn that began about 3 years \nago. Understanding that companies were in need of relief, in January, \nby a vote of 86 to 9, the Senate passed H.R. 3108, which provided \nrelief to single-employer plans, steel companies, the airline industry, \nand multiemployer plans. I supported this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, the pension bill was significantly weakened in \nconference, for no reason other than to single out multiemployer plans. \nIn so doing, the conference report puts at risk 65,000 small businesses \nand their 9.5 million workers. To the best of my knowledge, more than \n50,000 workers in Connecticut will be left without any relief under \nthis conference report. Because of this exclusion, I was not able to \nsupport this conference report.\n  There is no sound policy reason to not provide multiemployer plans \nwith relief. It does not cost the Treasury any money. The weak economic \nconditions plaguing our country have adversely affected multiemployer \nplans no less than single-employer plans. Since multiemployer plans are \noverwhelmingly used by workers who belong to a labor union, the only \nconclusion that I can draw for why the Republican conferees would not \nwant to provide relief to multiemployer plans is to penalize union \nworkers and the small businesses that employ them.\n  This is a regrettable and callous action by our Republican colleagues \nin this Chamber and the other Chamber. As we all know, conference \nreports cannot be amended. If they could, I would\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\neagerly support an amendment to ensure that multiemployer plans are \ncovered.\n  This conference report primarily helps the Fortune 500 companies, \nwhich I am not against. In fact, that is one of the reasons I had \nsupported the pension bill in January. I understand that employers \nacross the country have faced extraordinary pension liabilities based \nupon the obsolete Treasury bond rate. And I supported providing these \nplans with relief. But the conference report leaves behind our small \nbusinesses. It excludes our construction workers, electricians, \nplumbers, service workers, and others, and I cannot pretend that that \nis OK.\n  This bill was supposed to be about maintaining the viability of \npension plans, about doing what is right for our workers and their \nfamilies, and for our small businesses. Instead, it unfairly left out \nthousands of our small businesses and millions of our workers, for no \ngood reason.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that \nmultiemployer plans are provided with relief so that we also can ensure \nthe viability of these important plans.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the conference report on the Pension bill \nis another example of a broken legislative process. We passed a good \nbill in the Senate. There was bipartisan cooperation. Two committees--\nChairs and Rankings--worked together in a constructive manner.\n  This bill garnered overwhelming support here in the Senate, passing \n86-9.\n  On the Democratic side, there was concern about having this bill go \nto conference. Too often in the past several months, we have seen the \nwill of the Senate disregarded by House Republican leaders eager to \nrewrite bills in conference.\n  Our colleagues on the other side said no, that the Senate conferees \nwould advance the Senate position on the main issue of disagreement on \nmulti-employer plans.\n  Under the Senate bill 100 percent of multi-employer plans were \ncovered. The House had no provision to protect multi-employer plans. We \nexpected some give and take, some compromise. And we reached a good \nfaith agreement. The Senate bending over backward to accommodate the \nHouse, going from 100 percent coverage, down to 20 percent of \nmultiemployer plans in the most dire circumstances.\n  After an agreement was seemingly reached, the White House stepped in \nand told Republican conferees that they could not reach a compromise. \nThey had to ignore what the Senate passed and fall in line.\n  The result is the conference report before us which covers only a \ntiny fraction--3 percent--of multi-employer plans.\n  This puts the secure retirements of nearly 10 million Americans at \nrisk.\n  We are talking about people working for small businesses. Three-\nquarters of the approximately 60,000-65,000 employers that participate \nin multiemployer plans have fewer than 100 employees.\n  We are talking about hard working people bricklayers, carpenters, \npainters, janitors, hotel workers. In a multiemployer plan, a person \ngets to count all of the pension credit he earns working for any \nemployer in the pension plan. Multiemployer plans are thus particularly \nimportant in industries like construction or hospitality where work can \nbe short-term or seasonal.\n  Multiemployer plans have traditionally been well-funded. Only 31 \nmultiemployer plans have ever received financial assistance in the \nhistory of the PBGC multiemployer insurance program. And the PBGC \nmultiemployer program had never experienced a deficit through 2002.\n  Workers in multiemployer pension plans deserve the same relief we are \ngiving to workers in single-employer plans. Like single employer plans, \nmultiemployer plans have been hurt by three years of poor stock market \nperformance. As many as 30 percent of multiemployer plans could face \nfunding deficiencies in the next few years.\n  Moreover, multiemployer plans are not subject to the Deficit \nReduction Contribution (DRC) as single employers are. Instead, \nparticipating employers have to pay excise taxes--these excise taxes \ncan place huge burdens on employers. Companies also have to pay the \namount needed to make up the funding deficiency.\n  Let's be clear--what the Republican majority is saying is that would \nprefer to impose tax increases on small businesses across the country \ninstead of providing some reasonable period of pension relief. This is \ninexplicable.\n  Many employers may not be able to make these payments. If they can't \nthey will go bankrupt, and this will jeopardize the pensions of the \nworkers who have earned pensions under their collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  This legislation misses an important opportunity to help small \nbusinesses and millions of American workers.\n  At the same time, there are many good provisions in this bill that we \nsupport.\n  It would provide some protection for 35 million Americans covered by \nsingle-employer pensions. These are traditional pensions that provide \nmonthly federally guaranteed checks earned after a lifetime of work. In \ncombination with Social Security, these pensions provide a dignified \nretirement and most importantly, peace of mind.\n  As a result of a combination of economic factors, pensions faced a \n``perfect storm'' in recent years. The recession, a bear stock market, \nand a drop in interest rates, all put extraordinary pressure on pension \nfunds.\n  The airline industry has been especially hard hit in recent years as \na result of fears caused by the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade \nCenter and the SARS outbreak. The secure retirements of employees of \nthe airline industry were at extreme risk if we did nothing.\n  Congress needs to act to restore some stability to the defined \nbenefit pension system. If we don't, jobs will be lost. We do not want \nto see deficit reduction pension obligations push companies into \nbankruptcy and push more workers onto the unemployment line.\n  While the lack of protection for workers with multi-employer pensions \nand the implicit tax increase on small businesses make it impossible \nfor me to support this bill, the good it will do for 35 million \nAmerican workers, their employers, and the economy compel us not to \nstand in its way.\n  But this legislation should be just the beginning of our work to \ndefend the retirements of American workers. Democrats will be back to \nfight for those who have been left behind. We chose not to take out the \nwrong the Republicans have done to small businesses on those in who \nwork for the airlines, the auto companies and other large employers. \nBut we will be back to press this critical multiemployer issue.\n  Ten million Americans are seeing their retirements put at risk and \nCongress has an opportunity to come to their aid. I regret that this \nlegislation does not offer them any help, and I promise them that \nDemocrats will not rest until they have the retirement security they \nhave earned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 40 minutes remaining on the minority \nside, and 91 minutes remaining on the majority side.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, can I simply inquire from the Senator \nfrom Iowa, who I know wants to speak in favor of the bill, how much \ntime he may take, because there are other Senators who want to speak on \nour side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to speak for, I believe, in the neighborhood \nof 20 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nthe Senator from Iowa speaks, I be allowed to speak for another 10 or \n15 minutes. And I understand there are other Senators coming down to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, in the Senate, as you can tell \nfrom the debate, we are considering a bill that is critical to our \nNation's pension system and is necessary to help this economy as a \nwhole, primarily because of airlines being so essential to the economy \nof the United States of America, although it affects other segments of \nthe economy.\n  This bill, H.R. 3108, is entitled the Pension Funding Equity Act. It \nprovides a temporary 2-year fix to the interest rate companies are \nrequired to\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nuse in their pension calculations. Without this legislation, companies \nwill be required to make pension contributions based on the 30-year \nTreasury bond interest rate, even though the Government stopped issuing \n30-year bonds way back in the year 2001.\n  Clearly, this is a rule, under the 30-year bond rule, that does not \nmake sense anymore, so we have to change the pension laws to \nconform. This legislation will fix that by adopting a conservative, \nlong-term corporate bond rate for the next 2 years.\n\n  While the bond rate of corporations is in place for the next 2 years, \nCongress will have a chance to find a permanent replacement. That is \nwhat we are about doing already. For instance, that is one of the major \nissues before the Senate Finance Committee.\n  This bill also includes provisions to provide some temporary help to \nthe pension plans that need it most. Airlines and steel companies that \nhave been hit very hard by tough economic times are given a little more \ntime to get their plans' funding levels up to where they need to be. Of \ncourse, even multiemployer pension plans that were hit hardest by the \nbear market are given more time to make up their losses.\n  This bill is truly a must-pass bill. Without it, pension coverage for \nmillions of workers across the country will be in jeopardy. Without it, \ntens of billions of dollars that could be used to create jobs and grow \nbusinesses will unnecessarily be drained from our economy. Without it, \nsome companies could be forced into bankruptcy. In my own State of \nIowa, I know there are a lot of companies working hard to compete in \ntoday's challenging economic environment. These companies want to \nprovide pension plans for their employees, but they also need to know \nwhat the rules are for contributing to those plans. They want those \nrules in the process to make sense.\n  Without this legislation, some companies could see their pension \ncontributions increase three or four times in 1 year; in some cases, \neven more. That is a very difficult burden for any company to bear. For \na smaller or medium-size company, that kind of burden is probably too \nmuch.\n  This bill then gives our pension system a rule so pension \ncontributions will be calculated based on a rational interest rate \nrather than one that is obsolete and artificially low.\n  I know this bill does not do everything everyone wanted. This is \ntrue. But the provisions in this bill have broad bipartisan support. \nAnd, of course, as I constantly remind my colleagues, nothing of \nsubstance gets done in this body if it is not done in a bipartisan way, \nunlike the House of Representatives where partisanship can prevail from \ntime to time and does most of the time.\n  This legislation before us is simply too important not to be enacted \nnow. Companies must pay their next pension payment on April 15, just \naround the corner. Failure to pass this bill would have devastating \nconsequences for workers and the economy. This is a temporary bill, but \nwe need to be working on permanent reforms. The Senate Finance \nCommittee is about doing that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, will Senator Grassley yield to me for some \ncomments about his efforts in this regard?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am glad to yield without losing the \nfloor, yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I commend the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Iowa, for the work he has done on this \nlegislation. It should have been relatively easy to get this done, but \nit turned out to be a long process and a huge lift.\n  He was persistent, dogged, because he knew we had a problem we could \nresponsibly address before this deadline of April 15 would cost \nbillions of dollars for companies in a way that is not necessary and \ncould affect their solvency.\n\n  I particularly want to note, since there have been some questions \nraised about it, if you are going to write a textbook about how a \nconference should be handled, this is it. The chairman of the committee \ndidn't try to go around the other members. I was not a conferee, but I \nfollowed it very closely. The conferees met, House and Senate, \nRepublican, Democrat. Everybody was involved. Everybody had a chance to \nmake their case. Amendments were considered. In fact, the Senator from \nIowa even offered a last-minute amendment that would have moved it more \ntoward what Senator Kennedy was advocating, and it was defeated.\n  I am not sure I agreed with that effort, but I make that point to \nmagnify the point this was a full conference. It wasn't short-\ncircuited. Nobody was cut out of the process. You may not like the \nresults, but it was a good conference and it produced a good bill.\n  The criticism we are hearing today, in my opinion, is to threaten the \ngood in pursuit of the perfect from somebody else's point of view.\n  I want to say for the record, to my colleagues and the American \npeople, Senator Grassley did a good job. We should pass this bill. I \nbelieve this conference report will pass overwhelmingly, and this is \nthe way conferences should and can be done.\n  I thank the Senator for giving me a chance to commend him on his job \non this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nfor his kind comments. He was active in helping us arrive at a \nsolution, even though he was not on the conference committee. I would \nemphasize one thing he said, because I hope it sets a pattern for the \nfuture and maybe would relieve the Democratic Members of the Senate of \nsome nervousness they have about conferences: This does set an example \nof both sides of the aisle participating fully in the conference, \nbecause we want to be able to use that pattern for the future. Wherever \nI am involved, we are going to use that in the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi. When the Senator from \nMississippi asked to intervene, I had already emphasized the temporary \naspects of this legislation and what it included and the necessity for \nit. Now I want to speak about the need for permanent reform because \nthis is temporary legislation. It is a first step in what needs to be \ndone to preserve the defined benefit pension plan.\n  While this 2-year interest rate fix provides a temporary solution, we \nmust take action then on a permanent solution. Pension plan sponsors \ncontinue to confront a world of uncertainty until we get a permanent \nreplacement. They need to be able to budget for future pension \nexpenses. It is unfair to leave them in financial limbo. If we continue \nto do so, many will simply abandon pension plans altogether. We ought \nto be promoting the concept of pensions rather than doing things that \nencourage companies to abandon pensions for their employees.\n  There is uncertainty facing our pension system on a variety of other \nfronts as well. Our pension system needs funding rules that make sense \nand help avoid the funding problems many plans are facing today. In \nthat regard, I was very pleased this conference agreement included a \nprovision from the Senate bill that allowed plans that have funded \ntheir plans well and responsibly in recent years to continue making \ncontributions.\n  Pension plans also are facing uncertainty due to the fact many of our \npension laws predate the development of new and innovative pension plan \ndesigns that have been developed to meet the needs of today's workers. \nThis uncertainty should be removed, and our pension laws and \nregulations should be brought up to date to take account of positive \ndevelopments and evolutions in pension plans.\n  Defined pension plans are an irreplaceable part of our national \nretirement system. We owe it to the millions of workers and retirees \nwho participate in these plans to make them as strong as possible. We \nalso owe it to the young people of our country today to ensure our \npension system remains healthy and vibrant, so they can benefit from \nthese plans many years from now.\n  This bill is a first step to address what many experts have called a \ncrisis in our pension system. I hope we in Congress can work on a \nbipartisan basis to address these problems. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on that long-term solution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2307 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe statement by the Senator from Louisiana, I be recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure that \ntime is not applied to the Democratic side that remains on the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, I seek 10 minutes to talk about the \nasbestos bill, which we are having a meeting on this afternoon.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield the Senator 10 minutes for that purpose, \nyes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nI know the issue he wants to speak about--asbestos--is a very important \nissue that has great ramifications for workers and businesses in our \ncountry. I know he spent a great deal of time on that subject.\n  We only have, on this side, about 45 minutes to debate this very \nimportant pension bill that also affects large, small, and medium-sized \ncorporations and workers, whether they are union workers or not. I \nwanted to come to the floor after the opening of this debate this \nmorning and answer some of the questions that were raised, or comments \nmade by my good friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, and also the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Before the Senator from Iowa leaves, I thank him for his leadership. \nHe has worked very hard on this bill and there is no doubt, as the \nSenator from Mississippi came to the floor and said, that there is a \ngreat deal of good being accomplished in this pension reform bill that \nhelps us to direct capital in a much more effective and productive way, \nat a time when our country needs to be creating jobs, not destroying \nthem, and at a time when we need to be strengthening all of our \ncompanies, not weakening them.\n  There is no argument on this side about that issue--none. No \nDemocratic Senator has come to the floor to argue that there are not a \nlot of good things in this bill for companies in America, particularly \nthe airline industry and steel companies, which are in very precarious \nsituations with a deadline looming. Let me put that in the Record.\n  What is at issue is why 10 million workers are left out--10 million \nworkers and the companies that employ them. Some of those companies are \nsmall and medium-sized companies that employ unionized workers. Some of \nthem employ nonunionized workers.\n  I want to respond to a couple of things. The Senator from Iowa made a \nstatement I would like to correct. He said it could not possibly affect \n9.7 million workers. I have the GAO report--and that is where we get \nthis information--which says 9.7 million participants, because of the \nWhite House's position and the very partisan Republican approach on the \nHouse side that was taken--this is the GAO report that shows clearly \nthere are 9.7 million workers who will be left out. About 13 million \nworkers in the country are unionized, and a great deal of them will be \nleft out.\n  The second point is, the Senator from New Hampshire came to the floor \nand said: The Senator from Louisiana could not possibly be right \nbecause she claims this bill--the compromise purposely denied help to \nunion workers because the underlying bill protects unions.\n  For the record, I will say he is correct in part. This is the \ndifference. If you are a union that is fortunate enough to be attached \nto a big company that the Republican leadership in the House wants to \nhelp, you get help in this bill. Let me repeat that. If you are a union \nthat happens to be attached to a very large company that the Republican \nleadership in the House, with the support of the White House, wants to \nhelp, you get relief, and you get relief whether your company is in \ntrouble or not.\n  Let me submit for the record that General Electric Company will get \nrelief, and they deserve it. General Electric deserves this help. Their \npension is funded at 116 percent. Verizon is funded at 104 percent. \nAT pensions are funded at 111 percent. Prudential is funded at 112.1 \npercent. Edison Electric is funded at 100.2 percent. J.P. Morgan is \nfunded at 102.8 percent. Southern Companies is funded at 112.8 percent. \nWells Fargo is funded at 102.8 percent.\n  These are large companies; some are union, some are not. There is a \ncompany that was written in on a special provision, and they may \ndeserve it, but it causes some of us to be cynical about how these \nconferences, behind closed doors, work. UPS, which is a large company \nand a union company--and I support their help--gets help. If you are a \ncompany that is overly funded, and a company that has union workers, \nthe union is lucky to be attached to you because if they are left on \ntheir own, they don't get help. If you are a multiemployer plan, a \nunion, not fortunate enough to be attached to a big company, but you \nare attached to a little company, or to a medium-size company, the \nWhite House and the Republican leadership in the House decided you \ndon't deserve the help.\n  I have been waiting on the floor for 4 hours to get an answer to the \nquestion, why were they denied help? The Record shows--and I will \nsubmit for the Record--the fix that Senator Kennedy asked for and that \n86 Members of this body voted for--the fix in this bill, which would \nhave given relief to everyone, whether you are a big company or a \nlittle company, whether you were union or nonunion, and that passed the \nSenate with 86 votes.\n  We are proud of that work. It went over to the House, and under \npartisan political leadership, the help for 10 million workers was \nstripped out because they were not lucky enough to be attached to a big \nenough company. That is the truth. The fix would have given money to \nthe Federal Treasury, not taken money. Again, this fix did not cost \nanything. I can understand if someone would come to the floor and say: \nSenator, we simply could not afford it; we just could not afford it; we \nare fighting a war in Iraq; we have deficits; we cannot afford it.\n  Let me remind everyone, there is no cost to the Federal Treasury for \nthis particular fix. In fact, as Senator Kennedy spoke about, fixing \nthe multiemployer pension plan adds money to the Treasury.\n  I have to sit here and listen to people argue that this was a good \ncompromise? I have to go home and explain to my constituents, and I \ncannot explain it to them. Let me just tell you how it works in \nWashington these days: Bills that cost money to the Treasury get passed \nall day long. Bills that add money to the Treasury cannot get passed. I \ndon't know how to explain that to my constituents in Louisiana. I don't \nknow how to go home and explain to my constituents in Louisiana that \nthe big companies, some union and some nonunion, get help, but the \nsmall companies that some people purport to represent and union workers \ngot left out for no good reason.\n  Let me answer another charge. One of the Senators said: Senator, this \nis just the process; this happens all the time. I remember a time when \nit did not happen this way. I came to the Senate 7 years ago. When I \ngot here, there used to be a Senate position and a House position, not \na Republican position and a Democratic position. We had a Senate \nposition. I am proud to be part of the Senate of men and women, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who can put a fair deal together and will \nfight for a fair deal and not collapse, capitulate, and give in, and \nthat is exactly what happened in conference.\n  So when my colleagues ask, Does this give this Senator confidence or \nany Senator confidence that the conference process works, I would say \nsimply, No, it diminishes confidence. It undermines confidence. It does \nnot build good will. It tears down what little good will is left and \nmakes a mockery of it.\n  I wish for once the Senate would stand up and send a bill over to the \nHouse and say there is no reason we can't include everyone; it doesn't \ncost anything. These poor people who wake up early in the morning and \nstay up late at night trying to put bread on the table and pay their \nrent and buy gasoline that is now over $2 deserve a fair shake. It \ndoesn't cost anything. There is no skin off your back. But no, we just \ncave, all of us just cave. It is a shame.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  No, this does not help the process. This does not build confidence. \nThis does not encourage anyone.\n  The fourth point I want to answer is, oh, there she goes, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and other Senators on the Democratic side, making the \nperfect the enemy of the good. I am not looking for a perfect bill. I \nam looking for a square deal. I did not come here looking for a perfect \nbill. No Senator comes here looking for a perfect bill. There is no \nsuch thing. But I am still waiting for one Senator to come to the floor \nand give me one--one--good reason why 10 million workers and the \ncompanies that hire them that came here asking us for help when it is \nin our power to help, when it does not cost us anything to help, why \nwere they taken out of this bill?\n\n  I have not received an answer to that question yet. I will tell my \ncolleagues, we may vote on this bill in an hour or so, and I may end up \nvoting for this conference report. Some Democrats will vote no. But \nbecause there are some very good provisions in this bill and there are \ncompanies in my State that will be helped--and I want to support large \ncompanies because they are hiring, they are struggling; some of them \nare not; some of them are doing very well. I have no problem. We all \nneed to be pro-business, pro-growth, and pro-jobs.\n  I am probably going to vote for this conference report. I don't know \nhow the rest of the caucus will vote. Some will and some will not, but \nthat still does not answer my question or solve this problem.\n  I have to go back and tell 10,000, maybe more, workers in Louisiana: \nSorry, you were left out. When they ask: Senator, we didn't cost them \nanything, why did they leave us out? I want someone to tell me why so I \ncan go back and tell them. I am going to ask that question on every \nbill, and I am going to put an amendment on every bill, with Senator \nKennedy's help and other colleagues, whether this conference report is \nadopted or not, until we finally get an answer.\n  I hope it is not the answer I think it is. I will state it again and, \nuntil I get my answer, I am going to keep stating it. I think the \nanswer is, because these employers that have multiemployer plans are \nmostly unions that are not attached to big companies, that have a lot \nof money invested in lobbyists and others who can be here talking to \neverybody all day long, and I think the White House decided that \nbecause most of these are unions that do not support them at election \ntime, they are not going to support them at this time.\n  I know that is harsh, and I know it sounds very direct. I don't know \nany other way to be because that is the only conclusion to which I can \ncome.\n  Again, it does not cost money. They were in the original bill; 86 of \nus voted for it. Until I get a better answer, I am going to have to go \naround and tell people that is the answer. If someone wants to debate \nme here, in a private debate somewhere else, write me a letter, give me \na report, then I will stop saying that, and I will just say I was wrong \nand here is a good reason, and I will accept that and accept it as the \nprocess and just go on and fight another day. But I have yet to hear \nthe answer.\n  Let me state again for the Record, in case anybody thinks the only \nbusinesses that are getting help are businesses that are in trouble, GE \nis funded at 116 percent; AT at 111 percent. So we are not just \nhelping companies whose pensions are in bad shape. Part of the bill is \nto not put money in a pension that doesn't need it--obviously, these \npensions don't need it because they are overfunded--and to get that \nmoney back in circulation to create jobs. I am for that 100 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if it works for these big guys, why \ncan't it work for the little guy, the little contractors, for the union \nguys? We better get past the politics of deciding something is good or \nbad, whether it helps people who vote Republican or vote Democrat, and \nstart thinking about the country, start thinking about America, start \nthinking about our troops and get serious about creating jobs.\n  When this White House says they are serious about creating jobs, I am \ngoing to bring this up to the White House at every point. You could \nhave created jobs. It didn't cost you a penny to do it. In fact, it \nwould have added money. But you turned your back, you walked away, and \nyou left them standing there.\n  I hope those who were thinking maybe they would not get active might \nget active because of this, because it would sure wake me up if I \nwasn't paying much attention to what was going on.\n  I don't want to take any more time. I know the Senator from \nPennsylvania has been very patient. I will yield the floor but reserve \nthe time that is remaining for debate on this side, according to the \nunanimous consent agreement. I think it is the Senator's time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Asbestos Deliberations\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly upon the status of legislation to deal with the asbestos crisis \nwhich faces America. We have had it said that purportedly there are \nsome 70 companies which have gone into bankruptcy proceedings or \nreorganization proceedings. There are some 600,000 claims which have \nbeen filed by individuals who have been exposed to asbestos and make \nallegations of injury; some 8,500 companies have been sued. So we have \na net situation today where there are people who have been exposed to \nasbestos, who suffered from mesothelioma, which is a deadly disease, \nand they are now not being compensated because the defendants are in \nbankruptcy. We have had a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates that claimants who have been exposed to asbestos may receive \ncompensation for whatever injuries they may in the future sustain, \nwithout having the proof as to existing damages, which seems \ninappropriate to this Senator. It was a narrow 5 to 4 decision.\n  We have had many companies, some in my home State, and all across the \ncountry, in bankruptcy proceedings where commerce has been impeded, and \nif we are able to find an answer to this very vexing problem, it would \nbe an enormous economic stimulus to the economy of the United States.\n  In July, the Judiciary Committee passed out a bill largely along \nparty lines. I supported it even though I said at the committee markup \nthat I thought there were many infirmities and many problems, but I \nvoted to move it out of committee to get the process going. A very \nunique, really unprecedented procedure was then adopted where the \nformer Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a \nvery distinguished jurist, Judge Edward R. Becker, agreed to \nparticipate in what were essentially mediation proceedings for 2 days \nin August, August 18 and 19. Judge Becker and I sat in his chambers in \nPhiladelphia with representatives of the manufacturers, of the \ninsurers, the reinsurers, the AFL-CIO, and the trial lawyers to start \ngoing through the very complex issues which were involved to try to \ncome to some resolution.\n  Following those 2 days of meetings, we have met on 14 occasions in my \noffices in Washington with those same participants, the same so-called \nstakeholders. In between the meetings which Judge Becker and I have \nheld with the stakeholders, they have met among themselves and have \nworked out many of the issues.\n  I am pleased to report at this time that agreements have been reached \non quite a number of the tough issues. For example, the startup \narrangements have been worked out so that funding has been provided for \nthe defendants' expanded borrowing authority to make money available \nright away. There are provisions which provide for increased liquidity \nand upfront funding so that claims can be paid in short order. There \nhave been provisions worked out for streamlining the administrative \nprocess. The Court of Federal Claims initially had that authority.\n  We have worked with the Department of Labor. I compliment the \nDepartment of Labor for helping us work through a procedure for \nstreamlining the administrative process.\n  We have to define exigent health claims so people who are suffering \nfrom\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nmesothelioma and other deadly ailments will get early treatment. We \nhave worked through the processes on judicial review. We have worked \nthrough the processes on medical commodity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a schedule of the meetings which have \nbeen held with Judge Becker, some 14 in number, and the manufacturers' \nrepresentatives, representatives of the insurers, AFL-CIO and trial \nlawyers, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1125, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003\n\n\n                            Important Dates\n\n     5/22/03--Senator Hatch introduces S. 1125\n     6/19/03--Committee mark-up\n     6/24/03--Committee mark-up\n     6/26/03--Committee mark-up\n     7/10/03--Committee mark-up; voted out of Committee--10 yeas, \n         8 nays and 1 pass\n     8/18/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Philadelphia\n     8/19/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Philadelphia\n     9/12/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     9/26/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     10/3/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     10/14/03--Meeting with Senator Frist in Washington, DC\n     10/21/03--Meeting with Labor in Washington, DC\n     11/11/03--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     11/12/03--Meeting with Department of Labor in Washington, DC\n     /1/22/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     2/12/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     2/25/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     3/4/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     3/11/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     3/18/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     3/30/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n     4/7/04--Frist/Hatch substitute introduced\n     4/8/04--Meeting with Judge Becker in Washington, DC\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are proceeding with another meeting this afternoon. \nThe majority leader has deferred taking up the bill; had originally \nplanned to do so in March, and at the request of a number of people, \nincluding this Senator, the majority leader has deferred taking floor \naction on the bill and has now listed floor action for the day we \nreturn from the next recess, which is April 19.\n  Just yesterday, the majority leader, Senator Frist, and Senator \nHatch, the chairman of the committee, introduced a substitute bill. \nSenator Hatch has done an outstanding job on this matter, has worked \nthrough the process of establishing a trust fund which was originally \nset at $108 billion, since has been increased, with a schedule of \npayments to be determined very much like worker's compensation so that \nliability does not have to be established.\n  Senator Leahy spoke earlier today and raised questions about the \ndesirability of the substitute bill which was introduced yesterday, \nwith Senator Leahy saying that there has yet to be achieved consensus \non two essential elements of a FAIR trust fund, that is fair value \nawards and the total amount of the trust fund.\n  The parties are as yet substantially apart on these two items, and it \nis my hope that we can come to agreement. Senator Frist, the majority \nleader, has made a determination that setting a date will facilitate \nmore intense negotiations, so to speak, on the courthouse steps, and \nthat is a generalization. I hope that if we are not in agreement, but \nclose to agreement, that there may be yet some flexibility in the date \nlisted for floor action.\n  I declined to join with Senator Frist and Senator Hatch in their \nsubstitute bill because I think it is the better practice to try to \nwork through these problems. We have made enormous progress, and it is \nmy hope we can make more progress to be ready to reach the date which \nthe majority leader has set.\n  If we are able to come to terms, it will be an enormous economic \nstimulus to rescue some 70 companies which are in bankruptcy, and it \nwill be of enormous importance to the workers who have been exposed to \nasbestos and have serious ailments, including mesothelioma, which is a \ndeadly ailment.\n  We are going to proceed to try to do that work. I am hopeful we will \nbe able to come to terms with these outstanding problems and present a \nbill which can be enacted into law to solve these very serious \nproblems.\n  To reiterate, on April 7, 2004, Majority Leader Frist and Senator \nHatch introduced a substitute bill to S. 1125, the Fairness in Asbestos \nInjury Resolution Act, FAIR Act, of 2004. S. 1125 was reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee on July 10, 2003, by a vote of 10 yeas, 8 nays \nand 1 pass. I voted for it.\n  According to The RAND Institute for Civil Justice, ``about two-thirds \nof the claims are now filed by the unimpaired, while in the past they \nwere filed only by the manifestly ill.'' According to RAND, the number \nof claims continues to rise, with over 600,000 claims filed already. \nMore than 8,500 companies have been named as defendants in asbestos \nlitigation.'' In 2003 alone, a record 100,000 asbestos claims were \nfiled. Seventy companies have already gone bankrupt due to asbestos \nliability.\n  As it has been noted before, the bill reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee bill required a great deal of evaluation, analysis and \nsignificant changes. I contacted senior Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker, \nwho had been chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nuntil May 5 of last year. Judge Becker has expert insights into this \nmatter and since August of 2003, we have convened some 14 meetings with \nthe representatives from the manufacturers, the insurance companies, \nthe reinsurers, organized labor and the trial lawyers.\n  Through the series of meetings with Judge Becker, we have wrestled \nwith and have been able to solve a number of very complex issues. We \nhave had the cooperation of many Senators. Senators Hatch and Leahy \nhave had representatives at the meetings. In fact, Senator Hatch \naddressed this ``working group'' at one of our meetings. The majority \nleader and minority leader have had representatives at the meetings. \nSenators Dodd, Carper, Feinstein and Nelson have been represented as \nwell.\n  I am encouraged and appreciative to note that some of these \nagreements that resulted from our meetings have been incorporated into \nthe Frist-Hatch substitute asbestos bill. Included in the substitute \nbill are the following provisions negotiated through these meetings.\n  No. 1, streamlining administrative process, S. 2290 creates a more \nstreamlined administrative system that can be up and running quickly. \nThe trust fund will be administered by the Department of Labor, as \nopposed to the Court of Federal Claims under S. 1125.\n  No. 2, early startup, the bill aims to ensure that the compensation \nprogram under the bill can commence operations and begin paying claims \nquickly, particularly for living mesothelioma victims and for other \nexigent claimants who may have little time to wait. Such claimants \nshould not be subject to unacceptable delays in obtaining compensation \ndue to impediments in commencement of Fund operations. The agreed-upon \nadministrative structure, for example, includes provisions for interim \nregulations and houses the Office for Asbestos Disease Compensation in \nthe Department of labor, which has the experience and the \ninfrastructure to help expedite the establishment of a claims \nprocessing system.\n  The proposal addresses the need to ensure that monies are available \nto the Fund in a short amount of time to be able to pay claims.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have three subjects I intend to \naddress today. Let me address the first and the most sad of those. That \nis, of course, the enormous price that many families are paying as part \nof the current engagement that we are in in Iraq.\n\n\n                         pfc christopher ramos\n\n  General Robert E. Lee was once quoted as saying:\n\n       Duty, then, is the sublimest word in the English language. \n     You should do your duty at all times. You can never do more. \n     You should never wish to do less.\n\n  On Monday, April 5, just 3 days ago, PFC Christopher Ramos, age 26, \ndid his duty with the First Marine Division. He lost his life in action \nagainst Iraqi insurgents in Al Anbar Province in Iraq. Christopher \nRamos was from Albuquerque, NM. While at West Mesa High School, he \ndreamed about serving his country as a U.S. marine. Private Ramos' \nfather, Al Ramos, said of his son Christopher:\n\n       He was proud of what he was doing. He wanted to be a \n     Marine. He said it was either the Marines or nothing.\n\n  Today, it is important that we in the Senate honor his memory and \nservice, and the service of so many other brave young men and women who \nhave answered the call to duty and have made the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir Nation. It is equally important that we keep the families of \nthose individuals in mind and in our prayers.\n  Private First Class Ramos leaves behind a wife, Diana Ramos, and an \n18-month-old daughter, Malaya.\n\n\n                           army sgt lee duane\n\n  In addition to that terrible news, the Four Corners area, which \nincludes my State of New Mexico, also lost another fine young man in \nthe last few days, Army SGT Lee Duane Todacheene, who was from \nLukachukai, AZ, and was the nephew of the vice president of the Navajo \nNation, Frank Dayish, Jr. This young man, Sergeant Todacheene, was \nkilled in an Iraqi ambush, according to the Navajo Nation. We extend \nour sympathies to his family as well.\n\n\n                        marine lt erasmo valles\n\n  Finally, last week Marine LT Erasmo Valles of Hobbs, NM, was severely \ninjured in an attack in Falluja when his Humvee was hit by a roadside \nbomb. He is being treated at Bethesda Naval Hospital and we wish him a \nspeedy and a full recovery.\n  These brave soldiers were put in harm's way by their country, and \ntheir sacrifice needs to be noted by all of us. Just as we celebrate \nthe safe return of many, we need to acknowledge and mourn those who are \nnot going to return. I regret that PFC Christopher Ramos and other \nbrave marines and soldiers have lost their lives in this endeavor, and \nour sympathies go out to their families.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator allow me to make a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the adoption of \nthe pending conference report occur at 2:45 today, with the time until \n2:45 being equally divided, provided further that the last 8 minutes of \ndebate be divided so that Senator Kennedy or his designee be recognized \nfor up to 4 minutes, to be followed by the chairman of the committee or \nhis designee to close for the final 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me move to another subject and \nexpress some words about the pension bill that is pending before us.\n  I intend to support this bill, but I say that with substantial \nreservations because of the process, once again, that was followed in \ngetting this bill to the Senate floor--the partisan way in which it was \nhandled. I also say it because of what wound up in this pension bill \nthat was not intended to be there. There were things that were left \nout, and many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about those. The \nmultiemployer plans were not treated fairly, as they should have been \nand as I believe most Senators would want them to be, but also there \nwere provisions included in this bill--at least one provision that I \nthink is highly objectionable.\n  Section 207 of the conference report creates an antitrust exemption \nfor the graduate medical residency program that currently assigns \nmedical students to hospitals where they are required to work for 60 to \n100 hours per week for an average of $9 or $10 an hour. To people who \nare not familiar with the way this place functions in recent years, \nthey would be surprised to find that we have written into the pension \nbill a retroactive exemption from the antitrust laws related to this \nissue of medical residency programs. I understand there is currently a \nlawsuit pending before Judge Paul Friedman in the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia brought by medical residents that alleges \na price-fixing scheme among graduate medical education programs in the \nUnited States.\n  On February 11 of this year, Judge Friedman issued an opinion that \ndenied most of the defendants' motions to dismiss and allowed the \nlawsuit to proceed. In his opinion, the judge explained that the \nlawsuit involves one claim--that the defendant graduate medical \neducation programs engaged in price fixing.\n  Subsection (b)(3) of section 207 explicitly preserves the right to \nbring an antitrust lawsuit alleging any type of price-fixing \narrangement among two or more graduate medical education programs. \nClearly this subsection ensures that the antitrust exemption that is \ndescribed in subsection (b)(2) does not apply to this pending lawsuit.\n  The last sentence in subsection (b)(2) states that evidence of \nparticipation in a graduate medical education residency matching \nprogram shall not be admissible in Federal court to support a claim \nalleging antitrust violations.\n  However, subsection (b)(3) clearly states that:\n\n       ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt from \n     the antitrust laws'' any agreement on the part of graduate \n     medical education programs to fix prices.\n\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\n\n  Obviously, the restrictions on the admissibility of certain evidence \nin subsection (b)(2) cannot apply to price-fixing lawsuits that are \nexplicitly preserved in subsection (b)(3). The provision says \n``nothing'' in this section shall provide exemptions from price-fixing \nclaims. Therefore, any provision that would not allow necessary \nevidence to be admitted in price-fixing cases must not apply and could \nnot be construed to apply.\n  That being said, the antitrust exemption that is established by \nsubsection (b)(2) raises grave constitutional concerns. There has been \nno justification presented to this Congress, to any committee of this \nCongress for depriving medical residents of the same protections under \nthe antitrust laws that are enjoyed by other workers and other \nAmericans. I do not see how it is constitutionally permissible to take \naway the equal protection and the due process rights of medical \nresidents without any showing that is necessary or beneficial.\n  Frankly, this is outrageous for Congress to be legislating in this \nway, without any hearings, without any testimony, without any knowledge \nof what it is doing.\n  The reason we have debate on the Senate floor is to allow Members to \nexpress views when we are getting ready to change the law. This is a \ntime-honored process. It is one that was not honored in this case. As \nfar as I know, there has been no debate on the floor nor has there been \ndebate in committee about this issue.\n  I spoke to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, which is \nthe committee with jurisdiction over our antitrust laws, and asked if \nhe was informed about this provision being included in the pension \nbill. He said he had not been informed. It is my understanding that the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee was not informed either.\n  This is a provision that was added in a conference, without \nparticipation of Democratic Senators, and clearly it is contrary to \ngood policy and to proper procedure here in the Senate.\n  Let me conclude by having printed in the Record a letter that Senator \nCraig, Senator Feingold, Senator Herb Kohl and I all wrote to our \nmajority leader, Bill Frist, and to the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, last November, expressing our concern about this exact type of \nlegislative proposal and stating our strong objection to the inclusion \nof this kind of provision in legislation at that time or any time in \nthe future. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Gentleman: We are writing to express our concern about \n     legislative proposals that have the potential to undermine \n     ongoing antitrust litigation against the National Resident \n     Match Program (known as the ``Match'') by granting the \n     ``Match'' a retroactive antitrust exemption.\n       It is our view that Congress should subject proposals like \n     this one that hold widespread implications for patient safety \n     and the working conditions of hundreds of thousands of \n     medical residents to the regular legislative process--\n     including hearings and consideration in the appropriate \n     committees--before allowing it to move through Congress. This \n     is particularly important considering that such proposals \n     would retroactively interfere with pending litigation, in \n     which the factual record has not yet been developed and the \n     court has not yet ruled on the merits of the claims. In \n     addition, it is important for the Committee to consider the \n     specific language of any such proposal, as legislation \n     intending to exempt the Match could have broader, unintended \n     effects, including effectively immunizing price-fixing and \n     other anticompetitive practices alleged in the litigation.\n       By permitting such a bill to go forward without full \n     consideration of all the factual and legal issues, we would \n     set a precedent that will encourage defendants in all types \n     of pending litigation to come to Congress for relief. We \n     request, therefore, that the Senate convene hearings on this \n     matter before taking further action.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry E. Craig.\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n     Russell D. Feingold.\n     Herb Kohl.\n\n\n                        Electric Grid Stability\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In November of 1965, a disturbance on the electric grid \nresulted in the loss power to some 30 million people in the \nNortheastern U.S. Almost all of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, \nRhode Island, and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey were blacked out \nfor up to 13 hours.\n  In July of 1977, power lightening caused the loss of power to 9 \nmillion people in New York city and surrounding areas.\n  In December of 1982, high winds caused the failure of a transmission \ntower. Power was lost to 5 million people.\n  In July of 1996, power was lost to 2 million customers in 14 States \nin the West, 2 Canadian provinces and 1 Mexican state. The outage was \nthe immediate result of a line sagging into a tree.\n  In August of 1996, again as the result of contact with trees, another \noutage affected 7.5 million people in 14 Western States, 2 Canadian \nprovinces and 1 Mexican state.\n  In August of last year 50 million people in 8 Northeastern and \nMidwestern States and 3 Canadian provinces were blacked out for up to 4 \ndays.\n  These were only a few of the major outages that have rendered parts \nof our Nation powerless over the last few years. The most dramatic \noutage ever was only last summer. I don't have to tell the Members of \nthis body how serious the effects on the economies of these regions \nwere. We all saw it. Airports were shut down for days. Traffic was \nsnarled for hours. Businesses were closed, schools shut down. The \nestimates of losses were in the tens of billions of dollars.\n  After the first big blackout, in 1965, the industry, under pressure \nfrom the government, created a voluntary association to try to govern \nthe reliability of the system. That association became the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Council or NERC.\n  After the West Coast blackout in 1996, the Department of Energy put \ntogether a task force on reliability headed by former Congressman Phil \nSharp. That task force made a number of recommendations. Chief among \nthem was that Congress should pass legislation creating a mandatory \nstructure for reliability, with penalties for failure to comply with \nthe rules, and with government oversight.\n  In 1999, the Senate unanimously passed a bill sponsored by Senator \nSlade Gorton of Washington, that did just that. The House did not pass \nsuch a bill and no final action was taken.\n  After this most recent blackout, the Department of Energy, along with \nthe Canadian Government, convened a task force to look at the causes of \nthe outage and to make recommendations as to how to prevent future \nblackouts. That task force issued its final report Monday. There are a \nnumber of recommendations contained in that report, but the one that \nthis body most needs to pay attention to is the recommendation that the \nCongress pass legislation to create a mandatory system for ensuring \nreliability, with penalties for failure to comply with the rules, and \nwith government oversight. The report says: ``The U.S. Congress should \nenact reliability legislation no less stringent than the provisions now \nincluded in the pending comprehensive energy bills, HR. 6 and S. \n2095.''\n  The bill that is before contains those very provisions.\n  I don't think that anybody in the Senate believes that we should not \npass this legislation. The only question is in what form. This bill is \nthe same as the language contained in S. 2095, Senator Domenici's more \ncomprehensive energy bill. I am not optimistic that the larger bill \nwill pass the Senate, or if it does, survive a conference with the \nHouse to make it to the President's desk.\n  Again and again this country has experienced crippling blackouts. \nAgain and again investigating panels have recommended that the Congress \npass legislation to establish a mandatory regime for governance of \nreliability, with penalties for failure to comply with the rules and \nwith government oversight. Again and again, the Congress has failed to \ndo so.\n  It is time for us to pass this legislation.\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n   After the Blackout--FirstEnergy Has Been Kicked Around. When Will \n Congress Complete the Urgent Task of Improving Oversight of the Power \n                               Industry?\n\n       In the immediate aftermath of the massive August blackout, \n     President Bush and others in Washington were quick to call \n     for sweeping repairs of the nation's electricity grid. Many \n     talked about an investment of $100 billion (a hefty sum, even \n     on Capitol Hill). What has happened in the meantime? \n     Virtually nothing. Proposals ti improve the grid are part of \n     a comprehensive energy bill long stalled in Congress.\n       The country would benefit from a broadly conceived approach \n     to energy. Unfortunately, narrow interests have shaped a \n     large part of the legislation under consideration. Those \n     lawmakers arguing for a separate measure to address the \n     electricity grid make sense. Perhaps their efforts will be \n     advanced by the U.S.-Canadian task force that has issued its \n     final report on the causes of the blackout.\n       As expected, the task force blamed FirstEnergy Corp. for \n     plunging much of the Midwest, Northeast and Ontario into \n     darkness. The Akron-based power company has admitted trouble \n     with its computers, hampering coordination and diminishing \n     its grasp of events that August day. In that sense, the task \n     force faulting the company for failing to react more quickly \n     seems off the mark. How could FirstEnergy respond when it \n     wasn't fully aware of the problem?\n       The company already has made repairs. Among other things, \n     trees near power lines have been trimmed. What will Congress \n     do? Tough as the task force was on FirstEnergy, its 46 \n     recommendations suggest (correctly) troubles far beyond one \n     utility.\n       The task force proposed writing into federal law rules that \n     more effectively ensure the reliability of power supplies. As \n     it is, an industry group, the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council, monitors the performance of power \n     companies. Compliance with operating standards is voluntary. \n     Meeting the standards should be mandatory. The monitoring \n     effort should be independent of the industry.\n       If FirstEnergy operated at the edge of reliability (as the \n     task force concluded), federal officials have little clue \n     whether other utilities are doing so.\n       That lack of knowledge compounds the risk of blackouts, \n     larger and smaller, in view of the changing realities of the \n     power industry. The country asks the electricity grid to defy \n     physics. An industry once defined by local utilities \n     supplying electricity to nearby communities has been \n     dramatically transformed the past decade. Electricity now \n     travels long distances, across, say, Ohio into Canada, \n     placing substantial strain on the system.\n       Independent power plants tap into the grid with few \n     concerns about their overall impact. An industry pushed to \n     embrace market principles requires a new regulatory scheme. \n     That is the task Congress must complete--before the next \n     blackout. That is the urgent message of the U.S.-Canada task \n     force.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Bergen Record, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n                           Avoiding Blackouts\n\n       Last August, a blackout left 50 million people in eight \n     U.S. states and parts of eastern Canada without power. \n     Although embarrassed utilities are almost certainly more \n     vigilant, the blackout could happen again because in the \n     eight months since not much on the federal regulatory front \n     has changed.\n       On Monday, a joint U.S.-Canadian task force that has been \n     studying the blackout issued its final report, with 46 \n     recommendations to prevent a recurrence. Many of them are \n     highly technical, but one is startlingly simple:\n       Congress should give the utilities' oversight body, the \n     North American Electric Reliability Council, the power to set \n     mandatory, enforceable reliability standards for power grids.\n       The big blackout started when a tree in Ohio brushed \n     against a 345,000-volt line in an overgrown transmission \n     corridor. There are currently no mandatory federal standards \n     for how far back trees and brush should be cleared from high-\n     voltage power lines.\n       Congress is considering mandatory reliability standards as \n     part of the Bush administration's woeful energy bill, a rich \n     mixture of subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The \n     bill is now stalemated because of a dispute over costly \n     ethanol subsidies and immunity from lawsuits for \n     manufacturers of the fuel additive MTBE. The Bush \n     administration's arguments that the bill would ease high \n     gasoline prices were undercut when a study by its own Energy \n     Department showed that the bill would actually raise gasoline \n     prices by a few tenths of a percent.\n       One of the few levers left to backers is the mandatory \n     reliability provision. But this is unfair to consumers \n     because the energy bill could well fail to pass this year. A \n     responsible energy policy would be to strip out the mandatory \n     federal standards and pass them as a stand-alone bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n                          Probing the Darkness\n\n       ``We have no clue,'' lamented a First Energy Corp. engineer \n     as his computer system sputtered and a massive blackout \n     rolled across eight states last August.\n       Now, thanks to the final report of the joint U.S.-Canadian \n     blackout task force, FirstEnergy, along with others, should \n     have a fundamental understanding of how the lights went out \n     and what it will take to keep them on in the future. So \n     should the U.S. Senate, where an energy bill that could \n     create mandatory reliability standards for utility companies \n     is frozen because of other squabbles.\n       The task force has not wavered in blaming FirstEnergy for \n     the blackout. It continues to dismiss FirstEnergy's notion \n     that an unstable grid was to blame. Its interim report \n     blasted FirstEnergy for failing to cut trees that stood too \n     close to its high voltage lines. Now it adds that FirstEnergy \n     could have limited the damage if it had cut power to its \n     Greater Cleveland customers on Aug. 14. FirstEnergy \n     executives might begin repairing the company's reputation by \n     mustering the courage to utter three simple words: We are \n     sorry.\n       Though FirstEnergy bears the primary responsibility for the \n     blackout, it is not the sole culprit. Unlike other parts of \n     the country with powerful regional grid operators with the \n     authority to isolate trouble spots, the weaker Midwest \n     Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. could act \n     once emergencies develop.\n       There is hope for the MISO, which was criticized for its \n     poor coordination with FirstEnergy and its failure to tell \n     other utilities about the grid's mounting troubles. Since the \n     blackout, it now has a computer model that gives minute \n     details about the grid and it has improved communications \n     with other grid operators. For its part, FirstEnergy has \n     agreed to cooperate with an industry preparedness audit.\n       The blackout report also recommends that the North American \n     Electric Reliability Council, which sets voluntary standards \n     for electric companies, become independent and break its \n     financial ties to utility companies if it wishes to work \n     closely with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC \n     has been pushing for the authority to control electric grids \n     so it can make them more reliable.\n       The stalled Senate bill would boost FERC's power to rein in \n     frontier-style grids.\n       Experts predict that without a powerful sheriff over the \n     Midwest grid, another blackout is likely. Responsible \n     senators should strip the electric provisions out of the \n     energy bill and push for their separate approval before that \n     dark day comes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Long Island Newsday, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n                    Pass Electricity Reliability Law\n\n       The failure by Congress to pass a national energy bill is \n     trying up legislation that would help avoid another blackout \n     like the one that shut down much of New York and the \n     northeastern United States last year. The remedy is simple: \n     Split off and pass the sections dealing with reliability of \n     the nation's electric grid separately--and promptly.\n       The final report of the U.S.-Canada task force \n     investigating the blackout makes explicit the need for \n     enforceable reliability rules for North America's interlinked \n     electric utilities. It was because one Ohio utility, \n     FirstEnergy Corp., failed to follow the industry-recommended \n     standards--neglecting to shut down part of its electric grid \n     temporarily when a problem developed--that about 50 million \n     people were left without power, some for up to 4 days, last \n     August. The estimated cost to the U.S. economy: up to $10 \n     billion.\n       It was something as simple as a transmission line shorting \n     out on a tree branch that started the cascading chain of \n     events. The task force found that the outage got out of hand \n     because FirstEnergy violated several of the North American \n     Electric Reliability Council's voluntary standards--by not \n     responding properly to the power failure as it developed and \n     by failing to let neighboring utilities know what was \n     happening, among other shortcomings.\n       That's why the reliability rules need to be mandatory.\n       The necessary legislation is now part of a far-reaching and \n     controversial energy bill that has been stalled in Congress \n     for two years. The electric utility portion that would help \n     avert future blackouts has broad support. Holding it hostage \n     to the larger bill only delays the necessary effort to make \n     the nation's power supply more reliable and secure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Newark Star-Ledger, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n                        Head Off More Blackouts\n\n       Last August the intricate web of power plants, transformer \n     stations and transmission lines that form our nation's \n     electric power grid failed, shutting out the lights for tens \n     of millions in the Northeast and portions of Canada.\n       An international review team says it happened because the \n     utility industry in general, and an Ohio utility in \n     particular, failed to follow voluntary rules designed to \n     ensure electricity flowed reliably.\n       Computers were faulty.

The industry board that set the rules isn't independent \n     enough.\n       Another summer is approaching and the rules are still \n     voluntary, held hostage to the political battle in Washington \n     over a larger energy bill.\n       The power industry insists that another giant blackout is \n     unlikely. Utilities are upgrading maintenance, training and \n     equipment, spending lots of money to keep the juice flowing. \n     They may be right, for now. This summer the utilities are \n     likely to be on their toes.\n       But backsliding is inevitable without strong mandatory \n     rules. Sooner or later, there will be another power disaster.\n       There is widespread support in Congress for tough new \n     regulations. Unfortunately, GOP senators merged these reforms \n     into the larger federal energy bill, seeing them as leverage \n     to get support for the whole package, complete with lavish \n     new subsidies for oil, gas and coal producers and expanded \n     drilling in wilderness areas.\n       The energy bill is going nowhere in a presidential election \n     year. Congress should see the light and pass a narrow bill \n     designed to fix the electric grid and prevent future \n     blackouts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Westchester Journal News, Apr. 7, 2004]\n\n                      Preventing Future Blackouts\n\n       The power outage of August 2003 that left tens of millions \n     of people without electricity in New York, seven other states \n     and part of Canada should not have happened, according to the \n     final report released Monday by a joint U.S.-Canadian task \n     force that investigated the worst blackout in U.S. history.\n       The report, U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said, \n     ``makes clear that this blackout could have been prevented.'' \n     Perhaps now--eight months later--Congress will act on its \n     promise to fix the problems that caused the blackout.\n       The outage was not prevented, the report said, because \n     poorly trained operators in the FirstEnergy Corp. of Ohio \n     control room failed to alert other utilities that its \n     computer system malfunctioned so the cascade of outages could \n     have been short-circuited. The utility also had not followed \n     through on safeguards to deal with power failures and lacked \n     a backup monitoring system.\n       The result--in addition to the impact on millions of \n     people, including 6.7 million in New York--was a $10 billion \n     bite out of the economy.\n       The task force recommended establishing reliability \n     standards under an international overseer with the authority \n     to punish companies that violate them. That would replace the \n     voluntary rules of the North American Electric Reliability \n     Council, which has no enforcement power. The task force found \n     that FirstEnergy had at least seven violations of the \n     voluntary rules.\n       FirstEnergy has since increased staff training and spent \n     $10 million on new computer controls, company spokeswoman \n     Ellen Rains told USA Today. That's more than Congress has \n     done.\n       Measures addressing electricity reliability are contained \n     in an energy bill that is stalled in Congress for a third \n     year. These include upgrading the nation's rickety grid, and \n     taking control away from some 130 separate power authorities \n     and forming new regional transmission networks regulated by \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure adequate \n     electricity distribution.\n       Those measures, along with task force recommendations, \n     should be separated from other measures in the dead-ended \n     energy bill and approved quickly in stand-alone electricity \n     reliability legislation such as that proposed by Sen. Maria \n     Cantwell, D-Wash., and others.\n       New York state, it should be noted, has also done nothing \n     about keeping an adequate flow of power to meet the state's \n     current and future needs despite its own warning even before \n     the massive 2003 blackout. In 1999, a blackout left 200,000 \n     people without power in parts of Manhattan. The Democratic-\n     controlled Assembly and Republican-dominated Senate are in \n     political gridlock. Sadly, that's typical of a state \n     government that hasn't passed a budget on time in 20 years. \n     But nothing is happening.\n       Both Congress and the state Legislature need to act to \n     prevent another costly blackout.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Albany Times-Union, Apr. 8, 2004]\n\n                            Blackout Lessons\n\n\n   a report on last august's power failure makes clear the need for \n                          tougher regulations\n\n       Last summer's blackout plunged much of the Northeast and \n     parts of Canada into blackness. But a newly released report \n     on what caused the power failure, and whether it might have \n     been prevented, is illuminating. It should put to rest the \n     once-fashionable argument that the utility industry is best \n     served by government deregulation. Perhaps in terms of a free \n     market, less bureaucracy would lead to greater efficiency and \n     lower rates. But what of reliability? If anything, the \n     report is Exhibit 1 in a case for close government \n     oversight.\n       As expected, the report, compiled by a joint U.S.-Canada \n     task force, faults FirstEnergy Corp. of Ohio for failing to \n     contain the blackout by shutting off 1,500 megawatts of power \n     in the Cleveland-Akron area right after the first surge in \n     voltage occurred in transmission lines south of Cleveland. \n     Not only that, but the investigators found that FirstEnergy \n     should have been more alert to the possibility of a power \n     failure because the region it serves had a known history of \n     grid instability.\n       The report found that FirstEnergy not only failed to act \n     promptly but was ill prepared for an emergency because it \n     hadn't followed voluntary industry guidelines for long-range \n     planning and system monitoring. Just as alarming, the \n     investigators faulted the Midwest Independent Transmission \n     System Operator, which oversees FirstEnergy, for failing to \n     alert neighboring regions of a gathering crisis, as well as \n     other safeguards designed to stave off widespread outages.\n       The report's authors have rightly called for replacing the \n     voluntary guidelines with government regulations designed to \n     ensure the reliability of the nation's power grid. Given the \n     huge cost associated with the blackout, not to mention the \n     inconvenience for millions of stranded commuters and the \n     hazards they faced, ensuring reliability must be a top \n     priority. Given the vulnerability of the grid system to \n     potential terrorist acts, reliability must be an urgent \n     priority.\n       Regrettably, though, there are signs that any proposed \n     regulations might become mired in yet another partisan \n     standoff in Congress. Rep. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., prime \n     sponsor of a sweeping energy bill, believes that his \n     legislation already contains provisions that address most of \n     the task force's concerns. But Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., \n     has warned that the energy bill could become a ``quagmire'' \n     for new regulations and has proposed a separate bill instead.\n       She is right. It's past time for corrective action. Perhaps \n     no one has made that point better than Gov. George Pataki did \n     last August, when he bitterly recalled the assurances of \n     power systems managers that there would never be a repeat of \n     the East Coast blackout of the 1960s. He should remind Sen. \n     Domenici that those who do not learn from history are \n     destined to repeat it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, Apr. 8, 2004]\n\n                               Powerless\n\n       Imagine the moment. George W. Bush steps to the podium at \n     Madison Square Garden. The roar of approval from his fellow \n     Republicans is deafening as the president prepares to \n     formally accept their nomination to seek a second term in the \n     White House.\n       Then, suddenly, just as Mr. Bush is about to speak, the \n     lights go out; the sound system goes dead; the air-\n     conditioning clicks off.\n       Terrorism! Everyone suspects that at first. But they're \n     wrong. it's just another particularly ill-timed power \n     blackout in the Big Apple. A preventable disaster caused by a \n     utility company that failed to follow safety procedures \n     Congress has yet to make mandatory--even after a similar \n     incident last summer shut off the juice for days to more than \n     40 million people in eight states and parts of Canada.\n       Admittedly, the odds of such a blackout disrupting the \n     Republican National Convention in August are slim. And the \n     GOP will likely be prepared with backup generators in any \n     case.\n       A repeat of last summer's debacle is quite likely to occur \n     at some point, however, until Congress enacts the reliability \n     standards that are being held hostage to an internal \n     Republican dispute over Mr. Bush's long-stalled energy bill.\n       Lawmakers should set aside that dispute and move quickly to \n     enact a narrower proposal that would deal exclusively with \n     electricity standards and penalties for utilities that fail \n     to comply. There appears to be no disagreement in either \n     party that such mandatory standards are needed.\n       Massive, cascading blackouts are not new, but they are \n     getting worse. The first big blackout in November 1965 cut \n     off power to about 30 million people in the Northeast for up \n     to 13 hours. Other major outages have crippled Western states \n     and parts of Mexico.\n       Task force after task force has recommended that voluntary \n     reliability standards put in place in 1965 be stiffened \n     through the force of federal law and oversight. The most \n     recent such recommendation came this week from a joint U.S.-\n     Canadian panel studying the reasons for last summer's grid \n     collapse, which closed airports, schools and businesses and \n     cost tens of billions of dollars.\n       Most or all of the consequences could have been avoided if \n     an Ohio power company had been prepared, as it should have \n     been, with emergency plans to contain the damage caused by \n     three high-voltage lines that sagged onto untrimmed trees and \n     short-circuited.\n       Even if Mr. Bush's comprehensive energy bill represented an \n     enlightened approach to public policy, its failure to win \n     enactment so far wouldn't justify further delay in approving \n     the electricity standards. But this bill is a turkey, so \n     laden with giveaways to the energy industry it makes many in \n     his own party gag.\n       It's time for Mr. Bush to set the electricity standards \n     free. If he doesn't, the trendy question this summer may not \n     be ``Where were you when the lights went out?'' but ``Who was \n     in charge of the switch?''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Apr. 8, 2004]\n\n                       Little Change in the Grid\n\n       Last August, a blackout left 50 million people in eight \n     U.S. states and parts of eastern Canada without power. \n     Although embarrassed utilities are almost certainly more\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\n     vigilant, the blackout could happen again because in the \n     eight months since not much on the federal regulatory front \n     has changed.\n       Last week, a joint U.S.-Canadian task force that has been \n     studying the blackout issued its final report, with 46 \n     recommendations to prevent a recurrence. Many of them are \n     highly technical, but one is startlingly simple:\n       Congress should give the utilities' oversight body, the \n     North American Electric Reliability Council, the power to set \n     mandatory, enforceable reliability standards for power grids.\n       The big blackout started when a tree in Ohio brushed \n     against a 345,000-volt line in an overgrown transmission \n     corridor. There are currently no mandatory federal standards \n     for how far back trees and brush should be cleared from high-\n     voltage power lines. Had those standards been in effect last \n     summer and enforced--no blackout.\n       Congress is considering mandatory reliability standards as \n     part of the Bush administration's woeful energy bill, a rich \n     mixture of subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. \n     Even though its 10-year cost has been pared down from $31 \n     billion to $14 billion, it is still too rich for many \n     lawmakers.\n       The bill is now stalemated because of a dispute over costly \n     ethanol subisides and immunity from lawsuits for \n     manufacturers of the fuel additive MTBE. And its backers are \n     running out of arguments why the bill should be passed. The \n     Bush administration's arguments that the bill would ease high \n     gasoline prices were undercut when a study by its own Energy \n     Department showed that the bill would actually raise gasoline \n     prices by a few tenths of a percent.\n       One of the few levers left to backers like Sen. Pete \n     Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. Joe Barton, R--Texas, the chairmen \n     of the Senate and House Energy committees, is the mandatory \n     reliability provision. But this is unfair to consumers \n     because the energy bill could well fail to pass this year. A \n     responsible energy policy would be to strip out the mandatory \n     federal standards and pass them as a stand-alone bill.\n       Otherwise, the lights, elevators and air-conditioning could \n     go out against his summer, and this time we won't need a \n     joint U.S.-Canadian commission to know who is responsible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Toledo Blade, Apr. 8, 2004]\n\n                          Regulating the Grid\n\n       The massive power blackout that darkened much of the \n     northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada last Aug. 14 showed \n     that voluntary regulation isn't enough to keep the North \n     American electric grid reliable. The final report of a U.S.-\n     Canadian task force, which found that the outage was \n     preventable, only reinforces that view.\n       What Congress needs to do is strip new mandates for \n     operation of the grid from its moribund energy bill and pass \n     them as separate legislation. And it should do so now, not \n     later, before another catastrophic blackout ensues.\n       The North America Electric Reliability Council, which runs \n     the interconnected grid, is a creature of the power industry. \n     It should be, as the U.S.-Canada panel suggests, replaced by \n     a body that would impose mandatory federal standards on the \n     transmission of electric power, along with penalties for \n     utilities that violate them.\n       Very simply, the panel found at least seven violations of \n     the voluntary industry standards. NERC has no enforcement \n     authority, even among its own members, and hundreds of \n     millions of U.S. and Canadian residents should not have to \n     depend on the good will of the industry for reliable \n     electricity.\n       In addition, the panel has reinforced its earlier \n     conclusion that Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., parent of \n     Toledo Edison, was largely responsible for failing to take \n     quick measures that would have prevented the blackout's \n     spread to parts of eight states and the province of Ontario.\n       Failures in FirstEnergy lines south of Cleveland started a \n     voltage imbalance that tilted the system out of control on \n     Aug. 14, the report said, but earlier warnings went unheeded \n     by the company.\n       Months before the blackout, ``there was clear experience \n     and evidence that the Cleveland-Akron area was highly \n     vulnerable to voltage instability problems,'' the report \n     said. Unfortunately, neither FirstEnergy nor the Midwest \n     Independent System Operator, which was supposed to be \n     overseeing the utility, were prepared to assess or deal such \n     emergencies.\n       Cutting off the power of much of metropolitan Cleveland \n     immediately might have limited the blackout, the task force \n     said. We can understand FirstEnergy's reluctance to target \n     certain customers, although failing to take action had far \n     worse consequences. The outage ultimately affected some 50 \n     million Americans and Canadians.\n       FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries are carrying out an \n     aggressive tree-trimming program in the wake of the blackout, \n     but it is important to remember that what happened on Aug. 14 \n     was about more than limbs on wires.\n       As the panel pointed out, electric deregulation and the \n     resulting need for greater long-distance power transmission \n     have helped put the grid in jeopardy. In 1986, investor-owned \n     utilities bought just 18 percent of their power from other \n     producers. In 2002, the figure was 37 percent.\n       During the same period, U.S. electric demand grew by 26 \n     percent and generating capacity rose 22 percent, but the \n     grid's capacity remained largely static.\n       Those trends illustrate vividly the need to put the \n     electric grid under stringent federal regulation. Otherwise, \n     we'll never be sure the lights will stay on.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG.

There are 4 minutes on the minority side, and \nthere are 6 minutes 50 seconds remaining on the majority side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when 3\\1/\n2\\ minutes have been used.\n  Mr. President, the issue before the Senate at this time is whether we \nare going to treat all workers fairly and equitably in the pension \nsystem.\n  As we know, there are two different pension systems. The single-\nemployer pension system has 35 million Americans, and effectively 9.7 \nmillion are in the multiemployer plans. Both of those pension systems \nare under pressure because of the adverse economic impact.\n  We have tried in conference to make sure those 9.7 million Americans \nin a multiemployer pension system which are at serious risk are going \nto get the same kind of fairness and attention as in the single-\nemployer plans. We were unable to do that. We had that basically agreed \non.\n  They are effectively excluded. It is like taking 100 Members of the \nSenate and saying we are going to take care of 80, but we are leaving \n20 out. That is not right. What we ought to be doing is taking care of \nthe whole 100.\n  That is why I ask people to vote in opposition and give us a chance \nto come back and include all of those. We shouldn't exclude all those.\n  Who are the 9.7 million?\n  First of all, if we look at what has happened in the pension systems \nin America, we see the rapid decline and loss of pension coverage in \nAmerica. Among the groups that are losing it the fastest are those low \nwage workers. They are the ones in the multipension systems. They are \nthe ones at the greatest risk. They are the ones we ought to be out \nthere trying to protect. They are the ones involved as workers in the \nsmall business. That is what this is all about.\n\n  Why shouldn't we provide the protection for those workers in small \nbusinesses that are at the lower economic income as we are providing \nfor the Fortune 500? This legislation provides for the workers in the \nFortune 500. We are saying there are ``fortune 10,000'' companies as \nwell. I have read into the Record the various companies and \ncorporations.\n  We now know there is an assault on pension coverage. Without the kind \nof protection of including multiemployers, there are going to be \nhundreds of thousands of workers at risk, who play by the rules, work \nhard, and who have been falling further and further behind in the \neconomic progress of this country.\n  Final point: The point has been made that the White House says we \ncan't include the multiemployer programs because we do not want to put \nmore pressure on the Pension Guaranteed Corporations.\n  Look at this: Last year, $2.4 billion in 2003 drawdown on the pension \nPPGC for single-employer plans; less than $5 million last year for \nmultiemployer plans.\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\n  These smaller companies need protection, they need fairness, they \nneed equity. These companies need the kind of attention and relief that \nwe are providing for the single employer. This legislation doesn't do \nit.\n  Let us defeat this legislation and then embrace it and include all \nthe workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kennedy has 32 seconds; the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has 6 minutes 32 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator wish to make any further statement?\n  I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is interesting. Pensions are sort of \nlike health insurance. We all have it in the Senate. We all have good \nhealth insurance, unlike the rest of the 270 million Americans. We all \nhave good pensions.\n  Can you imagine how many Members of the Senate would be over here now \nif we said over 20 percent of the Senators are going to see their \npension effectively undermined?\n  That is what we are effectively saying to the workforce in this \ncountry. We are looking out after 80 percent. There is another 20 \npercent out there. We all have good ones in here. Why don't we at least \nmake sure, if we are going to protect the 80 percent of American \nworkers, that we protect the other 20 percent?\n  That is the issue that is before the Senate. It is an issue of \nfairness in how we are going to act for workers in this country. That \nis why I hope Senators will vote no.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his courtesy, as always. I \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate is how we \ncorrect an imminent problem, an immediate problem that many pension \nfunds are facing because the present way their payments into their \npension funds are valued is based on an instrument that no longer \nexists, the 30-year Treasury bond; therefore, they are being asked to \ncontribute an artificial number which has no relationship to the actual \ninterest rate charges and revenues or interest rate return that the \nmarketplace would naturally generate.\n  The practical effect is $80 billion will be misallocated within the \nmarketplace. The practical effect is that a significant amount of \ninvestment--the purchase of machines, the purchase of things which make \nthings more efficient, contributions to people's employment and other \nareas, including wages--will be impacted negatively because dollars \nwill be artificially moved, rather than where they are most efficiently \nused, meaning a loss of jobs.\n  The companies will be less competitive, the people who work for these \ncompanies do not have the support they need in the way of capital \nequipment and compensation, and there will be a negative impact on \nemployment in the marketplace. We need to correct that in the short \nterm. This is a short-term bill, a 2-year bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has raised some very legitimate \nconcerns about where the multiemployer plans are going, but that is a \nvery complicated issue. This bill is a very small attempt to address \nthe most severely distressed elements of the multiplans. It has \ntargeted language to address a few individual plans which are employer \nplans which are under clear stress--specifically, airlines and steel \ncompanies--but it does not try to solve all the problems.\n  The understanding behind this bill is that we are going to come back \nto this issue, hopefully promptly, for long-term substantive review of \nthe question and a fix. This is a 2-year bill. The most important part \nis to get the 30-year bond issue straightened out so the $80 billion is \nnot misallocated and the jobs that would be lost are not lost. That is \nwhy we need to pass this bill at this time.\n  I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 335 submitted by this \nSenator earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 335) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that Major League Baseball clubs and their players \n     take immediate action to adopt a drug-testing policy that \n     effectively deters Major League Baseball players from using \n     anabolic steroids and any other performance-enhancing \n     substances that create a competitive advantage for, and\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\n     pose a serious health risk to, such players and the children \n     and teenagers who emulate them.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by my colleagues \nSenators Biden, Fitzgerald, Allen, Breaux, Dorgan, and many others in \nsubmitting this legislation which calls on Major League Baseball and \nits players to adopt a legitimate drug-testing policy.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that Major League \nBaseball's current drug-testing policy stops short of what is necessary \nto protect the game, its players, and the children and teenagers who \nemulate them.\n  As Major League Baseball starts a new season--a time that ordinarily \nsignals renewal and promise--a dark shadow of public suspicion looms \nover the game and its players. Sadly, the talk amongst baseball fans is \nless this year about which team will win the World Series and more \nabout which at athletes have cheated by using performance-enhancing \nsubstances. Action is clearly needed by Major League Baseball to \naddress this problem and refocus its fans' attention to what takes \nplace on the fields of play.\n  The sport of baseball is America's pastime and an institution \ninextricably interwoven into the fabric of our culture. If Major League \nBaseball and its players fail to act to preserve and protect the sport \nby adopting a drug testing policy that effectively deters the players \nfrom using anabolic steroids or any other similar performance-enhancing \nsubstances, this important part of our culture will remain tarnished. \nThe resolution we are introducing today would call on Major League \nBaseball and its players to restore legitimacy to professional baseball \nand make the welfare of the sport more important than the self-serving \ninterests that have a choke hold on America's game.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has oversight authority \nover professional sports, and, more importantly, as a parent, let me be \nclear. There are real consequences to demanding anything less than \nclean professional sports. As discussed during a recent Senate Commerce \nCommittee hearing on steroid use in professional and amateur sports, \nthe failure to insist on stringent drug testing policies damages the \nintegrity of the games and calls into question records set by those \nsuspected of using performance-enhancing drugs.\n  No reasonable person would disagree that using any performance-\nenhancing substance for the sole purpose of gaining a competitive edge \nover an opponent is cheating. And, simply put, any sports organization \nthat turns a blind eye to drug use among its athletes is as guilty of \ncheating as the players. This cheating and the negative effect it has \non the integrity of any sport is shameful, and Major League Baseball \nand its players must cease treating the issue of drug testing as just \nanother bargaining chip. But more worrisome still is the poor example \nset by professional athletes in the eyes of the kids who idolize them \nand are led by their example.\n  Some may doubt the powerful effect that athletes have on the lives of \nkids. Let me remind them of the five-fold increase in the sales of the \nsteroid-like substance androstenedione--better known as ``andro''--that \noccurred after Mark McGwire admitted to using the substance in 1998 \nwhile chasing Roger Maris's home run record. Since then, the problem of \nharmful supplement use among children and teenagers has reached \nepidemic proportions. According to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, nearly 12 percent of high school boys and 3 percent of high \nschool girls use steroids. This is unacceptable.\n\n  The adverse health consequences associated with such use are \nindisputable. Medical experts warn that the effects on children and \nteenagers include stunted growth, scarring acne, hormonal imbalances, \nliver and kidney damage, as well as an increased risk of heart disease \nand stroke later in life. Psychologically, steroids have been \nassociated with increased aggression, suicide, and a higher propensity \nto commit serious crimes.\n  Today we call on Major League Baseball and its players to step up to \nthe proverbial plate and implement a drug testing policy that will \neffectively deter players from using anabolic steroids and other \nsimilar performance-enhancing substances. We cannot, and will not, \nallow professional baseball to collectively bargain away the legitimacy \nand history of the sport. The current drug-testing regime is simply \nunacceptable, and without quick and significant change to the way the \nleague tests for drugs among its athletes, the owners and players will \ncontinue to be viewed by the public as the knowing perpetrators of a \nshameful fraud.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to not allow the \nintegrity of professional baseball to be choked by the foul ambition of \nthose who cheat.\n  In today's East Valley Tribune in Arizona is a letter to the editor. \nIt reads as follows:\n\n       I am a 12-year-old Boy Scout working on my communications \n     merit badge. One of its requirements is to write a letter to \n     the editor of a local newspaper on a topic I believe in.\n       I think baseball players should not take steroids.\n\n  The letter goes on--this is from Hunter Amos of Chandler, AZ--to talk \nabout the need for baseball to bring about a meaningful drug-testing \nprogram. This from a 12-year-old Boy Scout.\n  It certainly proves the American people are involved and concerned \nabout this issue.\n  I would like to state the following very briefly. One, organized \nbaseball, Major League Baseball, and its players union have to come \ntogether and resolve this issue with a meaningful drug-testing program. \nA good model would be that which the minor leagues of baseball employ. \nIt seems to me, since it is already in being, that the major leagues \ncould just adopt the same procedures as the minor leagues.\n  Second, the blame is not entirely on the players. Part of the blame \nis on the owners. Commissioner Selig stated before our committee: It \nwas the last issue and they refused to budge, and we gave in because we \ndidn't want a work stoppage.\n  I understand that, but it is an indicator the owners were not that \nconcerned about it; otherwise, they would have held fast.\n  More importantly, this is for the good of two groups of Americans: \nOne, Major League Baseball players. But, two, young Americans, high \nschool athletes all over America who today believe the way to athletic \nexcellence is to take performance-enhancing drugs. That is wrong. \nStatistics, as well as anecdotal evidence, from high school coaches all \nover America are telling us young Americans, young athletes are using \nperformance-enhancing drugs in greater and greater numbers. Who are \ntheir role models? The major league athletes themselves.\n  We are not picking on baseball. The NFL has an excellent program. The \nother professional leagues do as well, and Major League Baseball \nobviously has one that is termed by many as a joke.\n  I could spend a lot of time mentioning Curt Schilling--who is one of \nmy personal heroes; unfortunately he has left the Diamondbacks and is \nnow with the Red Sox--was quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying:\n\n       Some of these guys look like Mr. Potato Head.\n\n  Some of these guys look like Mr. Potato Head? The damage some of \nthese individuals are doing to themselves is really terrible, but far \nmore terrible is the damage young high school athletes and college \nathletes are inflicting on themselves because of the precedent and \nexample of Major League Baseball players. My greatest hero was Ted \nWilliams. When I was a young, mediocre high school athlete, I probably \nwould have been tempted to emulate him.\n  All of us are aware a sense-of-the-Senate resolution has no force of \nlaw. I also recognize a sense-of-the-Senate resolution is a far cry \nfrom actual legislation. But I want to say now I believe I speak for \nall of my colleagues in the Senate, particularly those of us who have \nbeen involved in this issue, that we expect Major League Baseball \nowners and players to act. We expect them to act quickly. If they do \nnot, obviously we have to explore other options. I do not want the \nCongress of the United States to be involved in a management-labor \ndispute. None of us want\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nthat, and I think there will be difficulty because an action of that \ntype is almost unprecedented. But I point out Major League Baseball \ndoes have an involvement with the Congress of the United States. They \nwere not ashamed to come to the Congress of the United States to get an \nantitrust exemption, probably the most generous of any professional \nsport. Of course, they are engaged in interstate commerce.\n  I hope Major League Baseball understands we are serious, and the \npurpose of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution today is taking one step \nforward. I pray for the good of these young high school and college \nathletes and even junior high school athletes that Major League \nBaseball will realize we are serious and take it upon themselves to \nreopen negotiations and resolve this issue.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, who has been a \nstalwart on this issue and, in his usual eloquent and persuasive style, \nhas contributed enormously to this debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I follow my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, and thank him for his work. He, obviously, once again \non this issue, will not let go. He insists we address this issue. I \ndeeply appreciate it. I, like Senator McCain, am a great baseball fan. \nI grew up in a small town 60 miles from the nearest daily newspaper. \nWhen I was a kid, I used to get that newspaper and I would look at this \ntiny little section, ``Major League Leaders.'' I wanted to see if \nWillie Mays hit another home run. I loved baseball.\n  Later, I followed the saga of someone from my own State, Roger Maris, \nwho in 1961 was engaged in this home-run derby with Mickey Mantle. We \nwere so proud in North Dakota of having this home State slugger, Roger \nMaris, setting a new record for Major League Baseball in 1961.\n  Baseball was called our national pastime. In fact, last week the \nPresident of the United States traveled halfway across the country to \nthrow out the opening pitch. Why? It is a national pastime. People care \nabout baseball in this country. It is a great sport. But something is \nhappening in this sport that ought to give all of us great concern.\n  Sports Illustrated has a cover story. In the old days when Sports \nIllustrated had a cover story about baseball, it was about a pitcher, a \ncatcher, a player, or a baseball exploit. Now it is about drugs--Ken \nCaminiti, Jose Conseco, and others talking about drug use in baseball.\n  Two years ago, I chaired a subcommittee hearing of the Commerce \nCommittee on this subject. We had representatives from Major League \nbaseball, owners and others. We had representatives of the baseball \nplayers, and we addressed this issue. Then a month ago, Senator McCain \nchaired the full committee of the Commerce Committee hearing on the \nsame issue. We had the same people involved in testimony.\n  Do my colleagues want to know something. In 2 years, nothing had \nchanged. There was not even a baby step forward.\n  They say they initiated a testing program, one test a year, and there \nis prior notice of the test. That is not a testing program.\n  Senator McCain offers a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I know this \nby itself will not fix the problem, but it will send a message, it \nseems to me, to all involved that they ought to make progress; they \nought to do what is right and do what is necessary.\n  Two years ago when I held these hearings, we also asked a \npediatrician to testify, a pediatrician who is involved in sports. Do \nmy colleagues know what he said? He said we have kids in the sixth, \nseventh, and eighth grades who are wanting to take performance-\nenhancing drugs in order to play better football, basketball, perform \nbetter on track. Why do they do that? Because they see their idols do \nit. They see the professional baseball players on the front cover of \nSports Illustrated who are taking performance-enhancing drugs. Ken \nCaminiti said he thought half the players in the big leagues were using \nsteroids, and that he had used them in 1996 during his Most Valuable \nPlayer season.\n  He is out of baseball, says he feels ashamed and embarrassed about \nhis own problems, including a guilty plea for crack cocaine possession \nin 2002. A Most Valuable Player in baseball says half the players in \nthe big leagues were using steroids.\n  Does this have an impact? You bet your life it does. It has an impact \non American kids, kids who aspire to be involved in sports. It sends a \nmessage that the way to improve in sports is to take some performance-\nenhancing drug. That is a dangerous message. It is the wrong message. \nPeople will die as a result. That is why Senator McCain says let's stop \nthis.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator is well aware, and I want to thank him for \nhis continued involvement in this issue, this will be reported as a \nsense-of-the Senate resolution, which we all know is nonbinding. Could \nthe Senator predict what he thinks might happen if we go for another \nmonth or two and no action of any kind is taken by Major League \nbaseball? What does the Senator think might happen or could happen?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think what certainly could happen and \nmight happen is the Congress might intervene with legislation that is \nreal legislation, not just a sense of the Senate, because this is a \nsignificant public issue.\n  The National Football League has solved this issue. They have \nrigorous testing for those who play professional football in this \ncountry. They testified at the hearing Senator McCain held. Minor \nLeague baseball has solved this issue. The commissioner of baseball \nordered rigorous, wide testing for drugs in the minor leagues. So it is \nnot as if no one knows how to do this.\n\n  Mr. Fehr said in his testimony 2 years ago, and now 2 weeks ago, that \nthis is a matter of privacy for baseball players. It seems to me it is \nnot a matter of privacy. If in private people are taking banned drugs \nin order to enhance their performance in public, which is exactly what \nhappens in professional sports, the taking of drugs in private in order \nto enhance their public performance, does the public have a right to \nunderstand that and know about that? Darn right, the public has a right \nto know.\n  My point is this: When the Sports Illustrated magazine--a wonderful \nmagazine, one I love to read, that chronicles the great sports \nachievements in this wonderful country of ours--has a cover story of a \nmagnificent baseball player who says nearly half the players in the \nmajor leagues are taking some sort of banned substance, I do not know \nwhether he is right or wrong, but I do know this: it ought to be a \nwake-up call for baseball. It is in their interest, it is in the \nplayers' interest, to solve this issue.\n  There is a great baseball pitcher who used to pitch in the home State \nof my colleague from Arizona, Kurt Schilling. He is now in Boston. I \nknow 2 years ago, when all of this broke, this wonderful pitcher, \nperhaps one of the best of all times, what did he say? He thought there \nought to be testing. Why? I think the great baseball players understand \nthat this cloud over baseball, as a result of these drug allegations, \nought to be removed. It taints the sport. The good players, those who \nare not on performance-enhancing drugs, understand. They believe there \nought to be rigorous testing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator well knows, there are some superb athletes \nin Major League baseball today, and they are performing magnificent \nfeats. Yet a cloud hangs over their performances both in the minds of \nthe fans as well as many of their fellow players. Why is it, does the \nSenator think, that these players and owners would not recognize it is \nin the best interest of baseball itself? If they do not care about the \nhigh school athletes, if they do not care about the detriment to their \nhealth after they retire, as we see is happening with steroid users in \nother sports as well as this one, does not the Senator from North \nDakota think they would care about the reputable aspects, or being held \nin disrepute the records they are making as\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nthey are spending the best years of their lives in Major League \nbaseball?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I fully agree. In rodeo sports, something I care a lot \nabout because I grew up with horses and my father was an excellent \nhorseman, they say somebody has a lot of try. It is an interesting way \nof describing it, saying he had a lot of try.\n  Well, I hope when we look back in the rearview mirror and get the \ntesting that is necessary in baseball, the achievements of a baseball \nplayer in this country will be the result of both skill and try--I mean \nsomebody who had the determination to do well, had the skill, who put \nin the time, and did well. But when we read the front cover of Sports \nIllustrated, and they have some magnificent baseball player saying, I \nhad an MVP season, but I was on drugs, in my judgment it colors and \ntaints the exploits and achievements of others.\n  I hope Mr. Fehr and all of those involved will have a vote of the \nbaseball players or do what is necessary to get a consensus. I am \ncertain a consensus of professional baseball players must surely want \nto remove this cloud. Again, this is not some mysterious issue for \nwhich we do not have a solution. The National Football League has \nsolved it. The minor leagues have solved it. So, too, should Major \nLeague baseball.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. He \nhas been involved in this issue longer than I have. I appreciate the \nopportunity of working with him on a variety of issues in the Senate.\n  I would like to make one additional point. I have seen some comments \nby some observers of Major League baseball, and they are saying: Look, \nit cannot be too big a problem because Major League baseball is \nbreaking all records and it is more popular than it was before and \nratings are higher, so it probably then should not be such a big deal.\n  I will make two points. There was a recent Pew Research poll that \nshowed 90 percent of people who identify themselves as baseball fans \nsay something needs to be done about steroids. But maybe more \nimportantly, there was a time when baseball was very popular and had \ngreat attendance and was the national pastime and everybody was happy, \nbut baseball was segregated. Baseball was a segregated sport. I would \nargue today, baseball in America is a lot better off now that it is an \nintegrated sport, and I would argue that baseball will be a lot better \noff once we have a reasonable, workable testing program as far as \nperformance-enhancing drugs are concerned.\n  For the good of our national pastime, I urge that Major League \nbaseball owners and players sit down together and resolve this issue \nand then, as they have asked, we can move on to other issues of the \nday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable en bloc, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 335) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 335\n\n       Whereas, the sport of baseball is widely considered \n     America's pastime and an institution inextricably interwoven \n     into the fabric of our culture;\n       Whereas, anabolic steroids are substances that are \n     chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone and \n     promote muscle growth;\n       Whereas, anabolic steroids are Schedule III controlled \n     substances under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 \n     et seq.);\n       Whereas, certain products are sold legally in the United \n     States that promote muscle growth in a manner similar to \n     anabolic steroids;\n       Whereas, medical experts warn that the health consequences \n     associated with the human use of anabolic steroids or other \n     similar performance-enhancing substances can be dire;\n       Whereas, medical experts warn that anabolic steroids and \n     other similar performance-enhancing substances can have \n     particularly serious adverse health effects on children and \n     teenagers;\n       Whereas, these adverse health effects include stunted \n     growth, scarring acne, hair loss, dramatic mood swings, \n     hormonal imbalances, liver and kidney damage, a higher risk \n     of heart disease and stroke later in life, as well as an \n     increased propensity to demonstrate aggressive behavior, \n     commit suicide, and commit crimes;\n       Whereas, the dangerous and anti-competitive effects of \n     anabolic steroids when used by Major League Baseball players \n     were acknowledged but not adequately addressed by the 30 \n     Major League Baseball clubs and the Major League Baseball \n     Players Association in their September 30, 2002, Collective \n     Bargaining Agreement;\n       Whereas, the September 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement \n     does not allow for the imposition of a suspension or fine for \n     a first-time violation of the League steroids policy;\n       Whereas, the September 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement \n     does not allow Major League Baseball players to be subjected \n     to more than one unannounced drug test per season;\n       Whereas, the September 2002 Collective Bargaining Agreement \n     does not prohibit the use of certain performance-enhancing \n     substances that, although legal, promote muscle growth and \n     pose a serious health risk to users;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the 2002 Collective Bargaining \n     Agreement, the prevalence of the use by Major League Baseball \n     players of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing \n     substances that promote muscle growth and pose a serious \n     health risk, at the very least, appears to be significant; \n     and\n       Whereas, the use of anabolic steroids and other \n     performance-enhancing substances that promote muscle growth \n     and pose a serious health risk to children and teenagers \n     continues to rise: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the use of performance-enhancing substances such as \n     anabolic steroids poses a health risk, especially to children \n     and teenagers;\n       (2) the use of athletic performance-enhancing substances \n     such as anabolic steroids to gain a competitive advantage is \n     tantamount to cheating;\n       (3) there is sufficient evidence that children and \n     teenagers tend to emulate professional athletes;\n       (4) the effectiveness of the 2002 Collective Bargaining \n     Agreement to deter Major League Baseball players from using \n     performance-enhancing substances such as anabolic steroids \n     has been called into question;\n       (5) Major League Baseball and its players should exercise \n     their collective bargaining authority to negotiate and adopt \n     a more stringent drug-testing policy that is sufficient to \n     effectively deter Major League Baseball players from using \n     anabolic steroids or other similar performance-enhancing \n     substances to gain a competitive advantage; and\n       (6) taking such a step would help--\n       (A) to preserve the integrity of the game of professional \n     baseball;\n       (B) to protect the health of Major League Baseball players; \n     and\n       (C) to discourage the use of performance-enhancing \n     substances such as anabolic steroids by children and \n     teenagers who seek to emulate professional athletes.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about the \nhistoric day tomorrow, which is the 1-year anniversary of the \nliberation of Iraq, and the experience which Senator McCain and Senator \nChambliss and Senator Cochran and I just had with a few others in \nmeeting the Ambassador-designate from Iraq, Ambassador-designate Rend \nAl-Rahim.\n  She has been a leader in the movement for women's rights in Iraq, and \nhas been designated by the Iraqi Governing Council to represent her \ncountry here in the United States at this historic time. In listening \nto her message, it simply should remind all of us of the importance of \nwhat we, as Americans, have been doing in support of freedom for the \nIraqi people.\n  I wish to share a few of the comments which she made to us, and a bit \nof the response to that. First, she is a remarkable woman in her own \nright; she, as I said, has been fighting for Iraqi rights for a long \ntime. It is no surprise that someone with her background and \nqualifications has been selected to represent her country in the United \nStates.\n  Her first remarks were to thank the United States for helping to free \nthe Iraqi people and making an opportunity available to them to govern \nthemselves. She said that the main\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nword in Iraq today is the word ``democracy,'' that is what the Iraqi \npeople are talking about, and they are going to be ready and, indeed, \ndemand that when June 30 comes, they will be able to take control of \nthe political affairs of their country.\n  This is something they have been waiting for a long time to \naccomplish, and they are very grateful to the United States for making \nthis opportunity available to them. She made the point that democracy \ndied in Iraq 35 years ago; that under the repressive regime of Saddam \nHussein there was no freedom of expression, no ability to debate, \npolitical parties ceased to exist; he would not permit anyone to \nquestion him. But today she talked about the 150 new newspapers that \nhave cropped up, debating all sorts of issues in the country, and the \nopportunity for people to present their views on free television.\n  She said throughout the country of Iraq today there is free and \nrobust debate about the political future of their country; that \npolitical parties have grown, and the ability of Iraqis to govern \nthemselves, in her view, is not in doubt.\n  She made the point the security problems the United States and \ncoalition and Iraqi forces are facing today, while grave and serious, \nare not representative of any kind of popular uprising in the country \nas a whole; that in her view they represent a very thin slice of the \nIraqi population, and Americans should not view this as the view of the \nIraqi people in general. Indeed, the opposite would be the case; that \nmost Iraqis support the presence of the United States, appreciate what \nwe are trying to accomplish with the help of the Iraqi people there, \nand that this relatively small group of disaffected people does not \nrepresent the view of the Iraqi people as a whole.\n  In fact, her quotation, almost exactly--and she repeated it three \ntimes--was that the vast, vast, vast majority of the Iraqi people \nreject this point of view and support the presence of the United States \nand assistance to the people.\n  It was a remarkable performance by the Ambassador-designate who told \nus about the condition in which they found the Embassy when they came \nin and simply reminded us that we have a lot to do in supporting this \nnew government and helping it to be a viable force, not just in the \ncountry of Iraq itself but in representing itself to the rest of the \nworld, and most especially in the United States.\n  I was also moved by the strong statement made by my colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain, who had talked about his experience in Iraq \nand his experiences elsewhere in admonishing all of us to remember that \nthere is no alternative to victory in this war on terror, and \nespecially in the front we are conducting in Iraq today. Defeat is not \nan option. The consequences of defeat for the United States and the \nWest and our position in the war on terror would be catastrophic. Our \ncredibility would be lost, and that credibility is our primary asset in \ndealing with terrorism around the world.\n  Our ability to affect the future with respect to the terrorist threat \nwould be diminished significantly if we were not to persevere and \ncomplete our job in Iraq. This means, as Senator McCain pointed out, we \nwill have to acknowledge the hard reality that it will not be easy, and \nit will not be cheap. There will be casualties, and it is going to take \na long time.\n  Remember President Bush first told us that when this war commenced, \nand in his State of the Union speech, pointing out that it would be a \nlong, difficult struggle and that the American people would have to be \nprepared to persevere. The American people have persevered.\n\n  We are at a crossroads now. There are some among us who are raising \nquestions. That, in and of itself, in a democracy is not only fine but \ncritically important. The question is the tone of the criticism and the \neffect that it can have both on the morale of the Iraqi people and our \nown troops fighting there, as well as the message it conveys to the \nenemy terrorists. If the criticism is constructive and goes to \nquestions of how we should be doing what we are doing, it could be very \nbeneficial.\n  If, on the other hand, it suggests political motives for the \nPresident and the administration, suggests there is no support for the \nposition we are taking, and suggests what little support there might be \nwill erode to the point that we will not be able to sustain our \nposition, then people begin to wonder. The people of Iraq who are still \nnot secure, who are still fearful there are those among them who would \ncause them harm if they only had a chance, including the old Baathists, \nare going to be less secure and bold going forth with their new \ngovernment and less willing to continue to support the United States.\n  Our allies, the same message. Our troops would wonder, Is this a \nfight worth fighting; their families wondering, Is it worth my son or \ndaughter dying? Of course, the message to the terrorists, If we wait \nthese people out, these Americans have shown that they are willing to \nonly fight for so long, and then they will cut and run if we make life \ndifficult enough for them.\n  This is a message we cannot afford to send. It is important the tone \nof the debate, the content of debate, the motives ascribed to leaders \nin this country all take into account the way the message is portrayed \nelsewhere, the way it will be played on Arab television, for example. \nThese are not small matters. These are matters of fine-tuning a debate \nin the United States so that it will not adversely affect the way we \ncan conduct the war on terror generally, and on operations in Iraq \nspecifically.\n  I think sometimes we fail to take into account how our words are \nlistened to all over the world. I know as a Senator, it is still hard \nfor me to appreciate, knowing who I am and where I came from, that when \nI speak, my words may have pretty significant consequences to an awful \nlot of people. It is hard for me to remember that. I don't look at \nmyself any differently than I did when I was a lawyer 20 years ago. But \nwe in the United States tend to forget that others view us very \nclosely, and everything we do they pay a lot of attention. So the words \nwe speak in this Chamber and in other forums are going to be parsed \nvery carefully by others around the world for meaning.\n  When those words suggest either there is a lack of support in this \ncountry for the policies being pursued, that were overwhelmingly \nsupported by the Members of this body, the House of Representatives \nand, of course, the administration, when there is a suggestion that \nthere is a lack of support for that policy or that support is eroding, \nand if terrorists continue to ply their trade they can undercut us to \nthe point we will cut and run, when the words are interpreted in that \nway, then they undercut not just our policy but the people who are \nfighting for us in that region, and the people on whose behalf we are \ntrying to help secure freedom.\n  That is why it is so important for us to conduct this debate in a \ncivil and measured and responsible way. I urge all of my colleagues to \ntry to approach the subject in that fashion. I criticize no one for \nraising questions or even for criticizing the President or the \nadministration. It is perfectly appropriate in our country to do that. \nThere is certainly no right or wrong in exactly how we are approaching \neach of these issues. The decisions are made in the fog of war. Many of \nthem are somewhat gray.\n\n  I would only ask my colleagues, as we conduct this debate, that we \nconsider the tone so it doesn't have an adverse effect on the actual \nwar on terrorism itself.\n  As my colleague, Senator McCain, said, defeat is not an option. It is \nimpossible, given our military power, for us to lose the war in Iraq, \nbut it would be possible to lose that war at home if we don't conduct \nourselves in the same fashion and same spirit we ask our troops to \nconduct themselves when they are fighting for us abroad. That is an \nimportant responsibility we take on.\n  When I listened to the words of the Ambassador-designate today about \nlooking at the future of her country with such optimism and such \ncourage and such hope, it rekindled in me the desire to come and talk \nabout the fact that we have to do our part. Our troops are doing their \npart. We have to do our part as well. We need to make wise decisions. \nWe need to support the troops. We need to support the administration\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\nto the absolute extent we can. Our partisanship should stop at the \nshores, as it historically has.\n  I know in an election year it is going to be difficult for us to \ndiscipline ourselves in that way, but we have to do so because of the \nstakes involved.\n  I find after 1 year of the liberation of the Iraqi people, great \ncause for hope.\n  We should not minimize the difficulties that lie ahead. I think we \nneed to be extraordinarily candid about the problems we will continue \nto confront. But at the end of the day, if we persevere as we know we \ncan, if we have the same resolve and strength of character our young \nmen and women do who are there fighting right now--and you only have to \ntalk to a few to be imbued with their spirit--then I have no doubt the \nUnited States will stay strong, our great ally Great Britain will do \nthe same, as well as other members of the coalition that have assisted \nus so strongly; and in persevering and staying the course, we will be \nable, No. 1, to turn over political control of Iraq on June 30 to the \nIraqi Governing Council and, No. 2, we will be able to stay for as long \nas it takes to help secure that country.\n  Just as we have had the opportunity to govern ourselves, the Iraqi \npeople will have the same opportunity. That will, in turn, show others \nin the region how they too can govern themselves democratically, they \ncan live in an environment of freedom, and that is infectious and \nprobably would do more than any other single thing to ensure that \nregion of the world can enjoy peace, and that peace can even come to \nthe troubled relationship between the Palestinians and Israelis. It is \nsomething to be hoped for. It all depends on our ability right now to \npersevere, stay the course, and to maintain the hope and optimism we \nhad when we began this operation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the Senate will soon enter a period of \nrecess prior to the Easter holidays. I am a bit like Samuel Adams, I \nbelieve it was, who said that he could listen to anyone speak of his \nreligion. I am that way. I can listen to a Methodist, to a Baptist, a \nPresbyterian, Seventh-Day Adventist, a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest. \nI have no problem in listening and paying rapt attention to anyone \nspeak of his or her religion.\n  My own religion is the Christian religion. I grew up in a Christian \nhome. I was raised by an aunt and uncle who took me after my mother \ndied during the influenza epidemic in 1918. I was a bit less than 1 \nyear old at that time, my mother having died on Armistice Day 1918. I \nwas brought to West Virginia and grew up in the coal camps of southern \nWest Virginia.\n  At this point I should say that the woman who raised me was a very \nreligious woman. She did not go around wearing religion on her sleeve \nor claiming to be better than anybody else; she simply was a kindly \nlady who believed in religion, the old-time religion. She practiced it \nand many times I used to hear her pray after the old kerosene lamp was \nout and the rooms were dark. I heard her praying on her knees. I could \nsay that my uncle, Titus Dalton Byrd, was also a God-fearing man who \ndied when he was 82 years of age, a coal miner. He never owed any man a \npenny when he passed away from this Earthly life. I never heard him \nutter the Lord's name in vain in all the years that I lived with him. \nSo that is the way it was. They were poor folks.\n  I recently heard someone say--I believe one of the Democratic \nPresidential candidates--that he was the first in his family to attend \ncollege, or some such thing. Well, I am the first in my family to have \ngone to second grade in school. About the only books that were in my \nhome when I grew up as a child were a Montgomery Ward catalog, perhaps \na Sears Roebuck catalog, and the Holy Bible, King James Version. The \nman who raised me could read the Bible. I do not know how he learned to \nread, but nevertheless there was a Bible in that home, and here is the \nBible on my desk at this moment.\n  Now, why do I have this Bible here? Well, Easter is coming on and I \nam going to read from chapter 20 of the book of Saint John. I will not \nmake any comment on the Scriptures, except to read very briefly from \nthem. I do not claim to be a minister. I am not a minister, but I am \nfortunate enough to have the gift of being able to read, and as we \napproach Easter, I think it appropriate to read into the Record the \nfollowing excerpts from the book of Saint John, chapter 20:\n\n       The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when \n     it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone \n     taken away from the sepulchre.\n       Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the \n     other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They \n     have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know \n     not where they have laid him.\n       Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and \n     came to the sepulchre.\n       So they ran both together: and the other disciple did \n     outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.\n       And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes \n     lying; yet went he not in.\n       Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the \n     sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,\n       And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the \n     linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\n       Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to \n     the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.\n       For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise \n     again from the dead.\n       Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.\n       But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she \n     wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,\n       And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, \n     and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n       And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith \n     unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know \n     not where they have laid him.\n       And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and \n     saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\n       Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest \n     thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, \n     Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast \n     laid him, and I will take him away.\n       Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith \n     unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.\n       Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet \n     ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto \n     them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my \n     God, and your God.\n\n  Easter Sunday, Mr. President, is the holiest day on the Christian \ncalendar. On that first Easter Sunday, so long ago, a momentous gift \nwas given to the world. It was a promise of life everlasting, of \nimmortality.\n\n       For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten \n     Son,\n       That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have \n     everlasting life.\n\n  It is easy to overlook the magnitude of this great but invisible gift \namid all the brightly colored cellophane and foil-covered chocolates, \namid the soft nests of translucent plastic grass nestled around sugary \njelly beans and luminous dyed eggs. The talents of advertising agencies \nand merchandisers effect a powerful sleight of hand, drawing our focus \naway from the moving story of Easter with the dazzle of sugary \ncommercial products that have been divorced from their historical and \nreligious meaning.\n  It is difficult to ponder the end of life and death while surrounded \nby a quickening Earth under a warm Sun. These lovely spring days are \neach a small gift, too. In West Virginia, the trees are just in bud, \nallowing the warmth of the Sun to reach all the way into the shadiest \nhollows. In Washington, the 92nd annual Cherry Blossom Festival is \nunderway, as the cherry trees along the tidal basin and the Jefferson \nMemorial create a lovely vista of blossoms.\n\n     Loveliest of trees, the cherry now\n     Is hung with bloom along the bough,\n     And stands about the woodland ride\n     Wearing white for Easter.\n\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\n\n  So said Alfred Edward Housman, who was a Shropshire lad.\n  But the promise of rebirth and gift of new life everlasting are the \ngreat prize, hard won from the tragedy of betrayal and a torturous, \nprotracted death.\n  Over the span of a week, from His entry into Jerusalem on Palm \nSunday, and the final miracle of the resurrection and ascension on \nEaster Sunday, an epic unfolds. Christ's pain and suffering, so nobly \nborne, gave no hint of the miracle to come.\n  On this Easter Sunday, I offer my hopes to our men and women serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan and all the dangerous places in the world. Our \nhearts, our hopes, and our thoughts are with you, and may the Lord \nprotect you and give you the strength to see you through these \ndifficult times.\n  As William Cowper wrote:\n\n       It is the Lord who rises with feeling in his wings. When \n     comforts are declining, he grants the soul again a season of \n     clear shining to cheer it after rain.\n\n  I would like to think as we used to back in my younger days of the \nwords spoken by William Jennings Bryan. The words that come from his \nproof of immortality:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the \n     earth the soul of man, made in the image of his Creator?\n       If he stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered \n     blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of \n     another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope of the \n     sons of men when the frosts of winter come?\n       If matter, mute and inanimate, tho' changed by the forces \n     of nature into a multitude of forms, can never die, will the \n     imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a \n     brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay?\n       No. I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent \n     prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted \n     not a single atom in all His creation, has made provision for \n     a future life in which man's universal longing for \n     immortality will find his realization.\n       I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we live \n     today.\n\n  I also enjoy reading from William Jennings Bryan's ``The Prince of \nPeace,'' reading what he said about the grain of wheat.\n  He said:\n\n       In Cairo I secured a few grains of wheat that had slumbered \n     for more than thirty centuries in an Egyptian tomb. As I \n     looked at them, this thought came into my mind: If one of \n     those grains had been planted on the banks of the Nile the \n     year after it grew, and all of its lineal descendents had \n     been planted and replanted from that time until now, its \n     progeny would today be sufficiently numerous to feed the \n     teeming millions of the world. An unbroken chain of life \n     connects the earliest grains of wheat with the grains that we \n     sew and reap. There is in the grain of wheat an invisible \n     something which has the power to discard the body that we \n     see, and from earth and air fashion a new body so much like \n     the old one that we can not tell the one from the other. If \n     this invisible germ of life in the grain of wheat can thus \n     pass unimpaired through three thousand resurrections, I shall \n     not doubt that my soul has power to clothe itself with a body \n     suited to its new existence when this earthly frame has \n     crumbled into dust.\n\n  I thought a couple of these reminiscences from William Jennings Bryan \nand a few passages of the Scriptures might be appropriate on this April \nafternoon as we close.\n  I finally end with the words of Julian S. Cutler, whose poem, \n``Through the Year,'' reminds us the Lord is with us in all the seasons \nof the year and in all the seasons of our lives. And at Easter, we \ncelebrate God's promise that we may be with Him in life everlasting:\n\n     God be with you in the Springtime\n     When the violets unfold,\n     And the buttercups and cowslips\n     Fill the fields with yellow gold;\n     In the time of apple blossoms,\n     When the happy bluebirds sing,\n     Filling all the world with gladness--\n     God be with you in the Spring!\n\n     God be with you in the Summer,\n     When the sweet June roses blow,\n     When the bobolinks are laughing\n     And the brooks with music flow;\n     When the fields are white with daisies\n     And the days are glad and long--\n     God be with you in the Summer,\n     Filling all your world with song.\n\n     God be with you in the Autumn,\n     When the birds and flowers have fled,\n     And along the woodland pathways\n     Leaves are falling, gold and red;\n     When the Summer lies behind you,\n     In the evening of the year--\n     God be with you in the Autumn,\n     Then to fill your heart with cheer.\n\n     God be with you in the Winter,\n     When the snow lied deep and white,\n     When the sleeping fields are silent\n     And the stars gleam cold and bright.\n     When the hand and heart are tired\n     With life's long and weary quest--\n     God be with you Erma, in the Winter,\n     Just to guide you into rest.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4002-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4002-S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASBESTOS LITIGATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Byrd leaves the floor, I \nwish him a joyous Easter and thank him for reminding us of what Easter \nis all about.\n  When Members reflect on the diversity of the religious views of our \nconstituents--some are Protestant, some are Catholic; some folks in \nWest Virginia or Delaware are Jewish, as some here are. We have folks \nin our States who are Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist. There is a wide \ndiversity of religions in this country. It is a sign of our strength, \nnot a sign of weakness.\n  We are reminded that one of the reasons we are strong is because we \nrespect the right of everyone to worship God as he or she sees fit, or \nto not worship at all.\n  Ironically, whether we happen to be Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, or \nsome other faith, it is interesting how often we agree on a premise, a \nprinciple laid out in the New Testament.\n  I don't think Senator Byrd read it today, but we call it the Golden \nRule. The idea there is to treat other people the way we want to be \ntreated. I am not enough of a religious scholar to know where that \nscripture appears in the New Testament. It may also appear in the Koran \nor the Torah or any other religious text of other religions around the \nworld. But my guess is it does say, in so many words, we should treat \nother people the way we want to be treated.\n  I want to talk about that principle and how it might apply to what we \ndo in the Senate. I apply it to an issue we may address as soon as we \nreturn April 19.\n  Majority Leader Frist has said, when we return immediately following \nthe Easter holiday, the first issue of any consequence he would like \nfor us to address deals with asbestos litigation. This is something I \nhave worked on, along with many of my colleagues, for most of the 3 \nyears I have been in the Senate.\n  My first year in the Senate, about a year or two before the Presiding \nOfficer arrived, I remember visiting Senator Byrd. I asked how this \nplace works and he gave me some pointers. He was a great mentor then \nand he continues to be a great mentor today.\n  Among the pieces of advice he gave me: When people want to talk to \nyou, talk to them.\n  It turns out one of the calls my first year was from a fellow named \nFrank Macher. He is somebody my wife introduced me to. She worked at \nDuPont at the time and had dealings with Ford Motor Company. Frank \nMacher was a fairly senior official at Ford Motor Company. He retired \nfrom Ford Motor Company.\n  I lost track of him for a few years and he called to say he had \nassumed a new position with a new company. I asked, ``Who is that,'' \nand he told me he had just become the CEO of a company called Federal-\nMogul. I was not familiar with the company. He said I was probably \nfamiliar with some of their products. They manufacture or sell and \ndistribute, among other things, Champion spark plugs and a variety of \nother products used in the automotive industry.\n  He said: Sometime when I come to Washington in my new role I want to \nbe able to come and see you; it is good to renew a friendship. I said: \nCome on over.\n  Lo and behold, a month or so later he came. We had a great meeting. \nIt was a good moment. He headed for home. I said: If you are back this \nway, let us know.\n  After 6 months or so, he called me again. I said: How are you doing?\n  He said: We have a problem.\n  I asked: What is that?\n  He said that somewhere along the line, before he became CEO of this \ncompany, Federal-Mogul had acquired a subsidiary, I think it was a \nBritish subsidiary, for a period of time, not a long period of time but \nmaybe a couple of years.\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\n  He said because of that relationship--they acquired it and sold it \nwithin a couple of years--his company, Federal-Mogul, had been exposed \nto all kinds of litigation with respect to asbestos because this \nsubsidiary that they owned years ago for a short period of time had a \nposition or presence in the asbestos business.\n  We met and talked. I said: Since you live in Michigan, maybe you \nought to spend some time with your Senators. I think he visited his two \nSenators. I suggested he visit with the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee at the time, Senator Leahy. He was good enough to \nmeet with Frank Macher.\n  What proceeded from there, about a year or so later, is Federal-Mogul \nended up going into bankruptcy. Ultimately, it was reorganized and \nemerged from bankruptcy.\n  I don't know the effect on the employees within that company. I do \nknow this: The shareholders in the company lost, as far as I \nunderstand, the entire value of their shares. The employees of the \ncompany who had money in a 401(k) plan that included company stock lost \nthe value of that company stock. The pensioners from Federal-Mogul who \nwere retired, or trying to retire, probably lost some of their pensions \nas the company went in and out of bankruptcy.\n  We know what happens all too clearly--in fact, I am reminded of \nlegislation we worked on today--to employees or retirees of companies \nthat go into bankruptcy and how that can adversely affect the size and \namount of their pensions.\n  In any event, that experience with Frank Macher and with Federal-\nMogul acquainted me with an issue that, frankly, I had not thought \nabout for one minute before I came to the Senate.\n  Fast forward for several months, subsequent to that initial meeting \nwith Frank Macher, a second meeting with Frank Macher from Federal-\nMogul, to a conversation, a visit I had from an attorney from the west \ncoast. I can't recall his name off the top of my head, but he was a \ngood person, a trial lawyer. His particular specialty was representing \npeople who were afflicted with mesothelioma. Apparently, mesothelioma \nis something folks contract from exposure to asbestos. There is no \nknown cure. There are several thousand people who will die each year \nfrom that disease.\n  The attorney who came to meet with me talked about his clients. Those \nwho were fatally stricken and soon to die, and how in many instances \nthey or their families were not receiving the compensation for what \nthey were going through and for the loss of life.\n  He said the current system we have is broken. It ought to be fixed. \nIn too many cases, the way the current system works is that the people \nwho may have mesothelioma or a serious asbestos-related disease, lung \ncancer that has grown from exposure to asbestos, these individuals or \ntheir families are receiving pennies on the dollar for what they should \nbe getting for pain and suffering and loss of life.\n  Meanwhile, in too many instances people who may have had exposure to \nasbestos but are not impaired, are not sick, are taking away, siphoning \noff, some of the money that ought to be going to people who are \nimpaired or seriously ill and may ultimately die. Instead of the money \nactually getting to the victims, I am told maybe half goes to other \nparties in transaction costs.\n  That is not a good situation. It is not a healthy situation. Almost \neverybody here familiar with this situation would say if there is \nanything we ought to fix this year, this is near the top of the list. \nWe should fix it. We can fix it.\n  I have been here about 3 years and for most of those 3 years people \non both sides of the aisle have been trying to do that. Progress has \nbeen made. The Judiciary Committee marked up and reported out a bill \nlast year, a bill that has been criticized by a number of people, a \nnumber of parties that are involved in this issue. Nonetheless, it \nrepresents an effort to try to address a situation we all know needs to \nbe addressed.\n  The bill was reported out of committee last year. Since November of \nlast year, there have been a series of negotiations that have taken \nplace involving, among others, organized labor, as a proxy for the \nvictims and the workers, insurers, manufacturers; and, from time to \ntime, the trial lawyers have been involved in those discussions. Those \ndiscussions were intended to try to bridge the differences that \nseparated them and us from legislating successfully on this issue and \nestablishing a procedure and funding to make sure people who are sick \nand dying get the help they need, and folks who are not sick but may \nhave had an exposure have their health monitored, and if they do become \nsick, they get the financial help they and their families need, to try \nto reduce the transaction costs so it becomes pretty much a no-fault \nsystem.\n  While some progress has been made, there is more work to be done. I \nspoke yesterday with Majority Leader Frist, whom I respect very much. \nIn fact, the conversation I had with him yesterday is similar to one I \nhad with him the week before, and I think probably the week before and \nthe month before that. I have suggested to him, in strong terms, that \nas we return from the recess that begins tomorrow--and we return in \nabout 10 days--that the first bill we take up be legislation about \nwhich there has emerged a bipartisan consensus.\n  Again, it involves legal issues, but the first bill that we take up, \nin my judgment, should not be asbestos litigation reform. It should be \nclass action reform. We have debated it to some extent on the floor. We \nhad a cloture vote on class action legislation last year. We ended up \none vote short of the 60 we needed to proceed to the bill and take it \nup.\n  In the time since then, three other Democratic Senators have stepped \nforward and been part of a negotiation with our friends on the other \nside--negotiations in which Senator Kohl and I participated. I think \nout of those negotiations has emerged a significant improvement to the \nclass action bill that came to the floor last year and is a path \nforward to enacting that legislation in the Senate the week after we \nreturn from this upcoming recess. We should take it up. We should \nprovide a week to debate it. We should let it be like a bottle of wine, \nto breathe on the floor, if you will, to give Members the opportunity \nto offer amendments, hopefully, mostly germane. And I know there are \nsome Members who have constructive amendments to offer. There are \nothers who would like to offer some nongermane amendments, and I hope \nthe other side would allow some votes on those nongermane amendments.\n  After a reasonable period of debate, we ought to be able to go to \nfinal passage and send that bill to the House of Representatives.\n  I do not believe we are at that point yet with respect to asbestos \nlitigation. I urge Senator Frist not to lead with asbestos litigation \non April 19. Progress has been made in recent months, particularly \nsince November, in a negotiation begun by Senator Specter and overseen \nby Judge Becker. They have been successful in getting organized labor, \ninsurers, and manufacturers to agree on the administrative structure: \nWhere should this fund be housed? How should people go about applying \nfor money if they are sick or impaired? How do they go about, in a \npractical way, getting the help they need?\n  It has been a very constructive negotiation. Out of that negotiation \nI think a sense of trust and confidence has grown among the parties who \nhave been negotiating under the auspices of Judge Becker and Senator \nSpecter.\n  Previously, when the legislation was voted on, debated in committee, \namong the very positive things the committee did was to agree on \nmedical criteria. It is a tough issue. They reached consensus. We have \nthe medical criteria agreed to by the committee. We have agreement on \nthe administrative issues, which is important. My hope is they will be \nagreed to by the Senate.\n  But there are other issues that still remain to be addressed, and \nthey need to be resolved. I am not convinced, by a long shot, that our \nbest bet and our smartest course is to try to resolve all of these \nissues, and a number of others yet to be resolved, on the Senate floor.\n  Let me mention a few. How much money should each individual victim \nreceive? How much money should be contributed to the fund? How much \nfrom the insurers? How much from the manufacturers? How do we treat the \nseveral hundred thousand current claims--more than a quarter of \na million current claims? What kind of\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\nscreening should be provided for workers? How do we treat railroad \nemployees who are covered under a unique compensation system of their \nown? What happens if our assumptions are wrong, and the fund runs out \nof money 10 or 15 years from now, and people are still getting sick \nfrom their exposure to asbestos?\n\n  Those are big issues. Those are important issues. They are central to \nthe overall premise of this bill. And despite the best efforts of all \nsides thus far, we do not have consensus on them, at least we do not \nhave consensus as yet. That certainly does not mean we ought to give \nup, not by a long shot; quite the contrary.\n  Senator Frist has said the bill he has recently introduced is not a \ntake-it-or-leave-it offer. He said he is willing to work with Senators \non both sides to improve the bill and to improve its ultimate chances \nof passage.\n  I would say again to Senator Frist, I am anxious to be part of this \nsolution. I know others on my side, and certainly on the Republican \nside, are anxious to be a part of that solution. I would call on him \ntoday to join with Senator Daschle in a bipartisan effort where they \nconvene, under their auspices a negotiation that includes, among \nothers, organized labor, the insurers, the manufacturers, and perhaps \nthe trial bar, and get people in a room who can make some decisions, \nand to keep them there until most of the issues I have just gone \nthrough--at least those--are, for the most part, worked out to the \nsatisfaction of the parties.\n  We hear from organized labor that more money needs to go into the \nfund. And $114 billion--now I think a lot of people are suggesting that \nis enough. It may be; it may not. On the other hand, organized labor \nsays a number closer to what was reported out of committee--I think \n$153 billion--might be enough. But whether the number is $114 billion \nor $154 billion, there is some point there between $114 billion and \n$154 billion where we ought to be able to agree that those dollars--\nwhether it is $124 billion, $134 billion, $144 billion--that those \ndollars are likely to be sufficient to meet the legitimate claims that \nare going to be submitted for people who are sick from asbestos \nexposure.\n  And there needs to be a provision that says: If somewhere down the \nline the fund does run out of money, there has to be a way for people \nwho are still getting sick from their asbestos exposure to have a way \nto be compensated.\n  Some have suggested that maybe the way to do it is to let those \npeople back into the tort system. I would suggest not this tort system, \nthrough State and local courts, but through the Federal court. So if \nthe money ever runs out--and I hope it doesn't--people would have the \nopportunity to come back into the tort system.\n  If we take up asbestos litigation legislation that has been \nintroduced by Senator Frist on April 19 and immediately ask for a \ncloture vote, we are going to get an objection from this side for \nmoving forward at that time. We accomplish nothing. We could take up \nclass action on the same date. We have the votes to go to the bill. We \nhave a bipartisan consensus to do something to make sure that when \nnational class action litigation is brought of a national scope, of a \nsufficient financial magnitude, that it would be heard in a Federal \ncourt, particularly when the defendant is from a different State than \nthe plaintiffs. We can pass that bill. We ought to. We should send it \nto the House and hopefully they will find favor with it. I believe they \nwill.\n  But if we take up asbestos litigation at the beginning of the next \nperiod in which we are working in the Senate, we are going to end up \nmaking people angry, turning people off, raising further the sense of \ndistrust that permeates this body. We will make no progress. My fear is \nwe may poison the well for our ability to pass a class action bill that \nshould move through here pretty easily.\n  Again, I say to Senator Frist, reach out to Senator Daschle, to my \nleader, engage him earnestly, the two of you pulling interested parties \ntogether. I am not kidding, get them in a room and get them to stay \nthere. If some of us can be in the room, fine. Some of our staffs that \nare very knowledgeable on these issues and want to see this legislation \nworked out, get them in the room, too, to keep the negotiating parties \nhonest and to keep them moving. But let's put some focus on getting \nthat negotiation done so the issues around the amount of money we need \nand where it should come from, what to do with those hundreds of \nthousands of claims that are pending, so that we can resolve those \nissues before we bring the bill to the floor.\n  Senator Cornyn has been here a little over a year now. I have been \nhere a little bit longer than he. We both have been here long enough to \nsee bills come to the floor that are literally worked out on the floor \nbecause the committee was not able to do it, maybe it was not possible, \nand we ended up writing the bill on the floor. Sometimes that works \nout. Sometimes it doesn't.\n  If we try to write the asbestos litigation on the floor on April 19, \nwe are not going to work it out. There is value in setting a date \ncertain when we are going to take up this bill. I don't have a calendar \nwith me, but I think that Monday, May 17, is the last week we will be \nhere before the Memorial Day recess. I believe that is the date we \nshould set. I urge us then to take up asbestos litigation legislation \nthe week of Monday, May 17.\n  Maybe if we have had a chance to already do good work on class action \nlegislation in April, that will be helpful in dispelling some of the \ndistrust and mistrust that characterizes so much of what goes on in \nthis body and in this building these days.\n  A lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans--going back to the adage \nwe talked about in the New Testament--understand that we ought to be \ntrying to treat other people the way we would like to be treated, \nwhether they happen to be folks whose health is impaired, maybe their \nlives are threatened because of asbestos exposure, or maybe they are a \ncompany that is like Federal-Mogul that went bankrupt or an insurance \ncompany, some of which are, frankly, pretty close to the edge of \nremaining solvent because of their exposure over this issue. Maybe we \ncan put ourselves in the shoes of all those different parties and make \nsure that whether you happen to be impaired, injured, or you happen to \nbe an insurer or an employer, that we try to treat them with a \ncompromise bill where we treat them the way we would want to be treated \nourselves.\n\n  It is critically important that people who are sick and dying get the \nhelp they need now and that it be generous. It is important that people \nwho may have had an exposure, who become sick from asbestos exposure, \nif they become sick, they get the help they need, that it is fair, \ngenerous, and prompt. It is also important that people who may have had \nan exposure but are not sick, as they go forward in time, their health \nbe monitored, and that, frankly, somebody pay for that monitoring for \nthem, and that this fund we would create under this legislation pay for \nmedical monitoring costs so if those folks become impaired or develop \nthe symptoms that have costs the lives of too many people, they can get \nthe help they need and get it promptly.\n  By the same token, we have seen a whole lot of companies go under. \nThey have gone into bankruptcy. Some will say: Well, they will \nreorganize. Everything is fine.\n  It is not. It is not fair to the people whose 401(k)s are in company \nstock, if it is gone. It is not fair to the retirees whose pensions \nhave been reduced. It is not fair to the employees who may have lost \ntheir jobs at those companies. It is not fair to the shareholders who \nhave lost almost everything they invested in those companies.\n  Finally, as we bemoan the loss of manufacturing jobs--and we have \nseen literally millions more manufacturing jobs lost just in the last 3 \nor 4 years--it is important for us to create an environment in this \ncountry where manufacturing jobs can continue to exist and we don't \nlose even more jobs. I am convinced there are a couple things we could \ndo to help reverse this trend, or at least stop it in its tracks. One \nof them is to provide a legal system, a system of justice that makes \nsure when people are hurt, they are compensated and they are \ncompensated fairly; that the folks who damage them, who have hurt them, \npay their fair share.\n  It is also important as we do that work that we do it in a way that \nis fair and does not make our country an even less attractive place for \ncompanies to be in business, manufacturing businesses especially. We \nhave to be smart enough to figure this one out.\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n  We need to set a deadline for action, action to take the bill up \nhere. In the 3 or 4 weeks before we do that, there needs to be \ncontinued negotiation. My view is that negotiation should be fostered \nand overseen by the majority and minority leaders. We don't need to \ntake this up and do this on April 19. We need to take it up and we need \nto change it and improve it. We need to infuse that legislation with \nmore consensus that may grow out of the negotiations I am encouraging. \nIf that happens, we can pass a bill Delaware and Texas can be proud of. \nIt will really put truth to the notion that we treated other people the \nway we want to be treated, whether they happened to be an asbestos \nvictim or the company that is required to pay for their treatment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next 30 minutes or so, I have a \ncouple of statements I want to make on important issues and, shortly \nthereafter, we will be adjourning for our recess.\n  I had the opportunity to hear most of the comments from the Senator \nfrom Delaware, who, as he knows, I respect tremendously on a whole \nrange of issues, but in particular his commitment to doggedly working \nthese issues of class action and asbestos, issues that are so important \nto the American people. He and I have had many discussions in terms of \napproach and how best to address the issues. It is frustrating for me, \nobviously, in many ways in trying to schedule a lot of legislation that \nis important for us to have to stop or to switch and sequence these \npieces of legislation. Two of those pieces he mentioned--the asbestos \nlegislation and class action--are two that I hope we can address. \nAlthough it is difficult on the floor of the Senate to fully address \nthem, it is harder in committee. Both have been addressed in committee. \nThe issues on each have taken a different course.\n  Although no final decision is made, part of the reason for \nintroducing a revised asbestos bill last night was that people who care \nvery much about this issue--the 100 people in this body, and others who \nwill be impacted by this significant piece of legislation--will be able \nto read a current document that I think is improved in many ways. \nOthers may disagree, and that is why we need time to look at it and \ndiscuss it. But in the area of administration of the bill itself, there \nhas been a lot more discussion since the asbestos bill was marked up in \ncommittee. Those have been incorporated. There have been other changes \nwe need to debate and discuss. We can argue about the most appropriate \nforum. You can take it back through committee, or you can do it on the \nfloor of the Senate, where everybody can be involved.\n  Since we have given it one good shot through committee, I think it is \ntime to take the improved product, put it out there, which is what we \nhave done, and let people digest it and discuss it, starting today. \nThat was the whole purpose of introducing it. Then we will see over the \nnext 8 to 10 days. Hopefully, people will be getting together. I will \nmake that commitment to the Senator. He has appealed to common sense \nthat we get together on both sides of the aisle with leadership. I will \ndo that.\n  I am confident that in the end, we are going to be able to work \nthrough a lot of these issues. He enumerated the issues that were \naddressed in committee, which made it a good bill, and the issues that \nneed to be addressed, whether it is the size of the fund or payout of \nthe fund, the level 7 type criteria, a whole range of things I think we \ncan address.\n  We have addressed class action on the floor of the Senate. It was \ndebated and we had good debate here and in committee. There it was \nblocked. We had a filibuster here. We can, again, argue why there was a \nfilibuster, but it was filibustered. We tried it. Since then, we have \ngone back and worked together and have improved the product. My \nchallenge is to bring that improved product, where there are probably \nmore than 60 votes, to the floor, but do it in a way that we can stay \non the bill, have germane amendments, improve the bill, debate it, and \nvote on it.\n\n  My problem, as my distinguished colleague knows, is that nobody can \nmake that commitment. He and others have seen, without that sort of \ncommitment, what happens. It has happened with the FSC/ETI JOBS bill, \nwhich we will be talking about shortly. We spent 3 weeks on that, and \nwe would start and stop and start and stop, starting with 75 amendments \non one side, and we may have had 75 on our side, I don't know. But it \nhas been overwhelming. Now we are 3 weeks into that bill, and finally \nwe are going to come to some agreement on a universe of amendments. On \nclass action, we were unsuccessful. So I will shift to asbestos and see \nwhat we can do there by working together. Then we will come back to \nclass action. I heard loud and clear the rationale of why we can't \nconsider class action now, so I have decided another course. There is \nno agreement to address it yet. I express my willingness to work on \nthese issues.\n  Even though it is a very partisan environment and we have campaigns \nand it is an election year, if I look at what has been filibustered--\nthe JOBS Act, Welfare Reform Act, energy, medical liability, FSC/ETI, \nwhich were all filibustered--you almost say we are not going to get \nanything done. But we can. We can make progress on the JOBS bill here \nshortly, and I think also on these important tort-type issues where we \nknow we can do better and we can make progress as well.\n  So I thank my colleague. I don't think there is anybody in the body \nwho has worked harder on these issues on a personal basis to try to \nmove America forward on the issues, recognizing there has to be give \nand take. Nobody has the perfect answer. My purpose last night was to \nintroduce a product we can look at and debate and approve. We have that \nopportunity, over the next 8, 9, or 10 days, to do that.\n  We need to get everybody to the table, not excluding anybody, and to \nreally make it work. There is no way to pass a bill right now unless we \nget people to the table. Unless we are going to get more than 60 \npeople--but even 60 people isn't much--you have to have people as \ncommitted as the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment on a public health issue. I know \npeople say every time I get up, I am taking a health issue. It is \nimportant to me personally, but also to the American people, to address \nissues that don't necessarily make it to the front page every day which \nultimately impact people's lives, some of whom don't have anybody \nspeaking for them directly all the time. But also there are so many \nissues in health care that, if you shine a spotlight on them, people \nsay, that makes sense; let's do something about that.\n  One such issue centers on the fact that this week is National Public \nHealth Week. It started in the early part of the week and runs \nthroughout the week. It is a week during which health care \nprofessionals and the public at large, hopefully, take the time to \nreflect on the successes of our public health system and examine ways \nit can be improved.\n  As a physician and one who has spent 20 years in the field of health, \nI have always admired our public health system. I think our country has \nunderinvested in it in the last 10 or 15 years. But I think as people \nlook at issues like bioterrorism, the threat of biological agents, and \nchemical agents, and emerging infectious diseases such as SARS, HIV/\nAIDS, people realize that the frontline of defense is our public health \nsystem. With regard to Public Health Week, the American Public Health \nAssociation has focused its efforts this year on raising public \nawareness about health disparities, along with a short list of issues. \nI want to focus my remarks on the health disparities.\n  Each day over the course of this week, the national association has \nconvened a townhall discussion in a different city to highlight an \naspect of this topic of health disparities. People say: What is Dr. \nFrist talking about? It is the disparities, the differences that center \non race, on ethnicity, on geography--where somebody lives, whether it \nis in a city, a rural area, or different parts of the country--or \nhealth care disparities that center on health literacy, how educated \nyou are to understand what is being told to you about health care, your \nown health care, the environment and chronic disease, all of which have \nthese disparities\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nwhich, if we shine the light, we would probably eliminate a large \nnumber of them.\n  Two days ago on Tuesday, the American Public Health Association held \na townhall meeting in Memphis, TN, to highlight rural health \ndisparities, one of those geographic disparities that affect people in \nways that may not always be obvious. I want to take a moment and \nacknowledge several people: The Honorable Dr. W. W. Herenton, mayor of \nMemphis, the Honorable A. C. Wharton, mayor of Shelby County, as well \nas all the other many distinguished participants and sponsors of this \nsuccessful event, including another good friend, a former classmate of \nmine, a medical colleague when I practiced medicine, Dr. Kenneth S. \nRobinson, who is now commissioner of the Tennessee Department of \nHealth; Georges Benjamin, M.D., executive director of the American \nPublic Health Association; Pat Santel, president of the Tennessee \nPublic Health Association; Shavetta Conner, M.D., regional medical \nofficer, west region, Tennessee Department of Health; Robin J. Womeodu, \nM.D., executive director, Center on Health Disparities, University of \nTennessee; the Rural Health Association of Tennessee; the Tennessee \nHospital Alliance, as well as TennCare.\n  I especially wish to commend APHA, the American Public Health \nAssociation, for taking time to hold this particular meeting in \nTennessee and for their efforts to bring a comprehensive approach to \nthe problem of health disparities.\n  I strongly believe any health care disparity among our citizens is \nsimply unacceptable. No patient should be denied quality health care \nbecause of their race, where they live, what their ethnicity is, what \ntheir gender is, or their socioeconomic status.\n  Consider some of the facts, and once you hear these facts, you will \nsee why I believe it is unacceptable, there is no good reason for it, \nand almost all of these have reasons we can address that can change the \ndisparity.\n  Even when socioeconomic status is equal, the mortality rates are \nhigher among African Americans and American Indians than among other \ngroups.\n  My own speciality of heart disease--heart disease is, by the way, the \nleading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease mortality \nrates are almost twice as high among African Americans as among Whites. \nEven when we examine heart disease mortality by socioeconomic status, \nthe differences between African Americans and Whites, though \nsignificantly reduced, are not eliminated.\n  African-American and Hispanic women both experience a higher \nprevalence of diabetes when we compare those groups to White women.\n  New studies indicate 70 percent of American Indians live in urban \nareas, and nearly 1 in 4 of these live below the poverty level, and \nnearly half below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. These rates \nare substantially higher than the rates for all other races combined.\n\n  I mentioned income and geography. When we look at the disparities, \nboth income and geography play a major role. For example, African-\nAmerican men with incomes less than $10,000 have a heart disease \nmortality rate that is nearly 3 times that of their counterparts with \nincomes greater than $15,000.\n  Geography is also important. Twenty percent of the U.S. population \nlives in rural areas. These rural communities often experience poorer \noverall health status than many urban communities. Notably, residents \nof rural communities have higher rates of chronic illnesses, such as \ndiabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. They also have higher \nrates of disability.\n  The reasons for these rural disparities are many. They include \nfactors such as transportation difficulties, lack of physicians, and \nlack of other health services. Often the health care services that are \navailable are much more limited than those services available to their \nurban counterparts, to their counterparts in the cities. Also, \nresidents who are in rural areas are much more likely to be uninsured \nthan those in urban areas.\n  Last year in a speech at Morehouse University, I laid out a plan to \ncombat these health disparities. Since that time, I reached out broadly \nto a whole range of constituencies, working with stakeholders and \nnational leaders to gather input and ideas. Together we are working to \nensure my proposed legislation includes the very best possible \nstrategies to eliminate these health disparities.\n  These efforts culminated in the introduction earlier this year of \nmajor bipartisan legislation. Two months ago, I joined with Senator \nMary Landrieu, Senator Thad Cochran, Senator Mike DeWine, Senator \nChristopher Bond, Senator James Talent, and Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison to introduce Closing the Health Care Gap Act of 2004. This \nlegislation builds on past bipartisan efforts to address disparities, \nmost importantly the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research \nand Education Act of 2000.\n  In this legislation, we target five key areas. First, expanding \naccess to quality health care; two, strengthening national efforts and \ncoordination; three, helping increase the diversity of those health \nprofessionals who are active; four, promoting more aggressive health \nprofessional education that is intended specifically to reduce the \nbarriers to health care, several of which I have already mentioned; and \nfive, enhancing the research to identify sources of those disparities--\nracial disparities, ethnic disparities, and geographic disparities--and \nalso to assess the intervention strategies we know today are quite \npromising.\n  In addition, in closing, we know reducing and eliminating health care \ndisparities is not going to be easy. It is going to be a huge challenge \nbefore us. Even a lot of the conversations we must have as a society \nare very difficult, but we must try, and I believe we can do so.\n  When we engage in this debate, even in the heat of an election year, \nall of us need to keep in mind the stakes could not be higher. We are \ntalking about the health and the lives of our fellow Americans. The \nonly way we can make progress toward ending health disparities is by \nforging bipartisan solutions.\n  Again, I commend the APHA for focusing this entire week on health \ncare disparities. I also appreciate the efforts they have made to \nsupport this bipartisan legislation in this arena of health \ndisparities.\n  I look forward to working with the APHA and all of my colleagues to \ncontinue to work to combat the health care disparities that currently \ndo plague our American health care system and, as long as those \ndisparities exist, hurt innocent people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take another few moments to talk on \na separate issue that centers on a topic that has been the subject of a \nlot of debate and a lot of discussion on the Senate floor and \nelsewhere. It is the overall topic, the phenomenon of outsourcing. \nCritics contend that a company's effort to deliver a product or service \nmore cheaply and efficiently to the American consumer is hurting our \neconomy and hurting America's workers. Indeed, this has become fodder \nfor sound bites that I think are not justified and thus want to take a \nfew moments to talk more broadly about what outsourcing is and what it \nis not.\n  I should begin by starting with the flip side of outsourcing and that \nis insourcing. What is ``insourcing''? What is this phenomenon of \ninsourcing? Well, it has been a company such as Nissan opens a plant in \nthe United States and thereby creates high-paying jobs for American \nworkers to the benefit of those American workers. In fact, that is the \nvery thing that happened in Tennessee when, in 1980, Nissan opened its \nfirst plant in Smyrna. In the 1970s, Tennessee, like the rest of the \ncountry, was struggling with high unemployment several times the \ncurrent rate of 5.6 percent. Then Nissan opened a manufacturing plant \nin Rutherford County and Rutherford County then went into high gear.\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\n  A few years later, Saturn announced it was opening a plant, and today \nmiddle Tennessee is home to three major automobile factories. Nissan \ntoday employs roughly 7,400 workers and in the year 2000 paid out $27.7 \nmillion a month in payroll. That is insourcing.\n  Mark Herbison of the county's chamber of commerce says with \nunderstandable home pride:\n\n       We continue to see our existing companies grow and expand. \n     That is because of our quality of workforce here. If you look \n     at the Nissan plant, in 9 out of the last 10 years, they've \n     been ranked the most productive automotive plant in North \n     America.\n\n  Because of increased demand for Nissan cars, the company has spent $1 \nbillion to expand its Smyrna and Decherd plants. Production in Smyrna \nwas up 40 percent in February. Moreover, Nissan's success has extended \nby spurring growth of a number of companies that in turn supply the \nplant. There are now more than 900 suppliers providing 140,000 jobs in \nthe State.\n  The Nashville Business Journal reports that based on its success in \nmanufacturing, Rutherford County is now branching out to attract more \nwhite-collar jobs.\n  Nissan is just one success of how insourcing has led to job growth. \nOver 400 overseas companies have U.S. subsidiaries that are employing \nand creating jobs just in my home State of Tennessee.\n  The Swedish company Electrolux, previously known as Frigidaire, has a \nSpringfield operation that employs 2,900 workers. If one looks at the \nsize of these companies and the range, they will see there is a broad \nspectrum. In Australia, a corrugated box company operates a small \noutpost in Humboldt; a Netherlands food preparation company has an \noffice in Chattanooga that employs 175 called Bunge Foods.\n  Insourcing has, indeed, brought good jobs and good wages to \nTennessee. Over 157,000 jobs in Tennessee are the result of insourcing. \nThat is the flip side of outsourcing. U.S. subsidiaries support nearly \n7 percent of Tennessee's private sector workforce.\n\n  One might ask why do companies come to the United States of America, \ncome to Tennessee, to create jobs and manufacture their products? \nBecause company after company has found that insourcing is a boon to \ntheir bottom line. In turn, Tennessee workers get more and pay less for \ntheir products and the services they purchase.\n  There is a second aspect to this whole discussion of world trade that \nhas gotten overlooked in the debate, and that is the growth of American \nexports. Again, Tennessee has been a major beneficiary of the opening \nof foreign markets.\n  In 2002, Tennessee exported more than $11.6 billion worth of goods, \nup nearly 26 percent from 1997. Tennessee exports support 232,000 local \njobs, nearly one-tenth the State's total labor force, and over the last \n5 years the average Tennessean exporter increased sales by nearly 16 \npercent, selling over $2 million in goods each year to foreign \nconsumers.\n  Even more notably, export-supporting jobs paid 13 to 18 percent more \non average than nonexport jobs. Our focus should be to expand economic \ngrowth and promote higher wages, not to impose sanctions and \nrestrictions on America's job creators.\n  Listen to the words of Dyer County farmer Jim Moody. He tells a local \nMemphis paper: We've got to have exports to survive and do well.\n  Farmer Moody is right, and it is not just his farm that benefits from \nincreasing exports. It is every American who gets a good job, who gets \na higher wage, and every American consumer who is thereby able to \nstretch their dollar a little bit further, sometimes a whole lot \nfurther.\n  As we have all seen, especially recently in the last 6 months, our \neconomy over the last measured 6 months is growing faster than it has \nin the last 20 years. America has a dynamic economy. It is true that as \nthis economy, because of its dynamism, because of its flexibility, \nbecause of its ability to adapt, expands it at times has to shift \nresources, thereby resulting in dislocations. Hopefully, the \ndislocations are temporary. That is why it is so important for us to \nfocus on workforce development and training.\n  There is no question that in these dislocations workers are hurt, \nthose who are dislocated for a period of time, but our responsibility \nin Government, on the Senate floor, is to respond and support them, and \nsupport them with programs of retraining, education, and of allowing \nthese workers to adapt to this new environment.\n  Workers who are dislocated need to be trained to find a new job but \nalso to work at that new job. Luckily, there are a whole range of \npublic and private sector programs that are available. According to the \nGovernment Accounting Office, there are 44 federally funded programs \ntoday that provide employment and training services. In 2002, Congress \nspent more than $12 billion on employment and training activities, \naiding 30 million Americans with a whole range of services such as job \nsearch assistance, employment counseling, basic adult literacy, \nvocational training. The list goes on.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act was expanded in 2002 to provide \neven more generous assistance for workers who lose their jobs because \nof import competition or because of shift of production to another \ncountry.\n  Similarly, Congress has invested over $27 billion in training, under \nthe Workforce Investment Act. That act went into effect in 2000, and it \nis over $27 billion since that point in time. Its hallmark is the one-\nstop career center, and that provides job seekers with a single \nlocation to access a whole host of resources, including unemployment \ninsurance, job market information, job training, and job search \nassistance.\n  We reauthorized the bill last year with strong bipartisan support in \nthis body, the Senate. But, unfortunately, the Senate Democrats have \nblocked this bill from going to conference. Again, we passed it--I \nthink it was even unanimous--in the Senate, and the House has passed \nsuch a bill. But right now we are being blocked from going to \nconference. As a result, they are holding up a vital and much needed \nimprovement to the program that spends more than $5 billion a year on \njob training and other valuable assistance.\n  People say they want to help workers. But by blocking us going to \nconference on these bills, that, again, passed the House and the \nSenate, it is more just talk where we need to deliver that action. That \nis what the American people want. That is what they need. It is what \nthey deserve. So again I appeal to the other side of the aisle, please \nlet us go to conference on this important bill for the good of the \nAmerican people.\n  We need to help workers find good-paying jobs, to retrain them if \nthey need it, to get the support they need, to get them back on their \nfeet. Every American who needs a job should be able to get a job. We \nshould be willing to work hard together to expand the economy and to \ntackle whatever structural problems exist that hinder job creation.\n  You have seen numerous attempts on the floor of the Senate, most \nrecently a couple of days ago, that are aimed at controlling things \nsuch as litigation, unnecessary litigation costs that do, in effect, \ncripple economies, both at the macro and the micro level. It is \nestimated that frivolous lawsuits in this country today are costing the \neconomy $200 billion a year. If you assume a salary of, say, $50,000 a \nyear, that is the equivalent of 4 million jobs caused by frivolous \nlawsuits--4 million jobs that could lower the unemployment rate.\n  We see the effects of frivolous lawsuits most dramatically in my own \nprofession. You see it across the board, and we debated it again on the \nfloor yesterday, and we were unsuccessful, with a filibuster of that \nparticular legislation. But we talked a lot about the issues in terms \nof the impact on people--expectant mothers, in terms of their access to \nobstetricians. We looked at it in terms of trauma units and emergency \nrooms, where specialists, high-risk specialists are simply saying they \ncan't afford the malpractice insurance that is being charged to them \nand therefore are not going to take trauma anymore, and not going to \nwork in emergency rooms anymore because they simply cannot afford that \ninsurance. That ends up affecting the health care of all of us--all of \nus who might need that emergency room tonight or their trauma center \ntomorrow or that mom or expectant mom who needs an obstetrician.\n  We find doctors who are moving. We find doctors in Pennsylvania \nmoving\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nout to California and moving down South because of medical liability. \nWe find doctors leaving their local communities. We find doctors, in \nfact, even retiring from medicine.\n\n  A recent study by a University of Nevada Medical School professor \nfound that 42 percent of obstetricians are planning to move their \npractices out of southern Nevada. And if they do, Las Vegas will have \n78 obstetricians to deliver 23,000 babies each year. So how many babies \nwill get medical care and how many babies will not get medical care if \nthat is to occur?\n  These are the real-life consequences of surreal courtroom dramas that \ntake place. It is the reality of today. That is why, on this particular \nissue--although it was filibustered yesterday and was filibustered \nabout 2 months ago and was filibustered back in July--we are going to \ncontinue to bring it back because it is reality today. It is affecting \npeople's lives.\n  The Senator from Delaware was just on the floor talking about the \nout-of-control asbestos lawsuits. There, once again, you see effects \nthat are very similar in that they are severe and the people who most \nneed help no longer are getting that help. The approximately 600,000 \nclaims that have been filed have already cost $54 billion in litigation \ncosts, in judgments, in settlements.\n  Over 70 companies so far have declared bankruptcy under the crush of \nasbestos lawsuits. It is a problem that is bad. It has gotten worse in \nrecent years. In the very recent years it has even gotten worse in \nterms of the bankruptcies, in terms of the money not reaching the \nvictims themselves or even the potential victims but being siphoned off \nby frivolous suits by people who may be a little less scrupulous than \nany of us would like.\n  More than a third of the bankruptcies have taken place in the last 3 \nyears. In other words, it is getting worse and worse. These are huge \ncompanies: Johns Manville, Owens Corning, US Gypsum, WR Grace; over 90 \npercent of American industries are in some way affected. Even companies \nthat have little or no direct connection to asbestos are now being \ntargeted for legal annihilation. Asbestos-related bankruptcies have \nalready cost more than 60,000 jobs.\n  It is a broken system. The reason we plan in the future bringing it \nto the floor--I introduced the bill with Chairman Hatch last night--is \nthat we must make progress. I believe we have the responsibility to \naddress this unfair system that is hurting the American people. I know \nwe have the power to do it. Now we just need to show that we have the \nwill.\n  What started out as a quest for justice in the courts has, \nunfortunately, evolved into a wild litigation lottery, but it is \nsomething we can fix and I believe we will fix. I will have to say in \nthe lottery today--this out-of-control lottery that has now become the \nsort of system itself--there is only one winner, and that is \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers. It is not the victim or the person who is \npotentially hurt. People who are hurt by the negligence of others \ndeserve justice. But so do people who are hurt by a system that is \ndriving doctors out of the practice of medicine, that is driving \ncompanies out of business, and driving jobs out of the economy.\n  Every day we encourage America's job creators to grow and expand and \nto compete in this world market. Yet at the same time we are burdening \nthem with unnecessary, and I would argue unfair, litigation practices \nthat ultimately amount to a hefty tax, which makes them less \ncompetitive in the world marketplace.\n  In the manufacturing sector we have spent so much time on the FSC/ETI \nbill and the JOBS bill, talking about them, saying we must address \nthem. It is reported that excessive regulations have added 22.4 percent \nto the cost of doing business.\n  In closing, if we want American companies to be competitive, which we \nall do, if we want them to be strong, if we want them to be vital, if \nwe want them to grow, if we want them to create jobs, we have an \nobligation, too, and we need to make the system fair.\n  We can't ask these companies to run this great race to prosperity and \nthen bind them up at the same time in miles and miles of redtape and \nunnecessary, frivolous lawsuits.\n  America's entrepreneurs are smart, they are dynamic, they are \nproductive, they are highly competitive. And so are America's workers. \nWe need to pursue policies that allow us both to maximize their \npotential, and also their prosperity potential. We need to pursue \npolicies that, indeed, keep America moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I simply want to congratulate the \nmajority leader on a speech filled with a lot of common sense. I would \nlike to hear more of that these days and will just take 3 or 4 minutes \nto go back over what I heard and emphasize it.\n  On the first point, all the talk about jobs comes down to jobs \ntraining. We know in this country, and we have known it for years, that \nour economy is characterized by losing jobs and gaining jobs.\n  I remember 25 years ago during my first year as Governor; I went down \nto Memphis to try to persuade the International Harvester plant not to \nclose. I got my picture in the paper and pats on my back. I went back \nto Nashville. The next day they closed.\n  I realized if all I was doing was going around having my picture made \nin front of plants that closed I wouldn't be much of a Governor.\n  The more I study, I realize we literally will lose 6 or 7 percent of \nour jobs every year in Tennessee and in this country. The key to \nsuccess is whether we replace them with better jobs. The key to that is \nwhether we educate American men and women who are in one job to get a \nbetter job. That is painful. That is hard. That is not easy. But that \nis the truth.\n  The President's proposal about community colleges and the workforce \nbill, which is being held up, are good antidotes to that.\n  Second, on the majority leader's comments on insourcing, he is \nexactly right about that. We don't want to say: Nissan, go home from \nSmyrna, TN; Toyota, don't build that plant in San Antonio; Honda, go \nhome from Ohio.\n  In our State alone, as was pointed out, over the last 20 years the \ncoming of the auto industry to Tennessee has raised our family income \nfrom 80 percent of the national average to 100 percent of the national \naverage. It has been led by foreign companies. If they can't come here, \nwe can't go there. This is a two-way world.\n  The last thing the majority leader said is exactly right. We should \nlearn our lesson in the way we are insourcing. If you go to Europe, you \nhear a lot of people talking about outsourcing there. They are \noutsourcing brains to the United States because they are coming to our \nuniversities. We have created an environment in which we can grow the \nbest universities in the world, and we have done it. We can create the \nsame environment in the United States for the best jobs in the world.\n  We can do that by passing a lot of legislation that is being held up \nhere by the other side: legislation to reduce the cost of energy, the \nEnergy bill; legislation that would lower the corporate tax on \nmanufacturing--that is the JOBS bill being held up; legislation that \nwould reduce runaway lawsuits and reduce costs on business. The \nmajority leader brought that up several times. Legislation that would \nsolve the asbestos problem would reduce costs on business.\n  By reducing costs and encouraging education, we can create the same \nsort of environment that will insource new good jobs into America just \nas we have created the best universities in the world and insourcing \nthe best brains in the world that are coming to the U.S. because they \nare attracted here.\n  I hope I hear more of that kind of commonsense language, not just \nfrom the majority leader but from more and more Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  I wanted to compliment him and congratulate him for his remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1637\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mc Keever\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof David M. McKeever, a sergeant in the United States Army. Sergeant \nMcKeever was killed on April 5, 2004, in Baghdad, Iraq, when his Army \nunit was ambushed while guarding a hospital. He had 15 days left in \nIraq when he was killed. He was 25 years old.\n  Sergeant McKeever was assigned to the 1st Armored Division and had \nbeen recently promoted from the rank of specialist to sergeant. He was \nstationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, CO before later moving to \nthe Army base at Giessen, Germany in September 2002. He was one of \nthousands of brave American service men and women serving in Iraq who \nconfront danger every day. Their tremendous risks and sacrifices must \nnever be taken for granted.\n  His wife, Niki, grew up in Kearney, NE. Last October, Sergeant \nMcKeever, a Buffalo, NY native, visited family in Kearney while on \nleave. Sergeant McKeever leaves behind his wife; son, Dylan, now 1 year \nold; parents, David T. and Carol of Buffalo; brother, Thomas; and four \nolder sisters. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of them at this \ndifficult time. America is proud of David M. McKeever's service and \nmourns his loss.\n  Sergeant McKeever will be buried in Kearney. He will be remembered as \na dedicated soldier with an optimistic outlook on life.\n  For his service, bravery, and sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join \nme and all Americans in honoring Sergeant McKeever.\n\n\n                     u.s. army pfc cleston c. raney\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a brave young soldier from \nIdaho. U.S. Army PFC Cleston C. Raney of Rupert was only 20 when, on \nMarch 31, 2004, he lost his life in Iraq. Private Raney was killed by a \nroadside bomb doing what he considered his duty: fighting for the \nfreedoms we all hold dear. Today, I recognize his service and express \nmy sincere condolences to the family and friends of this exceptional \nyoung man.\n  Private Raney was born in Twin Falls, ID, and attended school in \nRupert and Burley. Driven by a strong sense of purpose, he joined the \nArmy in November of 2002 and began his military career as a combat \nengineer in Fort Riley, KS, in April 2003. In September 2003 he was \ndeployed to Iraq. He served honorably until his death.\n  Private Raney's death was part of the deadliest day of the war for \nthe Army's 1st Infantry Division, stationed at Fort Riley, KS. Four \nfellow soldiers from the same division were also killed. This fact \nunderscores the great threats that continue to face our young men and \nwomen in the Armed forces. It is also a testament to their great \nbravery, commitment, and resolve. Private Raney's death was the \nultimate sacrifice by a brave young America, made so that we and others \naround the world can live in freedom.\n  His family is very private and has asked that the media allow them to \ngrieve without the glare of cameras and the insistent questioning from \nreporters, but they did share some thoughts publicly about Cleston and \nhis love of life and family. He was a young man at the beginning of so \nmany opportunities in his life. He loved his family and enjoyed \nparticipating in activities with them, particularly beating his cousin \nGina at pool. He was so typical of many 20-year-old young men, and yet \nhis sacrifice for his country is anything but typical.\n  Private Raney's decision to serve our country places him in my \nhighest esteem. With gravity and sincerity, I honor him. My thoughts \nand prayers are with his grieving loved ones as they work to find peace \nin this difficult time. I know my colleagues here in Congress and many \nAmericans throughout our country do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4009-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4009-S4010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CLOTURE VOTES ON S. 2207 AND S. 1637\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President I rise to discuss S. 2207, Pregnancy and \nTrauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004, and S. 1637, the Jumpstart \nour Business Strength (JOBS) Act. Unfortunately I did not have an \nopportunity to cast a cloture vote yesterday on S. 2207 due to my \nobservance of Passover in Connecticut. The medical malpractice problem \nis a difficult issue and one about which I have long been concerned. We \nneed to strike the appropriate balance so that we have a system that \nensures those harmed by medical negligence are justly compensated while \nat the same time not set up a system that unnecessarily inflates \ninsurance rates. I have long sought to address this issue in a fair and \nrational way. For instance, I authored several bipartisan and balanced \nreform bills with Senator McConnell in the past. Unfortunately, the \nbills that have been before the Senate this Congress have been neither \nbipartisan nor balanced.\n  This includes the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of \n2004. S. 2207 goes further than necessary and than advertised, offering\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nlimited liability not only to doctors, but also to medical device \nmanufacturers and drug companies. Furthermore, the $250,000 cap on \nnoneconomic damages included in this bill may often prove too low for \nmany seriously harmed patients. I believe in meaningful and fair \nmedical malpractice reform; but this bill and the others debated on the \nfloor this session simply do not fit that description. For these \nreasons I would have voted against cloture for S. 2207, which failed to \nreceive the needed 60 votes by 49 to 48.\n  I was also unable to cast a second cloture vote on a motion to \nrecommit S. 1637, the ``Jumpstart our Business Strength (JOBS) Act,'' a \nbill to repeal the foreign sales corporation tax regime, and its \nsuccessor, the extraterritorial income tax regime, that have been found \nto be an illegal export subsidy by the World Trade Organization. I \nvoted against the first cloture filing on March 24 and, had I been \npresent on April 7, I would also have voted against cloture. The \ncloture vote failed to meet the 60-vote threshold by 50 to 47.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Investigators believe the two men were attacked because of \ntheir sexual orientation and are pursuing leads in the search for the \nsuspects. The five suspects are charged with first-degree intimidation.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4010-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4010-S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE IRS TAX GAP\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the next week, millions of Americans \nwill do their duty, obey the law, and complete their income tax \nreturns. Although this is clearly one of our citizens' least favorite \nannual rituals, most taxpayers will do what's right and provide their \nshare of funding to keep our national government running.\n  But while these honest Americans are doing their part, a number of \nothers are trying to get by without doing theirs. And that's what I \nwould like to talk about this afternoon.\n  Some call it the ``tax gap''--the difference between the amount of \ntaxes that taxpayers actually owe to the Federal Government and the \namount of taxes that taxpayers actually pay to the Federal Government.\n  This is not about raising taxes. This is about enforcing the tax laws \non the books. This is about collecting the taxes that are owed to the \nTreasury under the existing Tax Code.\n  While most Americans, with quiet patriotism, file their tax returns \nand pay their taxes on time, too many do not. There are a number of \nways that these folks try to skirt the law: Some don't file their \nreturns. Others understate their incomes. Still others take excessive \nor illegal deductions. And there are those who claim fictitious \nrefunds.\n  Unfortunately, there is a growing perception among honest taxpayers \nthat a large number of people are cheating the tax collector--and \ngetting away with it. The IRS Oversight Board Annual Survey on Taxpayer \nAttitudes reported that the proportion of Americans who ``completely \nagree' that it is all Americans' civic duty to pay their fair share of \ntaxes has steadily declined.\n  In 1999, 81 percent of Americans agreed that it's their duty to pay \ntaxes. In 2002, only 72 agreed with that statement. And last year, that \ngroup fell to just 68 percent of the population.\n  This trend is very distributing, but it is also very clear. More and \nmore people believe that cheating is acceptable.\n  As if this public attitude were not disturbing enough, the growing \nlack of taxpayer compliance jeopardizes the voluntary tax system on \nwhich our government depends. American taxpayers who voluntarily pay \ntheir fair share of the country's revenue will not support a tax system \nthat tolerates widespread cheating.\n  Taxpayers expect their Government to ensure that all pay their fair \nshare. Not one dime more, but not one dime less. The millions of honest \ntaxpayers deserve no less.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate estimated that the tax gap for 2001 \nwas $311 billion. But this is based on 16-year-old data from 1988. \nThere is every likelihood that the tax gap is significantly higher. It \ncertainly isn't less.\n  For the taxable years 2001 to 2003, the cumulative tax gap exceeded a \ntrillion dollars. In other words, if all individuals and corporations \nfully paid all of their taxes due for the past 3 years, the IRS could \ncollect an additional $1 trillion.\n  This huge level of unpaid taxes is harmful to law-abiding Americans \nand to the economy as a whole. Just as retail stores raise prices for \nhonest shoppers after they lose merchandise due to shoplifting, honest \ntaxpayers pay more to cover those who aren't paying their share.\n  In terms of the economy, each dollar in unpaid taxes increases the \ndeficit by a dollar. The administration predicts that the deficit will \nbe cut in half in the next 5 years. But since the administration took \noffice, the cumulative IRS tax gap has exceeded $1 trillion. Let me say \nthat again: $1 trillion. This is enough to help shore up Social \nSecurity, pay for the war in Iraq, ensure that no child is left behind, \nfix the highways and extend unemployment insurance.\n  Currently, the overall taxpayer noncompliance rate is 15 percent and \ngrowing. The plain fact is that voluntary compliance has been and \nremains the backbone of our tax system. Our primary mission must be to \nmaintain and enhance the health of that system by encouraging and \nfacilitating voluntary compliance with our tax laws. A 1-percent point \nswing in voluntary compliance will increase, or decrease, revenues each \nyear by more than $20 billion.\n  Our Federal budget has gone from one of the greatest surpluses in its \nhistory to the highest deficit ever known--$478 billion--close to half \na trillion dollars in the current fiscal year.\n  Now more than ever we need a plan of action to close the IRS tax gap. \nI propose the following:\n  First, let's make it easier for people to pay their taxes. Our \nFederal Tax Code and accompanying regulations are more than 54,000 \npages long. They are too complex, confusing, and costly to comply with. \nIn addition to making the code simpler for individual taxpayers, \nsimplification would reduce opportunities for dishonesty. Tax shelters \ndevelop because sections of the lengthy code are manipulated to achieve \nunwarranted tax benefits.\n  That is why I support a broadly based blue ribbon commission that \nwould recommend simplifications for our income tax system that we could \nact on.\n  Second, we need better data on noncompliance. To fix a problem, you \nhave to know the facts. I support the National Research Program that \nwould allow us to have a more accurate estimate of the IRS tax gap and \nshould help IRS identify where they should target their enforcement \nefforts.\n  Third, the IRS needs to do a better job enforcing our current tax \nlaws. And that may take Congress passing legislation forcing them to \ntake stronger action. Bills such as the good Government tax \nadministration bill would improve efficiency and strengthen safeguards \nin IRS collection cases. And in\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nthe JOBS bill--which I am optimistic we will pass in the very near \nfuture--we have included antitax shelter legislation that will make \nsure transactions are done for legitimate business reasons and not \nsolely for tax benefits.\n  We have also included provisions that would impose stiffer penalties \non any taxpayers who engage in shelter transactions. It is also time to \ncrack down on expatriation practices, corporate inversions, SILOs, \nabuses in the charitable area, Enron-related tax shelters, and offshore \nabusive tax schemes. And we should devote more resources to IRS \nenforcement. Dollars spent there will bring in several times as much in \nadditional revenue raised.\n  And last, but certainly not least, we need to set a goal, a benchmark \nof where we are going on tax compliance. Today, I proposed that we \nreach at least a 90 percent tax compliance rate by the end of the \ndecade. By 2010, at least 90 percent of Americans should be filing \ntheir taxes and paying their dues. It is not too much to ask. Now, it \nwill not be easy, but that does not mean that it cannot be done. I know \nwe can achieve it through the methods I just outlined.\n  With the growing deficit and the upcoming retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, increasing tax compliance is more important than ever. And \nit is also one of the easiest ways to raise more revenue for our \nNation. We are not talking about raising taxes--we are simply asking \nall Americans to pay their fair share as citizens of this great Nation. \nBy reaching a 90-percent compliance rate, we would raise at least $100 \nbillion more each year. This funding would go a long way toward \nstrengthening Social Security or helping our classrooms or paying down \nthe deficit.\n  April 15 is just around the corner. I encourage every citizen to do \nwhat is right, to stand up for your country and make your contribution. \nHere in Congress, we will keep working to make it easier for our honest \ntaxpayers to comply and to make it harder for those dishonest folks to \ncheat the system. Together, we will seal the tax gap and help the \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4011-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENATOR BOXER'S TRIGGER LOCK AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month the Senate considered and passed \nthe Boxer trigger lock amendment by a 70-27 vote. Senator Boxer's \namendment would require that all handguns sold by a dealer come with a \nchild safety device, such as a lock, a lock box, or technology built \ninto the gun itself. Further, it would direct the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to develop standards for child safety devices. The \nneed for this legislation is clear, and I supported its passage.\n  According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, each year \nteenagers and children are involved in more than 10,000 accidental \nshootings in which close to 800 people die. Further, about 1,500 \nchildren age 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency rooms for \nunintentional firearm injuries. About 38 percent of them have injuries \nsevere enough to require hospitalization.\n  In addition to accidental shootings, according to the Brady Campaign, \nevery year 1,300 children use firearms to commit suicide. Unlike \nsuicide attempts using other methods, suicide attempts with guns are \nnearly always fatal. These children are given no second chance.\n  It does not have to be this way. If gun manufacturers put locking or \nother safety mechanisms on guns, or dealers sold handguns with safety \ndevices, many shootings could be avoided, and fewer children would die \neach year.\n  The gun industry immunity legislation, to which Senator Boxer's \namendment was attached, would have provided unprecedented protection \nfrom liability to gun manufacturers and dealers, even in cases where \ntheir own gross negligence or recklessness led to someone being injured \nor killed. I opposed the immunity bill and was pleased that it failed \nto pass the Senate. However, Senator Boxer's trigger lock amendment \npassed with bipartisan support. Given that, I hope the Senate takes up \nand passes that legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4011-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4011-S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASBESTOS LITIGATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, Senator Landrieu and I rise today to add \nour voices to those who have been calling for a comprehensive national \nsolution to the asbestos litigation problem. Several members of both \nparties have recently come to the floor to discuss this very issue and \nwe want to join with them in urging our colleagues to address this \nmatter with immediate legislation.\n  I have always believed that one of the greatest freedoms in this \ncountry is the ability of ordinary citizens to seek redress in an \nimpartial court of law from other citizens or businesses--no matter how \nlarge or powerful. However, in the case of asbestos litigation the \nsystem no longer is able to meet this goal. The courts are so backed up \nwith asbestos lawsuits, many of which are brought by individuals who \nare not yet sick or may never get sick, that those victims who are \ntruly suffering from asbestos-related illnesses are not receiving \ncompensation and businesses are going bankrupt in the process.\n  Asbestos litigation is a serious and growing problem in our home \nstate of Louisiana. For the benefit of victims, union members, and \nbusinesses in Louisiana--both large and small--that are suffering the \nconsequences of this crisis, we urge the Senate to resolve this problem \nas soon as possible. Let me be clear: we want a bill that will provide \nguaranteed, fair compensation to deserving victims in our state and \naround the country. And, we want a bill that will provide certainty for \nvictims and businesses in Louisiana and elsewhere that have been caught \nup in this crisis.\n  I am becoming increasingly troubled by reports that negotiations \nbetween the parties on the asbestos bill are reaching a standstill. Too \nmuch work and tireless hours of negotiation have gone into this bill to \nlet it become yet another marker in the growing graveyard of failed \nlegislation. I would like to use this opportunity to urge all parties \nin this matter to continue working in good faith with one another to \nfind agreement on the issues that are still outstanding.\n  A final deal on asbestos will not be easy and it will require more \nconcessions from all parties. I know a number of my colleagues have \nworked unflagging to try and get this issue resolved. I commend them \nfor all their effort and work. However, it is also important that we \nrealize how close we are to not having any bill at all. I am concerned \nthat by hastily pushing forward legislation that only has partial \nsupport, we will effectively kill this bill. We cannot stand back and \nallow the current system to continue to spiral out of control. Another \nfailed cloture vote will not help victims, nor will it help business. \nThis is an issue that we should be able to vote out of the Senate, not \nby 60 votes, but by 70 or 80. We must continue to work together to this \nend. The asbestos litigation system is broken and it must be fixed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, to urge the Senate to enact meaningful \nasbestos litigation reform this Congress. I am equally concerned about \nthe impact that this escalating crisis is having in our own state of \nLouisiana.\n  The example of just one company illustrates how this ongoing \nlitigation is affecting Louisiana. In 1978, McDermott, headquartered in \nLouisiana, acquired Babcock & Wilcox, B, a premier commercial \nboilermaker and provider of other power generation equipment. B was \nthe leading manufacturer of boilers in the United States. In line with \nUnited States government specifications, all of these boilers were \ninsulated with asbestos. Now many years later, the company has been \nsubjected to an avalanche of asbestos claims. In fact, B had no \nrecourse other than to file for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the \nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. Because of the uncertainty of its asbestos \nliability and the resulting inability to satisfactorily reorganize the \nfinances of the company, McDermott's union employees in my state are \nadversely impacted. Just last week, representatives from my staff and \nSenator Breaux's staff attended a meeting of the management and union \nlabor at McDermott's facility in Morgan City, LA, to discuss this \nproblem. We now have a petition signed by 1,000 of these workers asking \nthat we solve this problem as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\n  Other industries and companies in Louisiana are threatened by the \ncurrent litigation system. Louisiana's economy is dependent on trade \nand the maritime industry. Many of our U.S.-flag shipping companies \nhave asbestos issues because certain parts of their ships' engines were \ninsulated with asbestos. These companies are equally concerned about \nthe uncertainty created by the current system and their long-term \nability to maintain solvency.\n  I do not have all the answers. I do know that legislation addressing \nthis issue is very complex. Any bill should virtually guarantee that \nasbestos victims receive fair and adequate compensation and it should \nalso give certainty to companies like McDermott. I realize that \nprogress has been made during the course of negotiations, but we must \nbuild on this progress by continuing to negotiate. I think we can reach \na bipartisan agreement and bring a bill to the floor as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4012-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4012-S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY \n                           COMMITTEE IN 2003\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, March 4, 2004 was the 1-year anniversary of \nthe last, brief appearance by Attorney General Ashcroft before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It was not an anniversary that we marked \nfor celebration. Instead, we marked the day as a low point, and \nsymbolic of the disdain shown by the administration for oversight by \nthe people's representatives in Congress.\n  I recognize that the Attorney General was recently incapacitated by a \npersonal medical condition. We all wished him a speedy and full \nrecovery. Up through March 4, however, there was no explanation for \nignoring his oversight responsibilities. The Attorney General has since \nresumed his duties after successful surgery and a brief respite. It is \ntime now for him to answer the call of those oversight responsibilities \nby appearing before this committee.\n  Vigorous oversight is instrumental to ensuring that our law \nenforcement officials are effective and accountable, both in fighting \ncrime and in preventing acts of terrorism. The lack of attention this \nJustice Department has given to oversight by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee regarding issues of national importance, including \nimplementation of the USA PATRIOT Act, is, quite frankly, appalling. \nReticence by the Nation's chief law enforcement officer to appear \nbefore the authorizing committee of the Senate would be disappointing \nany time. During these trying times in which the administration has \nchosen unilateral action it is inexcusable.\n  The written questions I posed to General Ashcroft in connection with \nlast year's hearing did not get any response for 9 months, and even \nthen, the so-called answers were incomplete and unresponsive. In fact, \nthe Justice Department has delayed answering numerous written oversight \nrequests until answers are moot or outdated, or they respond in vague \nand evasive terms. This approach stymies our constitutional system of \nchecks and balances. The checks and balance on the executive intended \nby the Founders and embodied in the Constitution are being put to the \ntest by a secretive administration. More importantly, such flagrant \navoidance of accountability fuels the sort of public distrust that is \nnow associated with federal law enforcement and, in particular, with \nthis Attorney General and his department.\n  Let me provide a few of what could be many, many examples:\n  On June 19, 2002, Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to the Office \nof the Inspector General, regarding allegations made by an FBI \nwhistleblower that posed several important questions about the problems \nin the FBI's translator program that have never been answered. The \nAttorney General has yet to intervene despite the unseemly delay. I \nraised the issue of translators in our first meeting on September 19, \n2001, as we began the process of constructing what became the PATRIOT \nAct. I have attempted to follow up in the months and years since that \ntime and have been given the run around with conflicting responses \nvirtually each time I inquire. With the implications proper translation \nand translation capacities have for the country's security, these \ndelays and this unresponsiveness is simply unacceptable.\n  Over 2 years ago, I began asking about the FBI's translation program. \nYet, questions I posed to the Assistant Attorney General Wray during an \nOctober oversight hearing were greeted with a virtual blank stare and \nno knowledge about the issue at all. On March 2 of this year, I sent a \nletter to the Attorney General and FBI Director Mueller repeating some \nof what I have asked before and asking about new issues that have since \nbeen raised. Needless to say, no answers have been forthcoming.\n  On January 10, 2003, Senator Feingold, Senator Cantwell and I sent \nthe Attorney General a set of questions regarding the Department's \ndata-mining practices. On February 19, we were informed that our letter \nhad been referred to the FBI for a response, and that a response would \nbe provided no later than March 31. On March 18, we were advised that \nthe FBI's response had been delivered to the Department for review and \napproval, and that the Department would transmit the final response to \nus directly. That was the last we heard on this matter. It has been \nover a year since we inquired. American's privacy interests should not \nbe so easily sloughed aside.\n  On May 23, 2002, I wrote to the Attorney General to request a full \naccounting of any problems the Department or the FBI might be \nexperiencing with regard to the PATRIOT Act amendment authorizing \n``roving wiretaps'' under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nFISA. In particular, I asked the Department to detail any problems \ninvolving technical and operational implementation of the new \nauthority, the current statutory language, construction of that \nlanguage by the FISA court, or a combination of any or all of these \nfactors. I have received no response. Roving wiretaps were one of the \nmore controversial authorities that we provided following September 11. \nAmericans across the country are concerned and fearful that their \nprivacy is being invaded by a federal government that may be repeating \nhistorical excesses. To reassure the public and to correct problems, we \nneed answers--prompt answers. Ten months is too long to have to wait \nfor such an accounting.\n  Other oversight letters that have remained unanswered for 6 months or \nmore include questions about the Department's death penalty procedures, \nthe status of regulations for reporting suspicion child exploitation \nmatters, concern about the Wen Ho Lee espionage case, and the release \nof Office of Legal Counsel opinions.\n  Despite his having recently been a Member of the Senate and of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, it would seem that in his current role as \nAttorney General, former Senator Ashcroft has forgotten that effective \noversight of the Justice Department requires the Department's full and \ntimely cooperation. When stale and incomplete responses to questions \ntrickle in after months of delay, one has to wonder whether the \nDepartment is incapable of responding in a timely fashion or is \ndeliberately stonewalling.\n  Congress is not the only one asking questions. In the past year, \nseveral Federal courts have criticized the Justice Department's use of \ntools to pursue terrorism-related activity and the unilateral power \nasserted by the executive branch. I regret that when Congress is not \nvigorous in its necessary oversight and when the Executive ignores our \noversight, it falls to the courts as the only remaining check on \nExecutive power to review its actions. That is why the Supreme Court \nwill be spending so much time this year on terrorism cases. That is not \nthe way it should be or needs to be. That is apparently the intention \nof the Executive, however. That contravenes the Constitution and \ndenigrates our Government.\n\n  Last March, I was hopeful that the Attorney General's appearance \nbefore the committee would be the first of a series of hearings \nbuilding on the important oversight activities we began in the last \nCongress, including the first comprehensive oversight of the FBI \ninitiated in decades. Unfortunately, that important mission too seems \nto have fallen by the wayside. With the change in Senate leadership to \nthe Republican Party, little interest has been\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nshown in effective congressional oversight. Our security and the \nAmerican people are the losers in this regard.\n  Late on a February Friday afternoon--a time often used by the current \nadministration to bury news stories--the FBI quietly released a report \non its broken ``Office of Professional Responsibility.'' The report was \noccasioned in part by FBI whistleblowers who had the courage to stand \nup and denounce longstanding problems in the way the FBI disciplined \nitself. One recommendation of the OPR report was to adopt a reform \nSenator Grassley and I have introduced over the last few years as part \nof our FBI Reform Act. Like oversight, our legislative efforts to \nimprove the practices of the Executive branch also seem stymied. This \nRepublican-controlled Senate will not even consider enacting reforms we \nall know are needed, that watchdogs within the Executive have endorsed.\n  So here we are, over 13 months after we last saw General Ashcroft, \nand we have no schedule for the long overdue appearance by the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States before the oversight committee of the \nSenate. Republican Senators may have disagreed with Attorney General \nReno's leadership on certain issues, but they cannot say that she did \nnot appear before the Judiciary Committee for hours and hours at a time \nand listen to our questions and seek to answer the questions of all \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats. By contrast, the current Attorney \nGeneral found the time to make a 19-city cross country tour last year \nin which he appeared before friendly, hand-picked audiences and \ndelivered a series of statements seeking to defend his use of the \nPATRIOT Act. He finds time to attend virtually every press conference \non an indictment or case development in high profile cases. Yet he has \nnot, and apparently will not, appear before the people's elected \nrepresentatives to answer our questions, hear our concerns and work \nwith us to improve the work of the Department of Justice.\n  We in Congress have the constitutional obligation and public \nresponsibility to oversee the Department of Justice's operations. After \nSeptember 11, after we expressed our sorrow for the victims and our \ndetermination to respond while preserving American freedoms, I publicly \nnoted my regret that we had not performed more effective and thorough \noversight of the Department of Justice in the years before 2001. During \nthe 17 months in 2001 and 2002 when I chaired the Judiciary Committee I \nworked with all Members, Republicans and Democrats, to provide real \noversight. There were times when the Attorney General used our hearings \nas a forum to attack us and our patriotism but we persisted to perform \nour constitutional duties. It is with deep regret that I report to the \nSenate and the American people that it is now more than a year since \nthe Attorney General of the United States last appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It is with sadness that I note the lack of \neffective oversight the Committee and the Senate are conducting on \nmatters that threaten the freedoms and security of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4013-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of April as \nChild Abuse Prevention Month.\n  Child abuse continues to be a significant problem in the United \nStates. It was estimated that in 2001, 903,000 children were the \nvictims of child abuse or neglect. Child abuse is a crime perpetrated \non the innocent and the defenseless.\n  In 2003, there were 17,345 substantiated child abuse or neglect cases \nin New Mexico. We must protect these children who cannot protect \nthemselves. By acknowledging April as Child Abuse Prevention Month, we \nare increasing awareness in the hopes that no more children live in \nfear.\n  Across this Nation, numerous individuals and organizations dedicate \ncountless hours of selfless work in the fight against child abuse. Many \nof the organizations that work to end child abuse began at the local \nlevel. I would like to acknowledge one of these organizations from my \nhome State in Las Cruces, NM. The child abuse awareness team consists \nof around 40 members who recognized a need in their community and \nresolved to make a change. This team of volunteers, law enforcement \nagents, school personnel and social service agency representatives, \ncontinually strives to protect the children in Dona Ana County.\n  The child abuse awareness team educates the community about child \nabuse prevention and reporting child abuse and neglect, promotes \nenforcement of child abuse and neglect laws, and provides advocacy for \nchild abuse victims. They believe the most effective child abuse \nprevention programs succeed when the entire community is involved.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to an issue that is currently being debated in Federal \ndistrict courts in New York, Nebraska, and San Francisco. Today, the \nPartial Birth Abortion Ban Act, which we overwhelmingly passed and saw \nsigned into law last year, is being challenged in three Federal courts \nacross the country. This law bans the gruesome procedure known as \npartial birth abortion, which is performed over a three-day period in \nthe second or third trimester of pregnancy. In this particular abortion \ntechnique, the physician delivers all but the baby's head through the \nbirth canal, stabs the baby in the base of the skull with curved \nscissors, and then uses a suction catheter to remove the child's brain.\n  As we have seen these trials go forward, I have been disturbed at \nsome of the testimony that has been given in opposition to this \nlegislation, and I wanted to ensure that my colleagues were aware of \nit.\n  In particular, in the testimony of these doctors who are challenging \nthis law, we see a complete disregard for any consideration of the pain \na child experiences during a late-term abortion. On March 30, in the \nNew York case, the judge asked the doctor testifying whether the fetus \nhaving pain ever crossed his mind. The witness, who does not perform \npartial birth abortions, but who has been present when they were done, \nreplied, ``No.'' The judge further questioned the witness as to whether \nthe mother of the child was informed as to the specifics of the \nprocedure in terms that the patient can understand.\n\n       The Witness: I guess I would say that whenever we describe \n     medical procedures we try to do so in a way that's not \n     offensive or gruesome or overly graphic for patients.\n       The Court: Can they fully comprehend unless you do? Not all \n     of these mothers are Rhodes scholars or highly educated, are \n     they?\n       The Witness: No, that's true. But I'm also not exactly sure \n     what using terminology like sucking the brains out would . . \n     .\n       The Court: That's what happens, doesn't it?\n       The Witness: Well, in some situations that might happen. \n     There are different ways it could be dealt with, but that is \n     one way of describing it.\n\n  This witness further testified that up until the last steps of a \npartial birth abortion, the feet of the child could be moving.\n  On April 5, another doctor testifying for the plaintiffs in New York \nshowed similar callous disregard for the pain the fetus might feel.\n\n       The Court: Do you ever tell them (the women) that after \n     that is done you are going to suction or suck the brain out \n     of the skull?\n       The Witness: I don't use suction.\n       The Court: Then how do you remove the brain from the skull?\n       The Witness: I use my finger to disrupt the central nervous \n     system, thereby the skull collapses and I can easily deliver \n     the remainder of the fetus through the cervix.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n       The Court: Do you tell them you are going to collapse the \n     skull?\n       The Witness: No.\n       The Court: The mother?\n       The Witness: No.\n       The Court: Do you tell them whether or not that hurts the \n     fetus?\n       The Witness: I have never talked to a fetus about whether \n     or not they experience pain.\n       The Court: I didn't say that, Doctor. Do you tell the \n     mother whether or not it hurts the fetus?\n       The Witness: I don't believe the fetus does feel pain at \n     the gestational ages that we do, but I have no evidence to \n     say one way or the other so I can't answer that question.\n\n  Yet even this week, Dr. Kanwaljeet Anand, a pediatrician at the \nUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and a witness in the \nNebraska case, testified that the procedure would cause ``severe and \nexcruciating'' pain to the fetus. He said, ``What we have noted from \nstudies of premature infants is that they have a much lower threshold \nfor pain, meaning they are more sensitive to pain than the full term \ninfant. In fact, some types of pain are three times greater sensitivity \nin the pre-term baby as compared to the full term neonate.'' He went on \nto say, ``I would say between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation is the \ngreatest sensitivity to pain.'' ``The threshold for pain is very low. \nThe fetus is very likely extremely sensitive to pain during the \ngestation of 20 to 30 weeks. And so the procedures associated with the \npartial-birth abortion that I just described would be likely to cause \nsevere pain, right from the time the fetus is being manipulated and \nbeing handled to the time that the incision is made, and the brain or \nthe contents, intracranial contents, are sucked out.''\n  Another aspect of the current court challenges to this law centers \naround whether partial birth abortions are ever medically necessary. \nThose arguing against the law have expressed their opinion that the \nprocedure is a medical necessity. The Department of Justice is \ndefending the law by supporting the extensive congressional findings \nincluded in the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act that indicate that \npartial birth abortions are never medically necessary. For this reason \nthe Department of Justice has sought the release of abortion records in \norder to demonstrate that partial birth abortions are never medically \nnecessary. In order to ensure patient privacy, any personal information \non these records which could identify a patient would be deleted prior \nto being submitted for review. Since those arguing against this law \nhave done so claiming the ``medical necessity of this procedure,'' it \nseems reasonable that they be required to show evidence which backs up \ntheir claims.\n  Those testifying in opposition of banning the use of this inhumane \nprocedure have continued to state its medical necessity. However, under \nquestioning from Department of Justice attorneys and Judge Casey in New \nYork, these abortionists have conceded that there are no studies which \nshow this procedure to be less risky for the mother than other types of \nlate-term abortions. They have also not been able to deliver any \nrecords showing its medical necessity, though this claim is at the core \nof their case. Some witnesses have indicated that this information \nwould be found in the patient's medical chart--the ones which they have \nrefused to release.\n  On April 6, Judge Casey in New York had this to say on April 6 \nregarding these medical records:\n\n       I have no comprehension why there is such resistance from \n     doctors maintaining as they argue as to the appropriateness, \n     the safety, etc., of these procedures, why the records, in \n     this case that book, should not be opened for examination. To \n     not have it turned over to the government continues not in a \n     fashion of a level playing field and I don't think was what \n     was envisioned as to how we should administer trials of this \n     nature or any trials in this court.\n       I would hope that the hospital would rethink their \n     position. I would also urge any of the plaintiffs, if they \n     have any records that are personal to them, that they don't \n     wait until, shall we say, by accident or whatever means they \n     are uncovered or stumbled upon; that they produce them, as \n     well they should know through their counsel that our system \n     believes in full discovery and disclosure, and concealing \n     facts or things in this context in our courts, in federal \n     court, is not something that is encouraged, just as the Court \n     has expressed a strong feeling that lawyers should be open \n     and completely candid in their statements to the Court.\n\n  I came to the floor today about this because I want my colleagues to \nbe aware of these cases as they go forward, and especially to point out \nexamples of some of the blatant disrespect being shown for the lives of \nthese partially-born children and their mothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4014-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MEN AND WOMEN'S NCAA BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS \n                   UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT HUSKIES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I come to the floor today to \ncongratulate the University of Connecticut Huskies' Men and Women's \nbasketball teams on their double national championship. This is the \nfirst time any school has accomplished this incredible feat. With this \nachievement, coaches Jim Calhoun and Geno Auriemma have solidified \ntheir place at the peak of college basketball's coaching mountain.\n  On Monday night, the men, lead by terrific performances by Emeka \nOkafor and Ben Gordon, defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 82-73. \nThis victory gave the men's program its second national title. On \nTuesday, the women, on the strength of a brilliant 17-point effort by \nDiana Taurasi, completed the Huskies' double dip, knocking off the \nTennessee Lady Vols by the score of 70-61 to capture their third \nstraight national championship and the fifth in the school's history.\n  These victories were captured with great teamwork, which was \nfortified by outstanding leadership. Not just from the two legendary \ncoaches, but from the players themselves. On the men's side, Emeka \nOkafor, whose dominating second half in the semi-finals against Duke is \nthe stuff of which legends are made. That performance, followed by his \nbrilliant 24 point 15 rebound effort in the championship game earned \nhim Most Outstanding Player in the Final Four honors, and will most \nlikely make him the top pick in this summer's NBA draft. On the women's \nside was Diana Taurasi. Diana's greatness speaks for itself. She lead \nthe Huskies to three straight national titles, compiled a career NCAA \ntournament record of 22-1, and was named Most Outstanding Player in the \nFinal Four the past two seasons.\n  This year started out with the greatest of expectations for both \nteams. They were both picked as pre-season No. 1 teams, but as the \nseason wore on, each had their share of adversity. Coach Calhoun and \nCoach Auriemma saw their teams suffer tough losses and key injuries. \nEach team's best player would battle through nagging injuries that made \nmany people question whether they had what it took to reach their \nchampionship aspirations. What is truly remarkable is that neither team \never doubted themselves. As the calendar turned to March, both teams \nbattled through the adversity, and began the long steady journey toward \ngreatness. After all the ups and downs of a long season, our UCONN \nHuskies finished the season where they started--on top of the college \nbasketball world.\n  Mr. President, today is a day of great pride for Connecticut. We are \nproud of Jim Calhoun, Geno Auriemma, and their terrific players. We \nthank them for their brilliance. We thank them for giving us such \ntremendous joy in watching them play. At a time when there are so many \nthings that divide us and have us concerned, it is so important to have \nsomething that unites us, lifts our spirits, and gives us a sense of \npride. Thanks to the Huskies' unprecedented accomplishment, today we \ncan truly say Connecticut is the College Basketball Capital of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4014-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4014-S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MINNESOTA ATHLETICS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it has been a great winter when it comes \nto Minnesota athletics. Last week I had the privilege to congratulate \nand recognize the achievements of the University of Minnesota Twin-\nCities women's hockey and basketball teams. Today, I switch schools and \ngenders to recognize and congratulate head coach Scott Sandelin and the \nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth Men's ice hockey team for their \nappearance in the NCAA Frozen Four. The Bulldogs will be making their \nthird NCAA Frozen Four appearance tomorrow, having previously appeared \nin 1984 and 1985.\n  The team and many of its fans are in Boston today, gearing up for the \nfast pace and the emotion that comes with playing in the Frozen Four on \nnational\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\ntelevision. The road to the Frozen Four can be difficult and demanding. \nI say ``can be difficult'' only because--well, the Bulldogs made it \nlook somewhat easy.\n  In convincing fashion, the Bulldogs defeated Michigan State 5 to 0 \nand the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities 3 to 1 to earn their first \nFrozen Four bid since 1985. Against arch-rival Minnesota-Twin Cities, \nthe Bulldogs stuck to a solid game plan, scored timely goals, and \nreceived phenomenal goaltending from Isaac Reichmuth, who also should \nbe recognized for his stellar shut-out of Michigan State.\n  While absent 19 years from the Frozen Four, the Bulldogs appearance \nin this year's Frozen Four is no surprise. After finishing the season \n28-12-4, and placing second in the Western Collegiate Hockey \nAssociation, the Bulldogs earned the second seed in the Midwest \nRegional of the NCAA tournament.\n  They are coached by Scott Sandelin. Coach Sandelin is a finalist for \nthe Spencer Penrose Award, the official award of the NCAA for Division \n1 coach of the year, and recently received Inside-college-hockey's \naward for Coach of the Year.\n  On the ice, the Bulldogs have been led all year by Hobey Baker \nfinalist Junior Lessard, who currently leads the Nation in goals and \nscoring. Lessard has also racked up two prestigious Player of the Year \nawards by Inside-college-hockey and U.S. College Hockey Online.\n  On the blue line, the Bulldogs are led by first team WCHA all-\nconference selection Beau Geisler, and as I mentioned before, Isaac \nReichmuch, himself a second team all conference selection, has been \nunbeatable in the pipes for the Bulldogs.\n  The Bulldog ice-hockey tradition runs deep. The program has placed \nover 34 of its student-athletes into the National Hockey League over \nthe past 35 years. Thanks to Bulldog legends such as Curt Giles, Pat \nBoutette, Brett Hull, Chris Marinucci, Derek Plante, and Shjon Podein, \nMinnesota-Duluth is one of the premier hockey schools in the Nation and \na source of deep pride for Duluth and all of Minnesota.\n  These young men, 15 of whom are native Minnesotans, are continuing \nthis tradition of excellence and deserve the recognition and excitement \nthat is accompanying their trip to the Frozen Four. Charter buses of \nMinnesotans have made the long trek to Beantown to cheer on their team \nand I, like them, look forward to a great match-up between the Bulldogs \nand the University of Denver tomorrow in Boston.\n  Congratulations to the University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs for \nwhat has been a stellar season, and best wishes on their ongoing quest \nfor the national championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4015-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GEORGIA TECH'S RAMBLIN WRECK MAKES GEORGIA PROUD\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to extend my congratulations to \nGeorgia Institute of Technology for the incredible performance of the \nYellow Jackets basketball team this year. Georgia Tech proved itself to \nbe a national power as it won game after game on its way to the NCAA \nfinal game.\n  I join all Georgians in admiration of the Yellow Jackets Head Coach \nPaul Hewitt, and his assistants Dean Keener, Willie Reese, and Cliff \nWarren for building a program which proved itself in national \ncompetition. I also want to congratulate the players who showed \nleadership, poise and class as they played great basketball against the \nbest teams in the country.\n  Georgia Tech is an important educational institution. Tech graduates \nlead the way in every aspect of the business and professional community \nin America. Its graduates are in high demand around the world for their \nskills and abilities. Its sports programs are also very well regarded.\n  The reputation of the Ramblin Wreck's athletic program can only grow \nhigher after this appearance in the NCAA tournament. When the season \nbegan, Georgia Tech was picked to finish seventh in the nine-team \nAtlantic Coast Conference. Instead it made it to its first Final Four \nappearance since 1990 and its first title game ever.\n  I salute the 2003-2004 Georgia Tech basketball team for a great year. \nThey have made all of Georgia proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4015-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RE-OPENING I-95 IN CONNECTICUT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in praise of the exemplary \nefforts of the construction and maintenance crews, engineers, and State \nand Federal transportation officials to quickly re-open Interstate 95 \nin Bridgeport, Connecticut, last week after a devastating fire \ndestroyed a portion of the highway. On behalf of the people of \nConnecticut, I offer them my deepest thanks for the hard work--and \nteamwork--that has restored a vital artery in our nation's \ntransportation system faster than anyone thought possible.\n  On Thursday evening, March 25, a car and a tanker truck collided \nwhile traveling along I-95 South in Bridgeport. The tanker truck, \ncarrying 12,000 gallons of home heating oil, tipped over and slid along \nthe barriers before stopping and, minutes later, the truck's contents \nignited, sending flames 50 to 60 feet into the air. Remarkably, no one \nwas killed or injured in the accident, and within 20 minutes \nfirefighters had extinguished the blaze, but the damage had been done. \nBoth the existing southbound bridge and a new bridge that had just been \nbuilt alongside of it were severely damaged.\n  I-95 in Connecticut--a traffic corridor of national significance that \nlinks New York City with Boston--was immediately shut down in both \ndirections over a distance spanning several exits. This caused major \ntraffic problems, especially for tractor-trailer drivers. Engineers \ndetermined that the northbound overpass could be shored up and made \nstructurally sound again, and additional supports were erected to \nreinforce the northbound span, which was reopened to traffic on Sunday \nnight, March 28. The southbound lanes, however, were beyond easy \nrepair, and engineers concluded that a temporary bridge would have to \nbe erected to support traffic on the southbound span of the highway. A \ntemporary bridge was supplied by Acrow Corp of Carlstadt, NJ. It \narrived in pieces and was assembled by crews from the Connecticut \nDepartment of Transportation, DeMatteo Construction, and Brunalli \nConstruction. By Sunday morning, the skeleton of the temporary bridge \nhad been fully assembled. A steel deck was then laid on top of it and \nthe surface was paved. The southbound lanes of I-95 were reopened on \nWednesday morning at 3:30 a.m.\n  Approximately 120,000 vehicles pass over this span of I-95 every day, \nand officials initially estimated that the highway would be closed for \nthree to four weeks. But the crews that performed the work managed to \nre-open it in just five days. This accomplishment cannot be overstated. \nI rise today to say thank you to the Connecticut DOT employees, Federal \nDOT officials, contractors and others who worked around the clock to \nmake it possible. Your service to our State is deeply appreciated, and \nwe commend you for your excellent work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4015-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4015-S4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JACK SMITH\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

She organized it as an \nindependent charity in 1999, and since then it has grown from helping a \ngroup of ten children to serving over a hundred children and sixty \nfamilies.\n  Today, The Children's Room is a beacon of hope and help for bereaved \nchildren and others in their family. It provides a safe and caring \nenvironment where children, teenagers and their families can obtain the \nsupport they need in grieving over the death of their loved ones.\n  Ms. Oliver's extraordinary caring, compassion, and dedication are the \nhallmarks of her career. In many ways, she's a pioneer in this very \nimportant field. She earned a Master's Degree in Counseling at Loyola \nCollege in Baltimore, with an internship in grief counseling at Hospice \nof the Chesapeake in Maryland and at Grandma's House, a Washington, \nD.C. home for children with AIDS.\n  As we all know, the need for these counseling services is especially \ngreat today, Judith Oliver's leadership is a model for all communities. \nMassachusetts is proud of her. We're fortunate to have her, and I join \nher many admirers in congratulating her on this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4016-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OREGON VETERANS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I rise to honor an Oregon \nveteran who answered the call of duty in service to his country. Grover \nJudd Killpack was born on January 24, 1924 in a small mining town \ncalled Mohrland, close to Price, UT.\n  Judd's military career began in October of 1943, when he entered the \nCoast Guard as an Seaman Apprentice. He was assigned to the USS \nCallaway, an attack transport ship that fought in the Pacific theater \nduring World War II. While on the Callaway, he ran one of the landing \nboats, transporting the soldiers to the fight and returning the wounded \nto the ship. He participated in six invasions in the Pacific, including \nthe Battle for Leyte Gulf and the Battle for Iwo Jiwa. Judd watched as \nthe Marines took control of the island and raised the flag on Mount \nSuribachi; a scene immortalized in the now-famous monument in \nArlington, VA.\n  After his tour of duty ended in May of 1946, he left the Coast Guard \nas a petty officer 3rd class and went home to Price, UT where he \nmarried Eva Milkovich. He attended Carbon College where he focused his \nstudies in the dairy field. He demonstrated his leadership skills as \nthe student body president. He transferred to Utah State University \nwhere he participated in the ROTC program and received his degree in \nDairy Technology. During this time Judd and Eve were blessed with a son \nand a daughter.\n  Judd took a sales job that led him and his family to Denver, CO. One \nday before his tour was over, his country called for his services once \nagain. He answered that call, leaving for the Korean War as a 2nd \nLieutenant in the Army in January of 1952. During his short time in the \nconflict he served as an artillery observer flying over enemy lines to \ndirect friendly fire on communist targets. He came home for good in \nNovember of 1952 as a 1st Lieutenant.\n  A new job opportunity brought Judd and his family to the northwest. \nThey stayed in Seattle, WA until January of 1955. They found their \npermanent home in Beaverton, OR and the Killpack family has lived there \nsince that day.\n  Judd went on to be a sales rep for the R Company in 1961 and spent \nthe rest of his working days with them, finally retiring in 1986. Judd \nhas been married to Eve since July 3, 1946 and has two children, five \ngrandchildren, and one great grandchild on the way.\n  For his selfless service to others, and to the United States in time \nof war, I salute Grover Judd Killpack as an Oregon Veteran \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4016-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4016-S4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week is National Public \nHealth Week, an annual event sponsored by the American Public Health \nAssociation or APHA. Every year in April, national, State and local \npublic health professionals highlight an important public health issue, \nto raise awareness about leading health problems impacting our nation. \nThis year, the theme of National Public Health Week is ``eliminating \nhealth disparities''.\n  There are many groups that experience disparities in health, largely \na result of limited access to important health care services. Living in \na rural area is in itself a health risk factor, due to numerous factors \nthat can adversely influence health and access and the resulting \ndisparities are well documented. Chronic illnesses are more prevalent \nin rural communities and studies have shown that rural residents are \nmore likely to describe their overall health status as poorer than \ntheir urban counterparts. Limitation in activity due to chronic health \nconditions among adults is more common in rural counties than in large \nmetro counties.\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\n  The University of Pittsburg's Center for Rural Health Practices \nreleased a report this week which highlights specific rural health \ndisparity issues. The report indicated that death rates for children \nand young adults are highest in the most rural counties. Nationally and \nwithin each region, death rates from unintentional injuries increases \ngreatly as counties become less urban. And death rates for motor \nvehicle-related injuries in most rural counties are over twice as high \nas the rates in central counties of large metro areas. My home State of \nSouth Dakota ranks 8th with two other States for having the worst motor \nvehicle death rate in the Nation.\n  In addition, adolescents living in the most rural counties are most \nlikely to smoke. For example, in 1999 for the United States as a whole, \n19 percent of adolescents in the most rural counties smoked compared \nwith 11 percent in metro counties. This disparity also holds true for \nadults who smoke. Adults in rural areas are more likely to consume \nalcohol than those living in other areas, and both men and women in \nrural areas have higher rates of self-reported obesity than men and \nwomen in other areas.\n  Minorities in rural areas also face additional health disparities. \nDiabetes among Native Americans is more than twice that of the general \npopulation, and heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of \ndeath among this population. Infant mortality among this population is \n1.7 times higher than among non-Hispanic whites and the sudden infant \ndeath syndrome or SIDS rate among this minority group is the highest of \nany population group in the nation.\n  It is important that we find ways to address rural public health \ndisparities. Access to health care providers is a critical component of \nthe solution and that is why I have long supported rural provider \npayment equity. Payment equity ensures that the doors stay open at our \nlocal hospitals and physicians offices. I feel that Congress needs to \ncontinue to address this important issue and make a commitment to rural \nresidents across America that it will support initiatives to remedy \nthis problem.\n  While payment equity is a critical component in solving this \ndisparity issue, it is only part of the overall solution. Access \nproblems continue to be a distinct challenge in rural communities, due \nlargely to declining rates of health care workers in these areas. In \n1998, there were six times as many general pediatricians per 100,000 in \ncentral counties of large metro areas as in the most rural counties and \nfive times as many general internists.\n  One of the ways to address this problem is through enhanced funding \nfor important Federal programs that promote the recruitment and \nretention of health care workers. I have recently sent letters to the \nleadership on the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, requesting a $63 million dollar increase \nfor Title VIII nurse education programs created under the Nurse \nReinvestment Act. I have also asked the committee to restore the \nPresident's proposed drastic cuts of almost $200 million for the Title \nVII health professions programs, by providing $308 million for these \nprograms.\n  In order to further address rural health disparities, we need to \nstrengthen efforts towards establishing a 21st century health care \nsystem that utilizes information technology to allow health care \nprofessionals across rural America to share their knowledge, expertise \nand resources. I have worked with my colleagues in the Senate to secure \nfunding in recent years to allow just that, such as the wonderful \nhealth information systems project through the Community HealthCare \nAssociation of South Dakota, and the nurse distance learning project \nthrough the University of South Dakota and the Good Samaritan Society. \nI encourage my colleagues to continue to build on these types of rural \nspecific projects nationwide so that we may see this dream of a modern \n21st century health care system become a reality.\n  In order to address the Native American health disparities problems, \nin addition to improving access to direct health care services, it is \nimportant that we obtain comprehensive data on key health risk factors \nimpacting this population. In South Dakota, the Northern Plains Tribal \nEpidemiology Center in Rapid City is providing information to tribes \nand working with tribes to help access health data through good \nassessment tools, which can be used to develop interventions and \nimprove the health in Native American communities across the State. \nThis is an effective model for approaching a critical minority health \nproblem and the Center combines epidemiology, research, and public \nhealth practice to develop interventions that can be disseminated to \nthe tribal communities.\n  Often our best solutions come from the local experts. I look forward \nto working with public health experts in both South Dakota, as well as \nthe Nation at large, to address these shortfalls in rural health. I \nbelieve that the information we gain through these discussions will \nprovide Congress with a broader scope of knowledge, thus allowing us to \nbetter meet the needs of those who fall into this health disparity \ncategory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4017-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4017-S4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JOHN THORNTON\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise today to tell my \ncolleagues about a generous person, who I am proud to call my friend \nand a Tennessean.\n  His name is John ``Thunder'' Thornton. You may have read about his \ngenerosity last week in USA Today.\n  In 1998, John went to the Final Four in San Antonio. While there, he \nhad a frightening experience--he has a heart attack in the back of a \ntaxi cab. His cab driver, Ceasar Hernandez, quickly drove him to the \nhospital and then made sure his teenage children, Dori and Johnny, got \nback to the hotel where family friends could take care of them.\n  In the USA Today article, John said, ``Caesar saved my life, and he \ncomforted my kids at a time when they needed that. I wanted to do \nsomething for him.''\n  So to show his appreciation 6 years ago, John bought the stranger who \nsaved his life a 1998 Cadillac sedan. The new car allowed Mr. Hernandez \nto start a cab company in his hometown of Victoria, TX instead of \ncommuting to San Antonio to drive a taxi.\n  John's gratefulness and graciousness doesn't end there. He returned \nto San Antonio last Friday for the Final Four. While there, he took Mr. \nHernandez to the games and dinner and also had a surprise in store. \nAnyone who knows John knows he's an avid fan of the University of \nTennessee. Ten years ago, he bought an orange and white stretch limo \nthat he's driven to UT games across the country. Now Mr. Hernandez's \ntaxi cab fleet includes that limousine.\n  This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Most \npeople in Tennessee know about John's gift to the University of \nTennessee in Knoxville to establish the Thornton Athletic Student Life \nCenter. But most people don't know that 10 years ago, when John sold \nhis business in Georgia, he paid off the mortgages of every employee \nthat worked for him.\n  As I said earlier, I am proud to call him my friend, and I am proud \nto call him a Tennessean. His father, Lloyd, and my father carpooled to \nwork at the Aluminum Company of America in Alcoa when John and I were \ngrowing up in Maryville.\n  The Lloyd L. Thornton stadium at Maryville College is named in honor \nof him--a tribute by his son.\n  On a personal note, I was proud to introduce John's daughter Dori, \nour Tennessee Cherry Blossom princess, at an event last week. She is a \nyoung Washington professional doing a fantastic job in political event \nplanning and fundraising for Hammond and Associates.

Mr. President, the management of National Public \nRadio has announced that Bob Edwards, the host of ``Morning Edition'' \nfor a quarter century, will be removed from the show at the end of this \nmonth. NPR executive vice president Ken Stern explained that getting \nrid of Edwards was part of ``a natural evolution.'' He says that it was \n``a programming decision about the right sound.''\n  ``Natural evolution?'' The ``right sound?'' I have no idea what these \nwords mean. In fact, I have yet to talk to anyone who knows what those \nwords mean.\n  If NPR's management wants to remove a star broadcaster, enormously \npopular all across America, you would think they would offer a clear, \ncoherent explanation. But, no, the best we are offered is that they \nwant a different ``sound.''\n  Well, this is not very sound on the part of NPR management. Think \nabout it: Bob Edwards has been the host of ``Morning Edition'' for 25 \nyears. He has won every radio broadcasting award imaginable, including \nthe 1999 Peabody Award. He has built ``Morning Edition'' into the No. 1 \nmorning show on radio in the United States, with almost 13 million \nloyal listeners. He has played a major role in doubling NPR's audience \nover the last 10 years.\n  Now, I didn't go to Harvard Business School. I don't have the \nbusiness and management credentials of the top executives at NPR. But I \nhave enough sense to heed the oldest and wisest rule of management: If \nit ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  If you are fortunate to have the best in the business, a broadcaster \nwho is the heart and soul of the No. 1 morning show on radio, then, for \nheaven's sake, you don't remove him. You don't dump him. You raise his \npay.\n  Characteristically, Bob Edwards was gracious and restrained. He said, \n``I would love to have stayed with `Morning Edition.' But it is not my \ncandy store.''\n  No, ``Morning Edition'' is not Bob Edwards' candy store. Nor is \nNational Public Radio the candy store of Mr. Stern, Jay Kernis, Kevin \nklose, and the other NPR executives apparently responsible for this \ndecision.\n  I would remind them that NPR's middle name is ``Public.'' National \nPublic Radio and its affiliate stations depend on taxpayer dollars and \ncontributions from ordinary Americans. NPR depends on the public's \nsupport. And I have yet to talk to one person, one member of Congress, \none listerner of public radio who supports this decision.\n  Americans are speaking up and expressing their unhappiness. NPR has \nbeen deluged with telephone calls and e-mails. And I certainly \nencourage people to call their local NPR station or go to the NPR \nwebsite at www.npr.org, where you can register your dissatisfaction. \nUrge NPR's executives to reconsider this unwise decision. Urge them to \nlisten to their listeners.\n  Let me be clear, I do not advocate or support any kind of boycott of \nNPR. It would be a misguided and counterproductive for people to \nwithhold contributions to their local NPR station. After all, National \nPublic Radio is a national treasure. It is the gold standard of radio \nnews and journalism. And we should do nothing that undermines it.\n  But we have a right to speak up. And we need to speak up. So by all \nmeans, send an e-mail to NPR. The address of the ombudsman at NPR is \nsimple enough: ombudsman@npr.org. In addition, call your local NPR \naffiliate. Urge them to request NPR to reconsider its decision to \nremove Bob Edwards from ``Morning Edition.'' And if NPR digs in its \nheels, urge your local affiliate to discontinue ``Morning Edition'' and \nfind alternative programming for the morning time slot.\n  Obviously, I am personally a big fan of Bob Edwards. I listen to him \nvirtually every morning, and have for as long as I can remember. He is \na straight-shooter, smart, erudite, witty, and calm. He doesn't shout \nor rant. In other words, he adds class to radio news reporting and \ninterviews.\n  So I urge executives at National Public Radio to reconsider their \ndecision to remove Bob Edwards from ``Morning Edition.'' And I urge \nAmericans who share my respect for Bob Edwards to make their voices \nheard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4018-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORIAM OF NORMAN A. LeBEL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nreflect on the life of Professor Norman A. LeBel, who passed away on \nDecember 21, 2003. Professor LeBel's life was dedicated to organic \nchemistry research where he was an outstanding example to his \ncolleagues and an inspiration to his students.\n  Professor LeBel was born in Augusta, Maine on March 22, 1931, and \nreceived an A.B. degree in chemistry from Bowdoin College in 1952. \nProfessor LeBel and his wife Connie, also from Maine, returned often to \nthe States.\n  Professor LeBel obtained a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology in 1957. He then moved to \nDetroit, MI, where he began a 40-year career at Wayne State University \nin the Department of Chemistry, during which time he directed the \nresearch of 32 Ph.D. students. Professor LeBel made numerous \ncontributions to organic chemistry during his long career, the most \nnotable being the development of the chemical transformation commonly \ncalled the LeBel Reaction. He retired in 1996, after serving Wayne \nState University as chairman of the chemistry department; as chief of \nstaff for the office of the provost; and as interim dean of the College \nof Liberal Arts.\n  Professor LeBel served the American Chemical Society (ACS) in a \nnumber of roles, starting as chairman of the Awards Committee of the \nDetroit Section (1961-1962), then secretary-treasurer of the Division \nof Organic Chemistry (1965-1969). He was a division councilor for 20 \nyears, starting in 1970, and served on the Committees on Publications, \nNominations & Elections, and Divisional Activities. Professor LeBel was \nalso general chairman of the international chemistry meeting known as \nPacifichem 2000.\n  Among his many awards, Professor LeBel received the Wayne State \nUniversity President's Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1981, the \nACS Organic Chemistry Division's Paul G. Gassman Distinguished Service \nAward in 1996, and the ACS Santa Clara Valley Section's Shirley B. \nRadding Award in 2001.\n  In conclusion, I want to express my condolences to Professor LeBel's \nfamily and former students. His contributions to the field of organic \nchemistry are only equaled by his devotion to higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4018-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4018-S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASSISTED LIVING\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Louisiana \nAssisted Living Association, LALA, which will be celebrating ``Assisted \nLiving Day'' open April 14, 2004 in the State capitol. Both in my home \nState and in States across the Nation, disabled individuals and older \nAmericans are voicing their demand for a wide range of long-term \nservices. Assisted living represents a significant piece of that \ncontinuum of care.\n  Decades ago, those in need of long-term care had limited options--\nfamily caregivers, skilled nursing homes or institutional care. In many \ncases, family caregivers cannot provide the proper level of care for \ntheir loved one for a variety of reasons. In other instances, the \nperson does not require the high level, around-the-clock care of a \nskilled nursing facility or institution. Now, many disabled persons and \nolder Americans with functional limitations and/or cognitive \nimpairments are finding the assistance they need and desire in assisted \nliving, and in other home and community-based settings.\n  Unfortunately, our Federal financing structure has a strong \ninstitutional bias and does not reflect Americans' growing desire to be \ncared for in settings other than nursing homes or institutions. Public \npreference is not the only momentum driving this need for change--we \nsee this direction in our courts as well. At the Federal level, the \nlandmark Olmstead decision underscored this push toward allowing our \ncountrys' elderly and disabled to live in the least restrictive \nsettings for as long as possible. And, in my home State of Louisiana, \nthis momentum was echoed in the Barthelemy case, in which the court \nstrengthened the rights of people to get assistance in\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nhome and community-based settings. We now know that we are not talking \nabout merely a preference for non-institutional care--but a legal right \nto it.\n  In my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, I have held numerous hearings on long-term care and the \nimportance of supporting the continuum of care options. Assisted living \nis one of the most significant of these options and offers a real \nchoice to those Americans wanting assistance outside of an \ninstitutional setting--a preference that will only grow as more of our \nbaby boomers look for help with long-term care. Today, I salute the \nLouisiana Assisted Living Association for taking time to educate and \nimprove awareness about a service that I believe can and will improve \nthe lives of many of our Nation's disabled and elderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4019-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING KAREN MAYRY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize an \nindividual who is a dedicated advocate for the blind in this Nation, \nand especially in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Karen was raised in Hibbing, MN. The second of five children, she \nlearned at an early age to cope with people's afflictions. Her brother \nRobert was born with Down syndrome. It was from this early exposure \nthat Karen gained some of the beliefs that would carry over in later \nlife. At age 11, Karen, herself was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes--the \ndisease that was to define the rest of her life.\n  In 1965, Karen married her long-time love, Marshall. While living in \nTacoma, WA, where Marshall was to finish out his military obligation, \nKaren found a job teaching in the Clover Park school system. In her \nfirst year on the job, she experienced her first hemorrhage in her \nright eye which resulted in complete vision loss in that eye. Because \nof her love of educating children, she remained on the job teaching \ndespite experiencing a traumatic physical ailment.\n  Marshall and Karen moved to Denver, CO after his military obligation \nwas fulfilled. While in Denver, Karen lost still more of her vision and \nfor all purposes became ``totally blind'' and underwent eye surgery \nwith the hope of restoring some vision to her right eye. The surgery \nwas deemed a cosmetic failure. It was also at this time, that doctors \ndiscovered that she was beginning to experience renal failure.\n  In 1969, Karen and Marshall moved to Rapid City where she was hired \non as a Juvenile Probation officer. She remained at the position for 6 \nyears until her renal failure had continued to progress so much that \nshe was no longer able to continue her duties. Experiencing kidney \nfailure soon after, her loving brother, David, offered one of his \nkidneys. After many months of complications delaying the surgery, the \ntransplant was successful. Three weeks later, she left the hospital and \nher kidney functions have remained excellent for the past 27 years.\n  Following the successful kidney treatment, she was approached by \nrepresentatives of National Federation of the Blind to become a member. \nThe philosophy of the NFB matched her own; one of independence and the \nabilities of blind persons, if given a chance. Soon after joining, she \nbecame active that same year and was elected state president, a quite \nremarkable accomplishment.\n  Karen Mayry is the long-time president of the South Dakota Federation \nof the Blind. For many years, she has provided tireless advocacy for \nthe blind residents of South Dakota and for the disabled population of \nthe State. Under her presidency the State affiliate has grown to five \nlocal chapters. She has proposed and lobbied for and had legislation \npassed bettering the lives of blind South Dakotans. She has testified \nbefore the Senate, investigating transportation for the handicapped and \nhas annually made trips to our Nation's Capital to lobby for issues of \nimportance to the blind of the country.\n  She is dedicated to advocating issues of importance, and she is \ncommitted to breaking down the structural and attitudinal barriers that \nimpact the blind and disabled community in south Dakota. Her list of \norganizations is vast and her accomplishments and awards are countless.\n  Despite various physical ailments in recent years, Karen refuses to \nbe sidelined and continues her stalwart advocacy. Her vitality and \nenergy is commendable and her advocacy and education over the years on \nissues affecting blind and disabled individuals have proven very \nsuccessful. She works hard to educate and advocate for the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, helps promote the skills and talents of the \nblind and educates the business community about the importance of \nhiring individuals with disabilities.\n  South Dakotans with disabilities have many fighters in their corner, \nand Karen Mayry is one of their most ardent advocates. Karen doesn't \nmince words with elected officials, I, for one, have appreciated her \nfrankness and candor over the years. Her insight is valuable on \nimportant issues, not only on matters directly affecting blind \nresidents, but also in issues vital to all South Dakotans, disabled and \nnon-disabled alike.\n  As residents in my State prepare for the annual South Dakota \nFederation of the Blind Convention in Sioux Falls, I take this \nopportunity to congratulate and commend Karen Mayry for her many years \nof outstanding advocacy work for the blind. I applaud her dedication \nand commitment, appreciate her advocacy, and wish her the best in her \nown individual battle to come. I look forward to continuing my work \nwith Karen concerning issues of importance to the blind and disabled \ncitizens of south Dakota. It is with great honor that I share her \nimpressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4019-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ALISA BARTON\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Salvation \nArmy welfare coordinator Alisa Barton was honored nationwide with an \nAward of Excellence in Social Service at the National Social Services \nConference in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, March 20.\n  As former military child and wife, Mrs. Barton knows firsthand the \nhardship Army families can experience, especially during times of \ndeployment. Mrs. Barton has continuously worked to help alleviate the \nneeds of families remaining at home while their loved ones serve this \ncountry in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  She developed a program called Homefront War Relief, which has \nreceived national recognition for helping the families of deployed Fort \nCampbell soldiers. The Homefront War Relief program, partnered with \nWal-Mart, allowed the Salvation Army to assist 743 military families \nresulting in the largest military assistance effort the Salvation Army \nof Hopkinsville has ever done. Throughout 2003, 5,000 military \npersonnel and their families received assistance in the form of comfort \nkits to deployed soldiers, food and clothing, holiday meals, and Bibles \nand inspirational books to troops.\n  Mrs. Barton is dedicated to helping those who come to the Salvation \nArmy in need. She began working with the Salvation Army by ringing \ndonations bells and describes her work as a labor of love spreading the \nChristian faith and helping people. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring Mrs. Barton. She is a wonderful asset to Kentucky and an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4019-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4019-S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING MARSHALL ALL-STAR CHEERLEADERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Juan \nMejia for his achievement in becoming the Tulare County spelling bee \nchampion and his entrance into the prestigious National Spelling Bee in \nWashington D.C.\n  Juan was born in Guzman, Mexico and moved to the United States when \nhe was a year and a half old. He learned English while attending pre-\nschool at a Head Start Program at Sundale School. Continuing on to Kohn \nElementary he distinguished himself as a bright and motivated student \nand was accepted into the GATE program for gifted students. Now at Live \nOak Middle School he continues to excel in his studies and extra-\ncurricular activities.\n  Juan Mejia's achievement in the Tulare County Spelling Bee is \nparticularly notable because of his late introduction to the English \nlanguage. By working hard and using all available resources, Juan \novercame an educational barrier to become a master of the English \nlanguage. For his focus, fortitude and determined work, I congratulate \nhim and wish him the best of luck in the National Spelling Bee in \nWashington D.C. Regardless of the outcome in the National Spelling Bee, \nJuan Mejia is a tremendous success and a worthy example of how \nchallenges can be met and overcome with focused effort and \nperseverance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4020-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF DOUG HARRISON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Doug \nHarrison's lifetime of service to the Fresno Metropolitan Flood Control \nDistrict, and most importantly, the people of Fresno County.\n  In 1970, Doug Harrison began a career with the FMFCD. He served as \ngeneral manager for 31 years. Mr. Harrison led the effort that designed \nand implemented a storm drainage system that ended regular flooding \nwhich had plagued residences and businesses for generations. Under his \nleadership, the construction of flood retention basins throughout the \nFresno-Clovis metropolitan area became part of a network of groundwater \nrecharge facilities, and in recent years Mr. Harrison led efforts to \nwork with community groups, such as Tree Fresno, to landscape many of \nthese facilities. The result has been the protection of property, \nreplenishment of vital groundwater resources and beautiful greenspace, \nas well as recreational facilities at many basins.\n  Mr. Harrison is an exemplary public servant, who has worked \ntirelessly for a broad constituency. He has made the lives of many \npeople better. His innovation, energy and dedication will be missed. To \nhim, I say thank you. He is a public servant in the best and truest \nsense of the word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4020-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I commend the Kennesaw State \nUniversity Owls basketball team for winning its first NCAA Division II \nnational championship title. In the 84-59 victory over Southern \nIndiana, the Owls showed great poise. After the Screaming Eagles \nsprinted to an eight-point lead, the Owls settled down, regained the \nlead and never lost it. The team, which moved up to the NCAA Division \nII Peach Belt Conference in 1994, took the championship in only their \nsecond appearance at the NCAA Division II national tournament.\n  The title capped a 35-4 season record, which had ended with a 26-game \nwinning streak and the Peach Belt championship.\n  I commend Coach Tommy Ingle, his assistant coaches Jeff Jones and \nStace Tedford, for developing and leading this strong team of student \nathletes. Coach Ingle was able to take the team to a national title in \nonly his second year at the helm. That is extremely impressive.\n  I also want to praise the players themselves, including seniors \nReggie McCoy, Terrence Hill, and Justin Thompson for displaying \nleadership, determination, skill and sportsmanship. This young \nbasketball squad has already made its mark in college basketball.\n  In addition to their basketball performance, the Fighting Owls have \ndemonstrated the personal qualities that make them a credit to one of \nGeorgia's great institutes of higher learning, and a credit to the \ngreat State of Georgia as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4020-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSUMPTION GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nAssumption Greek Orthodox Church, the second Greek Orthodox \ncongregation to be formed in the state of Michigan. Events celebrating \nthe 75th anniversary of Assumption Church began in 2003 and will \ncontinue in 2004 with a grand banquet to be held on April 24. These \nevents bring together members of the congregation, as well as thousands \nof others from throughout the metropolitan Detroit area and around the \ncountry, to mark this milestone in the history of Assumption Church.\n  At the turn of the century, many Greek immigrants settled in cities \nand towns across the nation. Greek immigrants established a thriving \ncommunity in Detroit, in what has become known as Greektown. Seventy-\nfive years ago, seven men from the growing Greek community on Detroit's \n``eastside'' met to lay plans for a parochial school and a place of \nworship that would be close to their homes. They sought to continue the \ntradition of teaching the Greek language and history to their \ncommunity. In 1930, with the blessing of the Patriarch of \nConstantinople, the first Church Council established the Assumption \nChurch at Hillger and Kercheval in Detroit. The Church was formally \nnamed ``Koimisis tis Theotokou'' meaning ``The Dormition of the Virgin \nMary.''\n  The Church experienced steady growth in both the number of families \nthat joined the parish and the number of new programs that served the \nneeds of the parishioners. Beginning with its first Greek school \n``Socrates,'' the Church added various programs for its youth, women, \nand senior citizens, and continued to expand its philanthropic and \nreligious outreach. The parishioners' reputation as a thriving, caring \ncongregation grew and attracted families from Detroit's suburbs and \nbeyond. Today, more than 1,200 families belong to Assumption Church, \nmaking it the largest parish in the region and one of the largest \nparishes in the Archdiocese.\n  The Assumption Greek Orthodox Church family moved several times over \nthe years before building the current facilities in St. Clair Shores, \nwhich include the notable Assumption Cultural Center. They built \nchurches at Beniteau and Vernor Highway and on Charlevoix that serve \nProtestant congregations today. Like these stalwart structures that are \nreminders of the congregation's vision and faithfulness, Assumption's \nspiritual leaders have been significant pillars in the community. The \nfirst priest, Father Christopher Makris, arrived in Detroit from \nChicago. His service was followed by 11 clergy leaders and several \nlaity, who have been represented in the highest positions of service \nnationally in matters of religious education, stewardship, athletics, \nthe St. John Chrysostom Oratorical festival and various missionary \nactivities. Father Demetrios Kavadas provided spiritual leadership for \n39 years and is Assumption's longest serving clergyman. In 2003, Father \nEpihanios Perialas became interim pastor and honored the parish through \nhis elevation to Metropolitan of Spain and Portugal. Father Michael \nVarlamos became pastor in 2003 and continues to serve in that capacity \ntoday. Unfortunately, the Church experienced a devastating fire on \nDecember 21, 2002, that destroyed the interior of the Church along with \nits beautiful iconography. The Church was promptly restored and re-\nopened its doors almost one year to the day, in December 2003.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the congregation of \nAssumption Greek Orthodox Church for achieving 75 years of devotion to \nGod, their faith, and excellence in serving their members and the \nsurrounding communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4020-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4020-S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4020-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4020-S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4021-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4021-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3550.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to disabled military \n     retirees; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, a penalty is imposed against disabled military \n     retirees for concurrent receipt of retirement and disability \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, if a member of the armed forces retires with 20 or \n     more years of service to this country, earning retirement \n     compensation, and this same retiree has a major disability \n     resulting from wounds or service connected activities, $1 \n     from his or her retirement check is deducted for each dollar \n     of disability payment received; and\n       Whereas, this law requires retired military personnel to do \n     something no one else in America is obligated to do--pay for \n     their own disability; and\n       Whereas, for many years, veterans' organizations and \n     disabled veterans battled to change this law; and\n       Whereas, last year, Congress recognized that disabled \n     military retirees had a legitimate complaint and introduced \n     legislation that was designed to correct this policy; and\n       Whereas, included within the National Defense Authorization \n     Act For Fiscal Year of 2002 is legislation that will end this \n     discriminatory practice of deducting disability compensation \n     from retirement pay. However, the legislation will be \n     effective only if the President requests money to cover its \n     costs in his next budget; and\n       Whereas, these disabled military retirees fought in World \n     War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and a dozen brush \n     fire wars in unremembered countries, risking everything for \n     our country. They gave of their youth and health, only to be \n     retired with a disability that they are forced to pay for out \n     of their own pockets; and\n       Whereas, the discrimination our country has displayed for \n     its disabled military retirees should not be passed on to \n     those young people who are now fighting our War Against \n     Terrorism; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to urge the Congress of the \n     United States to fund the National Defense Authorization Act \n     For Fiscal Year of 2002, to eliminate the penalty imposed \n     against disabled military retirees for concurrent receipt of \n     retirement and disability compensation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the President of the Senate, and each Member \n     in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-389.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to commending Title IX of \n     the Education Amendments of 1972; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, June 23, 2002, marks the celebration of the 30th \n     anniversary of Title IX of the Education Amendments enacted \n     by the United States Congress and signed into law in 1972, \n     and upon this occasion, it is deserving of special public \n     commendations; and\n       Whereas, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, \n     which is one of the most significant pieces of federal \n     legislation passed in the 20th century, prohibits \n     discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and \n     activities at education institutions that receive federal \n     funds, and it is an omnibus education law affecting all \n     curricular and extracurricular offerings, from medicine, law, \n     and science to drama, dance, and athletics; and\n       Whereas, girls and women throughout the ages have \n     participated in a variety of sports and physical activities \n     in school, community, and club programs; and\n       Whereas, prior to the passage of Title IX, there were few \n     opportunities for girls and women to participate in high \n     school or college athletics; and\n       Whereas, participation in sports is acknowledged as a \n     positive force in developing and promoting physical, mental, \n     moral, social, and emotional well-being, and it is well-\n     established that participation in athletics builds self-\n     esteem, communication skills, discipline, and perseverance, \n     all qualities that make a positive and significant \n     difference in the quality of life and in the level of \n     accomplishment; and\n       Whereas, participation in girls youth and high school \n     sports leagues has risen to a record level, and participation \n     by female collegiate athletes now represents 41 percent of \n     all varsity athletes; and\n       Whereas, girls who participate in sports have the \n     opportunity to develop strong interpersonal relationships \n     while learning teamwork, goal-setting, and other achievement-\n     oriented behaviors; and\n       Whereas, participation in athletics strengthens family \n     bonds between young women and their parents who may have \n     participated in athletics themselves, and engaging in \n     physical activities and sporting events as a family unit \n     further enhances family bonds; and\n       Whereas, teenage female athletes are less likely to use \n     marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit drugs, less likely to be \n     suicidal, less likely to smoke, and more likely to have \n     positive body images than female nonathletes, and woman \n     student athletes graduate at a significantly higher rate than \n     women students in general; and\n       Whereas, teengage female athletes are 50 percent less \n     likely to become pregnant as female nonathletes, less likely \n     to have sex as teenagers than female nonathletes, and more \n     likely to postpone their first sexual experience than female \n     nonathletes; and\n       Whereas, many female athletes have distinguished themselves \n     as representatives of California and the nation in \n     international competition and the Olympic Games, and during \n     the 2000 Summer Olympics, women competed for the first time \n     in the same number of team sports as men; and\n       Whereas, professional female athletes now compete in \n     leagues such as the Women's United Soccer Association, the \n     Women's National Basketball Association, the Women's Tennis \n     Association, the Ladies Professional Golf Association, \n     Women's Professional Softball League, and the Women's \n     Professional Football League, and the United States \n     Professional Volleyball League will launch in 2002; and\n       Whereas, the increased visibility of female athletes \n     provide people, young and old, female and male, with positive \n     role models, and many women agree that seeing successful \n     female athletes make them feel great pride as women; and\n       Whereas, Title IX continues to break down the gender \n     barriers in educational institutions, giving women the \n     opportunity to strive and achieve for excellence and realize \n     the best within themselves; and\n       Whereas, women of all ages should be encouraged to compete \n     and contribute to sports at all levels of competition and to \n     ensure opportunity for the next generation of female athletes \n     and sports leaders as we enter the new millennium; now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and Congress of the \n     United States to do all of the following:\n       (1) Stand firm in their resolve to uphold the intent and \n     substance of the current provision of Title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972.\n       (2) Pursue a strong enforcement policy for Title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 and strengthen the compliance \n     and enforcement policies of the U.S. Department of \n     Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR).\n       (3) Support the continuation of the strong compliance \n     standards that are currently in place for Title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972.\n       (4) Encourage all Americans to participate in the national \n     celebration, ``Celebrating 30 Years of Title IX'';

A bill to help American families save, invest, and build a \nbetter future, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Better Future for \nAmerican Families Act. Today's legislation will strengthen progressive \ntax credits to help middle-class families save, invest, and get ahead.\n  For more than 200 years, our country has been propelled by this \nsingle, powerful idea: All Americans should have the opportunity to \nrise as far as their hard work and God-given potential can take them. \nIn the last generation, however, the American Dream of building \nsomething better has been replaced with the hope of just getting by.\n  Due to the rising costs of housing, health care, and other \nnecessities, many families are no longer saving for the future. In \nfact, they need to borrow to get through the present. Personal \nbankruptcies reached an all-time high of 1.6 million a year in 2002. \nAlmost one in five households approaching retirement can expect to \nretire in poverty, and this rate is even higher for African American \nand Hispanic households. The middle-class--the foundation of this \ncountry--is sinking.\n  If we want to create new wealth in this country, we should start by \nrewarding the work and responsibility of America's families. What's \nright for our economy, our democracy, and our society is consistent \nwith our values as well: Every American should have the chance to be an \nowner--to buy a home, save for college, invest in America, or put money \naside for a secure retirement.\n  In current law, there is a Saver's Credit that matches retirement \nsavings of low-income families up to dollar-for-dollar. The credit has \nbeen a success, but it does suffer from some limitations.\n  First, the Saver's Credit will expire in 2006. The Republican budget \nplan fails to extend it, even as it extends other tax cuts enacted in \n2001. My legislation would make it permanent.\n  Second, the credit phases out rapidly, providing only a small benefit \nto many middle-income families and creating high marginal tax rates for \nmillions of savers. My legislation would expand benefits for families \nearning less than $50,000.\n  Finally, although 57 million taxpayers are eligible for the maximum \ncredit on paper, 80 percent of them cannot actually benefit from it \nbecause they lack income tax liability. These are families that need \nhelp as much as anyone, and my legislation would make them eligible for \nthe credit.\n  This legislation would make a real difference for American families. \nA family that saves the maximum under this plan every year from age 25 \nto retirement will have a nest egg of $200,000 on top of any other \nsavings, pensions, and Social Security.\n  Here in Congress, it is our responsibility to make sure that families \nworking for a living have the tools they need to move forward. My \nlegislation is not about creating another government program to protect \nfamilies; it is about helping families help themselves.\n  If we help families save, we can unleash a new era of possibilities \nwith a stronger economy because we're saving and investing more; with \nfamilies at ease because they have financial security; and with our \nchildren prospering because they have a strong foundation on which to \nbuild. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize programs that support economic and \npolitical development in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia and \nsupport for three new multilateral institutions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Greater \nMiddle East and Central Asia Development Act of 2004 with my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman. This bill supports economic and private sector \ndevelopment in the countries of the Greater Middle East and Central \nAsia.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 signaled a turning point \nin United States foreign policy. Al-Qaida and affiliated groups have \nestablished a terrorist network with linkages in Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nthroughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, and around the \nworld. The war on terrorism requires that the United States consider \nthe Greater Middle East and Central Asia as a strategic region with its \nown political, economic and security dynamics. While rich in cultural, \ngeographic and language diversity, the Greater Middle East and Central \nAsia face common impediments to economic development and political \nfreedom. Although poverty and economic underdevelopment alone do not \n``cause'' terrorism, the expansion of economic growth, free trade, and \nprivate sector development can contribute to an environment that \nundercuts radical political tendencies that give rise to terrorism.\n  The economic problems of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia \ncannot be considered in isolation. We must work with the governments \nand peoples of the region on a cohesive program of political and \neconomic reforms that builds a better future. We cannot lose the next \ngeneration to hopelessness and despair. Our initiatives must support \nprogress toward market economies, enhanced trade, the development of \ndemocratic institutions, expansion of citizen-to-citizen contacts, \neducational reform, and private sector development. UN Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan has said that we cannot reach the UN's goals for \nimproving health, education, and living standards over the next 12 \nyears ``without a strong private sector in the developing countries \nthemselves, to create jobs and bring prosperity.'' This region needs \nmore jobs, economic growth, a vibrant private sector, and good \ngovernance practices to help stabilize societies and lead to a stronger \nfoundation for political reform and conflict prevention.\n  President Bush has committed the United States to a ``forward \nstrategy of freedom'' in the Greater Middle East to combat terrorism \nand encourage reform in these countries. This is a multi-layered \nstrategy, including increased spending and support for the National \nEndowment for Democracy, greater emphasis on public diplomacy, and \ninitiating programs that support political liberalization and free \nmarkets. The G-8 summit in June and other forthcoming multi-lateral \nforums will provide opportunities to consult with our allies on many of \nthese issues. Similarly, Senator Dick Lugar, chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, has called for a Greater Middle East \nTwenty First Century Trust as part of a program of greater engagement \nwith this region, and Senator Joseph Biden, ranking member on the \ncommittee, has proposed a Middle East Foundation to support political \nparticipation and civil society in the Middle East.\n  Our bill deepens and expands America's commitment to economic reform \nand private sector development in the Greater Middle East and Central \nAsia by authorizing $1 billion per year for five years and creating \nthree new multilateral mechanisms: a Greater Middle East and Central \nAsia Development Bank to promote private sector development; a Greater \nMiddle East and Central Asia Development Foundation to implement and \nadminister economic and political programs; and a Trust for Democracy \nto provide small grants to promote development of civil society.\n  These are not traditional foreign aid programs. Our legislation seeks \nto help stimulate private sector development, promote strong market \neconomies, invigorate trade relations within the region, and empower \nstates to rebuild and open their economies. Through a combination of \ngovernment initiative and flexible private sector financing, we can \nbring the resources and expertise needed to launch a new beginning for \neconomic development to the Greater Middle East and Central Asia. Our \nbill also encourages the State Department and other relevant government \nagencies to consider new and creative approaches to coordination of \npolitical and economic support for the region.\n  Over the past 2 years, the United States has spent at least $120 \nbillion on our military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Investing in \npolitical and economic development is equally important in order to \nachieve stability in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia. \nPromoting trade and economic growth in the region complements our \npolitical and diplomatic objectives in the war on terrorism. People \nneed hope for better lives. We cannot succeed in our war on terrorism \nuntil hope replaces despair among the next generation in the Greater \nMiddle East and Central Asia.\n  Just this week, the editorial page of the Omaha World-Herald, my \nState's leading newspaper, supported the Bush administration's efforts \nto encourage economic openness among Muslim nations. Our bill today \ncomplements these worthy initiatives. Working with our allies to \nencourage free market development and political liberalization in the \nMuslim countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia would \ncreate, in the World-Herald's words, ``a win-win situation'' for the \nUnited States and those Muslim countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                S. 2305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Greater Middle East and \n     Central Asia Development Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize assistance for \n     political freedom and economic development, particularly \n     through private sector development, in the Greater Middle \n     East and Central Asia, including contributions to and \n     participation in 3 new entities: a Trust for Democracy, a \n     Development Foundation, and a Development Bank.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, signaled a \n     turning point in United States foreign policy.\n       (2) Al Qaeda and affiliated groups have established a \n     terrorist network with linkages in Afghanistan, Pakistan, \n     throughout the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, and \n     around the world.\n       (3) The war on terrorism requires that the United States \n     consider the Greater Middle East and Central Asia as a \n     strategic region with its own political, economic, and \n     security dynamics.\n       (4) While rich in cultural, geographic, and language \n     diversity, the Greater Middle East and Central Asia face \n     common impediments to economic development and political \n     freedom.\n       (5) Although poverty and economic underdevelopment do not \n     alone cause terrorism, the expansion of economic growth, free \n     trade, and private sector development can contribute to an \n     environment that undercuts radical political tendencies that \n     give rise to terrorism.\n       (6) Given the relationship between economic and political \n     development and winning the global war on terror, America's \n     support for freedom in the Greater Middle East and Central \n     Asia must be matched with expanded and new programs of \n     partnership with the people and governments of the region to \n     promote good governance, political freedom, private sector \n     development, and more open economies.\n       (7) The United States and other donors should support those \n     citizens of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia who \n     share our desire to undertake reforms that result in more \n     open political and economic systems.\n       (8) Turkey, which should be supported in its aspirations \n     for membership in the European Union, plays a pivotal and \n     unique role\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\n     in efforts to bring economic development and stability to the \n     Greater Middle East and Central Asia.\n       (9) The President should seek new mechanisms to work \n     together with European and other nations, as well as with the \n     countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia to \n     promote political and economic development in the Greater \n     Middle East and Central Asia.\n       (10) Because the dynamics of the Greater Middle East and \n     Central Asia have a serious impact on global security, the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should now shift \n     its strategic focus to the region, including expanded roles \n     in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Mediterranean.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION; SPECIAL RULE.\n\n       (a) Greater Middle East and Central Asia Defined.--In this \n     Act, the term ``Greater Middle East and Central Asia'' means \n     the 22 nations of the Arab world (Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, \n     Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, \n     Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine/West Bank/Gaza, Qatar, \n     Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab \n     Emirates, and Yemen), Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, \n     Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and \n     Uzbekistan.\n       (b) Special Rule.--A country listed in subsection (a) may \n     not receive assistance under this Act if such country is \n     identified as a country supporting international terrorism \n     pursuant to section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration \n     Act of 1979 (as in effect pursuant to the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), \n     section 40(d) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2780(d)), section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2371), or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     is authorized to provide assistance to countries of the \n     Greater Middle East and Central Asia for the purpose of \n     promoting economic and political freedoms, free trade, and \n     private sector development, including the programs described \n     in the following paragraphs:\n       (1) United states contribution to and membership in a \n     greater middle east and central asia development bank.--The \n     President is authorized to work with other donors and the \n     countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia to \n     establish a Greater Middle East and Central Asia Development \n     Bank to promote private sector development, trade, including \n     intra-regional trade, and investment in the Greater Middle \n     East and Central Asia.\n       (2) Creation of a greater middle east and central asia \n     development foundation.--The President is authorized to work \n     with other donors and the countries of the Greater Middle \n     East and Central Asia to establish a multilateral Greater \n     Middle East and Central Asia Development Foundation to assist \n     in the administration and implementation of assistance \n     programs, including public-private programs, pursuant to this \n     Act, with specific emphasis on programs at the grass-roots \n     level, to include volunteer-based organizations and other \n     nongovernmental organizations that support private sector \n     development, entrepreneurship, and development of small- and \n     medium-size enterprises and exchanges.\n       (3) Creation of trust for democracy.--The President is \n     authorized to establish, together with other donors and \n     private sector and nongovernmental leaders from the Greater \n     Middle East and Central Asia, a multilateral, public-private \n     Trust for Democracy to support grass-roots development of \n     civil society, democratic reform, good governance practices, \n     and rule of law reform in the Greater Middle East and Central \n     Asia. Private foundations shall be encouraged to participate \n     in the Trust through the provision of matching funds.\n\n     SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COORDINATION OF \n                   ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES OF THE GREATER MIDDLE \n                   EAST AND CENTRAL ASIA.\n\n       Recognizing the importance of coordination of assistance to \n     the countries of the Greater Middle East and Central Asia, \n     and the strategic imperatives required by the war on \n     terrorism, it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of State and the heads of other relevant \n     Government agencies should consider new approaches to the \n     coordination of the provision of political and economic \n     support for the countries of the Greater Middle East and \n     Central Asia; and\n       (2) the Secretary of State should consider appointing a \n     Coordinator for Assistance to the Greater Middle East and \n     Central Asia.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Madam President, I rise today, along with my friend \nand colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, to introduce the Greater \nMiddle East and Central Asia Development Act of 2004. This would be a \nMarshall Plan for the Greater Middle East.\n  Let me put it in the context of the news we are receiving from Iraq \ntoday. While public opinion surveys that have been taken by independent \ngroups have shown recently that the substantial majority of the people \nof Iraq, quite understandably, are grateful that Saddam Hussein is no \nlonger in power, and while a majority of them are optimistic about \ntheir future--a better life for themselves and their children--it is \nclear, of course, every day there is a growing group of Saddam \nloyalists left over from the previous regime, and terrorists, fanatical \njihadists, insurgents who will attack and kill Americans and Iraqis to \nstop the forward movement of progress and freedom and prosperity in \nIraq.\n  We clearly have to respond to that with force in defense of our \nvalues, of liberty, of freedom for the Iraqis. We have, if you will \nallow me to use Scriptural words, to employ our swords. But it is also \ntrue in Iraq and throughout the world that we will only win the war on \nterrorism if we use not just our swords but plowshares as well. That is \nwhat this piece of legislation Senator Hagel and I are introducing \ntoday is all about.\n  I want to speak for a few moments about it. Senator Hagel will be \nover later in the day to offer his remarks on the bill.\n  Madam President, a half century ago, at the dawn of the cold war, \nCongress authorized the Marshall Plan for Europe--a bold initiative \ninspired by Secretary of State George Marshall and premised on a simple \nbut transformational idea: that to stop communism, we had to rebuild \nand democratize Europe. The Marshall Plan offered monetary aid, of \ncourse, but it offered much more. It was a national commitment of \nAmerican values to transform the future of Europe by offering the \nEuropeans the blessings of liberty and prosperity, and thereby\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nlinking, in the deepest way, Europe's future with our own. The same \nideals and goals of the Marshall Plan can and must now be applied to \nthe people of the Greater Middle East.\n  The predominantly Muslim countries of the Middle East and Central \nAsia have, unfortunately, emerged at this moment in history as the \ncradle of fanatical Islamic jihadist terrorism. There is a great civil \nwar being fought in the Arab world between the peace-loving, law-\nabiding majority of Muslims and the minority of jihadists. This civil \nwar unleashed the violent terrorist forces that led to September 11, \n2001, the attacks on America; March 11, 2004, the attacks on Spain; and \nthe repeated attacks in places such as Fallujah in Iraq that are \noccurring almost every day. The outcome of our war against Islamic \nterrorists will be determined by the way in which we use our swords and \nour plowshares to determine the outcome of the civil war in the Muslim \nworld.\n  To stop al-Qaida and other terrorist groups from expanding this civil \nwar and recruiting a new generation of killers, we must use all of our \nmilitary power to capture and kill the enemy. We must drain the swamps \nof terrorists in Iraq and wherever they grow.\n  At the same time we must combat the conditions that fuel terrorism \nand drive recruits to al-Qaida and hate and despair. To do this we must \nseed the garden, not just drain the swamp, with freedom, hope, and \neconomic opportunity. If we invest in the political and economic future \nof the Middle East and Central Asia in our time, as we did in Europe \nwith the Marshall plan after the end of the Second World War and at the \nbeginning of the cold war, we will expand democracy's reach, choke off \nthe terrorists, strengthen our own national security, and move the \nworld toward greater peace.\n  That is the underlying premise of the legislation Senator Hagel and I \nare introducing today. It is designed to complement our swords in the \nwar against terrorism with the plowshares of political and economic \nassistance.\n  Our legislation is not soft. It is not welfare. It is in fact a \ndifferent kind of warfare on the battlefield of ideas and ideologies, \nvisions for the future. Although there are compelling humanitarian \nreasons for offering assistance to the people of the Greater Middle \nEast, there are also compelling American national security reasons for \ndoing so. The political and economic assistance Senator Hagel and I are \nproposing might be though of as additional weapons in America's arsenal \nin the fight against terrorists.\n  Let me summarize what our legislation contains. We advocate making a \nmajor financial investment in the future of the Middle East and Central \nAsia. How we propose making this investment is in some ways as \nsignificant as how much we propose investing. The key to the success of \nour Marshall plan for the Middle East, as it was of the Marshall plan \nfor Europe, is it is not a detailed list of programs. It is a statement \nof values and purposes. It is the creation of a structure to carry out \nthose values and purposes, and it is a commitment of American and \ninternational resources to realize those purposes.\n  Our legislation would create three new international institutions \nthat will support economic and political development in the Greater \nMiddle East and Central Asia, open institutions that will require \nparticipation by representatives of the countries benefiting from this \nsupport, a partnership. Institutionalizing involvement of a wide group \nof donors and recipients will promote better cooperation and give \nownership and accountability to the impacted nations and to the private \nreformers in those nations--key ingredients to successful foreign \nassistance.\n  The first new institution Senator Hagel and I would create is a trust \nfor democracy for the Middle East that would support the development of \ncivil society in the region, not unlike efforts we made to help those \nwho had the dream of freedom and opportunity in countries of the former \nSoviet Union, now living to experience that dream. Modeled on the \nBalkan Trust for Democracy, this institution we propose would marshal \nthe support of civic leaders and reformers as well as private \nfoundations to provide grants to worthy grassroots projects that \nsupport free association and promote civic responsibility, the building \nblocks of democracy.\n  Second, Senator Hagel and I would build a multilateral development \nfoundation that would provide a second track for assistance, together \nwith other donors, assistance that would be additional to that already \nbeing provided bilaterally by the U.S. and other international donors. \nThis foundation will be a public place where we and other donors can \ncome together with the countries of the region to set priorities \ntogether, to work together for the greater good of this troubled \nregion. Many countries in the Greater Middle East are richer than they \nare developed, meaning their wealth has not translated to economic \nprogress for most of the people. We would invite all governments in the \nregion to sit on the board of this foundation, and we would ask all to \ncontribute financially and programmatically to it.\n\n  Finally, our legislation would establish a new Middle East and \nCentral Asia development bank, like the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development. This bank would include private sector \nparticipation and would underwrite large-scale infrastructure projects \nin the region. It would also have a microcredit lending facility and a \nproject development facility.\n  We also believe it is important and necessary to make American \nassistance more effective. That is why we are calling for the \nestablishment of an office of the coordinator for Greater Middle East \nand Central Asia at our Department of State. The creation of such an \noffice would help ensure all assistance provided by any government \nagency of ours is in line with the overarching goals and objectives of \nour foreign policy. It would also give other donors and countries of \nthe region a simple place to go when seeking information about the \nprograms we would create.\n  With this collaborative structure in place, Senator Hagel and I would \nauthorize $5 billion in assistance over the next 5 years. That is no \nsmall sum. But it is in fact small in comparison to the tens of \nbillions of dollars in today's money that were spent on the Marshall \nplan in Europe 50 years ago and the hundreds of billions of dollars we \nare spending now and will continue to have to spend for the military \nside of the war against terror. That figure, we believe, is the minimum \nrequired to have a positive, measurable impact in the region and to \nsignal the seriousness of our intentions.\n  Earlier this month, civil society leaders from all over the Arab \nworld gathered in Alexandria, Egypt to discuss an Arab reform agenda. \nAt that meeting participants agreed on a declaration that calls for \nsignificant reforms that encompass the ``political, economic, social, \nand cultural aspects'' of society. The fact is the reforms those Arab \nworld reformers seek are at least as far-reaching as those that are \nbeing suggested by others from the outside, including from the United \nStates. I know there are similar reform efforts underway in Central \nAsia. They deserve our support.\n  In introducing this legislation today, Senator Hagel and I hope to \ngive new impetus to the discussions taking place in Washington and \nelsewhere about what we collectively can do to support political and \neconomic reform in the Greater Middle East and to give the people in \nthose great regions an alternative to a better life than the hatred and \nsuicidal death al-Qaida offers.\n  The Bush administration has put forward serious proposal along the \nsame lines as ours. It certainly has the same goals. This bill Senator \nHagel and I are introducing today is intended to build on that effort. \nWe hope it helps shape the debate of the best method to implement, \nwhich should be one of partnership and collaboration along with a \nserious commitment of American resources.\n\n  In June, the United States will host the G-8 summit in Sea Island, \nGA. That summit will be followed by the U.S.-EU and NATO summits also \nin June. The future of the Greater Middle East will be placed high on \nthe agenda of all those important meetings.\n  By introducing this legislation today, Senator Hagel and I hope to \nenable our Government to go into these summits with the bipartisan \nsupport of the Congress and also to provide some direction as to what \nwe believe should be done and how it might best be done.\n\n[[Page S4030]]\n\nSenator Hagel and I hope our colleagues will take a look at this \nproposal and join us in cosponsoring it and sending thereby a message \nno less profound and no less necessary than the message of the Marshall \nplan half a century ago, that the United States is serious about \nimproving the lives and expanding the freedoms of the millions of \npeople who live in the Greater Middle East and Central Asia.\n  Today, that is our most urgent international imperative. At the dawn \nof the cold war, America answered the challenge of communism by seeding \na garden of peace, hope, and prosperity in Europe. Today, at the dawn \nof our current war against terrorism, it is equally essential that we \nanswer the inhumane, barbaric threats of terrorism and acts of \nterrorism with all necessary force, but also by seeding the same kind \nof garden of peace, hope, and prosperity in the Greater Middle East.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 2306. A bill to reauthorize, restructure, and reform the intercity \npassenger rail service program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, joined by Senator Sununu, I am \nintroducing legislation to fundamentally reform our Nation's intercity \nrail passenger program. The proposal adopts the core concepts for \nreform advanced by the administration in its Amtrak legislation--cost-\nsharing with the States, a network of trains that makes economic sense, \nand fair and open competition for Amtrak. However, in recognition of \nthe magnitude and complexity of the task of restructuring Amtrak, the \nlegislation takes a more moderate, realistic approach to reform. While \nI would prefer to see more accomplished in the next 6 years, enactment \nof the restructuring and reforms we are proposing today would represent \nmeaningful progress toward creating an intercity passenger rail program \nthat makes economic sense and meets the needs of the traveling public.\n  It is past time for Congress to come to terms with Amtrak's problems \nand why it is largely a failure. Year after year, for more than 3 \ndecades, Congress has funded an essentially nationalized passenger \nrailroad, that in most areas of the country neither meets a market \ndemand nor provides needed public transportation. After 34 years and \n$27 billion in taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak still serves less than 1 \npercent of intercity travelers.\n  My colleagues and I may not agree on exactly how Amtrak should be \nrestructured, but we should agree that what exists today is far from \nideal. Amtrak loses over $1 billion annually. Its debt stands at almost \n$5 billion, a legacy the taxpayers will bear for years to come. It has \nmortgaged nearly every asset it owns, including a portion of New's \nYork's Penn Station, to avoid bankruptcy. It operates routes, many of \nthem in the middle of the night, that lose hundreds of dollars per \npassenger. And despite a Federal investment of $3.2 billion for high-\nspeed service on the Northeast Corridor, the Acela service has been \nplagued by equipment and operating problems. In a report prepared at my \nrequest, the General Accounting Office recently found that Amtrak \nmismanaged the project, blatantly ignoring the Federal master plan and \nfailing to complete 51 of the project's 72 work elements.\n  It is past time to end the status quo. If the collective wisdom of \nCongress is to continue to fund intercity passenger rail service, then \nwe should do so in a manner that makes economic sense. The legislation \nwe are introducing today would restructure the passenger rail program \nin a realistic way and provide responsible funding for existing service \nand new corridor development.\n  First, the legislation would make cost-sharing on shorter-distance \ncorridor routes more equitable. Today, California, Washington, Oregon, \nand a number of other States play an active role in funding and \nmanaging passenger service on corridor routes in their States, while \nother States pay nothing. This legislation would require equitable \ncost-sharing for all corridor trains. By the end of the 6-year \nreauthorization period, States would be required to fund 70 percent of \nthe operating losses on corridor services, the level of contribution \nalready being made by California, the Pacific Northwest, Oklahoma, \nMissouri, and several other States. Furthermore, the Federal share of \noperating subsidies would be payable as grants to the States. Where \nStates have taken an active role in managing Amtrak service, there has \nbeen more accountability, better customer service, and a higher level \nof efficiency.\n\n  Second, the legislation would restructure Amtrak's long distance \nroutes. I am not proposing, as many of my colleagues would expect, to \n``whack'' every long distance train. In fact, closure and consolidation \nwould be a last resort under my proposal. The ultimate goal would be to \nreduce the annual operating subsidy required for these routes by at \nleast 50 percent whether by restructuring the route, reducing operating \nexpenses, contracting out service to a private operator, or securing \nState financial support. Amtrak operates 16 long distance trains, \nincluding the Sunset Limited, a train that runs through Arizona on its \n3-day odyssey from Los Angeles to Orlando and loses over $400 per \npassenger. Reducing the burden of these trains on the taxpayer is one \nof my top priorities.\n  This proposal would also establish fair and open competition for \nAmtrak. If, after 34 years of being told by Amtrak that profitability \nis just a few years away or, more recently, that it is on a ``glide-\npath'' to self-sufficiency, we are now to conclude that Amtrak will \nalways run operating and capital deficits. Our duty to the taxpayers is \nto ensure that service is operated as efficiently as possible to \nminimize subsidies. To achieve this goal, there must be fair and open \ncompetition for Amtrak from private sector companies and commuter \nauthorities.\n  Some of my colleagues contend that the private sector would not be \ninterested in operating passenger service, noting that Amtrak was \ncreated because the freight railroads did not wish to continue \nproviding what had become unprofitable service with the development of \nair travel and the Interstate Highway System. But times have changed. \nNorfolk Southern recently told transportation officials in Georgia that \nit wants to be considered to run the State's planned commuter service \nbetween Atlanta and Macon. Herzon, a private company headquarted in \nMissouri, operates commuter services in Texas and California, and has \nbeen trying to bid against Amtrak to operate the ``Mules'' service \nbetween St. Louis and Kansas City. Further, 14 private corporations \nexpressed interest in operating service following a Commerce Committee \nhearing in which the question of private sector interest was posed.\n  Fourth, this legislation would establish a process for corridor \ndevelopment modeled after the transit ``new starts'' program. Many \nStates have expressed interest in developing new conventional or high-\nspeed intercity passenger service in highly-traveled corridors. My \nproposal would evaluate new intercity services on a competitive basis \nand require that projects meet planning and design requirements similar \nto those that apply to the well-respected new starts program \nadministered by the Federal Transit Administration. As the States \nassume more responsibility for operating subsidies, the amount of \nfunding available for corridor development would increase. By year 6 of \nthe reauthorization period, $800 million would be authorized for \ncorridor development.\n  This legislation also addresses ownership, management, and \nmaintenance of Northeast Corridor. As recommended by the \nadministration, the bill proposes that the Federal Government assume \nownership of the Northeast Corridor and implement a plan to restore the \nCorridor to a state of good repair. The Northeast Corridor States would \nbe encouraged to adopt an interstate compact within 5 years and assume \nresponsibility for the Corridor's management. Other States would be \nexpected to manage their corridor services, and the Northeast Corridor \nshould be no exception. Moreover, over 1,000 of the 1,200 or so trains \noperated daily on the Corridor are commuter trains, not intercity \nservices. Until the interstate compact is in place, Amtrak would \ncontinue to operate and maintain the Corridor.\n\n  Finally, the legislation institutes reforms at Amtrak. Amtrak would \nbe required to perform its services under\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\ncontract with the Federal Government or States, and would be required \nto develop a more accurate and transparent cost accounting system. As \nrecommended by the DOT Inspector General, an effort would be made to \nrestructure Amtrak's debt to reduce the cost to the taxpayers.\n  We encourage our colleagues to support this legislation. Reforming \nAmtrak and the way our intercity passenger rail program is now \norganized must be accomplished before Congress considers expanding \nintercity service. Simply throwing billions more at Amtrak as some of \nmy colleagues propose--whether through appropriations, bonds, or some \nother funding scheme--will not solve the fundamental problems. We can \nand must do better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:.\n\n                                S. 2306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CRITERIA FOR RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Restructuring as Linked Corridors.--\n       (1) Prerequisite for restructuring.--A long distance route \n     or portion thereof may be recommended for restructuring as a \n     linked corridor if--\n       (A) the origin-to-destination travel time of each corridor \n     link in the new route, at conventional train speeds, \n     including all station stops, will be competitive with other \n     modes of transportation;\n       (B) each corridor link in the new route connects at least 2 \n     major metropolitan areas or provides a link between 2 or more \n     existing corridor routes;\n       (C) the route as restructured can be reasonably expected to \n     attract at least 10 percent of the combined common carrier \n     market in the markets served;\n       (D) the projected cash operating loss of each of the \n     restructured links does not exceed 11 cents per passenger-\n     mile on a fully allocated cost basis; and\n       (E) by the end of fiscal year 2010 the Federal operating \n     subsidy will be reduced by at least 50 percent (as compared \n     to the operating subsidy for the route for fiscal year 2003), \n     taking into account commitments by the affected States to \n     provide financial support for the route so that no Federal \n     operating subsidy is available for any portion of a route for \n     which there is no such State commitment.\n       (2) Hours of operation.--In addition to the eligibility \n     criteria in paragraph (1), any long distance routes \n     recommended for restructuring as linked corridors shall be \n     designed to operate between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 \n     p.m.\n       (3) Modification of routes.--With the concurrence of the \n     affected States and the host railroad, the route and stations \n     service by a restructured long distance route may be modified \n     to improve ridership and financial performance.\n       (4) New capital plans.--As part of the restructuring plan \n     for reconfigured routes, the Commission shall develop a \n     capital plan, if additional capital is needed to reconfigure \n     the route as linked corridors.\n       (b) Contracting-Out of Profitable Long Distance Routes and \n     Services.--The Commission shall determine which long distance \n     routes or services on such routes, including auto-ferry \n     transportation, food service, and sleeping accommodations, \n     could be contracted to a private operator on a for-profit \n     basis. In making these determinations, the Commission shall \n     solicit expressions of interest from the private sector in \n     operating long distance routes or services, including the \n     conditions under which private companies may be interested in \n     operating such services.\n       (c) Consolidation and Closure.--The Commission shall make \n     recommendations to Congress for consolidating and closing \n     long distance train routes or portions of routes that cannot \n     be restructured under subsection (a) or contracted out under \n     subsection (b), to reduce the Federal operating subsidy \n     required by at least 50 percent by the end of fiscal year \n     2010 (as compared to the operating subsidies for those routes \n     for fiscal year 2003), taking into consideration--\n       (1) the operating loss on a fully allocated cost basis, \n     including capital costs, of the route or portion thereof;\n       (2) the extent to which train service is the only available \n     public transportation to the cities and towns along the route \n     or portion thereof;\n       (3) whether an alternate route could significantly reduce \n     operating losses and capital requirements or increase \n     ridership;\n       (4) available capacity on the rights-of-way of the host \n     railroad or railroads; and\n       (5) commitments by the affected States to provide financial \n     support for the route or portion thereof.\n       (d) Cooperation of American Passenger Railway \n     Corporation.--\n       (1) The American Passenger Railway Corporation shall \n     cooperate and comply, subject to the agreement of the \n     Commission to protect the confidentiality of proprietary \n     information, with all requests for financial, marketing, and \n     other information about the routes under consideration by the \n     Commission.\n       (2) The Secretary of Transportation may withhold all or \n     part of an operating or capital grant to the Corporation if \n     the Secretary determines the American Passenger Railway \n     Corporation is not cooperating with the Commission as \n     required by this subsection.\n       (e) Report.--The Commission shall submit its \n     recommendations for restructuring the long distance routes to \n     the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. The report shall include a description \n     of--\n       (1) the analysis performed by the Commission to reach its \n     conclusions;\n       (2) options considered in the development of a \n     restructuring plan; and\n       (3) the impact of the restructuring on employees of the \n     American Passenger Railway Corporation for any long distance \n     route restructured under this section.\n\n     SEC. 108. IMPLEMENTATION OF RESTRUCTURING PLAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     implement the restructuring plan submitted to Congress by the \n     Long Distance Route Restructuring Commission in its report \n     pursuant to section 106 unless a joint resolution is enacted \n     by the Congress disapproving such recommendations of the \n     Commission before the earlier of--\n       (1) the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date the \n     Commission submits its report to Congress; or\n       (2) the adjournment of Congress sine die for the session \n     during which such report is submitted.\n       (b) Certain Days Disregarded.--For purposes of subsection \n     (a), the days on which either House of Congress is not in \n     session because of an adjournment of more than 4 days to a \n     day certain shall be excluded in the computation of a period.\n       (c) 1-year Implementation Period.--Unless disapproved under \n     section (a), the Secretary of Transportation shall fully \n     implement the plan within 1 year after the date on which the \n     period described in subsection (a) expires.\n\n     SEC. 109.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the importation of prescription drugs by importers, and \nby individuals for personal use, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question to the \nChamber today.\n  What would you call it if Americans were paying up to 300 percent \nmore for the same product as consumers from other countries were \npaying? Back in Iowa, we would call that ``highway robbery.'' Yet, \nhighway robbery is what is happening every day in this country, and it \nis happening over prescription drugs.\n  Yes, prescription drugs are being sold at prices that are 30 to 300 \npercent higher in the United States than in places like Canada or \nEurope.\n  Here are some examples.\n  The price in Canada of Nexium which is for heart burn and ulcers, is \nabout 40 percent of the price in the U.S. Nexium would cost about $120 \nfor 28 20-milligram capsules if you bought it here in the States. If \nyou order the same Nexium from Canada, you'd pay about $51.\n  Here is another example: The price in Canada for Vioxx which is for \narthritis pain, is also about 40 percent of the price in the U.S. If \nyou purchased 30 12.5-milligram tablets in Canada, you would pay about \n$36 and here in a U.S. pharmacy, you would pay about $86.\n  And why is that, Mr. President? The reason is the importation of \nprescription drugs, those very same drugs that patients are using in \nCanada, and Australia, and Japan, is illegal in this country. So \nconsumers in other countries get price breaks from the drug \nmanufacturers and the American public doesn't.\n  One way to look at this is that by paying those higher prices, the \nAmerican public is paying more than its fair share for the cost of \nresearch and development for future new drugs. That is not fair.\n  This means when a new drug comes on the market, the American consumer \nhas paid for the research but consumers in other countries benefit from \nthe new therapy.\n  I have supported amendments to permit Canadian drug purchases before. \nWe have had numerous votes in this Chamber on legalizing importation. \nWe had a vote most recently during the Medicare debate.\n  Last year, the House overwhelmingly passed a drug reimportation bill \nby a vote of 243 to 186. But, in the end, the conference report for the \nMedicare bill watered down the possibility of legal importation such \nthat it was meaningless.\n  I was very disappointed about that. I think it was victory by \nsubterfuge for the pharmaceutical industry.\n  So, I decided to roll up my sleeves and go to work on drafting my own \nbill that would address the problems surrounding importation. In fact, \nI was working very closely since the beginning of the year with my \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. We were \nworking together until 3 weeks ago to create a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. We made a lot of progress. We still had some issues to \nwork out but we were very close to having a final agreement.\n  With my leadership on the Finance Committee, and Senator Kennedy's \nleadership on the HELP Committee, let alone his expertise on the Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetics Act, I figured we had a good shot at getting \nsomething done.\n  Our discussions certainly created a lot of buzz around town. I had \nreporters and all manner of interest groups asking me and my staff \nabout the bill and when we would introduce it. But those discussions \nhave since evaporated. Apparently, the Democratic caucus was concerned \nthat things were moving too quickly or that too much momentum was \nbuilding behind a bipartisan effort. What I do know is that our \nbipartisan product was no longer the priority.\n  I was disappointed about that too. Senator Kennedy and I work well \ntogether. In fact, we are joining forces even now to get the Family \nOpportunity Act to the floor and passed out of the Senate.\n  You can understand why I was discouraged to learn that Senator \nDaschle had determined lowering the costs of prescription drugs through \nimportation was going to be a partisan issue.\n  Members can understand why I was discouraged to learn that Senator \nDaschle determined lowering the cost of prescription drugs through \nimportation was going to be a partisan issue. This reminded me of what \nhappened in the year 2002 with the Medicare prescription drug debate. \nThere, too, Senator Daschle became concerned that the Finance \nCommittee--then chaired by my friend, Senator Baucus--would report a \nbipartisan prescription drug benefit for seniors.\n  Senator Daschle, in 2002, as the majority leader, bypassed the \nFinance Committee and took the prescription drug bill straight to the \nfloor. That is not how we get legislation passed in the Senate, and \neveryone around here knows it. As I say so often to my colleagues, \nnothing gets done in the Senate if it is not bipartisan or at least \nsomewhat bipartisan.\n  In the year 2002, it resulted in a very partisan debate in the Senate \nover\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\ncompeting Medicare drug benefit proposals. There were multiple partisan \nproposals by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. I had a proposal \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats. The Democratic caucus \nfought our bill, which was dubbed the tripartisan bill because one of \nthe key authors, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, sits in the body as an \nIndependent.\n  What happened in the final analysis in 2002? The Senate did not pass \na Medicare drug benefit proposal that year. The debate fell apart in \npartisan bickering in the Senate. That happened because partisan \npolitics intervened to prevent a bipartisan compromise.\n  It looks to me that this is what is happening now on the issue of the \nimportation of drugs into the United States to help our seniors. When \nwe go to the pharmacist to pick up a prescription, I don't remember the \npharmacist asking if you are a Republican or a Democrat. When you pay \nyour health insurance premium, I don't think the insurance company \nlooks for an ``R'' or a ``D'' by your name before they accept your \npayment.\n  No, I don't see the importation of drugs as a partisan issue. Being \nforced to pay higher prescription prices because there is a lack of \ncompetition in the global pharmaceutical industry is not a partisan \nissue. That is why I decided to move ahead and introduce the bill I am \nintroducing today.\n  This bill I am introducing today in a large degree is the bill on \nwhich I worked very closely with Senator Kennedy when our efforts got \nsuperseded by the Democratic caucus. I made a few changes, but this \nbill is basically what Senator Kennedy and I were working on together \nbefore partisan politics got in the way. I thought what we had was a \ngood proposal. We were close to having all the details worked out. I am \ngoing ahead and introducing that bill today by myself.\n  Let me explain the bill. Quite simply, it would legalize immediately \nthe importation of prescription drugs from Canada. After 2 years, \nconsumers would be able to order their drugs from other countries, as \nwell. It creates a practical and safe system to do it.\n  Today the law prohibits the importation of prescription drugs until \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that importation \ncan be done safely. Under current resources and under current \nauthority, the Food and Drug Administration has not been able to \nprovide such assurance on the safety of drugs coming in from other \ncountries. We have had Health and Human Service Secretaries in both the \nClinton administration and the Bush administration. This is not \nRepublicans protecting pharmaceuticals, if you want to look at it this \nway. It is both Democrat Presidents and Republican Presidents making a \ndecision that the certification and safety of drug importation was not \nlegally permitted.\n  Even though the law says you can import drugs, because of the lack of \ncertification, they cannot come into the country. More and more people \nhave been getting prescriptions filled in Canada, regardless of what \nthe law says. Technically, that is illegal today.\n  The Food and Drug Administration and our customs officials have been \nlooking the other way. The Food and Drug Administration has said there \nare serious safety issues with drug importation from other countries. \nThey say this because no public health authority is overseeing many of \nthe prescriptions coming in from other countries. In fact, the Canadian \nGovernment has said it will not take responsibility for assuring the \nsafety of drugs being shipped to the United States from Canada. They \nhave basically told the U.S. consumer: You are on your own from the \nstandpoint of safety--I suppose, as far as the Food and Drug \nAdministration, efficacy as well as safety.\n  Today, importation is no longer limited to organized bus trips across \nthe border to pharmacies in Canada. Instead, it is becoming a booming \nmail-order pharmacy operation with customers all over the United \nStates. We see press accounts on a regular basis describing Americans \nwho log on to the Internet to purchase drugs from Canada and elsewhere.\n\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee \non Governmental Affairs conducted an investigation into drug \nimportation. They found about 40,000 parcels containing prescription \ndrugs come through JFK Airport every day. JFK Airport houses the \nlargest international mail branch in the United States. From Miami, \n30,000 packages of drugs come into the United States; 20,000 packages \ncome into Chicago each day of the year. About 28 percent of the drugs \ncoming in are controlled substances. These are addictive drugs that \nrequire close supervision from physicians.\n  From where are most of these drugs coming? I was surprised to hear it \nwas not only Canada, but also Brazil, India, Pakistan, the Netherlands, \nSpain, Portugal, Mexico, and Romania.\n  My bill immediately halts unsafe importation from rogue operators but \npermits individuals to obtain prescriptions from licensed Canadian \npharmacies on an interim basis while the Food and Drug Administration \ngets a new drug importation system up and it runs well.\n  The American public is tired of waiting for the Federal Government to \ntake action to legalize importation and to assure the safety of \nimported drugs. Under my bill, the Food and Drug Administration is \nrequired to issue final regulations for the new drug importation system \nwithin 90 days of enactment. Under the new importation system, \nindividuals and pharmacies could purchase qualified drugs for import \ninto the United States from foreign exporters that register with the \nFood and Drug Administration. To be registered, the foreign exporters \nmust demonstrate compliance with safety measures, must submit to the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts, and take other steps to assure the safety \nof imported drugs.\n  A user fee charged to registered exporters would provide the \nfinancing needed for the Food and Drug Administration to register and \noversee foreign drug exporters and assure the state of imported drugs.\n  The drugmakers do not want to see their lower priced products from \nother countries coming into the United States. That is certain because \nthe present laws do not permit this competition to them. They would say \nit undermines their profits here. They will want to do everything they \ncan to stop drug importation.\n  Even though this bill might pass, these companies will find some way \nto keep these drugs out of the country. So I have to deal with that \nfact in this legislation.\n  So under my bill, drugmakers that take steps to prevent importation \nof their products from these registered drug importers will lose their \ntax deduction for their advertising costs.\n  Now, that is going to upset the trade associations that deal with \nadvertising. That is going to upset TV and newspapers and magazines \nthat get a lot of money from advertising. I have had a long history of \nsupporting the deductibility of advertising expenses as a legitimate \nbusiness expense. I have not changed my mind in regard to that, not at \nall. In fact, I have a history of voting against amendments that are \noffered on the floor of the Senate that would make advertising not \ndeductible.\n  But we are not talking about not allowing the deductibility of \nadvertising costs. Only if a company tries to do something illegal and \nkeep drugs from coming in from out of this country, then they will pay \nthe penalty of not having their advertising costs deducted. But I \nassume, when we pass this bill, these drug companies are going to abide \nby this law. There will not be one cent of advertising that cannot be \ndeducted as a legitimate expense, so I do not want the advertising \nfraternity to get upset with this legislation, when I have been a \nbacker of the legitimate writeoff of advertising expenses.\n  Now, this not only has the stick that I just described, but we have a \ncarrot as well, to encourage companies to abide by this law and not try \nto keep imported drugs from coming into this country by some sort of \nrequirement they would put on supplies outside the country not to ship \ndrugs into this country; and that is, they will get a 20-percent \nbenefit--a 20-percent benefit--by having an increase in their R tax \ncredit.\n\n  I am going to discuss that further, but going back to the advertising \ncosts, I do sense, from my people in Iowa--at every town meeting some \nperson complains about the advertising of\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\ndrugs on TV. I defend the advertising of drugs on TV because that is \ncommercial free speech. I think our citizenry ought to be as educated \nabout drugs as they can be, so they are not beholden to their own \ndoctor or doctors for what might be applied. I think we ought to have \nan educated patient group, so this advertising is very good. But I \nstill have to say that my Iowa constituents are pretty fed up with all \nthose drug ads they see on TV, and how they are probably adding to the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  I am fully in favor of this free speech, and I do not, in any way, \nwant to prohibit companies from running the ads they want to run. But \nif drug companies are not going to allow U.S. consumers to have access \nto these lower prices in other countries, then, under this legislation, \nthey would lose the tax deduction for the cost of those advertisements.\n  Now, on the other hand, I said there is a carrot out there. The \ndrugmakers complain to us that these lower prices might take money from \nresearch and development. They would rightly say: Where are we going to \nget the money to have the next generation of ``magic'' drugs that we \nhave? We want that to happen, because when I buy a drug today, my \nmother or grandmother, when they bought pills, paid for that research \nfor the generation of drugs I take. I want my children and \ngrandchildren to have a new generation of drugs for the future. So we \ndo not want to hurt research and development.\n  So my bill, then, creates an incentive for drug companies that do not \nfight this importation of drugs. Companies that do not prevent \nimportation from registered exporters will get a 20-percent increase in \ntheir R tax credit. I hope everybody will think that is very fair.\n  I have a more detailed summary of this bill that I am going to put in \nthe Record. I ask unanimous consent that this summary and a question \nand answer document be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe that free trade principles argue in favor of \npermitting the importation from Canada and perhaps from other developed \ncountries as long as we can implement a system for safe importation.\n  Today, there is no assurance of safety--no one is watching the \nstore--and products are coming in from all over the world.\n  My legislation has two objectives. First, it will put an immediate \nend to the unregulated and unsafe situations of drug imports that we \nhave today by default. This is key because the situation today \nthreatens the safety of our Nation's drug supply and puts patients who \nobtain these drugs at risk of harm.\n  Second, the legislation will provide the Food and Drug Administration \nwith the resources and authority to ensure the safety of imported \ndrugs, and importation will only be permitted by registered exporters \nwho submit to the Food and Drug Administration authority.\n  Now, this bill will get referred to the Finance Committee because it \nhas tax provisions in it, but the bulk of my bill falls under the \njurisdiction of the HELP Committee, and my friend, Senator Gregg, as \nchairman of that committee, has announced he will hold a markup this \nyear on a drug importation bill.\n  I do not intend to assert jurisdiction over this proposal, and I \nbelieve we should rely upon that regular committee process to work. \nThat is how we get legislation passed in the Senate. Because that is \nwhere bipartisanship is formulated, at the committee level.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this bill. I wanted to get these \nideas out here for discussion. I hope some of my colleagues will want \nto cosponsor this bill. It is time we got this done, and this is the \nyear to get it done, particularly following upon the vote that was in \nthe House of Representatives last year.\n  We must not let partisan politics get in the way, and I think it is \ngetting a little bit in the way right now. I hope we overcome that. I \nhope I am able to develop a relationship with Democrats, once again, to \nwork on this bill in a bipartisan way. If we do not do this, I think \nthere is going to be a penalty paid at the ballot box in November.\n  The American consumers are waiting. Let's get the job done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        Overview of Key Elements\n\n       Legalizes reimportation (or importation) of prescription \n     drugs from FDA approved exporters. To be approved, registered \n     exporters must agree to meet safety requirements and to \n     permit FDA inspectors on their premises full time to ensure \n     compliance.\n       Creates a ``fast-track'' regulatory process for FDA to \n     implement the importation system quickly.\n       Importation of qualified prescription drugs from Canada is \n     immediately legalized while the new importation system is \n     developed and implemented by FDA.\n       Under the new system, individuals, pharmacies, and drug \n     wholesalers are permitted to legally import prescription \n     drugs from registered foreign exporters:\n       Individuals may order drugs from a registered exporter \n     pursuant to a valid prescription issued by a U.S. doctor and \n     filled by a pharmacist whose licensing requirements are \n     equivalent to those required in the U.S. or by a dispensing \n     pharmacist duly licensed by a state.\n       Commercial shipments are permitted only to licensed \n     pharmacists for resale directly to consumers and by drug \n     wholesalers who can sell to pharmacies as they do today.\n       Drugs imported to U.S. pharmacies and drug wholesalers must \n     be FDA approved drugs produced in the United States or in FDA \n     inspected manufacturing facilities in other counties. FDA is \n     required to provide the proper labeling for drugs for \n     importation.\n       The FDA through its inspectors is responsible for tracing \n     all drugs exported to the U.S. back to their original \n     manufacturing plant and ensuring that they have been stored \n     and transported safely from that plant.\n       Individuals may also purchase drugs that are bioequivalent \n     to FDA-approved brand name drugs that are produced by the \n     same brand-name manufacturer.\n       These drugs are drugs not technically approved by the FDA \n     but the foreign government has approved the drug and that \n     drug has the same active ingredient or ingredients as the \n     FDA-approved drug and the same route of administration, \n     dosage form, and strength.\n       If a drug manufacturer believes, however, that the non-FDA \n     approved drug is not bioequivalent to the FDA approved drug, \n     then it must submit a petition to the FDA to show that (a) \n     the differences result in a product that is not bioequivalent \n     to the drug approved in the U.S., and (b) that such \n     differences are due to scientifically and legally valid \n     differences in the regulatory requirements of the U.S. and \n     the country(ies) in which the apparently similar drug is \n     marketed. The manufacturer is required to pay a user fee \n     sufficient to cover the cost of the FDA's review of the \n     petition and supporting documentation.\n       A User Fee charged to registered exporters provides the \n     financing to provide the resources to FDA to ensure the \n     safety of imported drugs.\n       User fees charged to registered exporters would be \n     sufficient to cover all costs including those incurred for \n     inspection and verification within the United States, at the \n     exporter's premises and any other location where the drugs \n     have been stored prior to entry into the U.S.\n       The FDA would be required to verify the source and inspect \n     the intermediate handlers of all drugs intended for export \n     into the United States.\n       FDA would also be required to determine by a statistically \n     significant sample that the recipients held valid \n     prescriptions (individuals ordering 90-day supply or less) or \n     verify that recipient was a licensed pharmacy that only \n     dispensed drugs to individuals.\n       The FDA would also be required to supply valid U.S. \n     labeling upon request of the registered exporter and affix or \n     supervise the affixing of seals, markings or tracking \n     technology that would inform border personnel that such \n     imports were lawful to be entered as labeled.\n       Drugs not permitted for importation include controlled \n     substances and certain other drugs not appropriate for \n     importation because of storage, significant safety concerns, \n     or drugs that are more likely to be counterfeited.\n     Provisions to Protect Safety of the Public\n       Unauthorized imports would be treated as contraband and \n     would be seized and destroyed upon entry without notice.\n       For the first two years, importation would be limited to \n     Canada. The Department of Health and Human Services would \n     submit a report to Congress in the second year, and unless \n     Congress changed the law, countries from which importation is \n     permitted would be expanded to include, the European Union, \n     the European Free Trade Association, Japan, Australia, and \n     New Zealand. Other countries meeting statutory criteria could \n     also be added to the list by the Secretary.\n       The legislation continues to prohibit the import or \n     reimport of drugs supplied free or at nominal cost to \n     charitable or humanitarian organizations including the United\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\n     Nations or a government of a foreign country.\n       Requires pedigrees from the manufacturer to the dispensing \n     pharmacist for all prescription drugs sold within the U.S. or \n     to an exporter authorized to export drugs into the U.S.\n       Requires the automatic suspension of an exporter's \n     registration for any attempted entry of non-qualified or \n     unsafe drugs with restricted ability to seek re-instatement \n     in the future.\n       Requires that registered exporters submit to the \n     jurisdiction of the U.S. federal court system and provides a \n     mechanism for civil actions against the property of persons \n     that import non-qualified drugs.\n       Repeals the provision in the Controlled Substances Act that \n     permits the personal import of scheduled drugs, which is a \n     significant source of illegal drug trade in the U.S.\n     Tax Incentives for Manufacturers to Facilitate Reimportation\n       Incentive To Not Prevent Reimportation: Manufacturers that \n     do not take any action, directly or indirectly, to prevent \n     reimportation receive a 20% increase in R tax credit for \n     that year.\n       Penalty For Preventing Reimportation: Manufacturers that \n     take any action, directly or indirectly, to prevent \n     authorized reimportation lose the business expense deduction \n     for advertising expenses.\n\n\n                  Questions and Answers about the Bill\n\n       Question. What are the goals of the legislation?\n       Answer. The legislation has two objectives. First, it would \n     put an immediate end to the unregulated and unsafe situation \n     with drug imports that exists today. Second, the legislation \n     would provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the \n     resources and authority to ensure the safety of imported \n     drugs.\n       Question. How does the bill work?\n       Answer. Current law prohibits the importation of \n     prescription drugs until the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) certifies that importation can be done safely. \n     Using current resources and authority, the FDA has not been \n     able to provide an assurance of safety of imported drugs.\n       The bill immediately halts unsafe importation but permits \n     individuals to obtain prescriptions from Canadian pharmacies \n     on an interim basis while FDA gets the new drug importation \n     system up and running.\n       Under the bill, the FDA is required to issue final \n     regulations for the new system within 90 days of enactment. \n     Under the new importation system, individuals, pharmacies, \n     and drug wholesalers could purchase qualified drugs for \n     import into the U.S. from foreign exporters that register \n     with the FDA. To obtain a registration, a foreign exporter \n     must demonstrate compliance with safety measures, must submit \n     to jurisdiction of U.S. courts, and take others steps to \n     assure safety of imported drugs. A user fee charged to \n     registered exporters would provide the financing needed for \n     FDA to register and oversee foreign drug exporters and ensure \n     the safety of imported drugs.\n       Question. How will patients get their prescriptions filled \n     at an overseas drug exporter?\n       Answer. First of all, consumers that want to have their \n     prescriptions filled at an overseas prescription drug \n     exporter will be able to go to the FDA website and find a \n     list of companies that have passed FDA's requirements to \n     become a registered exporter. Just as for filling a \n     prescription in the U.S. today, the patient must have a valid \n     prescription written by a health care professional licensed \n     in a state to prescribe drugs. The patient will then compare \n     drug prices at the different registered exporters to find the \n     best price available. To get the prescription filled, the \n     patient will have to contact that exporter and either mail or \n     fax the prescription to them.\n       Alternatively, the registered exporter could call the \n     patient's prescriber and get the prescription over the phone. \n     This is the same process as mail order pharmacies in the U.S. \n     use today.\n       A pharmacist at the registered exporter would fill the \n     prescription according to the prescriber's instructions. The \n     registered exporter may only fill the prescription with \n     brand-name drugs, meaning these are the same drugs as those \n     approved by the FDA and manufactured by the same company as \n     approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S.\n       Individuals can also have a prescription filled that is \n     technically not an FDA-approved drug, but the drug has the \n     same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, and route of \n     administration as the FDA-approved drug and is made by the \n     same manufacturer as the FDA-approved drug. These drugs are \n     manufactured by the same brand-name manufacturer and are made \n     for sale in the market of the approved country.\n       The registered exporter is required to verify that the drug \n     can be traced back to the original manufacturer and the drug \n     must have been stored and handled properly. The FDA, through \n     its on-site inspectors, will also be verifying that the \n     prescription drugs being dispensed to patients meet FDA's \n     criteria.\n       Once the prescription is filled, the registered exporter \n     will place a label or other markings on the package for \n     shipping that identify the shipment as being in compliance \n     with FDA's safety requirements and all registration \n     conditions. These markings will be designed by FDA and may \n     include track-and-trace technologies and anti-counterfeiting \n     measures. When the package enters the U.S., that marking will \n     signify to Customs officials that the product was dispensed \n     from a registered exporter and can therefore be permitted to \n     enter the country. Packages with drugs that lack this marking \n     will be seized by Customs and destroyed.\n       Question. Can the importation of prescription drugs from \n     other countries be expanded?\n       Answer. Yes. In the second year of the importation program, \n     HHS would be required to submit a report to Congress on the \n     safety of the program and its impact on trade. Unless \n     Congress acted, the program would be expanded in year three \n     to include importation from the European Union, the European \n     Free Trade Association, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. \n     Other countries that meet specific statutory criteria may \n     also be added to the list.\n       Question. What is the complete list of countries that would \n     be permitted in the third year of the program?\n       Answer. There are currently 15 members of the European \n     Union: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \n     Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, \n     The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Beginning on May 1, \n     2004, there will be 10 new member states in the European \n     Union: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. There are 4 \n     member countries in the European Free Trade Association: \n     Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n       Question. How much does this program cost?\n       Answer. The infrastructure needed to guarantee the safety \n     of the imported prescriptions would be financed through user \n     fees. User fees would be paid by registered exporters, which \n     could be the overseas pharmacies or prescription drug \n     wholesalers, for example. Congressional Budget Office has not \n     yet officially scored the bill.\n       Question. Now that the bill is introduced, what comes next?\n       Answer. Because the bill contains tax provisions, it has \n     been referred to the Finance Committee. Senate leadership has \n     expressed an interest in developing legislation this year to \n     allow the importation of prescription drugs. Because the bulk \n     of the legislation falls within the jurisdiction of the \n     Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee, it is \n     expected that HELP will take the lead in reporting any \n     legislation.\n       Question. How is this bill different than other legislation \n     on importation?\n       Answer. While the idea of importation of prescription drugs \n     from foreign countries enjoys broad bipartisan support, the \n     issue of safety continues to remain a major barrier to \n     allowing importation to move forward. Secretaries of HHS from \n     both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have determined \n     that safe importation of prescription drugs cannot be \n     guaranteed with the authority and resources the FDA has \n     today. Many bills presume that importation is safe and that \n     FDA and the public should not be overly alarmed. However, \n     there is a legitimate concern about unsafe pharmaceuticals \n     entering the U.S. every day. Hundreds of thousands of \n     packages enter our country on a daily basis, with little or \n     no ability for the U.S. Customs Service or the FDA to \n     guarantee these drugs are safe and effective. Rather than \n     ignore the safety issue, this bill responds to the concerns \n     raised by FDA and others and creates a way to ensure safe \n     access to lower cost prescriptions.\n       Question. How does this bill lower the costs of \n     prescription drugs Americans have to pay?\n       Answer. United States consumers pay 30 to 300 percent more \n     for their prescriptions drugs than those in other countries. \n     Drug manufacturers are forced to sell their products at lower \n     prices in other countries and try to re-coup their profits by \n     making Americans pay higher prices for the same products. \n     This bill recognizes that competition in the global \n     marketplace can work to lower prescription drug costs. If \n     lower cost pharmaceuticals are made available to Americans, \n     drug companies will be forced to re-think their pricing \n     strategy and won't be able to gouge consumers in the United \n     States.\n       Question. What mechanisms does the bill propose to \n     guarantee safety?\n       Answer. The bill would allow importation of qualified drugs \n     only from registered exporters, whose actions will be held \n     accountable in U.S. Federal courts.\n       Registered exporters must have an FDA-approved compliance \n     plan that demonstrates they are meeting the safety \n     requirements established in the bill or by FDA. Exporters \n     must permit FDA inspectors to be present onsite on a \n     continuous day-to-day basis and FDA is required to have \n     assigned inspectors to that exporter. FDA will conduct day-\n     to-day onsite monitoring of the exporter at the place of \n     business for the exporter including any warehouses owned or \n     operated by the exporter and FDA will have access to inspect \n     the exporters records to ensure compliance. Only where an \n     exporter has demonstrated a track record of compliance will \n     FDA be permitted to perform periodic inspections. The FDA \n     must verify the chain of custody for each qualifying drug \n     from the manufacturer of the drug to the exporter.\n       Only licensed pharmacists at the registered exporter will \n     be allowed to dispense prescriptions with a valid U.S. \n     prescription from a U.S. physician. Commercial shipments can \n     only be received and resold by licensed pharmacists. \n     Unauthorized imports\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\n     would be treated as contraband and would be seized and \n     destroyed upon entry without notice. Under the bill, an \n     exporter's registration would automatically be suspended for \n     any attempted entry of non-qualified or unsafe drugs and \n     these exporters can be barred from seeking re-instatement in \n     the future. The bill would allow for importation first from \n     Canada in order to test the safety of the system and \n     determine whether additional controls are needed before \n     expansion to additional counties.\n       Question. How does the bill prevent drug manufacturers from \n     gaming the system?\n       Answer. Drug manufacturers that take any action, directly \n     or indirectly, to prevent authorized importation will see a \n     loss of their tax deduction for advertising expenses. Drug \n     manufacturers that do NOT take action, directly or \n     indirectly, to prevent importation will see a 20 percent \n     increase in their research and development tax credit for \n     that year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2308. A bill to provide for prompt payment and interest on late \npayments of health care claims; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nensure that managed care plans and other private health insurers pay \nhealth care claims in a timely fashion. I thank my colleagues Senators \nLautenberg, Reed, Bingaman and Cantwell for joining me in introducing \nthis bill.\n  This legislation seeks to address the very serious backlog of HMO \npayments that hospitals and physicians are facing in my State of New \nJersey and across the country. Specifically, the legislation requires \nprivate health plans to pay manually filed claims within 30 days and \nelectronically filed claims within 14 days. Insurers that fail to meet \nthese time frames would be required to pay interest for every day the \nclaims went unpaid. Insurers that knowingly violate these prompt \npayment requirements would be subject to monetary penalties.\n  A Federal prompt pay law is critical to ensuring that our health care \nproviders maintain adequate cash flows and are able to continue \nfunctioning. The need for such a law cannot be understated. In my State \nof New Jersey, almost half of all hospitals are operating in the red, \nand that number is growing. Physicians and hospitals are experiencing a \nsevere medical malpractice crisis, which is further limiting their \nresources. Untimely payment of claims has only compounded this problem.\n  According to a survey of 50 New Jersey hospitals, only 39 percent of \nmanually-filed clean claims are paid within 40 days. These institutions \ncannot afford to wait indefinitely for reimbursement for services they \nhave provided. Each year, hundreds of millions of dollars in HMO \npayments to hospitals are held up for months at a time, worsening \nprovider fiscal woes.\n  The problem of late payments has reached such a crisis that 47 \nStates, including New Jersey, have enacted ``prompt pay'' laws to \nrequire insurers to pay their bills within a specific time frame. \nUnfortunately, New Jersey's law, like most similar State laws, is \nlargely ineffective because it lacks strong enforcement provisions and \noffers no incentives for private insurers to comply. Furthermore, State \nprompt-pay laws only apply to non-ERISA regulated plans, which only \ncover approximately 50 percent of New Jersey insureds.\n  Shouldn't we hold private insurers to the same standards that regular \ncitizens must adhere to? If you don't pay your health insurance premium \nwhen it's due, the company will simply cancel your policy. If you're \nlate making your credit care payments, your credit care company charges \nyou interest. Why shouldn't private health insurers also be penalized \nfor making late payments?\n  In my view, it only makes sense to hold insurance companies to the \nsame type of standards to which we hold Medicare. Medicare must pay \nclaims within thirty days of receiving them. Why should private \ninsurers be immune from any such time limits?\n  The bottom line is that patients, hospitals and other health care \nproviders should not have to shoulder the burden of unpaid claims. My \nlegislation will ensure that private insurers assume the financial \nresponsibilities for the health coverage they are being paid to \nprovide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a refundable wage differential credit for activated military \nreservists; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide a financial safety net for the families of our young men and \nwomen who proudly serve in the Nation's military Reserve and National \nGuard.\n  Our country is demanding that our military reservists and members of \nthe National Guard play a more crucial and sustained role in \nsupplementing the activities of our traditional armed forces than at \nany other time in our recent history. In response to the Iraq War and \nhomeland security needs, the country has called up hundreds of \nthousands of our Reserve and National Guard members for extended tours \nof duty of up to 18 months.\n  Today, roughly 175,000 members of the reserve components are on \nactive duty. About 40 percent of the troops now going into Iraq are \nreservists. Reserve component leaders expect the total number of \nguardsmen and reservists on active duty for the war on terrorism to \nremain above 100,000 for the next two years.\n  Since September 11, 2001, more than 60 percent of North Dakota's \nguardsmen and reservists have been called to duty. One of the issues I \nhear most often about from those service members and their families is \nhow hard it is for them to make ends meet on their military incomes.\n  When Guard members or reservists are mobilized, it has an enormous \nimpact not only on their lives, but also on the lives of their loved \nones. In many cases when an individual is mobilized, his or her family \nmay experience a significant loss of income. This is because active \nduty military compensation often falls below what reservists earn in \ncivilian income. These income losses are often exacerbated by the \nadditional family expenses that are associated with military \nactivation, such as the cost of long distance phone calls and the need \nfor extra day care.\n  Clearly this is a major financial problem for many reservists and \ntheir families. The Pentagon's Reserve Forces Policy Board says that a \nsignificant number of mobilized Reserve component members earn less \nthan their private sector and civilian salaries while on active duty. \nThe most recent information provided on mobilization income loss comes \nfrom a Pentagon survey in the year 2000. Some 41 percent of guardsmen \nand reservists who were mobilized that year reported income losses \nranging from $350 per month to more than $3,000 per month. Self-\nemployed reservists reported an average income loss of $1,800 per \nmonth. Physicians and registered nurses in private practice reported an \naverage income loss of as much as $7,000 per month.\n  Those were big losses. But when that survey was conducted in 2000, \nreservists were mobilized for an average of\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\nonly 3.6 months. Today mobilizations of 14 to 18 months are common. So \nthe annual losses in wages are much, much bigger.\n  The loss of income that reservists and guardsmen incur when they are \nordered to leave their good-paying private sector or civilian jobs to \nserve their country often creates an unmanageable financial burden. \nThis further disrupts the lives of their families who are already \ntrying to cope with the emotional stress and hardship caused by the \ndeparture of a beloved spouse, or parent who has been ordered to active \nduty.\n  In the mid-1990s the Pentagon tried to address this problem by \noffering members of the National Guard and Reserve the opportunity to \nbuy insurance to protect against income loss upon mobilization. The \nprogram sold coverage for income losses of up to $5,000 per month. \nUnfortunately, the program was poorly planned and executed, and \nCongress had to appropriate substantial money to bail out the program \nbefore it was terminated. Since then the private sector has shown \nlittle interest in reviving the mobilization income insurance program.\n  We need to find another way to deal with the issue. I believe that \nthe federal government should try to help alleviate the financial havoc \ncreated for activated reservists, guardsmen, and their families. The \nbill I am introducing today will help in this endeavor.\n  Specifically, my legislation provides a fully refundable, 100-percent \nincome tax credit of up to $20,000 annually to a military reservist on \nactive duty based upon the difference in wages paid in his or her \nprivate sector or civilian job and the military wages paid upon \nmobilization. For this purpose, a qualified military reservist is a \nmember of the National Guard or Ready Reserve who is mobilized and \nserving for more than 90 days. The benefit of this activated military \nreservist tax credit is available for tax years beginning after \nDecember 31, 2003.\n  We owe a great deal to those Americans who put on their uniforms and \nserve in the military in the most difficult of circumstances. We can \nnever fully repay that debt. However, we can do much more to remove the \nimmediate financial burden that many National Guard and Reserve \nfamilies experience when a family member is ordered to active duty. \nThis legislation will provide those families with some much-needed \nfinancial assistance. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support my \nefforts to get this tax relief measure enacted into law as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 2310. A bill to promote the national security of the United States \nby facilitating the removal of potential nuclear weapons materials from \nvulnerable sites around the world, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto address one of the critical security issues in the post 9/11 world: \nthe existence of hundreds of vulnerable facilities around the world \nwith nuclear materials. If keeping weapons of mass destruction, WMD, \nout of the hands of terrorists is at the top of our foreign policy \nagenda, then removing weapons-usable material from facilities where it \nis susceptible to terrorist theft or should diversion be a top priority \nfor U.S. national security policy.\n  Yet, currently, there is no single, integrated U.S. government \nprogram, with a defined budget and resources, to facilitate the removal \nof these materials. The legislation I introduce today with Senators \nBill Nelson, and Reed will: establish a presidential task force in the \nDepartment of Energy on nuclear removal; provide a specific mandate for \na program to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the \nworld as quickly as possible; provide specific direction to allow the \nuse of flexible incentives, tailored to each site, to secure host-\ncountry cooperation in removing the nuclear materials, and; authorize \n$40 million in Fiscal Year 2005 to carry out the functions of this \nbill.\n  There are hundreds of facilities around the world that store from \nkilograms to tons of plutonium or highly enriched uranium, HEU. The \nState Department has identified 24 of these locations as high priority \nsites.\n  President Bush singled out terrorist nuclear attacks on the United \nStates as the defining threat our nation will face in the future. In \nmaking the case against Saddam Hussein, he argued: ``If the Iraqi \nregime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of uranium a little \nbigger than a softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a \nyear.''\n  What he did not mention is that with the same amount of uranium, al \nQaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, or any terrorist organization could do the \nsame and smuggle the weapon across U.S. borders. And the fact that AQ \nKhan's network put actual bomb designs on the black market only \nheightens the need to make sure the ingredients are not available.\n  In response to this threat, the Administration has focused its \nefforts on removing vulnerable international nuclear materials through \nfour projects: the take-back to Russia of HEU fuels from Soviet-\nsupplied reactors; the on-going effort to convert Soviet-designed \nresearch reactors from HEU to non-bomb-grade fuels; the decades-long \neffort to convert U.S.-supplied research reactors from HEU to LEU, and; \nthe on-going effort to take back U.S.-supplied HEU.\n  This represents an important first step, but I am deeply concerned \nthat these efforts are not sufficient and do not adequately address the \nseriousness of the issue.\n  The current approach will take 10-20 years to complete at the current \nrate of about 1 facility per year. This is a time frame out of synch \nwith near-term dangers.\n  Under the current approach to the take-back of Soviet-supplied HEU, \nthere have been only two successful HEU removals in more than two \nyears, at Vinca and at Pitesti. But the Vinca operation also required \nthe contribution of $5 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative to \ncomplete, because of the administration's claim of inadequate authority \nto pursue various activities to facilitate Serbian cooperation.\n  The U.S.-Russian bilateral agreement on a broader take-back effort \nhas taken years to complete--and even once final Russian government \napproval is secured, there are a wide range of other issues delaying \nprogress within Russia, including the need to prepare environmental \nassessments of types that have never before been done in Russia, that \nwill require sustained, high-level pressure to overcome.\n  U.S. efforts to convert HEU-fueled reactors within Russia are still \nmoving slowly on the technical front, in part because of insufficient \nfunding, and we are only now beginning to take the first steps toward \nproviding incentives directly to facilities to give up their HEU.\n  The scope of the HEU conversion effort in Russia is inadequate. It \ncovers only research reactors. Outside the scope of current efforts are \ncritical assemblies, pulsed powered reactors, and civilian and military \nnaval fuels. This leaves numerous vulnerable HEU stockpiles scattered \nacross the FSU.\n  Under the current U.S. HEU take-back effort, the return of U.S.-\norigin HEU fuels, if no new incentives are offered, tons of U.S.-\nsupplied HEU will remain abroad when the program is complete, this is \nDOE's official projection.\n  Under the current U.S. HEU reactor conversion effort, if no new \nincentives are offered, scores of U.S.-supplied reactors may continue \nto use HEU indefinitely.\n  A report released last year from the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard University described a scenario in which a 10 \nkiloton nuclear bomb is smuggled into Manhattan and detonated resulting \nin the loss of 500,000 people and causing $1 trillion in direct \neconomic damage.\n  We must do everything in our power to prevent such an event from ever \noccurring.\n  We need a presidential task force in the Department of Energy on \nnuclear removal. We must provide a specific mandate for a program to \nremove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the world as \nquickly as possible and provide specific direction to allow the use of \nflexible incentives, tailored to each site, to secure host-country \ncooperation in removing the nuclear materials.\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n  And, yes, we need additional funding to get the job done.\n  This legislation will give our government the direction, tools, and \nresources necessary to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites \naround the world in an expeditious manner. We have little time to \nspare. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (3) provide funds to upgrade security and accounting at \n     sites where, as determined by the Secretary, potential \n     nuclear weapons materials will remain for an extended period \n     in order to ensure that such materials are secure against \n     plausible potential threats, and will remain so in the \n     future.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the submittal \n     to Congress of the budget of the President for fiscal year \n     2006 pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with other \n     relevant Federal Government and international agencies, shall \n     submit to Congress a report that includes the following:\n       (A) A list of the sites determined by the Task Force to be \n     of the highest priorities for removal of potential nuclear \n     weapons materials, based on the quantity and attractiveness \n     of such materials at such sites and the risk of theft or \n     diversion of such materials for weapons purposes.\n       (B) An inventory of all sites worldwide where highly-\n     enriched uranium or separated plutonium is located, \n     including, to the extent practicable, a prioritized \n     assessment of the terrorism and proliferation risk posed by \n     such materials at each such site, based on the quantity of \n     such materials, the attractiveness of such materials for use \n     in nuclear weapons, the current level of security and \n     accounting for such materials, and the level of threat \n     (including the effects of terrorist or criminal activity and \n     the pay and morale of personnel and guards) in the country or \n     region where such sites are located.\n       (C) A strategic plan, including measurable milestones and \n     metrics, for accomplishing the mission of the Task Force \n     under this section.\n       (D) An estimate of the funds required to complete the \n     mission of the Task Force under this section, set forth by \n     year until anticipated completion of the mission.\n       (E) The recommendations of the Secretary on whether any \n     further legislative actions or international agreements are \n     necessary to facilitate the accomplishment of the mission of \n     the Task Force.\n       (F) Such other information on the status of activities \n     under this section as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (2) The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but \n     may include a classified annex.\n       (f) Potential Nuclear Weapons Material Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``potential nuclear weapons material'' \n     means plutonium, highly-enriched uranium, or other material \n     capable of sustaining an explosive nuclear chain reaction, \n     including irradiated materials if the radiation field from \n     such materials is not sufficient to prevent the theft and use \n     of such materials for an explosive nuclear chain reaction.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Department of Energy for fiscal \n     year 2005 for activities of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration in carrying out programs necessary for \n     national security for purposes of defense nuclear \n     nonproliferation activities, $40,000,000 to carry out this \n     section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 2311. A bill to provide for various energy efficiency programs and \ntax incentives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nFeinstein, Bingaman, and Cantwell, to introduce the Efficient Energy \nthrough Certified Technologies and Electricity Reliability Act, or \nEFFECTER Act of 2004. This legislation is urgently needed to help \nprevent the painful disruption of electric power blackouts, to save \nAmerican consumers billions of dollars in wasted energy costs, to \ncreate jobs, and eventually, to avoid the needless emission of more \ngreenhouse gas pollution than comes from our Nation's entire automotive \nfleet. According to a vast majority of the international scientific \ncommunity, these anthropogenic, or manmade gases, especially carbon \ndioxide, are triggering dramatic changes in the Earth's climate system.\n  This legislation will increase the security and reliability of the \nelectric grid, while reducing natural gas and electricity prices though \na gradual reduction in demand. Targeted tax incentives and standards \nfor energy efficiency in commercial buildings, both new and \nretrofitted, will support the reduction in demand, as will the \nconstruction of new and retrofitted homes, including rental housing, \nand the use of more energy efficient appliances.\n  Last March 4, 2003, I introduced, along with Senator Feinstein and \nothers, the EFFECT Act of 2003, legislation that provided tax \nincentives for advanced levels of energy efficiency and peak power \nsavings technologies in the buildings in which we live, work, and \nlearn. Buildings consume some 35 percent of energy nationwide and are \nresponsible for the emissions of a comparable percentage of pollution; \nvery importantly, they account for more than one-half of the Nation's \nenergy cost. I am pleased that many of these provisions were \nincorporated into the Senate energy bill that passed the Senate last \nfall, as I believe incentives provided through the tax system are \nnecessary to complement existing energy efficiency policies at the \nFederal and State levels.\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\n  The EFFECTER Act of 2004 that we are introducing today goes even \nfurther to encourage the EFFECT Act's tax incentives provided in the \nSenate's energy bill. It encourages administrative improvements, cost-\nefficiencies, and it also reflects a number of consensus provisions \nfrom H.R. 6, the Omnibus Energy Conference Report. These provisions \nmirror simple, common sense solutions, such as the mandatory \nelectricity reliability provisions that have been held hostage to the \nineffective ideas in the energy bill for some 4 years. We provide \nrequirements for electric generating and transmission companies that \nencourage them to cooperate with each other on a mandatory basis, \nsince--as we discovered last summer--relying on ``a gentleman's \nagreement'' doesn't work.\n  The legislation also includes the Energy Savings Performance \nContracts program, whose authorization expired in October of 2003. The \nESPC program promotes consensus energy efficiency standards and reforms \nin Government contracting that save the taxpayers money. This bill \nrequires the Federal Government, through its agencies, to acquire the \nmost cost-effective as well as energy efficient products and to design \nbuildings that can also save the Government money. Through what many \ncharacterized as an arcane scoring method, the CBO had incorporated a \n$3 billion cost increase into the program. However, in its wisdom, the \nSenate, in the FY05 Budget Resolution, appropriately directed the ESPS \nto score at zero. The result is a zero cost to this provision.\n  The EFFECTER Act of 2004 addresses some of our largest energy \nproblems head-on. Its incentives for energy efficiency are more \neffective and expedient than those in the energy bills currently being \ndebated, yet they cost less to the Government. Indeed, over the long-\nterm, they save the Federal Government money.\n  Last August our country suffered a costly and harmful blackout that \naffected some 40 million Americans. Now, more than 6 months later, we \nhave take little effective action to reduce the likelihood that \nadditional blackouts could threaten lives and damage our economy again \nthis year or any time in the near future. Our country currently has a \nneed for more electric power plants, but we also need to protect our \npresent electricity system from overload caused by wasted power use. By \nnot pulling power from the grid at peak times in the next 10 years, the \nEFFECTER Act of 2004 will help America's building owners save more \nelectricity--electriicty equivalent to the amount that would be \nproduced by 350 new power plants of 400 MW capacity.\n  Since last summer, natural gas and oil prices have skyrocketed. These \nhigh prices hurt Americans two ways: jobs are lost when high fuel \nprices force industry to cut back on production, and high heating bills \nstrain family and business budgets. Saving wasted energy is one of the \neasiest and least costly ways to save money and save jobs. This \nlegislation will save American families and business owners over $30 \nbillion dollars annually by 2015, and prevent the waste of over 3.3 \nquads of natural gas annually--over 12 percent of total gas use.\n  We all recognize the importance of increasing employment. Energy \nefficiency creates jobs both through manufacturing, designing and \ninstalling efficiency measures and through additional consumer and \nbusiness spending--spending consumers can afford when their energy \nbills are lower. The EFFECTER Act of 2004 will produce over a half \nmillion new jobs in the American economy.\n  As a Nation, we are engaged in a difficult debate about reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, an effort we believe will protect the world's \nclimate while assuring continued productivity for our economy. By \nreducing energy use that otherwise would be wasted in inefficient \nbuildings, this legislation will reduce greenhouse gas pollution in an \namount equivalent to the reduction that would occur if we took 25 \npercent of the cars off America's roads.\n  These energy, money, and pollution saving solutions focus first on \npromoting fast acting energy efficiency both for natural gas and for \npeak electricity, which in turn also contributes to natural gas demand. \nDramatic energy savings can be obtained by a carefully crafted package \nof low cost market-based incentives and consensus efficiency standards. \nI believe we have crafted just such a package and I urge my colleagues \nto support this bipartisan bill that uses tested, performance-based and \ncost-effective approaches that truly help solve our most immediate \nenergy problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2313. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \na voter-verified permanent record or hardcopy under title III of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, the people of the United States \nlearned many things from the election of 2000. I believe the most \nimportant lesson was that voting equipment should produce a clear paper \nrecord of each voter's intentions for use in a manual recount. \nAmericans remember well that the outcome of the 2000 presidential \nelection was determined by whether a ``chad'' was hanging, pregnant, or \ndimpled.\n  More recently we have found that, despite the passage of election \nreform legislation in 2002 called the Help America Vote Act, our \nelectoral system is still experiencing difficulties. The 2004 \npresidential primaries have produced accounts of voting irregularities. \nThis is especially distressing considering another national election is \njust months away. Voters in several States, including California, \nMaryland, Georgia and my own State of Florida have experienced problems \ncasting their votes and seeing them accurately counted.\n  On the Tuesday, March 9, 2004, presidential primary in Palm Beach \nCounty, FL, the ``oops factor'' again reared its ugly head, casting \ndoubt in the minds of many Floridians about whether or not their votes \nactually counted. An error on the part of poll workers--pressing the \nwrong button to activate voting machines--prevented many from voting in \nthe Democratic primary. A technological error in the tabulation of \nballots in Bay County, FL showed Congressman Dick Gephardt winning the \nprimary by a 2-to-1 margin. Fortunately, Bay County uses a paper ballot \nsystem so they could refer to their paper trail to rectify the error.\n  This is not the first election since 2000 where the value of a paper \nrecord has been apparent. Just this past January, victory in a South \nFlorida Republican primary election for a vacant seat in the State \nlegislature was determined by just 12 votes. In that election, 137 \nblank ballots were cast on electronic voting machines that do not \nproduce a paper record. A candidate requested a manual recount, only to \nfind such a recount impossible without paper records verifying the \nintent of those 137 voters.\n  In Georgia's Presidential Primary, ``smart cards'' containing ballot \ninformation for electronic machines were left unprogrammed. Technical \nirregularities in Maryland elections prevented at least one voter form \nvoting--and he wrote about it in the Washington Post.\n  These incidents and many others are clear evidence that we need \nvoting machines that produce an individual paper record for all votes \ncast. While the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) included provisions \nrequiring paper records for manual audits, we have come to find out \nthat voting jurisdictions are not interpreting these provision the way \nCongress intended.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Clinton and Boxer in introducing the \nRestore Elector Confidence in Our Representative Democracy Act (RECORD \nAct). This legislation will ensure that all voting jurisdictions will \nhave machines that produce voter-verifiable paper records, so that they \nwill be as prepared as they can be to count every vote come this \nNovember. It is critical that Congress take every possible step to \nprevent any resemblance between Election Day 2000 and Election Day \n2004.\n  Once a month I spend a day working side-by-side with the people of \nFlorida. On Saturday, March 6, 2003, I spent my 399th Workday as an \nelections worker for the Miami-Dade County Division of Elections. \nVeteran Supervisor of Elections Connie Kaplan assured me that\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\nelectronic voting machines are accurate. The things I learned on the \njob reinforced that assessment. But several voters expressed confusion \nabout the layout of the electronic ballots, and uncertainty about \nwhether or not their votes had been cast. It was clear to me that \nvoters would be more confident that their votes would be counted if \nthere were a paper record of those votes. In light of reported \nirregularities and security concerns, this voter apprehension is \nlegitimate. In order to be certain about the accuracy and security of \ncomputer voting systems we need a paper record to confirm every vote \ncast.\n  Modern society is replete with electronic machines that provide the \nmost basic services: ATMs, train ticket vending machines, gasoline pay-\nat-the-pump stations. All of these machines produce paper records. The \nvotes of America's citizens are at least as important as these \ntransactions. People do not and should not blindly trust the accuracy \nof computer voting technologies. Congress must pass the RECORD Act so \nthat Americans can have confidence that their votes will be counted.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Graham in \nintroducing the ``Restore Elector Confidence in Our Representative \nDemocracy Act of 2004'' (``RECORD'' Act) because there is no civic \naction more important in a democracy than voting. Yet right now, many \nAmericans have concerns about the integrity of the electoral system. We \nmust restore trust in our voting, and we must do it now.\n  Electronic voting systems, specifically touch-screen voting machines, \nare being increasingly used across the nation. Indeed, according to \nElection Data Services, it is estimated that this November, at least 50 \nmillion voters this year will vote on touch-screen voting machines.\n  These machines have benefits but there are major concerns with the \nsecurity of these machines and the current ability of voters to verify \ntheir votes through a paper record. This legislation effectively \naddresses both of these vitally important issues.\n  In New York, electronic voting is on the horizon. Some machines will \nbe used next year in the New York City mayoral race. As New Yorkers \nstart to use this new technology, I want them to be absolutely certain \ntheir right to elect the leaders of their choice won't be at risk for \nwant of a simple fix like this.\n  When you use an ATM, you get a paper receipt. Right now, when you \ncast an electronic vote, you get nothing. You have no way of knowing \nthat the selections you've made on the touch screen will be recorded \nand counted.\n  This legislation will ensure that voters will be able to verify a \npaper ballot that accurately reflects their intentions and that will be \nlocked away and will be the official ballot in a recount. This \nlegislation will also address the security issues surrounding \nelectronic voting systems.\n  Why is this so critical? Because we know from computer experts that \nthese systems are vulnerable to hacking--and that with just a push of a \nbutton, hackers could turn Kerry votes to Bush votes. Think about that.\n  Indeed, a number of recent studies, including the July 2001 study by \nCaltech/MIT, the July 2003 study by Johns Hopkins and Rice \nuniversities, the September 2003 study by Science Applications \nInternational, and the two November 2003 studies conducted by Compuware \ncorporation and InfoSENTRY, pointed to significant and disturbing \nsecurity risks in electronic voting systems and related administrative \nprocedures and processes.\n  According to the Johns Hopkins study, these voting machines are \nincapable of detecting their own mistakes. Specifically, as one of the \nauthors noted, there is no way to validate the outcome of an election \nusing the current crop of machines. Errors can't be detected and, in my \nopinion, that is a threat to all of us.\n  There were also problems with these machines in the recent \npresidential primaries. Counties in California, Georgia, and Maryland \nreported problems with encoders, the devices that allow touch-screen \nvoting machines to display the candidate and ballot measures specific \nto one county.\n  We already know of stories from Florida in which there was a special \nelection for one office, and the computer election system recorded 120 \npeople as there but not voting.\n  These security concerns have only been inflamed by statements from \npeople like Walden O'Dell--the CEO of Diebold, a major electronic \nvoting machine manufacturer--who said he would do anything to ensure \nthat President Bush would be re-elected.\n  So we have a system that is vulnerable to attack, that provides no \nreal accountability to ensure accuracy and, to add to our concerns, an \ne-voting manufacturer demonstrating his tremendous partisanship. This \nshould give us all pause.\n  This legislation will require the use of voter verifiable paper \nballots so that each and every voter will be able to confirm that his \nor her vote was accurately cast and recorded. The verified paper ballot \nwill be deemed the official record for purposes of a recount and at \nleast 2 percent of all ballots in all jurisdictions in each State and 2 \npercent of the ballots of military and overseas voters will be counted \nat random.\n  One hundred and fifty million will also be appropriated to the \nElection Assistance Commission in order to help States implement the \npaper ballot system.\n  To ensure greater security of electronic voting systems, the Act \nauthorizes the use of only open source software. Manufacturers will \nalso have to satisfy a number of security standards concerning the \ndevelopment, maintenance, and transfer of software used in electronic \nvoting systems.\n  This legislation also provides $10 million to the Election Assistance \nCommission to help it administer the implementation of verification \nsystems and improved security measures nationally, and $2 million to \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology for consultation \nservices to State and local governments regarding voter verification \nand the security of their electronic voting machines.\n  The Commission must receive this additional administrative funding \nbecause unfortunately, even though the Help America Vote Act of 2002 \nauthorized $10 million annually to help the Commission do its work, \nCongress in the fiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriations legislation \nappropriated less than $2 million to the Commission, making it that \nmuch more difficult for the Commission to do its work.\n  Lastly, the Act requires the Election Assistance Commission to report \nto Congress within 3 months of enactment on operational and management \nsystems that should be used in Federal elections and within 6 months of \nenactment on a proposed security review and certification process for \nall voting systems.\n  Our Nation is the greatest nation on earth and it is the leading \ndemocracy in the world. In fact, the Bush Administration takes pride in \npromoting democracy around the world--and they should. But we also have \nto do everything in our power to ensure democracy here. Central to our \ndemocracy is the ability of Americans to have confidence in the voting \nsystem used to register and record their votes. This is a fundamental \nstandard that must be met. We are currently, however, falling short of \nthat standard.\n  And let me say one more thing. The election this November is going to \nbe one of the most important of my lifetime. And every pundit in \nAmerica says it will be close, because we are still so divided. If we \nhave huge problems again, if we have another debacle like Palm Beach \nvoting for Buchanan, people will fundamentally lose confidence in our \ndemocracy and in their vote. We cannot let that happen.\n  This legislation is good insurance against that risk. For all of \nthose who believe that in a democracy, there is no more important task \nthan assuring the sanctity of votes, this should be an easy step to \ntake to assure it. I ask all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2315. A bill to amend the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to \nextend the deadline for the INTELSAT initial public offering; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would make \na\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\ntechnical change to the ORBIT Act's IPO provision.\n  As you may recall, I sponsored the ORBIT Act in 1999 with strong \nbipartisan support. Since that time, I have worked with Senators \nMcCain, Hollings and others to pass technical amendments to the Act by \nunanimous consent when needed. And it is my hope and expectation that \nwe can pass this small technical change as quickly as before.\n  Congress passed the ORBIT Act to enhance competition in the global \nsatellite communications market. I am proud to say that ORBIT has \nachieved all of its objectives. Since its enactment, the FCC has found \nthat positive change has occurred in the satellite services market as a \nresult of the ORBIT Act. The FCC has declared that the pro-competitive \nobjectives of the ORBIT Act have been achieved--including the complete \ntransformation of Intelsat from what used to be a highly bureaucratic, \nintergovernmental organization into a fully privatized, U.S. licensed \ncompany that is headquartered and operates in the U.S., and is now \nsubject to U.S. laws and U.S. regulations.\n  Another important benefit produced by the ORBIT Act has been the \ninfusion of U.S. capital and other private investment into the former \nintergovernmental organizations. American and other private investors \nhave made significant investments in Intelsat and Inmarsat following \nenactment of the ORBIT Act. The only piece of unfinished business from \nthe ORBIT Act that remains is the requirement that an IPO occur by a \ndate certain.\n  I have always had serious reservations with the very idea that \nCongress would impose a date certain for an IPO, rather than letting \nmarket forces determine the appropriate time for such an event. If I \nhad my preference, we would get rid of the mandatory IPO requirement \naltogether. But since the Intelsat IPO deadline is June 30, 2004, we \ndon't have a lot of time to get back into the substance of that issue.\n  The pressing matter at hand is that Intelsat's IPO deadline is fast \napproaching, and the market is simply not conducive for a successful \nIPO. This is the same situation we encountered in 2002 when my good \nfriend Senator Hollings and I worked together to provide a time \nextension for conducting the IPO. I would say to my colleagues that the \ntelecom market isn't much better now than it was in 2002. So we again \nneed to provide Intelsat with an extension on its IPO deadline because \nmarket conditions are not favorable at this time.\n  If Congress does not quickly pass legislation extending the June 30, \n2004 IPO deadline, several U.S. entities who are major investors in \nIntelsat stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars because the \ntelecom market for IPOs is far from ideal. This will be extremely \nharmful to U.S. interests and it will damage Intelsat, an important \ncommunications asset for the U.S.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues and the leadership to quickly \nmove the passage of this legislation. The bill would simply extend \nIntelsat's IPO deadline for 12 months and give the FCC discretionary \nauthority to further extend this deadline another 6 months if market \nconditions warrant.\n  I urge my colleagues to support quick passage of this legislation so \nthat it can be enacted into law well before June 30, 2004.\n  I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nReord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF IPO DEADLINE.\n\n       Section 621(5)(A)(i) of the Communications Satellite Act of \n     1962 (47 U.S.C. 763(5)(A)(i)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``December 31, 2003,'' and inserting ``June \n     30, 2005,''; and\n       (2) by striking ``June 30, 2004;'' and inserting ``December \n     31, 2005;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2316. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \npenalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement plans for adoption \nexpenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation along with Senator Landrieu to help bring adoption within \nreach for more Americans. Today in the United States there are \nliterally thousands of children waiting to be adopted. The average \nchild has been waiting in foster care for about four years.\n  One of the major barriers to adoption for many Americans is cost. I'm \nnot sure that people understand that adopting a child can sometimes \ncost more than $50,000. That's just the adoption process itself!\n  The $10,000 per child adoption tax credit does help some, but it \nhelps after the fact when you have the receipts. The problem is that \nmany times the money for adoption has to be given beforehand--it \nrequires up-front money. The tax credit doesn't help out there.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is one way the Federal \nGovernment can help with the initial costs of adoption. Many Americans \nplace money for their retirement in IRA accounts, but you generally \ncan't touch this money until you're 59\\1/2\\ years old, and if you do, \nyou'll pay not only your marginal tax rate on the withdrawal, you'll \nalso be forced to pay an additional 10 percent penalty to the IRS.\n  There are exceptions to this, however. Under current law, you can \nmake penalty-free early withdrawals from your IRA to help you buy your \nfirst home, pay for excessive medical costs, or for qualifying \neducation expenses. The idea is certainly to encourage savings for \nretirement, but also to allow you to use your own money--penalty free--\nif there's a compelling need.\n  I would make the case on behalf of the thousands of children who \ndesperately want a loving family, and on behalf of the thousands of \nparents who dream of becoming parents, that adoption is a compelling \nneed. And, the majority of Americans agree. Fully 78 percent of \nAmericans said in a poll that they believe the government should be \ndoing more to promote adoption.\n  Our bill would prohibit the IRS from penalizing Americans who want to \nuse a portion of their retirement savings to adopt a child. It would \nallow Americans to withdraw up to $10,000 penalty-free from their IRA \nto help with adoption expenses. This is money that can be used up-front \nto pay for travel, court costs, attorney fees and all of the little \nsurprises that add up to make adoption unaffordable for many.\n  We need to continue to promote adoption in America to the extent that \nwe can. We owe it to these children and to families across our country \nto break down the barriers that keep kids from becoming a part of a \npermanent loving family. I urge my colleagues' support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4053-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4053-S4058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 334--DESIGNATING MAY 2004 AS NATIONAL ELECTRICAL \n                              SAFETY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 338\n\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the amazing \n     contributions that young people make to their communities \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of National Youth Service Day are to \n     mobilize youths as leaders to identify and address the needs \n     of their communities through service and service-learning, to \n     support youth on a lifelong path of service and civic \n     engagement, and to educate the public, the media, and \n     policymakers about the year-round contributions of young \n     people as community leaders;\n       Whereas young people in the United States are volunteering \n     more than has any generation in American history;\n       Whereas the ongoing contributions young people make to \n     their communities throughout the year should be recognized \n     and encouraged;\n       Whereas young people should be viewed as the hope not only \n     of tomorrow, but of today, and should be valued for the \n     inherent idealism, energy, creativity, and commitment that \n     they employ in addressing the needs of their communities;\n       Whereas there is a fundamental and absolute correlation \n     between youth service and lifelong adult volunteering and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas a sustained investment by the Federal Government \n     and commitment by corporate partners fuels the positive, \n     long-term cultural change that will make service and service-\n     learning the common expectation and common experience of all \n     youth;\n       Whereas, through volunteer service and related learning \n     opportunities, young people build character and learn \n     valuable skills, including time management, teamwork, needs-\n     assessment, and leadership, that are sought by employers;\n       Whereas service-learning, an innovative teaching method \n     combining service to the community with a classroom \n     curriculum, is a proven strategy to increase academic \n     achievement;\n       Whereas private foundations and corporations support youth \n     service and service-learning because they believe that strong \n     communities begin with strong schools and a community \n     investment in the lives and futures of youth;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day is a program of Youth \n     Service America, and is being observed in 2004 for the 16th \n     consecutive year;\n       Whereas Youth Service America continues to expand National \n     Youth Service Day, now engaging millions of young people \n     nationwide with 50 Lead Agencies in nearly every State to \n     organize activities across the United States;\n       Whereas Youth Service America has expanded National Youth \n     Service Day to involve over 90 national partners;\n       Whereas National Youth Service Day has inspired Global \n     Youth Service Day, which occurs concurrently in 127 countries \n     and is now in its fifth year; and\n       Whereas young people will benefit greatly from expanded \n     opportunities to engage in meaningful volunteer service: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 339\n\n       Whereas there are currently as many as 150,000 military \n     personnel stationed in Iraq, including more than 100,000 from \n     the United States and approximately 24,000 from coalition \n     member nations;\n       Whereas United States military personnel in Iraq continue \n     to perform their duties with the highest degree of \n     professionalism, patriotism, and heroism;\n       Whereas more than 600 United States military service \n     members have lost their lives and more than 2,988 have been \n     wounded in action in Iraq since the beginning of military \n     action in March 2003;\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n       Whereas since March 2003, the United States has allocated \n     at least $110,000,000,000 for military action, relief, \n     reconstruction, and security operations in Iraq;\n       Whereas on June 30, 2004, the United States is scheduled to \n     turn over control of Iraq to a Transitional Iraqi Government;\n       Whereas the creation of a stable, secure, and democratic \n     Iraq will strengthen regional, international, and United \n     States national security;\n       Whereas following recent violent unrest in Baghdad and \n     Fallujah, the United States Central Command Chief, General \n     John Abizaid, asked United States military staff to examine \n     options for sending more troops to Iraq;\n       Whereas a significant North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) security presence in Iraq would greatly reduce the \n     threat to United States service members currently stationed \n     in that country;\n       Whereas a United Nations and a NATO presence in Iraq would \n     lessen the financial burden on the United States;\n       Whereas NATO has played an integral role in efforts to \n     restore and maintain order in Bosnia, Kosovo, and \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas a comprehensive NATO mandate for peacekeeping \n     operations and a comprehensive United Nations mandate for \n     nation-building in Iraq would greatly increase the legitimacy \n     of the presence of the United States and other members of the \n     international community in that country, as well as the \n     chances of success in establishing a democratic and stable \n     nation for the Iraqi people; and\n       Whereas such a United Nations mandate will not be \n     achievable without the adoption of a United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution establishing such mandate: Now, therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) applauds the dedication, professionalism, and \n     patriotism of United States military service members serving \n     in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world, and remains \n     committed to providing them with all the resources that they \n     need to return home safely when their missions are complete;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to the creation of a stable, \n     secure, and democratic Iraq;\n       (3) recognizes the important role that a United Nations \n     mandate to assist the new Iraqi Government and a North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mandate for peacekeeping \n     in Iraq could play in achieving these goals;\n       (4) urges the President to immediately instruct the \n     Secretary of State to begin initiating consultations with \n     other members of the United Nations Security Council \n     concerning the United Nations mandate for Iraq, with the goal \n     of securing a United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     authorizing such mandate not later than May 15, 2004; and\n       (5) urges the President to immediately instruct the \n     Secretary of Defense to initiate consultations with the \n     Secretary General of NATO and other NATO members with the \n     goal of securing a decision by NATO not later than May 15, \n     2004, to deploy forces in Iraq beginning June 30, 2004, in \n     order to assist Iraqi military and security forces and to \n     establish and maintain a security umbrella to facilitate the \n     work of the United Nations and the interim Iraqi government \n     in building democratic institutions and preparing for \n     nationwide elections in 2005.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know that all of my colleagues have been \nreading the recent reports of increasing violence in Iraq. What once \nseemed to be a small insurgency could possibly be developing into a \nlarger revolt. And this rapidly growing and violent opposition to the \nUnited States presence in that country is placing American service \nmembers at great risk. It is also threatening our goal of securing a \nstable and democratic Iraq. Taken together, I believe that this \nsituation makes it all the more clear what many of us have been urging \nall along--that we need to internationalize our efforts in Iraq now. \nToday, I am submitting a Sense of the Senate resolution urging the \nPresident to do just that.\n  As my colleagues know, there are well over 100,000 United States \nservicemen and -women currently stationed in Iraq. And while our troops \nare going through rotations that are scheduled to leave this number \nsomewhere around 100,000, I would point out that the recent upsurge in \nviolence in that country has prompted U.S. Central Command Chief \nGeneral John Abizaid to ask his military staff to examine options for \nsending more U.S. troops to Iraq.\n  Despite claims by some in the Bush administration that this is not a \nnecessity, it is certain that with this increasing instability, the \ndemands on our troops will continue to grow. That could very well mean \nthat at some point we will need to send more troops to Iraq.\n  This is all coming at a time when arguably, the dangers to our troops \nhave never been greater. Twelve Marines were killed in a single day of \nhostile action last weekend. Four American contractors were brutally \nslain and mutilated last week. And the situation appears to be getting \nworse.\n  Let me be clear. This is not a statement on the abilities of the \nUnited States military. Our troops--and I know there is complete \nconsensus about this--have and continue to perform with the utmost \nprofessionalism, patriotism, and heroism. Nobody can dispute that. And \nthis Senator, for one, remains committed to ensuring that they have \nevery tool at their disposal, every resource that they need, to come \nhome safely and as expeditiously as possible. My resolution, first and \nforemost, reaffirms these facts.\n  But with more than 600 U.S. service members killed and more than \n2,988 wounded since March 2003, the time has come for us to be honest \nabout our needs in Iraq. We need an international security presence in \nthat country. NATO would be the ideal body to provide such an \ninternational presence. It has played an important role in efforts to \nrestore and maintain order in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. And \nplain and simple, the presence of international troops would reduce the \nrisk to U.S. military personnel. My resolution would urge the President \nto instruct the Secretary of Defense to begin consultations with NATO \nwith this goal in mind.\n\n  My resolution would also urge the President to instruct the Secretary \nof State to begin consultations with the United Nations Security \nCouncil concerning a UN Security Council Resolution for Iraq. While \nNATO can help handle the security concerns in Iraq, we need a UN \npresence in that country with respect to efforts to build stable and \ndemocratic institutions.\n  After all, let's be honest, we have a serious lack of international \ncredibility for being in Iraq right now. This lack of credibility is \nimpeding our abilities to secure our political goals in that country. \nIt is preventing the international community from rallying behind us in \nour attempt to build a stable and democratic Iraq--a goal that we all \nshare. And it is preventing us from gaining the legitimacy we need \namong average Iraqis which is so vital to the success of our efforts.\n  Some might even argue that with the June 30th deadline approximately \n12 weeks away, we are moving backwards in terms of our readiness to \nhand over control to an interim Transitional Iraqi Government.\n  This fear was illustrated perfectly by an official from the Coalition \nProvisional Authority (CPA) in an article in today's New York Times. \nLet me quote from that article, which occurs in the context of allied \nand Iraqi security forces' loss of control in the southern Iraqi cities \nof Najaf and Kufa: ``An official in the occupation authority said \nWednesday that . . . months of efforts to win over the population with \ncivil projects and promises of jobs have failed with segments of the \npopulation.''\n  That same official was quoted in the article as saying that ``Six \nmonths of work is completely gone . . . there is nothing to show for \nit.'' According to the same article, ``government buildings, police \nstations, civil defense garrisons, and other police installations built \nup by Americans had been overrun and stripped bare'' in those cities. I \nask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  This all highlights an important fact--that without getting the \nlegitimacy we need to function in Iraq, we will be lacking the most \nbasic foundations for ensuring the success of our efforts--efforts for \nwhich we have already allocated more than $110 billion American \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  The answer for all of this is simple, and I believe that it has been \nfrom the beginning. We must engage NATO and the UN with the goal of \ntheir playing significant roles in Iraq. And we must do it now. NATO \ncan help immensely with sharing the security burden. And a UN mandate \nwill grant us the legitimacy we need to function in Iraq. It will also \ngrant our long time allies, with whom we have been at odds over this \nwar, the domestic legitimacy they need to play a part in building \nIraq's future.\n  We now have a choice. We can continue to argue whether these steps \nshould have been taken before the war. Or, we can join together in \nurging these steps be taken now. Our men and\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nwomen in uniform deserve it. The American taxpayer deserves it. The \nIraqi people deserve it. And our national security and the security of \nthe world deserve it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2004]\n\n      U.S. Vows To Retake 2 Southern Cities in Hands of Militants\n\n                         (By Christine Hauser)\n\n       Baghdad, Iraq, Apr. 8.--The Sunni and Shiite uprisings \n     against the American-led occupation forces in Iraq continued \n     today throughout the country as the high command of the \n     American military acknowledged that militant fighters had at \n     least partial control of two southern cities.\n       Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the American commander in \n     Iraq, said at a news conference here that Shiite rebels had \n     full control of Kut and partial control in Najaf, but he \n     vowed that American forces would retake the cities.\n       ``We are conducting offensives across the battle space to \n     eliminate'' the rebels, he said.\n       American troops are confronting resistance by Sunni \n     militants in a volatile region west of Baghdad and by Shiite \n     insurgents in Baghdad and southern Iraq. The two fronts do \n     not appear to be formally linked but seem to be finding and \n     exploiting common ground in their shared opposition to the \n     foreign occupation.\n       General Sanchez said today that there may be links between \n     the Shiite and Sunni insurgents at low levels of the \n     resistance movements but offered no further analysis.\n       In Baghdad, thousands of Sunni and Shiite protesters held a \n     rally outside the Um al-Qura mosque in solidarity with Sunni \n     countrymen in Falluja, Karbala and other conflict zones, \n     Reuters reported. Similar rallies took place in Mosul and \n     Baquba, north of the capital.\n       Militant Shiites were seen delivering food aid to a Sunni \n     mosque in Baghdad as part of a relief effort for the \n     residents of Sunni-dominated Falluja.\n       ``We will carry our swords and strike the Americans on \n     their heads,'' a Sunni cleric yelled, Reuters reported.\n       The most likely explanation for the coincident eruptions of \n     violence, many Iraqis believe, is that Sunnis and Shiites are \n     each watching the other's assaults, first in Falluja last \n     week and then in other places over the weekend--the Sadr City \n     neighborhood of Baghdad, Kufa, Najaf and at least three other \n     southern cities--sensing that the American forces were \n     overstretched.\n       The eruption of violence across the country has also had a \n     wide impact on American allies there, with forces from other \n     nations coming under direct attack, forcing some countries to \n     rethink their commitments to Iraq.\n       Among the latest challenges to foreign resolve was a \n     mysterious militant group claiming responsibility for the \n     kidnapping of three Japanese citizens. Al Jazeera television \n     showed images today of the three wearing blindfolds and \n     civilian clothes, a group of men armed with assault rifles \n     surrounding them. The group, which called itself Saraya \n     al-Mujahideen, said it would kill the hostages unless \n     Japan withdrew its forces within three days.\n       Japan has about 530 ground troops in Iraq, part of a total \n     planned deployment of 1,100 soldiers for a mission to purify \n     water and carry out other reconstruction tasks.\n       Reuters, quoting the South Korean foreign ministry, \n     reported that seven South Korean members of a church group \n     had also been kidnapped by an armed group in Iraq. About 460 \n     South Korean medical personnel and military engineers have \n     been in Iraq for nearly a year but are scheduled to return to \n     South Korea after Seoul's planned deployment of up to 3,600 \n     troops to the Kurdish region of northern Iraq later this \n     year.\n       And an official from the Foreign Office confirmed today \n     that a 37-year-old Briton had been kidnapped, Reuters \n     reported.\n       In fighting today, American-led coalition forces in Baghdad \n     destroyed a building used as a base of operations for the \n     militant followers of rebel Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, \n     CNN reported, quoting an American military official. American \n     troops suffered no casualties and insurgent casualties were \n     ``minimal,'' the official said.\n       In Falluja in the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad, where \n     some of the most intense battles have occurred this week, \n     fighting raged between American troops and Sunni rebels loyal \n     to the fallen regime of Saddam Hussein. The director of the \n     main hospital there told Reuters that as many as 300 Iraqis \n     had been killed and at least 400 wounded since Sunday.\n       Hospital officials said on Wednesday that several dozen \n     people were killed after Americans fired rockets at a mosque \n     compound in Falluja. American officials said their troops \n     were retaliating against militia members who were firing from \n     the mosque. The mosque itself remained largely intact.\n       Mosque loudspeakers broadcast instructions to townspeople \n     to take their dead to a sports stadium for burial, Reuters \n     reported. Fighting has made the town's cemeteries \n     inaccessible.\n       Pentagon officials in Washington signaled on Wednesday that \n     they would probably delay bringing home some 25,000 troops as \n     scheduled and probably move reinforcements to the south.\n       ``We're facing a test of will, and we will meet that \n     test,'' Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said, adding \n     that the plan to postpone the troop return was part of a plan \n     ``to systematically address the situations we are facing.''\n       The intensification of the combat is sapping efforts to lay \n     the foundations for a largely ceremonial transfer of \n     political sovereignty to the Iraqis on June 30.\n       An official in the occupation authority said Wednesday that \n     allied and Iraqi security forces had lost control of the key \n     southern cities of Najaf and Kufa to the Shiite militia, \n     conceding that months of effort to win over the population \n     with civil projects and promises of jobs have failed with \n     segments of the population.\n       ``Six months of work is completely gone,'' the official \n     said. ``There is nothing to show for it.''\n       He cited reports that government buildings, police \n     stations, civil defense garrisons and other installations \n     built up by the Americans had been overrun and then stripped \n     bare, of files, furnishings and even toilet fixtures.\n       For the first time since the fall of Saddam Hussein a year \n     ago, the Americans found themselves fighting intensely \n     against two main segments of the population, using warplanes, \n     attack helicopters and armored units against the groups the \n     United States had said it came to liberate when it invaded in \n     March last year.\n       In a further indication of widening opposition to the \n     allies' presence, Bulgaria has asked the United States to \n     send troops to reinforce its 450-member battalion in Karbala.\n       In Falluja, the Marines said they had waged a six-hour \n     battle around the Abdel-Aziz al-Samarri mosque before calling \n     in a Cobra helicopter, which fired a missile. An F-16 dropped \n     a laser-guided bomb, Lt. Col. Brennan Byrne said.\n       Elsewhere in Falluja, American forces seized a second place \n     of prayer, the Muadidi mosque, according to The Associated \n     Press. A marine climbed the minaret and fired on guerrilla \n     gunmen, witnesses told the agency. Insurgents fired back, \n     hitting the minaret with rocket-propelled grenades and \n     causing it to partly collapse, the A.P. added.\n       Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the chief military spokesman in \n     Iraq, said the Marines did not attack the mosque until it \n     became clear that enemy fighters were inside and using it to \n     cover their attacks.\n       He told CNN that under the Geneva Convention, the mosque \n     was protected but that once attacks originated from it, its \n     protected status was moot.\n       Much of the Iraqi anger among the Shiites has been fanned \n     by what many here see as a heavy-handed crackdown by American \n     occupation forces on Mr. Sadr, with the closing of his \n     mouthpiece newspaper last week and the announcement of an \n     arrest warrant in connection with a cleric's murder last \n     year.\n       ``What is going on now is a huge popular uprising,'' Qais \n     al-Khazali, a spokesman for Mr. Sadr, said in Najaf on \n     Tuesday.\n       ``This is a reaction from the Iraqi people, not just from \n     the Shiites,'' he said. ``It is for the Sunni people, too. \n     This intifada unites us.'' Intifada, Arabic for shaking off, \n     is the word used by Palestinians for their struggle against \n     Israel.\n       American officials have to balance their security aims \n     without appearing to interfere with a Shiite pilgrimage \n     holiday called Arbaeen, which starts Friday, when millions of \n     Shiites pray at shrines in Najaf and Karbala.\n       ``We are weighing our options, thinking very carefully \n     about the way to restore order to Najaf,'' General Kimmitt \n     said. ``But at the same time, doing it in such a manner that \n     does not alienate the pilgrims who are celebrating one of the \n     most important observances of the Muslim calendar.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 99--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE \n   REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN FOR ITS PARTICIPATION AND COMPLICITY IN THE \nATTACKS AGAINST INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN THE IMPOVERISHED DARFUR REGION OF \n                             WESTERN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 99\n\n       Whereas, since early 2003, a conflict between forces of the \n     Government of the Republic of the Sudan, including militia \n     forces backed by the Government, and rebel forces in the \n     impoverished Darfur region of western Sudan has resulted in \n     attacks by ground and air forces of the Government of Sudan \n     against innocent civilians and undefended villages in the \n     region;\n        Whereas the militia forces backed by the Government of \n     Sudan have also engaged in the use of rape as a weapon of \n     war, the abduction of children, the destruction of food and \n     water sources, and the deliberate and systematic manipulation \n     and denial of humanitarian assistance for the people of the \n     Darfur region;\n        Whereas United Nations officials and nongovernmental \n     organizations have indicated\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\n     that the humanitarian situation in the Darfur region is \n     extremely urgent, particularly in light of restrictions by \n     the Government of Sudan on the delivery of humanitarian \n     assistance for the people of the region;\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2003, United Nations \n     Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland \n     declared that the Darfur region was probably ``the world's \n     worst humanitarian catastrophe'';\n       Whereas, on February 17, 2004, Amnesty International \n     reported that it ``continues to receive details of horrifying \n     attacks against civilians in villages by government \n     warplanes, soldiers, and pro-government militia'';\n       Whereas, on February 18, 2004, United Nations Special Envoy \n     for Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan Tom Eric Vraalsen declared, \n     following a trip to the Darfur region, that ``aid workers are \n     unable to reach the vast majority [of the displaced]'';\n        Whereas Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Peace Prize-\n     winning medical humanitarian relief organization and one of \n     the few aid groups on the ground in the Darfur region, \n     reported that the region is the scene of ``catastrophic \n     mortality rates''; and\n        Whereas nearly 3,000,000 people affected by the conflict \n     in the Darfur region have remained beyond the reach of aid \n     agencies trying to provide essential humanitarian assistance, \n     and United Nations aid agencies estimate that they have been \n     able to reach only 15 percent of people in need and that more \n     than 700,000 people have been displaced within Sudan in the \n     past year: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the Government of the Republic of the \n     Sudan for its attacks against innocent civilians in the \n     impoverished Darfur region of western Sudan and for its \n     failure to take effective actions to stop militia attacks on \n     civilians in the region, and demands that the Government of \n     Sudan immediately take actions to cease these attacks;\n       (2) calls on the international community to strongly \n     condemn the Government of Sudan for its participation and \n     complicity in these attacks and demand that such attacks \n     cease;\n       (3) urges the Government of Sudan to allow the delivery of \n     humanitarian assistance to people in the Darfur region; and\n       (4) urges the President to direct the United States \n     Representative to the United Nations to seek an official \n     investigation by the United Nations to determine if crimes \n     against humanity have been committed by the Government of \n     Sudan in the Darfur region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4058-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3044.

Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk \nwhich is due for its second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for a \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2290) to create a fair and efficient system to \n     resolve claims of victims for bodily injury caused by \n     asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I object to further proceedings on the measure at this \ntime in order to place the bill on the Calendar under the provisions of \nrule XIV.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will be placed on \nthe calendar.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, many Members have been troubled by the \nfact that we are, apparently, after all of the work we have made to get \nto a point where we have a finite list, more extensive perhaps than \neither of us would like on the FSC bill, we are actually not going to \ngo to the FSC bill; we are going to the asbestos bill.\n  As the majority leader knows from conversations I have had with him, \nit is unlikely this legislation will be able to move--not because we do \nnot want to work on a bill that ultimately can become law to address \nthe very legitimate concerns both of us have, all of us have with \nregard to asbestos, but as we have seen with malpractice, this is not \nthe way to do it.\n  One would think that perhaps this is just another effort politically \nthat will not have any result legislatively. I am not ascribing \nmotives, but I hope there could be a real bona fide effort to work \nthrough the issues prior to the time we force votes on the floor, \nespecially when we have other legislation for which many of us have \nbeen working hard to move, including the FSC bill.\n  Having said that, obviously, I am not in a position to stop the \nmajority leader from moving as he has parliamentarily, and I will \ncontinue to express the hope that we can find some constructive \nsolutions that reflect a\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nreal compromise as we address this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will respond to both of these issues. Asbestos is an \nissue the Senator from Delaware and I know the Democratic leader feel \nstrongly about. It is an important bill, a bill we should address. We \nneed to figure out the way to best address it.\n  The introduction of the bill is an attempt to advance the law so we \ncan address it. We will continue discussions as the best way to address \nit.\n  Regarding the FSC/ETI, the JOBS bill, as he said, we have more \namendments than either of us would like. It has been difficult to get \nit to the point we did. But it, too, is a bill we absolutely must \naddress and we will continue to address.\n  I am hopeful over the recess, regarding both of these bills, Members \nwill look at, spend time with, and discuss and debate them in a \nbipartisan way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4060-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, today it is my distinct honor to rise \nand submit a Senate resolution recognizing the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica Awareness Week, which is April 11-17, 2004.\n  Many of my colleagues may not be aware what an outstanding civic-\nminded organization the PVA is in our country. But first let me tell \nyou that these are not just ordinary citizens--they are veterans who \nsacrificed for our Nation in ways we can never fully repay. The PVA is \ncomposed of veterans of the Armed Forces who have spinal cord injuries. \nThey are veterans who honorably and nobly served their country and \ncontinue to serve on a daily basis.\n  The PVA provides invaluable services to veterans' families and to our \nown Department of Veterans Affairs--ensuring that civil rights and \naccess to viable transportation and affordable housing will always be \nprovided to those with spinal cord injuries. PVA does this so their \nmembers may have the same opportunities as the rest of us--for whom \nthese brave members fought--that they may have the independence that we \nall are blessed with in this country.\n  The PVA is a leader in medical and prosthetic research, funding two \nresearch foundations that investigate a broad spectrum of neurological \nsciences to seek a cure for spinal cord injury as well as breakthroughs \nin rehabilitation to improve the quality of life of all Americans with \nspinal cord injuries.\n  I would like to also remind my fellow Senators that the PVA is the \nsponsor of the Nation's largest wheelchair sports programs, fostering a \nwide range of sporting, and indoor, and outdoor recreational events to \nencourage physical activity and comradeship so vital to the ongoing \nrehabilitation of its members.\n  I encourage all of you, indeed all Americans, to take time next week \nto thank those who have made such tremendous sacrifices in order for us \nto enjoy the freedoms we now posses. And please take time from your day \nand find out how you can help and volunteer with your local PVA \nchapter.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 326\n\n       Whereas ethnic violence erupted in Kosovo on March 17, \n     2004, claiming the lives of 20 individuals, including 8 \n     Kosovo Serbs, 8 Kosovo Albanians, and 4 unidentified victims, \n     injuring more than 600 others, and displacing more than 4,000 \n     Kosovo Serbs and other minorities;\n       Whereas the violence also resulted in the destruction of \n     more than 500 homes belonging to Kosovo Serbs, Ashkali, and \n     other minorities, and in the destruction of, or damage to, \n     more than 30 churches and monasteries belonging to the \n     Serbian Orthodox Church;\n       Whereas historic mosques in Belgrade and Nis, and an \n     Islamic center in Novi Sad, were also destroyed or damaged;\n       Whereas in response to the violence, Commander in Chief of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Forces \n     South, Admiral Gregory Johnson, concluded, ``This kind of \n     activity, which essentially amounts to ethnic cleansing, \n     cannot go on.'';\n       Whereas Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General James \n     Jones ordered the deployment of NATO's Strategic Reserve \n     Force on March 19, 2004, to calm the violence and end the \n     destruction;\n       Whereas Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and \n     Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro Goran Svilanovic \n     met in Washington on March 19, 2004, and called for an \n     immediate end to the violence, concurring that no party in \n     Kosovo can be allowed to profit or advance a political agenda \n     through violent measures;\n       Whereas a stable, secure, and functioning multiethnic \n     society is in the best interest of all people of Kosovo, the \n     broader region of Southeast Europe, and the world;\n       Whereas it is essential that political leaders in Kosovo \n     support efforts to establish an environment in which all \n     people in Kosovo have freedom of movement and the ability to \n     live free from fear;\n       Whereas the United States and members of the international \n     community have called on the people of Kosovo to implement 8 \n     standards outlined by the United Nations Interim \n     Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), which are to be met prior \n     to the consideration of the question of final status for \n     Kosovo, including: the existence of effective, \n     representative, and functioning democratic institutions; \n     enforcement of the rule of law; freedom of movement; \n     sustainable returns of refugees and displaced persons, and \n     respect for the rights of communities; creation of a sound \n     basis for a market economy; fair enforcement of property \n     rights; normalized dialogue with Belgrade; and transformation \n     of the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) in line with its \n     mandate; and\n       Whereas it is in the long-term interest of all people of \n     Kosovo that the UNMIK standards are achieved in order to \n     promote peace, stability, and economic development, and to \n     ensure a better future for all people in Kosovo: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges all people in Kosovo to immediately stop the \n     violence, end the destruction of homes, churches, and other \n     cultural and religious sites, and cooperate with North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization's Kosovo Force (KFOR), the \n     United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), and \n     the Kosovo Police in identifying for prosecution the \n     perpetrators of violence and the destruction of property;\n       (2) expresses its deep condolences to the families of those \n     who have been killed in the recent violence;\n       (3) strongly condemns the destruction of personal and \n     religious property in Kosovo, including more than 500 homes \n     belonging to Kosovo Serbs, Ashkali, and other minorities, and \n     of 30 churches and monasteries belonging to the Serbian \n     Orthodox Church, adding to the more than 100 churches that \n     have been destroyed since June 1999;\n       (4) strongly condemns the destruction of historic mosques \n     in the cities of Belgrade and Nis, and of an Islamic center \n     in Novi Sad;\n       (5) recognizes the commitment made by the Kosovo Assembly \n     to establish a fund for the reconstruction of property, \n     including homes and churches, destroyed during the attacks;\n       (6) recognizes the commitment made by Serbian officials to \n     provide funds for the reconstruction of mosques in Belgrade \n     and Nis, and an Islamic center in Novi Sad;\n       (7) urges political leaders to fulfill their commitment to \n     rebuild what has been destroyed and to take all possible \n     action to allow the more than 4,000 Kosovo Serbs and other \n     minorities displaced during the violence to return quickly \n     and safely to their homes and communities;\n       (8) encourages all political leaders in Kosovo to renounce \n     the use of violence, and to proceed with efforts to establish \n     a secure, peaceful, multiethnic society, which protects the \n     rights of all people in Kosovo, and to\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\n     take action to proceed with the implementation of the \n     standards or ``benchmark goals'' outlined by UNMIK;\n       (9) strongly recommends that the United Nations review the \n     structure and organization of UNMIK;

Mr. President, earlier today I submitted a Senate \nresolution that requests the President of the United States to \ndesignate April 16, 2004, as ``National Youth Service Day.'' I am proud \nto be submitting this Senate resolution for the second year. National \nYouth Service Day is the largest service event in the world with over 3 \nmillion participants. National Youth Service Day acknowledges the \nremarkable community service efforts of youth today, and encourages all \npeople to recognize and support the significance of these \ncontributions.\n  National Youth Service Day is a public awareness and education \ncampaign that highlights the positive contributions that young people \nmake to their communities throughout the year. On this day, youth from \nacross the United States and the world will carry out community service \nprojects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. \nNational Youth Service Day brings a diverse group of local, regional, \nand national partners together to support and promote youth service.\n  It is imperative to keep young people active and motivated and \ninstilled with a sense of community responsibility. Volunteer work \ngives youth an outlet to gain this responsibility and to learn valuable \nskills that are essential to personal and academic achievement.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Akaka, Alexander, Allen, Bayh, \nBunning, Campbell, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, Collins, Conrad, DeWine, \nDodd, Domenici, Durbin, Kerry, Landrieu, Mikulski, Murray, Schumer, \nSnowe, Stabenow, and Stevens for cosponsoring this worthwhile \nlegislation, which will ensure that youth across the country and the \nworld know that all of their hard work is greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, on Monday, April 19, the Senate will be in \na period of morning business. I have stated it is our intention at this \njuncture to proceed to the consideration of S. 2290, the asbestos bill. \nAlthough we don't have an agreement on proceeding to the bill, we will \ncontinue to have discussions with the Democratic leadership in an \neffort to move forward on this legislation.\n  A few moments ago we reached an agreement which limits amendments to \nthe FSC/ETI bill or the JOBS legislation. I know the Democratic leader \nworked in good faith to limit amendments on his side, and he has \nwitnessed firsthand that I have had my hands full throughout the day as \nwell. The attempt was made to limit the number of amendments as much as \nwe possibly could. I feel that is what we have done. But I am \npersonally disappointed we can't get the list smaller, especially on \namendments that are totally unrelated. The agreement we entered into is \nto define the universe of amendments, and I would expect and encourage \nthe managers to continue to work to whittle down that list \nappropriately. I expect them to do so, and that was the nature of the \ndiscussion we had today.\n  All of us know the calendar is working against us and we absolutely \nmust, with the sanctions having an impact today and increasing every \nmonth, find a way to get this bill done. I don't believe it should be \nnecessary--I hope my colleagues agree--to consider four pages of \namendments. Again, I encourage the managers to work with all of our \ncolleagues to limit the number of amendments we ultimately consider.\n  As I previously announced, we will not be having rollcall votes on \nApril 19. A number of colleagues will want to talk on the issues, \nincluding asbestos, and they will be able to do that on Monday.\n  Having said that, I wish all of our colleagues a safe and happy \nrecess.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/08/senate-section/article/S4072-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL, 19, 2004, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
