Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the energy bill. When we return to the energy bill, I \nwill be offering the first amendment. That amendment will be the \nethanol amendment that a number of Senators referred to during \nyesterday's session. This amendment will be offered on behalf of myself \nand Senator Daschle as a leadership amendment.\n  Today, Members are welcome to speak on that amendment or the energy \nbill in general. However, as I announced, there will be no rollcall \nvotes during today's session.\n  On Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the jobs/growth \nbill. The order allows for up to 2 hours of consideration during \nMonday's session, but there will be no rollcall votes on Monday as \nwell.\n  I will have more to say on next week's schedule later today, but \nlooking over that schedule this morning, at this juncture I do want to \ntell my colleagues it is going to be a very busy week that likely will \ngo late Friday. Although I am not planning to go into Saturday, in \nlooking at what we need to accomplish next week in terms of the jobs \nand growth package, in addressing, on Thursday, HIV/AIDS, and then \nduring the week, on Friday or sometime during the week addressing the \nissue surrounding the debt limit--all three of those issues we need to \ncomplete next week. I do want to notify my colleagues, it is going to \nbe a long week that will likely extend late into Friday.\n  At this time I have a statement on another subject. The subject is \nbeing introduced and talked about in terms of the backdrop of what we \nhave seen occur in the last 5 months on the floor of the Senate in \nterms of the use of a filibuster being used in an unprecedented way \nwith regard to the nominations for judicial vacancies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5981-7", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5981-S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMENDING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, with some regret but determination, and \nalong with 11 Senators, I submit today--let me read the list of \nSenators at this juncture who are cosponsors of this resolution, a \nresolution to amend the Senate rules. The cosponsors are: Senators \nMiller, McConnell, Stevens, Santorum, Kyl, Hutchison, Allen, Lott, \nHatch, Cornyn, and Chambliss.\n  I submit a resolution to amend the Senate rules. At this point I will \nsend the resolution to the desk. I ask it be referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment will change the way the \nSenate concludes debate on Presidential nominees. No longer will it be \nnecessary to overcome a 60-vote barrier before Senators can exercise \ntheir power to consent to a nomination.\n  Five months into the 108th Congress, we confront multiple filibusters \nof highly qualified and intellectually superior judicial nominees, \nfilibusters that are unfair to the nominees, unfair to the President, \nand unfair to the majority of Senators--Senators who are ready to \nconfirm them.\n  Of course, we all fully respect and honor the views of any Senator \nwho differs from our own assessment on the quality of any particular \nnomination, and I think if he or she finds a particular nominee unfit \nfor any reason, they should vote to reject. But by denying the right of \nan up-or-down vote on a nominee and choosing, rather, to filibuster, \nthey deny the Senate and each Senator the right to vote at all.\n  The remedy is filibuster reform. Over time, many Democrats as well as \nmany Republicans have proposed changes to\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nintroduce greater fairness in the Senate rules. It is to these \nproposals that I have looked in crafting this resolution.\n  My proposal is similar to S. Res. 85, proposed in March by my \ndistinguished Democratic colleague from Georgia, Senator Zell Miller. \nIt also tracks a recommendation offered in 1995 by the distinguished \nDemocratic Senators from Iowa and Connecticut, Tom Harkin and Joe \nLieberman. Both the Harkin-Lieberman and the Miller resolutions provide \nfor declining cloture requirements of 60, 57, 54, and 51 on successive \ncloture motions. They represent a wholesale reform of the cloture rule, \napplying to every debatable proposition.\n  My resolution is different. My resolution, by contrast, is more \nnarrowly tailored, tailored to respond to the problem at hand. My \nresolution applies only to nominations. It leaves the rest of rule XXII \nunamended. It addresses the very specific defect that needs repair.\n  There are other differences, however minor, from these other cloture \nreform efforts. Unlike these earlier proposals, mine would not allow a \ncloture motion to be filed until a nomination had been pending before \nthe Senate for at least 12 hours. This provision tracks language that \nthe distinguished Democratic leader inserted into S. Res. 8, the power-\nsharing resolution he introduced in the last Congress.\n  I share his purpose to ensure that there exists an adequate \nfoundation of debate before cloture is sought.\n  My resolution also provides for a step below constitutional majority \nof 51 votes on the fourth cloture attempt. Under my proposal, further \ncloture motions will require a majority of all Senators present and \nvoting. This provision is included in response to colleagues who \nbelieve that supermajority voting requirements on nominations are \nunconstitutional. If 95 Senators are present, a 51-vote threshold is \nstill a supermajority. Cloture by a majority of Senators present and \nvoting has deep historical roots among Senate Democrats.\n  In past years, such a change was offered by eminent and distinguished \nSenators such as Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Paul Douglas of \nIllinois, and Wayne Morse of Oregon. These Senators proposed to reach \nall Senate debate, not just nominations.\n  Under the proposed new procedures, cloture cannot be precipitously \ninvoked. Not only is there a 12-hour waiting period, but in addition, \nthe resolution tracks the provision from the Harkin-Lieberman and \nMiller initiatives that one cloture motion cannot be filed until \ndisposition of the prior cloture vote. This is contrary to the present \noperation of rule XXII which permits multiple cloture motions to be \nadvanced without waiting for the outcome of the cloture motion \npreviously filed. Between the time a nomination is brought to the floor \nand the moment that it can be confirmed by a simple majority vote, the \nelapsed time would be 13 session days.\n  I stated that I regret having to introduce this resolution. The right \nto debate is not unlimited but, indeed, it is precious and important. \nMy first vote as a U.S. Senator was in 1995 to table the Harkin-\nLieberman resolution even though I was a freshman in a newly elected \nmajority, and the cloture amendment they proposed would have advanced \nour party. By contrast, in the Senate today are nine Democratic \nSenators who voted in favor of the sweeping Harkin-Lieberman reform. I \nask: Will they now support my more narrow remedy?\n  I was presiding when the distinguished Democratic Senator from West \nVirginia, Robert Byrd, took to the floor to contend that Harkin-\nLieberman was unnecessary because it was primarily aimed at controlling \nfilibusters on motions to proceed. ``No need to change the rules,'' \nsaid the Senator, ``because a leader could avoid such filibuster by \noffering nondebatable motions in the morning hour.'' The Senator did \nnot argue the absence of a problem but, rather, the presence of an \nalternative solution, a safety valve so further limiting of debate was \nnot required.\n  I was persuaded by his logic. I opposed then, and would oppose now, \ncomprehensive change in rules governing Senate debate.\n  However, in the case of nominations, the safety valve of an \nalternative solution is not as readily at hand. Under existing cloture \nrules, the filibuster of a nomination is the last word and it is fatal.\n  Filibustering nominations is a relatively new phenomenon, even as to \nthe nominees for the executive branch, and it has emerged in this \nCongress as a particular problem relative to Federal judges. Prior to \nthis year, the record number of cloture votes on any nominee was three, \nand on a judicial nominee the record was two. Already, we have had six \ncloture votes on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the District of \nColumbia Circuit Court of Appeals, two cloture votes on the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and indeed \nthreats from the minority for additional filibusters on other nominees. \nClearly, we have entered upon a new era, damaging to the Senate as an \ninstitution, where a majority will be denied its right to consent to a \nnomination because a minority will filibuster to hold that nomination \nhostage.\n\n  The need to reform the filibuster on nominations is obvious, and it \nis now urgent. Many will contend that the Senate should not rubberstamp \nPresidential appointments. I fully concur. The Senate's responsibility \nunder article II to advise and consent is critical to maintaining the \nchecks and balances of our constitutional system. For reasons \nsufficient unto itself, the Senate may reject any nominee. Brought \nforward to a vote, the Supreme Court nominations of Clement Haynsworth, \nG. Harrold Carswell, and Robert Bork all failed on the Senate floor, \nand not by filibuster. Scholars may argue whether these nominees should \nhave been turned aside, but no one can dispute the Senate's right to \nreject them. The Senate's constitutional role must never be diminished.\n  In the case of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, it is plain that \nthe votes to confirm are present. They have the support of a majority \nof Senators. But the votes to confirm cannot be taken because these \ndebates have been tainted by filibuster. Without filibuster reform, a \ndisciplined minority can cast an ever-lengthening shadow over the \nconfirmation process. Through reform, we will respect the right of all \nSenators to act upon a nomination brought to the floor. In so doing, we \nwill strengthen the Senate as an institution and enhance its \nconstitutional purpose.\n  It is unfortunate that we have come to this point. I would have far \npreferred that nominations be given a floor vote after full and free \ndebate. As the filibuster strategy emerged, I tried many times without \nsuccess to secure agreements to vote at a time certain. Wanting to \nrespect minority rights and, indeed, the right of all Senators, I \nwithheld filing for cloture on the Estrada nomination until it had been \npending for 13 days.\n  But just as I act with regret, I act with determination. For almost \nall our Nation's history, filibustering nominations was unheard of and \nunknown. It was unknown when the cloture rule was adopted in 1917. It \nwas unknown when the rule was extended to nominations in 1949. The \nrenowned filibusters of the 1950s and 1960s never involved \nfilibustering a judge. Senator Richard Russell of Georgia led both \nfilibusters, but even in the face of glowing judicial activism neither \nhe nor his allies ever filibustered a judge.\n  Obviously, some respected traditions have changed. Senate rules are \nnot immutable. Senate norms have altered over time, and our rules have \nchanged in response. The initial cloture rule of 1917 was a reaction to \ncumulative and growing consternation over years of uncontrolled \nfilibusters. The 1949 expansion reflected frustration that the original \nrule was too narrow and applied only to pending measures. In 1959 and \n1975, the rule was amended because the hurdle for cloture was thought \nto be too high. In 1979, Senator Byrd successfully amended the rule to \neliminate the abuse of postcloture filibuster. Before the practice of \nfilibustering nominations takes deeper root and damages the Senate even \nmore, it is time to amend our rules again. I act now as a first step to \nensure we have a confirmation process that is fair to the nominees, \nthat is fair to the President, and that is fair to all Senators. If we \nachieve that, we will also be fair to the American people.\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5981-7", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5981-S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMENDING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this renewable fuels \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Daschle, as well as a number \nof other Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked on this \nimportant issue for a number of years.\n  I think the fact that the Democratic leader and I have joined \ntogether to offer this amendment demonstrates the significance of this \nparticular issue as well as the broad bipartisan support that this \ncompromise package enjoys.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to commend all of the cosponsors \nof the amendment, many of whom came to the floor yesterday morning to \nspeak, for their hard work, their dedication over the years in forging \nthis agreement. I also note that the President has made passage of this \namendment a priority, and I commend him for his commitment to getting \nthis done.\n  This particular amendment will enhance America's energy independence \nand energy security by increasing the use of domestically produced, \nclean, renewable fuels. As the chairman of the Energy Committee has \npointed out many, many times, America is dangerously dependent on \nforeign oil. We currently import 60 percent of the oil we consume, and \nthat number is increasing. One of the major goals of this energy bill \nwe are debating on the floor of the Senate is to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil. This amendment is a critical component of that effort.\n  The Frist-Daschle amendment establishes a national renewable fuels \nstandard of 5 billion gallons per year by the year 2012, nearly \ntripling the use of ethanol and biodiesel over the next decade. It \nphases out the use of MTBE over a 4-year period and authorizes funding \nto prevent and clean up MTBE contamination from leaking underground \ntanks. And it repeals the Federal oxygen content requirement for \nreformulated gasoline, with strong antibacksliding language to ensure \nthat air quality is not compromised.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this amendment is the product of a great \ndeal of work by many Members of the Senate over the last several years. \nIt is a compromise that has broad, bipartisan support. It will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. It will protect the environment. It will \ncreate jobs. It will increase farm incomes. It will stimulate \ninvestment in rural communities.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Daschle and all of the other \nsupporters of this package to get it adopted as expeditiously as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5983-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5983-S5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the schedule of the majority leader \nis burdensome. I do wish to say a few words while he is here regarding \nthe proposed rule change.\n  First of all, I have said, on a number of occasions in recent weeks, \nthat I understand the intensity of the feeling of members of the \nmajority--some members, not all--on the Miguel Estrada nomination and \nthat of Priscilla Owen. But I do say, that for people to lament that \nthe process is broken regarding judges is simply without foundation or \nfact. Mr. President, 124 judges have been approved for President Bush--\n124. Two have been held up.\n  The number of cloture motions that have been filed, for those of us \nwho have served in the Senate for some time, is somewhat meaningless. \nThe reason you continually file new cloture motions is if there is a \nchange in the vote. And for Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada, there \nhas not been a single vote change--not one. They are all the same. So \nfiling those cloture motions is just for show; it has no basis in \nsubstance.\n  Now, I do say to the leader that I think this is being approached in \na proper fashion. I think that to go to seek a rules change is the way \nit should be done. If you don't like what is going on here, try to \nchange a rule.\n  I have been personally--and I am sure it has not gone without the \nnotice of others--concerned about some of the statements made by \nMembers of the majority saying they are going to have this rule changed \nregardless of what the Rules Committee does; that if it does not work \nout in the Rules Committee, they are going to come here and have the \nPresiding Officer just say what we have been doing is unconstitutional.\n  Now, one of the newspapers announced that this would be nuclear. I \nthink, legislatively, nuclear is the proper term.\n  I have no problem--I say this to the majority leader--seeking to \nchange the rules. If the rules are changed by a procedure we have \nalways used here in the Senate, I will go along with that. But to have \nsomething done, that is to say suddenly that you cannot have a \nfilibuster because it is unconstitutional, creates many different \nproblems. Does that mean if 11 members of the Judiciary--a majority--\nholds up a judicial nominee, that that is unconstitutional and it can \ncome immediately to the floor? I think not.\n  So I recognize--I have been as frustrated as anyone trying to get \ncloture motions filed and cloture determined on a vote. I can remember \nwhen I was a relatively new Member of the Senate--I was not too new \nthen--during the Clinton administration and we were trying get grazing \nchanged in the western part of the United States. We had four or five \ncloture motions filed. We got up to 57 or 58 Senators on that occasion. \nAnd we were moving, filing the cloture motions that seemed to be \ngaining status.\n  Then suddenly George Miller from the House and Harry Reid from the \nSenate were called to the White House, and the President of the United \nStates, Bill Clinton, said: We are not going to support you on this \nanymore. It is over with. He had made some arrangements with House \nMembers, and our trying to get cloture invoked on something we believed \nwas very important was, in effect, pulled out from under us. I can \nstill remember that.\n  But in those, I say to the majority leader, when cloture motions were \nfiled by Senator Byrd, we kept gaining votes. In relation to Miguel \nEstrada and Priscilla Owen, that is not the case.\n  So again, I say, that the majority leader is approaching this in the \nSenate way, the right way. I do say--and I know he has had \nconversations with the Democratic leader, and I have spoken to other \nMembers on the other side--I hope it will be done in that fashion and \nnot by some jury-rigged fashion to change the rules by some \n``constitutional'' matter.\n  I even understand one of the Republican Senators is filing a lawsuit. \nFine. More power to them. Let them file a lawsuit. I think that is the \nway it should be determined. But don't change the Senate rules in some \nother fashion because it would really damage our ability to move \nforward on legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just in closing, on my behalf, the whole \npurpose of submitting this resolution today is to further elevate the \ndebate in recognition that things change in\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nthe Senate over time. As we look back over the cherished history we all \nshare--and it is our heritage--things today are different, and there \nare times for the rules to change. When you even contemplate changing \nthe rules, you have to give a great deal of thought and debate and \ndiscussion, and that is what is underway today in submitting this \nresolution. I believe it is a reasonable, commonsense way of addressing \nan approach to addressing the issue.\n  I look forward to the continued debate, in referring it to the \nappropriate committee, where that debate can begin. And we can be \ncommenting on the floor itself.\n  Again, this proposal is a bit different from the others that have \nbeen submitted in the past. It is similar in many ways in drawing upon \nprevious legislation. It is different in the fact that it is narrow and \napplies to nominations; that there is this 12-hour period to give \nadequate time to have the debate and discussion; to start off with a \nthreshold that is 60 votes, but over a period of 4 steps comes down to \nultimately what is a majority vote of those present. The only other \ndifference is the cloture votes would be filed sequentially. You have \nto dispose of one cloture vote before you go to the next, again to make \nsure we do not cut off adequate time to have a debate, but also to \nassure, at the end of the day, that the right of every Senator to \nexpress themselves in an up-or-down vote will be present.\n  So I am very excited about the resolution itself. Again, we are \ntrying to do it in a very deliberate, a very focused, a very \ndisciplined way. That is the purpose of the submission of the \nresolution today. I do hope it provokes discussion and debate on this \nfloor and in committee so we can bring this, what is unprecedented in \nterms of partisan filibusters, to an end as it applies to judicial \nnominees.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was not in the Chamber until just a few \nmoments ago. I didn't have the luxury of hearing the distinguished \nmajority leader. His comments have been reported to me, and I have now \nhad the opportunity to see the text of his remarks.\n  I welcome the introduction of his resolution. A Senator is within his \nrights and certainly a majority leader is within his rights to suggest \nchanging the rules. If we are to change rules, there is a procedure. \nAnd I respect the majority leader's interest and determination to \nsuggest ways that the rules could be changed with regard to filibusters \nor, for that matter, any rule involving Senate procedure.\n  He joined me in opposing this proposal when it was offered by \nSenators Harkin and Lieberman about 10 years ago. But obviously, over \nthe course of 10 years, we all have a right and an expectation that we \nwill change our points of view from time to time. He has on this \nmatter.\n  As in most parts of this country, slogans and phrases sometimes have \nmore wisdom than one might see on the surface. There is an old slogan \nor saying in South Dakota that I am sure is repeated in other States: \n``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' It ain't broke.\n  Anytime you can confirm 124 judicial nominees in the course of 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, I don't see much broken. That is a 98.4-percent confirmation \nrate. Any baseball player standing at home plate would settle for 500 \npercent, 400 percent, 300 percent. Any quarterback would love to have a \n98-percent rate of completion on passes. I don't know of another \nadministration that has enjoyed the success in confirmations of its \njudges that this administration has: 124 to 2; that is the score; 124 \ncircuit judges, district judges; 124 nominees who have worked their way \nthrough hearings, through a committee vote in the Judiciary Committee, \nand on to the floor in 2\\1/2\\ years; 124 to 2.\n  Those two, Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, have unique \ncircumstances. In the case of Mr. Estrada, it is a matter of asking him \nwith all deference to fill out the application form for the job.\n  I have many employees. I am fortunate to have such good ones. But \nnobody would work in our office if they refused to fill out pages 3 and \n4 and 5 of a 5-page application. If they said: I will fill out the \nfirst two pages but not the last three, I would say: Find another job. \nYou are not going to work here.\n  That is really what Mr. Estrada is saying to us. In spite of the fact \nthat Mr. Bork, Mr. Rehnquist, Mr. Civiletti, and so many other nominees \nwho have had similar circumstances have provided the very information \nwe are asking of Mr. Estrada, Mr. Estrada and his supporters in the \nadministration are saying: No, we will not comply. We will not fill out \nthe job application.\n  Our response is: Fill out the job application and you will get a \nvote. It is that simple. In the case of Ms. Owen, we have a record that \nis very disconcerting, a record of putting her own views ahead of the \nlaw. We cannot accept that either. If she would comply with the law and \ninterpret the law, it would be one thing; but to ignore the law and to \nuse her own views as she applies her decisionmaking authority is not \nsomething that is acceptable as well. So you have those two nominees.\n  I know some of my colleagues have lamented this notion that \nfilibusters could be employed, but we had a filibuster in the 106th \nCongress of a man of incredible stature and standing, Richard Paez. He \nwas a nominee to be U.S. Circuit Judge in the Ninth Circuit during the \n106th Congress. This was a filibuster. I find it interesting that the \nmajority leader was one of those who voted against cloture. He \napparently felt at the time that cloture was inappropriate, or he would \nnot have voted against it. In other words, he voted to extend the \nfilibuster during that debate on Mr. Paez.\n  But Senator Frist certainly is not alone. There were 14 people who \nvoted to continue debate on Mr. Paez. Senator Hatch, as recently as \n1994, said the filibuster is--using his words--``one of the few tools \nthat the minority has to protect itself and those the minority \nrepresents.'' Senator Hatch made the statement during a filibuster to a \nClinton nominee to the Third Circuit. In 1997, 3 years later, Senator \nHatch stated:\n\n       Determining which of President Clinton's nominees will \n     become activists is complicated and it will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questioning. \n     . . .\n\n  Senator Smith of New Hampshire--no longer with us in the Senate--also \ncame to the floor to argue forcefully in support of filibustering \njudicial nominees. His quote:\n\n       So I do not want to hear that I am going down some trail \n     the Senate has not gone down before by talking about these \n     judges and delaying. It is simply not true. Don't pontificate \n     on the floor and tell me somehow I am violating the \n     Constitution . . . by blocking a judge or filibustering a \n     judge that I don't think deserves to be on the court. That is \n     my responsibility. That is my advise and consent role, and I \n     intend to exercise it.\n\n  So, first, on the basis of the record, 124 to 2, and second, on the \nbasis of past precedent, both with regard to Republican positions \nrelating to these judges, as well as to the advocacy of the filibuster \nin prior years, makes me question: Why now, with that record, would \nanybody be concerned about the rights of the minority, the rules of the \nSenate, or the longstanding practice every Senator has been the \nbeneficiary of with regard to using the rules of the Senate to advance \nhis or her arguments?\n  Mr. President, I guess I will simply reiterate the admonition many \nSouth Dakotans oftentimes use: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Mr. \nPresident, it ain't broke.\n  The Federalist Papers are those papers we turn to with some frequency \nas we attempt to interpret the intentions of our Founding Fathers as \nthey considered the institutions of the Senate and the House, our \ndemocracy. Federalist 63 says:\n\n       The people can never willfully betray their own interests; \n     but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of \n     the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where \n     the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one \n     body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and \n     dissimilar bodies is required in every public act.\n\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\n\n  Well, the key word in Federalist 63 is the word ``dissimilar.'' We \nare not the House of Representatives. We are the body where \ndeliberative, extensive, unlimited debate is protected. That is the \nessence of the Senate. I sometimes don't know that we live up to the \nmoniker ``the greatest deliberative body in the world.'' Sometimes I \ndon't think we are particularly deliberative. But we are rooted in the \ntraditions of unlimited debate. That has been the essence of this body \nfor well over 200 years.\n  I hope we never minimize the importance of our distinctions, our \ndissimilarities with the House, the intentions of the Founding Fathers \nwhen it comes to the protections, traditions, and the usefulness of the \nrules of the Senate, just as they applied over 200 years ago. That, in \nessence, is what is at stake.\n  As I said at the beginning, the majority leader is certainly within \nhis right to propose rules changes. That has happened by leaders and \nSenators on both sides of the aisle for hundreds of years. We will \nalways examine ways with which to make the Senate work more \nfunctionally and perhaps more efficiently. I don't want to give up the \ntradition of the very essence and meaning of the body for the sake of \nefficiency, for the sake of moving things along because, indeed, that \nwas not the intent or the expectation of our Founding Fathers.\n  Let me finish by restating the score: 124 to 2. It ain't broke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5985-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5985-S5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know the majority leader also came \nbefore the Senate this morning to do what I expected he would do \nyesterday. He has laid down the first amendment in the energy debate. I \nwant to again commend him for his leadership and involvement with \nregard to the ethanol amendment. The ethanol amendment enjoys broad \nbipartisan support. That was evidenced, of course, yesterday as people \non both sides of the aisle came to the floor and spoke eloquently and \nwith conviction about the importance of this legislation. It is \nimportant, in part, because of our dependency upon foreign sources of \noil.\n  We use too much imported oil. The more we can become self-sufficient \nand independent, the more we can truly not only help our own economy, \nbut create environments within which questions pertaining to our \ndependence will not become key issues as we resolve whatever diplomatic \nor international challenges our country may face.\n  Energy independence is a laudable goal and it is within our grasp. \nBut the only way it can be achieved is with the creation of renewable \nfuels, the creation of fuels that can be discovered, utilized, and \ncreated in this country. There is no better example of that than \nethanol. Ethanol reliance means energy independence.\n  Secondly, the environmental issues are clearly at stake as we \nconsider the consequences of ethanol. Clean air benefits cannot be \nunderstated. In 2002 alone--just last year--ethanol use in the United \nStates reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.3 million tons, which is \nthe equivalent of removing more than 636,000 vehicles from the road. \nThat is a remarkable achievement. That was in 1 year. If you can \nimagine taking 636,000 vehicles off the road in 1 year, and the effect \nit would have on greenhouse gases if we could do that, that is in \nessence what we were able to create with this increased reliance on \nethanol--not to mention our opportunity to phase out methyl tertiary \nbutyl ether, MTBE, contamination.\n  MTBE contamination was also used as an oxygenate to improve \nenvironmental circumstances when the oxygen standard was passed in the \nearly 1990s. We only found later how contaminating and toxic it can be. \nSo phasing out MTBE is also a part of our legislative approach, and \nthat, too, will have dramatic positive environmental consequences.\n  We talk about the economic consequences of ethanol and that, too, can \nhardly be overstated. One in three rows of corn in South Dakota today \nis being used to produce ethanol. The ethanol industry is creating $1 \nbillion in additional economic impact in my State alone. It means \nhigher corn prices. It means prices will increase, according to USDA \nestimates, 50 cents a bushel, about $1.3 billion in additional farm \nincome annually once this legislation is enacted.\n  The University of South Dakota has stated this proposal has the \npotential to create 10,000 new jobs in our State, bringing in more than \n$600 million annually to the State economy and over 214,000 jobs \nnationally once the RFS is implemented.\n  From an economic point of view, in addition to the environmental and \nenergy independence advantages, we also have, of course, an \nagricultural advantage: more income for farmers with less reliance on \nfarm programs.\n  There is a lot to be said for this legislation. I am very pleased, \nafter all these years, as lonely as it was when we started, to see this \nkind of broad-based support. I would estimate now more than two-thirds, \nmaybe three-fourths, of the Senate would support this legislation. We \nare well on our way to establishing what I view to be an appreciation \nof the importance, the contribution, the impact that ethanol can have \nin energy, in the economy, in agriculture, and in foreign policy.\n  That is why I feel as strongly as I do about the amendment, and that \nis why I am pleased to be a cosponsor with Senator Frist and many of \nour colleagues, including the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \nMr. Johnson, on this amendment.\n  I hope the Senate will act quickly. Let us adopt this amendment. Let \nus ensure, whether it is part of the energy bill or a freestanding bill \nthat was reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthat we will have the opportunity to enact this legislation into law \nsometime this year. We should not wait any longer. It should happen \nthis year. It can happen this year. With the broad bipartisan support, \nit will happen this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the renewable fuels standard amendment just offered by \nSenator Daschle and Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong support of \nthe bipartisan renewable fuels standard amendment and to encourage my \ncolleagues to support this critically important provision when it comes \nto a vote.\n  Last year, Senator Hagel, my Republican colleague from Nebraska, and \nI worked on a renewable fuels standard for ethanol and biodiesel during \nconsideration of the Senate energy bill. We were successful in securing \ninclusion of a renewable fuels standard in the Senate energy bill. We \nwere successful on the Senate floor, but as we got to conference with \nthe House of Representatives, the entire energy bill wound up not being \npassed and the whole collection of provisions collapsed in the end. But \nwe were successful in the Senate Energy Committee last year, we were \nsuccessful on the Senate floor, and I am very optimistic this year that \nwe not only will pass a renewable fuels standard in the Senate once \nagain but that with newfound interest in the RFS in the House of \nRepresentatives, I am confident this will ultimately make it to the \nPresident's desk and become law this year.\n  Regrettably, time ran out on us last year during the 107th Congress, \nand yet two-thirds of the Senate voted in favor of a renewable fuels \nstandard and against amendments that would have weakened or eliminated \nit.\n  Today, ethanol and biodiesel comprise less than 1 percent of all \ntransportation fuel consumed in the United States. Out of 134 billion \ngallons of fuel consumed in the U.S., renewable ethanol and biodiesel \nmade from soybeans comprise less than 3 billion gallons--3 billion out \nof 134 billion gallons consumed.\n  Our amendment, identical to language passed in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, would require that 5 billion gallons of \ntransportation fuel be comprised of renewable fuel by the year 2012.\n  The consensus was agreed to last year after productive negotiations \nbetween the renewable fuels industry, agriculture groups, the oil \nindustry, and environmentalists.\n  Rural States such as South Dakota can make enormous contributions to\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nenergy independence throughout our Nation with a renewable fuels \nstandard. Thanks to the establishment of six new farmer-owned co-ops in \nSouth Dakota since 1999, ethanol has enjoyed significant growth in our \nState. We are currently ranked fifth in U.S. production.\n  Remarkably, one out of every three rows of corn in South Dakota is \nmarket bound for ethanol production already. More than 1 million \nbushels of corn are sold annually to produce nearly 400 million gallons \nof ethanol in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Around 8,000 farm families are involved in value-added ethanol \nproduction at one of the eight facilities currently in operation, and \ntwo more facilities are under construction. Ethanol helps these South \nDakota families increase their income in three ways.\n  First, ethanol plants help spur competition for corn and boost corn \nprices locally. Corn prices include between 8 and 15 cents per bushel \nwhen an ethanol plant is based in a local market. Second, membership in \na value-added ethanol co-op yields profits, or dividends, from ethanol \nproduction which supplements farm income. And third, it creates farm \njobs in rural communities throughout our State.\n\n  However, most farmers involved with ethanol indicate to me that a \nsignificant share of their investment thus far in ethanol facilities \nhas been, for all practical matters, a faith-based investment. They \nsimply have faith that ethanol is right for their investment and right \nfor America, but there has been no adoption of ethanol or biodiesel as \na part of a national energy strategy.\n  Adoption of our bipartisan RFS amendment today will give them and \nother producers more than just faith when considering whether to invest \nin an ethanol plant. Our amendment will give producers a rock solid \ncommitment that the United States will, in fact, increase the demand \nand the market for ethanol and biodiesel.\n  The U.S. energy situation, as we all know, is uncertain, considering \nhow volatility in gas and diesel prices, the growing tension in the \nworld from terrorist attacks, and how the war in Iraq affected us. The \nmore we depend on oil from the Middle East, the more our stability is \ninevitably tied to governments and factions in that region. The use of \ndomestic clean renewable energy sources can increase our energy \nsecurity and increase our Nation's security. It must be a critical part \nof our Nation's energy strategy.\n  Simply put, adoption of the RFS amendment will help lower our \ndependence on foreign oil, strengthen energy security, increase farm \nincome, provide for clean air, and create jobs throughout the United \nStates, particularly in the rural communities.\n  An important, but underemphasized fuel is biodiesel, which is chiefly \nproduced from excess soybean oil. In South Dakota, soybean production \nhas increased by a dramatic 200 percent in the last 10 years. Recently, \nbiodiesel has emerged as a promising new energy source. RFS would \ngreatly increase the prospects for biodiesel production benefiting \nsoybean farmers from South Dakota and throughout the Nation.\n  I want to ensure the record reflects the influence and the \nextraordinary leadership that my colleague, Senator Daschle, has lent \nto the support of ethanol and a renewable fuels standard.\n  For over 20 years, Senator Daschle has been fighting for ethanol. \nWhen we began this debate, there were times in South Dakota that the \ndiscussion was about gasohol. There are times when Senator Daschle has \nbeen jokingly referred to in our State as ``Senator Gasohol.'' His \nleadership was instrumental in creating incentives which led to a surge \nin the demand for ethanol in the early to mid-1990s.\n  In the year 2000, it was Senator Daschle again who first introduced \nthe concept of a RFS as the next building block for expansion of the \nrenewable fuel industry. Today, I am pleased and I am proud to join \nSenator Daschle and many other Senators on a bipartisan basis to \ndemonstrate strong support for an RFS.\n  In the 20 years or more Congress and States have provided incentives \nto produce ethanol, we have learned a lot of lessons. Tax incentives at \nthe State and Federal level provided lifeblood for the ethanol industry \nand helped make the production of ethanol a competitive alternative to \nother fuels. The most aggressive growth spurt for ethanol occurred as a \nresult of the Clean Air Act.\n  Ethanol production doubled in the 1990s, with 10-percent annual \ngrowth. In 1990, the year we passed the Clean Air Act, the United \nStates produced about 800 million gallons of ethanol. By 2000, we \nproduced 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol. Coincidentally, the most \nrecent explosion in ethanol development took place as a result of the \nanticipation that Congress would establish an RFS. The renewable fuels \nstandard was first introduced in 2000 and production since that time \nhas dramatically expanded from 1.6 billion gallons to approximately 3 \nbillion gallons this year. Once again, ethanol production has doubled. \nAt this stage, enactment of an RFS is the single most important market \ndriver for ethanol that we can contemplate.\n  What lessons have we learned? If 8,000 farm families in South Dakota \ninvested their hard-earned money in the development of eight ethanol \nplants without an RFS, we could just imagine how many more producers \nSouth Dakota and across the entire Nation will be willing to invest in \nrenewable ethanol or biodiesel production if we adopt an RFS.\n  Ethanol plants are being constructed in record time with larger \ncapacity and more farmer investor financing than ever before. The most \nimpressive expansion in capacity has been right in my home State of \nSouth Dakota. Passage of an RFS will ensure greater capacity expansion, \na dramatic stimulus to the economic growth of rural America. It will \ncreate jobs and it will increase our energy security.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to adopt the bipartisan RFS \namendment being offered by Senator Daschle and Senator Frist today. I \nurge support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came to the floor earlier today to \nrespond to the distinguished majority leader. I just had the \nopportunity to hear the President's remarks with regard to judicial \nnominations. I felt it was important to come back to the floor for just \na couple of minutes to respond and to make sure the American people are \nclear and the record is clear with regard to judicial nominations and \nwhat I would view to be the rest of the story.\n  The rest of the story can be found on three charts. We have heard a \nlot this morning about the intransigence of the Senate, about how much \nthe Senate is in crisis because we haven't confirmed nominations; about \nhow the system is broken. In South Dakota, we like to say, If it ain't \nbroke, don't fix it.\n\n  I have three charts to prove that it ``ain't broke.'' One-hundred and \ntwenty-four is the first chart. One-hundred and twenty-four judicial \nnominees have been confirmed in this administration. That is a record. \nThere is no administration we can find that has had a better record \nthan this. One-hundred and twenty-four circuit and district court \nnominees have been confirmed since this President has taken office. \nHere is the number that have not: That is right--2; 124 to 2.\n  We have done a little math. Here is the third chart. That is a 98.4-\npercent approval rate. I don't know of a business, or a sports figure, \nor a politician who gets 98.4 percent of what they ask. But that is the \nrecord. That is exactly the success level of this administration when \nit comes to judicial nominees--98.4 percent.\n  ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\n  I find it particularly interesting that over the course of the 8 \nyears of the Clinton administration, we had 50 judicial nominations \nthat didn't get a hearing.\n  You talk about a filibuster. What about the fact that a person can't \neven get a hearing in the committee? Ten judicial nominees got a \nhearing but no vote. Sixty-five nominees never got to\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nthe Senate floor over the course of 8 years during the 1990s. I will \ntell you that there was no 98.4-percent approval rate then. But that is \nthe record.\n  To reiterate--just to be sure everybody understands, I will do this \none more time--one-hundred and twenty-four nominees were confirmed in \n2\\1/2\\ years, circuit and district court nominees approved in the \nSenate--a record. Two nominees have not: Mr. Estrada because he has \nrefused to fill out his job application, and Ms. Owen in large measure \nbecause she puts her own views ahead of the law. Those are the two.\n  One-hundred and twenty-four to two, that comes out to 98.4 percent of \nall Bush nominees confirmed to date.\n  I will end where I began. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it''.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are dealing with the energy bill on the \nfloor of the Senate, and specifically we are considering an amendment \nthat has been offered dealing with renewable fuels, or ethanol. I want \nto talk a bit about that subject, but I think it is important that \nperhaps I first comment on the discussion just preceding when Senator \nDaschle came to the floor to talk about judgeships.\n  Let me reiterate for a moment something that I think is very \nimportant for people to understand. I know the majority leader and the \nPresident today have talked about some collapse in the system and some \ngreat concern about the fact that judges aren't getting confirmed.\n  Let's understand something. We have the lowest number of vacancies on \nthe Federal bench we have in a decade and a half. Why is that the case? \nIt is because we have been approving nominations sent to this Senate by \nthe President day after day--124 of them. I voted for all but 3 of \nthem--124.\n  The reason the majority leader and others say the system has \ncollapsed is that there are two nominees who haven't gotten through the \nSenate. They are upset about that. Well, there is nothing in the U.S. \nConstitution that says there is a requirement for the Senate to be a \nrubberstamp for any President, Republican or Democrat. The fact is that \nmost of President Bush's nominees are going to be approved by the \nSenate--and have been, 98.4 percent. If the President sends us a \nnominee who aspires to be put on the Federal circuit court for an \nentire lifetime and that nominee says, You have no right to the \ninformation you requested from me, then I say you have no right to \nexpect that the Senate will approve you for a lifetime appointment on \nthe Federal bench.\n  Mr. Estrada has been told that he is to provide information to the \nSenate in order that we may evaluate it.\n  He has been unwilling to do that. So has the Bush administration. In \nfact, until Mr. Estrada provides that information to the Senate, he is \nnot going to get a final vote on his nomination. If he decides never to \nprovide that information to the Senate, in my judgment, he is not going \nto be a circuit court judge; the Senate is not going to approve his \nnomination.\n  Let's understand the facts. There is a lot of hyperbole used here in \npolitics. The facts are these: This Senate has done a masterful job, in \nmy judgment, of moving through the nominations sent to us by President \nBush. Day after day and time after time, we have done that. In my \nState, we had two judgeships open. Both Federal judgeships were filled \nby Republicans nominated by President Bush--one in Fargo and one in \nBismarck. I am a Democrat, but I was proud to support both of the \nnominees. I came to the floor and spoke in support of both Republican \nnominees, who I think will make outstanding Federal judges. They are \nnow both on the bench.\n\n  That is the way the system should work, and it is the way it has \nworked in almost every circumstance--except for two. Because of those \ntwo, we have the majority leader and the President of the United States \nsay the sky is falling. Nonsense, what sheer, utter nonsense. The sky \nis not falling.\n  What has happened is, we have a couple of nominees with whom this \nSenate has decided it does not want to proceed--until we get certain \ninformation from Mr. Estrada; and the other nomination, Judge Owen, was \nturned down last year by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I wish to make this point: I know these days, with the 24/7 news \ncycle, there are some who believe if you say something and it gets \nrepeated often enough--over and over and over again--that it will \nbecome fact. Well, it is not a fact for the President, and it is not a \nfact for the majority leader, to be able to say to the American people \nthat we are somehow obstructing the nominations of Federal judges. That \nis simply not the case. It is demonstrably not the case, and there \nisn't any way they can make that case because the record is clear and \nthe facts are in: 124 Federal judges have been confirmed, 125 if you \nconsider the other judge which is a special judgeship for a 15-year \nappointment, but out of those 124, 125, all but 2 have moved here in \nthe Senate.\n  I do not know of another time when the minority has been as \ncooperative and done as much to make sure we have filled these \njudgeships. In fact, when President Bush took office, and going back a \nyear and a half ago, when my colleague, Senator Leahy, inherited the \nchairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, we had a substantial number of \nopenings on the Federal bench that had not been resolved and that had \nnot been filled, and we have now moved very quickly, with the \nPresident, to resolve that, and we have the lowest number of vacancies \non the Federal bench for the past decade and a half.\n  Let me be clear that there is not a circumstance here where there has \nbeen obstruction in the Senate. We have approved most of this \nPresident's nominees, and likely will continue to do so; and I will \nlikely continue to vote for nearly all of them. But there will be \ncircumstances in which a specific nominee will not get through this \nSenate for a number of reasons, and when that is the case, it is not \nappropriate and not factual for someone to get on a microphone and tell \nus: The sky is falling. That is total, sheer nonsense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5987-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5987-S5991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, now that I have that off my chest, \nlet me go on to talk about energy.\n  I am proud to be on the floor of the Senate in support of the ethanol \namendment, which is bipartisan. It is interesting to me that this \nlegislation dealing with ethanol is an amendment that comes to the \nfloor by virtue of Senator Frist, Senator Daschle, myself, Senator \nTalent, Senator Johnson, and so many others, with strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is saying: At least one part of this country's energy \nstrategy that makes sense is to take the starch and sugars from a \nkernel of corn, ferment that, and get a drop of alcohol and extend \nAmerica's energy supply. You do a couple things with that: You expand \nthe opportunity for markets for agricultural products and help family \nfarmers, and you actually grow your energy supply in America's farm \nfields by producing corn that can be then used to produce ethanol. What \na remarkable thing to do. It makes good sense to extend our energy \nsupply by producing ethanol.\n  Now, let me talk a bit about what sets us up to do this. First, we \nhave to have a serious discussion about America's energy future. I have \nspoken of this before, but I wish to do it very briefly again.\n  We need to use fossil fuels in this country's future. There is no \nquestion about that: coal, oil, natural gas. We use them, and we will \nuse them. But if our energy strategy is only that--if America's future \nenergy strategy is only a dig and drill strategy--then it is a \n``yesterday forever'' strategy. Every 25 years we can come to the floor \nof the Senate, we can have another debate about how much we are going \nto dig, how much we are going to drill, and probably satisfy our urge \nto speak. But we will not have satisfied this country's need for a \ndifferent kind of energy strategy.\n  So an energy bill that makes sense for this country's future is one \nthat\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\ndoes dig and drill, with environmental safeguards, but it must do more \nthan that. It should, first, include incentivized production, but, \nsecond, it should provide conservation measures, because a barrel of \noil saved is a barrel of oil produced in our economy. Then, in addition \nto production and conservation, an energy bill that makes sense is an \nenergy bill that has a title that deals with the efficiency of all of \nthe appliances that we use in our daily lives. And, fourth, it should \ninclude a provision that deals with limitless and renewable sources of \nenergy. That is what this amendment is about.\n  So production, conservation, efficiency, and limitless and renewable \nsources of energy--that is what an energy bill is about, if it is \nbalanced. Add in the limitless and renewable sources of energy, for my \nmoney, it means we should pole vault over all of these 25-year debates \nand say, we want to move to a new energy future.\n  One hundred years ago, when you wanted to gas up an old Ford, a Model \nT Ford, you pulled up to the gas pumps, you stuck that hose in the gas \ntank and began pumping. One hundred years later, we do exactly the same \nthing. If you happened to have driven a Ford this morning, and stopped \nat a gas pump, you did exactly the same thing they did a century ago: \nYou run gas through the car's carburetor. And God bless us, we have \ngreat cars, and we have fuel at every gas pump, and no waiting lines. \nThat is the way we fuel our automobile, our transportation fleet.\n  Let me describe what is happening with respect to energy in this \ncountry. If you look at the total demand for oil, and then look at \ntransportation, you will see that the fastest rising demand for energy \nin this country, for oil particularly, is in transportation; it is in \nour vehicle fleet. That is where our demand for energy is rising.\n\n  What I believe we should do is heed the words of President Bush, who \nsaid: Let's move to a hydrogen fuel cell future. When President Bush \ncalled for that in the State of the Union Address, I said: This makes \ngreat sense. I had previously introduced a piece of legislation \nsuggesting the same. I suppose that is why I thought it made great \nsense.\n  But the fact is, for this President to put his administration on the \nline in support of a hydrogen future with fuel cells is a very \nimportant step. To be sure, his plan is not very bold. I suggest that \nhis plan is rather timid: in fact, it is $1.2 billion, half of which is \nnew money, and part of which comes out of other important energy \ninitiatives, particularly in renewables. But I don't want that to \ndiminish the fact it is very important that this President--a \nRepublican President, who comes from an oil State--says: Let's move to \na different kind of energy future, especially with respect to \ntransportation and the vehicle fleet.\n  Let's see if your children, and our grandchildren, might not be able \nto turn the key on an automobile that uses hydrogen in fuel cells. \nHydrogen is ubiquitous. It is everywhere. Hydrogen is in water. You can \nput up a windmill, with more efficient turbines, and take energy from \nthe wind, produce electricity, and use that electricity--through the \nprocess of electrolysis--to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water, \nand then store the hydrogen, and use that to power our vehicle fleet. \nThat is one application: using wind energy to produce electricity to \nproduce hydrogen. But there are so many ways to produce hydrogen, and \nit is everywhere.\n  So what we have to do is begin to solve this problem of moving to a \nhydrogen future--the problem of production, the problem of \ntransportation, storage, and infrastructure. But the fact is, although \nthese are problems, they are not insurmountable.\n  I drove a hydrogen car yesterday that was here on Capitol Hill. It is \nthe second one I have driven. This was a General Motors car. One was \nUnited Technologies. Hydrogen vehicles are twice as efficient in \ngetting power to the wheel as the internal combustion engine. Do you \nknow what they put out of the tailpipe? Water vapor. What a wonderful \nthing: You find an engine that is twice as efficient, using a fuel \ncell, and you clean up the environment by putting water vapor out of \nthe tailpipe of a vehicle. What a wonderful thing to do.\n  Now, I can't tell you how important it is to have the President's \nsupport on this. I nearly tripled what the President wanted by pushing, \nalong with Senator Domenici, and others in the Energy Committee, to \nsay: Let's substantially increase the amount of resources we are going \nto put towards moving in this direction of a hydrogen future. This \nrequires bold, big initiatives. So the bill on the floor is slightly \nover $3 billion. I would like it to be $6.5 billion. I would like \ntargets and timetables. I would like to see 100,000 vehicles using fuel \ncells on America's roads by 2010.\n  I would like to see 2.5 million vehicles on America's roads by 2020. \nTargets and timetables is the way we drive this issue. With research \nand development in a whole range of areas, and development of \ninfrastructure, we can do this. We won't do it if we just revert back \nto what we have always done.\n  When I was a little boy growing up in a town of 350-400 people, they \ndecided to try to dig an oil well 5 miles from my little town. It was \nthe biggest thing in the world. We were so excited when somebody said \nthey would try to dig an oil well on Bon Woodruff's farm. We thought it \nwas the biggest thing. I remember driving out there. We used to drive \nout there all the time, the whole town. We would all drive out to see \nwhere the oil well was. We would watch the rig being put up. When it \ngot up, it had lights all over it. They were drilling day and night. \nPeople were driving out and parking, watching. There was nothing going \non, just lights and a rig. In my town that was a big deal. It was a dry \nhole. They never got oil. But it was a pretty interesting several \nmonths.\n  As a little boy, I thought about the drilling for oil, where we find \noil abroad, and how we use oil to power our vehicle fleet. Fifty-five \npercent of that which we use comes from outside of our country. That \ndoesn't make sense. Much of it comes from troubled parts of the world, \na third from the Middle East. We could wake up some day and discover \nthe supply of oil is cut off because of terrorists. Then America's \neconomy would be flat on its back. The 55 percent foreign oil we are \nnow dependent on is going to rise to 68 percent if we don't do \nsomething.\n  What is the greatest demand? Transportation. We have to do something \nbig and bold. We have to have an energy policy that says to the people: \nWe will get out of this. We may never be completely independent, but we \nwill sure be a whole lot less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  That brings me to the amendment. The amendment dealing with ethanol. \nI am a big fan of growing part of our fuel in the farm fields. You grow \nthat corn, take that ear of corn, take the kernels off, and with those \nkernels of corn you produce alcohol. It is important to farmers. It is \na new market for their crop. It is important to our country's energy \nneeds because it extends America's energy supply.\n  MTBE, a fuel additive, will be phased out in this legislation. We are \ndiscovering when MTBE shows up in America's groundwater, it is harmful \nto health. We will get rid of it. When we do, it will dramatically \nincrease the demand for ethanol across America. That demand will \nincrease to nearly 5 billion gallons. That means we will see more and \nmore plants built around the country that will use the agriculture \nfeedstock, take the alcohol from it. You still have the protein \nfeedstock left to feed to the cattle, and you have grown some energy in \nAmerica's fields. It is, therefore, renewable. We are not using it up. \nIt is renewable year after year.\n  I am pleased that now for the first time we see a robust bipartisan \ngroup. It is not that it has not always been bipartisan; it has always \nbeen a bipartisan debate. But when you have the majority leader and \nminority leader leading an amendment, that is a big deal. Those of us \nwho care about ethanol understand this is a moment in time in which we \nregister strong support for moving in a different direction, for being \nbold. I talked about hydrogen and fuel cells. That is one part of being \nbold. The other part of renewable and limitless sources of energy is \nethanol. There is more, including biodiesel, among others. So there is \nmuch to do.\n\n  The legislation we have brought to the floor from the Energy \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nis imperfect. But it has some good features. We will add some \nadditional features. Senator Domenici should be commended. He is a \npleasure to work with. Senator Bingaman on our side of the aisle, \nranking Democrat, is the same, a terrific Senator who has done a great \njob. The energy bill needs some strengthening. We need a Renewable \nPortfolio Standard to improve the future for renewable energy for \nelectricity. We need a Renewable Fuels Standard, which includes the \nethanol amendment.\n  We need protections on the electricity title that do not now exist. I \nchaired hearings in the last year and a half with respect to what Enron \nCorporation did in the State of California and on the West Coast. When \nI said during that time that it looked to me like it was massive \nmanipulation of electricity markets, and grand theft going on to the \ntune of billions of dollars for consumers in California and the West \nCoast, that was pooh-poohed by everybody. All the conservative \ncolumnists and others, Mr. Krauthammer and others, would write: Who are \nyou kidding? There is no manipulation. Every time something likes this \ngoes on, the Democrats claim there is manipulation.\n  We now know there was grand theft going on. Massive criminal \ninvestigations are occurring. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nwhich for a long while did its best imitation of a potted plant and \ndecided it would not do anything while the people were victimized, has \nnow said it was not just Enron, but there were a number of companies on \nthe West Coast that decided to take the opportunity to shut down the \nelectricity plants, short the load, drive up prices, and profiteer as a \nresult of it.\n  Strategies like Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy. You don't know what \nFat Boy is? Fat Boy was a strategy by which energy traders working for \nthe Enron Corporation colluded to try to see if they could steal from \nconsumers. Death Star, same thing; Get Shorty, there were a dozen of \nthem and more. Even more than the strategies, which were written in \nmemos that we now have, we also have the transcripts of telephone \nconversations in which they talk about how they will shut down the \nplant in order to short the load and drive up price. They moved \nelectricity in and out of a couple of States in order to increase the \nprice, in some cases tenfold in 24 hours. What is that called, except \nstealing?\n  There are going to be people who go to jail for it. The electricity \ntitle in this bill must address these issues, wash trades, and others. \nIt addresses a couple of them, but not nearly enough. We need to put \nconsumer protections in here so what happened to the people in \nCalifornia does not ever happen again. We have a lot of people running \naround the country saying: We need to restructure the electricity \ntitle. We need to restructure electricity issues so there is massive \ncompetition.\n  We have a bit of experience with that which tells us that when you \nhave very big players who have the ability to control and monopolize \nmarkets, and you also have a consumer, if you don't have a referee in \nbetween making sure the big interests are not cheating, the little \ninterests get trampled. That is what happened on the West Coast. It is \nnot just petty theft. It is billions of dollars.\n  My colleague who will speak following me, Senator Nelson of Florida, \nwas a member of the subcommittee where we investigated these issues. \nFrankly, it made you sick to see what was going on.\n  Finally FERC stepped in and imposed a price cap. Finally an \ninvestigation was undertaken. The Justice Department is involved. The \nfact is, we should not and will not pass an energy bill through the \nCongress without an electricity title that provides protections to make \nsure this never happens again.\n  There will be other amendments. I am proud today to support this \namendment, a bipartisan strong amendment on ethanol. We will also need \nto include a Renewable Portfolio Standard in the bill. We need to put \nin provisions that deal with consumer protections with respect to \nelectricity. There is much yet to do. It is a pretty good start. This \nbill will advance America's energy interests, if we can add the \namendments and add some protections.\n  Following the war in Iraq, what we know exists in the Middle East, as \nwell as all of the uncertainties around the world, if anybody still \nwonders whether we need an energy policy, they have been asleep. This \ncountry needs to make sure its economy, its way of life, the future for \nthe American people is not held hostage by the whims, confrontations, \ntragedies and conflicts in other parts of the world. That is what a \ngood energy strategy, a balanced energy strategy, will do for our \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from North Dakota and I are joined \nat the hip on so many of these issues he has just raised regarding \nenergy. This Senator was particularly intrigued by the compelling \nargument the Senator from North Dakota made about a hydrogen engine \nbeing developed.\n  Does the Senator know, will there be an attempt to increase the \namount of funding for research and development for a new hydrogen \nengine that will be in this particular bill?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Florida should know that I offered an \namendment in the Energy Committee that failed, I believe, by one or two \nvotes. I intend to offer it again on the floor. It is similar to \nlegislation introduced in the Senate that creates an Apollo-like \nprogram on hydrogen and fuel cells. My belief is we ought to do for \nthis as we did with respect to going to the moon. President Kennedy \nsaid let's put a person on the moon by the end of the decade. Sure \nenough, Neil Armstrong stepped off that ladder running and planted his \nfoot on the surface of the moon by the end of the decade.\n  It seems to me if this country really wants to effect substantial \nchange, then you have to set goals and timetables. My proposal, which I \nintroduced with a number of colleagues in the Senate--actually prior to \nthe State of the Union Address in which the President announced his \nsupport for this initiative--is a $6.5 billion authorization over 10 \nyears that sets targets and timetables and puts this country squarely \nbehind an aggressive Apollo-type program, saying let's get there and, \nas a nation, let's aspire to reach a goal. Yes, I intend to offer it as \nan amendment to the energy bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This Senator will be one of the Senator's \ncosponsors on the amendment. It is interesting that you have described \nit in terms of an Apollo-type program, which is exactly what this \nNation needs. If we put our minds to something, as we did in the \n1960s--announced by the President that we were going to the Moon by the \nend of the decade, and then return safely, and the Nation marshals its \nwill and resources to do a technological feed as we did in going to the \nMoon, if we apply that same kind of will to addressing the energy \ncrisis by the development of a hydrogen cell, a hydrogen engine that \ncan propel most of our vehicles in this transportation sector--and the \nSenator's chart shows that transportation is the largest consumer of \nenergy in the United States--if we did that, then clearly, as the \nSenator from North Dakota says--and I second it--we are going to wean \nourselves from the foreign oil that we find ourselves so dependent upon \ntoday.\n  I will just offer as support for the Senator's statements that \nonboard the space shuttle we produced electricity from a hydrogen fuel \ncell. It is the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen that then produces \nelectricity. What does it have as a byproduct? Water. As a matter of \nfact, onboard a mission of the space shuttle, so much excess water is \nproduced that it needs to be released into space; a water dump is done, \nusually after each flight day.\n  It is there, it is technology we understand, and we are using it \ntoday in space aboard spacecraft. There is no reason we cannot bring \ndown the per unit cost of a hydrogen engine if we put our minds and our \ntechnology and resources into it. What it would do for us is lessen our \ndependence upon foreign oil, which would lessen some of the kinds of \nthings that we have to do in that region of the world that gets us \ninextricably involved in our military and foreign affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator wants to take the floor \nin\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nhis own right. I think it is important for people to know he is the \nonly Member of the Senate who has actually flown on the space shuttle. \nMany people know that. Many years ago, he was part of the crew of a \nspace shuttle. He knows of what he speaks.\n  I was originally going to call the bill I introduced--trying to move \nus in a bold, aggressive way toward a hydrogen future and fuel cell--\nthe Manhattan Project, which was another successful project that dealt \nwith something different. The Manhattan and Apollo Projects were both \nprojects that had this country saying let's do this with targets and \ntimetables. I think that is what we should do with respect to the \nPresident's call for a hydrogen economy and fuel cell, especially \nhaving this President's administration behind this initiative.\n  It is no small thing to have a President from an oil State say to the \ncountry: Let's see if we can move toward a future with hydrogen and \nfuel cells.\n  Good for him. That support is going to be very important. I will \nindeed offer my amendment to the energy bill at some point in the \ncoming days, and I am happy to have the support of the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this week we began debate on the energy \nbill, a vast and complex piece of legislation, arguably an important \npiece of legislation, that deals with an issue that touches every \nAmerican in some way, shape, or form. Access to stable, reliable \nsources of energy is central to the strength of our economy.\n  I have real concern, as we take up this bill, that it not simply be a \npiece of legislation where we look to include every element, every \nfragment, every idea ever considered that might, in fact, alter energy \nmarkets around the country or around the world. I am concerned that in \nour effort to craft an energy policy, we simply look for ways to aid or \nto assist particular businesses, industries, or areas of research.\n  This bill currently includes very substantial loan guarantees to \nsuccessful private corporations around the country; it includes \nresearch subsidies for investment in fossil fuel research, oil and gas \ndevelopment; and it includes a very complex and sizable tax package, \nsome of which I think is questionable as to whether it will achieve the \nkind of fairness, equity, and efficiency in the energy markets we would \nlike to see.\n  This morning, however, I wish to speak about one particular provision \nthat is before us in the form of an amendment, an amendment that has \nbeen offered to dramatically increase the size and the scope of the \nFederal ethanol program. It not only expands the size of the ethanol \nprogram in America, but it effectively makes it mandatory, taking us \nfrom a 2-billion-gallon-a-year ethanol program to some 5 billion \ngallons a year over the next 8 years.\n  I can understand there are a lot of supporters of the ethanol program \nin this Chamber. A lot of the Members of the Senate have farm economies \nback home and see income or productivity that comes from this Federal \nprogram. But I do not think it is right to provide a subsidy at the \ntaxpayers' expense for a program that cannot stand on its own feet.\n  Among the concerns I have with the current program, first and \nforemost is the supposed environmental benefits of ethanol. It is true, \nas an oxygenate, ethanol reduces the volatile compounds that are \nemitted into the atmosphere from fuel, from gasoline, but it does not \ndo anything substantively to reduce the level of NOx in the atmosphere \nthat contributes to the ozone problem, to the smog problems. I think as \nthis debate goes forward, we will hear a lot of discussions from some \nof those Senators who represent urban parts of the country that have \ntough, real problems with ozone and smog. They have grave concerns \nabout this program that provides a huge taxpayer subsidy without \ndealing with those important environmental issues.\n  From an energy perspective, we will hear a lot of discussion about \nthe amount of energy that will be produced from this renewable resource \nbecause it is corn based, but from most proponents we will not hear a \nlot of discussion about the energy it takes to produce this ethanol in \nthe first place. It takes nearly a gallon of fuel to produce a gallon \nof fuel. So at the end of the day, you may have ethanol that you can \nblend in gasoline and put in your car, but you have used quite a bit of \nenergy to get there in the process.\n  From an energy perspective, energy efficiency, energy independence, \neven then, in the best case, the benefits are marginal, if they exist \nat all.\n  Finally, of real concern is the subsidy itself. There is an enormous \ntaxpayer subsidy that is used to provide viability to this industry. As \neveryone goes to the pump, they pay 18.3 cents in tax for every gallon \nof gas they put in their car. If that gallon is blended with 10-percent \nethanol, it is exempt from 5.3 cents of that gas tax. That represents a \n53-cent-a-gallon subsidy for the ethanol itself--53 cents. At the end \nof the day, that means a billion dollars less going into our highway \ntrust fund.\n  We are going to deal with the highway reauthorization bill later this \nyear, and there are a lot of supporters of highways who are pushing for \nmore money. I think we need to take a long, hard look at what the right \namount to spend on infrastructure is in this country. But we certainly \ndo not need to be subsidizing a questionable effort such as this \nethanol program in a way that takes money out of our highway trust \nfund, a billion dollars a year today, and with this expansion that will \ngo to $2 billion a year by 2012. That means $2 billion a year lost from \nthe highway trust fund.\n  Now, for years the argument that was made by House Members, Senators \nor legislators all across the country to support this subsidy, was that \nwe need the subsidy in order to encourage people to use the ethanol \nfuel. That is why we have the subsidy. We need it if we are going to \nget people to use this fuel.\n  That subsidy has not been very successful in getting people to use \nthat much of the fuel. So now they are going to go to a mandate.\n  Well, I can understand why one would want to force a mandate on the \nAmerican people if they are determined to force them to purchase the \nfuel. But if it is going to be mandated, why is the subsidy still \nneeded?\n  That is one of the central issues we are going to have to deal with \nin this debate, and we need to at least put people on the record as to \nwhy they think we still need to subsidize this industry, in many ways a \nvery concentrated industry.\n  There are about half a dozen very large, successful businesses, that \nare responsible for about 70 percent of the ethanol produced in this \ncountry. Why do we ask taxpayers to continue to subsidize this industry \nwhen we have a mandate in place that forces them to buy the product? \nThat makes no sense. I do not think it is fair in the first place to \nforce them to buy the product, but I certainly do not think it is fair \nto force them to subsidize the product at the same time. It has got to \nbe one or the other. If a subsidy is to be provided because it is the \nonly way to get people to purchase the product, at least that is a \nrational argument--not one I support but it is a rational argument. If \nthe only way to get them to buy the product is to mandate it, to force \nthem to buy it, that is also a rational argument, although not one that \nI support. But it cannot be both ways. A subsidy cannot be forced on \nthe American people, the money cannot be diverted from the trust fund \nand have the mandate at the same time.\n  If the mandate is going to be that 5 billion gallons of this fuel has \nto be purchased every year, the least we can do is then treat it the \nsame way we treat any other fuel in this country with an appropriate, \nfair, and well-thought-out excise tax. The American people deserve \nconsistency and fairness in this matter.\n  I think it is a shame that we have a program such as this ethanol \nprogram that really has not proven its worth, that unfortunately \nchannels huge taxpayer subsidy to a small number of very successful, \nprofitable companies around the country. I would rather see a bill that \ndid not have this taxpayer subsidy in it in the first place, but if we \nare going to take up this issue, let us at least be fair and equitable \nin the way we deal with it.\n  We need a good, thoughtful energy policy in the United States. This \nkind of subsidy ought not to be part of that program and that policy.\n  I have a number of other concerns with the legislation before us, but \nI\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nhope when the time comes we can work to craft an amendment that would \nright this wrong, that would ensure that ethanol is treated the same as \nany other fuel that we have in the country, and that would improve the \nquality of this legislation before it passes the Senate, if it is able \nto do so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole).

Mr. President, the other morning, as I read the clips \nfrom the Anchorage Daily News, I was taken by a report of an event that \ntook place when President Bush landed on the aircraft carrier off of \nSan Diego.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Anchorage Daily News article be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. This article referred to Petty Officer 3rd Class Francis \nCushingham IV, who met and shook hands with the President three times \nwhile he was on the aircraft carrier. It describes how this 21-year-old \nAlaskan from Eagle River and his 5,000 shipmates played host to \nPresident Bush and what they did.\n  President Bush was on board all day getting to shake hands with \nalmost every member of the crew. As the article says:\n\n       Trust an Alaskan to make the most of opportunity. Despite \n     an uncertain start, Cushingham managed to shake Bush's hand \n     three separate times, get his picture taken with the \n     President, and appear in a background shot on the Today show.\n\n  The article goes on to say that Cushingham considers it to be proof \nof his few moments of glory and has a quote from him:\n\n       It's something I'm going to keep to show to my children and \n     my grandchildren. I can say, ``Hey, I met the President.''\n\n  There are people who criticized the President for having landed on \nthat aircraft carrier. As a pilot, I envy the opportunity he had to \nland on that aircraft carrier and I certainly do not criticize the \nPresident for his visit.\n  Our battle carrier groups are tremendous examples of the ability of \nthe United States to project force to all corners of the globe. What \nbetter way to show the world that force than to have the President of \nthe United States land on this aircraft carrier as it returned to its \nhome base?\n  In fact, before the President landed on that carrier, the basic air \ncombat groups on board the carrier had left. They fly ahead of the \nvessel as it goes into home port so they can go have their reunions \nwith their families at the air bases, which reflect their duties. The \nsailors' families meet them as they come in to port. In this instance, \nit was San Diego. I have witnessed some of those real amazing events \nwhen a major ship comes back into port.\n  This visit of the Commander-in-Chief was accomplished within normal \nallocation of training flight hours to the pilots who flew him there. \nHe was a passenger. He, as well as I, would like to experience landing \na plane on an aircraft carrier but we know we cannot do that.\n  Very clearly, the President was carrying out the tradition of every \nPresident since John Tyler in 1844. President Eisenhower visited \naircraft carriers after World War II. In 1980, Jimmy Carter visited the \nNimitz, and in 1994, President Bill Clinton, on the George Washington, \nwent from England to France for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of \nNormandy. I do not remember any criticism of that. In fact, to the \ncontrary. I think Americans are proud of the fact their President goes \nout to greet the troops as they are coming back and spends time with \nthem.\n\n  As this article points out, this Alaskan greeted the President as he \ncame out of the gym. He had gone to work out with some of the guys and \ngals on board. I cannot think of a better way for a Commander-in-Chief \nto demonstrate the great confidence we have in the young men and women \nwho performed their duty in Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent that another article which I have be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is an article from the Copley News Service entitled \n``Bush Continues Seagoing Tradition.'' It points out the number of \ntimes that Presidents have gone on board aircraft carriers.\n  Long before I came to the Senate, I remember when Adlai Stevenson \ncame to Alaska. He was just a Presidential candidate. We traveled miles \nand miles to see him, although I was a Republican candidate for office \nat the time. I think every American wants to see the President and is \ntotally honored to ever be in the presence of the President. That \nperson represents the honor of our country, and I cannot think of a \nbetter way for a President to do it than to go out and land on an \naircraft carrier and honor those who have served our country so well in \nIraq.\n  I do congratulate the President and I hope he keeps it up. I hope he \nvisits every naval vessel he can visit and every military base he can \nvisit.\n  This generation has done a tremendous job for us in Afghanistan and \nIraq. My generation was referred to as ``the greatest generation.'' I \nthink these young people far surpass what we did in terms of their \nability to follow orders, to achieve the goals that are set for them, \nand to do it in a very humane and humanitarian way.\n  Again, I think the President did the right thing by thanking the \nsoldiers and sailors and marines on that aircraft carrier in person. I \nagain repeat, I hope he will do it again.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           After Shaky Start, Alaskan Greets Bush Three Times\n\n                           (By Sheila Toomey)\n\n       Petty Officer 3rd Class Francis Cushingham IV was so \n     nervous about meeting the president that he almost blew his \n     first opportunity.\n       ``I'm all freaking out. I was basically scared to meet him. \n     I mean, he's like basically the most powerful person on the \n     planet,'' Cushingham said by phone Friday from San Diego, \n     where the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is docked.\n       The 21-year-old from Eagle River and his 5,000 shipmates \n     played host Thursday to President Bush, who declared victory \n     in Iraq in a speech broadcast from the carrier as it \n     approached the California coast. The ship, which lift the \n     United States in July, was returning from duty in the Persian \n     Gulf.\n       Bush was on board all day, and getting to shake his hand \n     became a ship-wide obsession.\n       Trust an Alaskan to make the most of opportunity. Despite \n     an uncertain start, Cushingham managed to shake Bush's hand \n     three separate times, get his picture taken with the \n     president and appear in a background shot on the ``Today'' \n     show.\n       ``I'm basking in it,'' Cushingham said. ``Everybody was \n     honored and excited. There's a lot of people who didn't get \n     the chance to shake his hand, and they're all bummed out.''\n       The first occasion was outside Cushingham's work station, a \n     room of computers used in navigating the massive ship that's \n     located along a corridor leading to the captain's cabin. When \n     a bunch of Secret Service agents appeared, signaling the \n     president's approach, Cushingham said he got nervous and \n     turned to leave. A colleague stopped him, and the first shake \n     took place.\n       ``I said, `How are you, sir? It's a pleasure to meet you, \n     sir.' He said, `Thank you for your service to your country.' \n     I swore my face was the brightest hue of red you could \n     possibly muster, but my friend said I didn't look nervous.''\n       An hour later, Bush was returning from the ship gym, \n     wearing workout clothes, needing a shower, friendly and \n     shorter than he looks on television, the 6-foot-3-inch \n     Alaskan said.\n       ``He stood in the doorway, saw all of us with our cameras, \n     and pretty much offered a photo op right there. . . . He \n     said, `Who has a camera? Who am I standing with first?' ''\n       ``I shook his hand about 4:20 in the afternoon,'' \n     Cushingham said. ``Pacific time.''\n       The third shake was up on deck, after Bush's speech. Now a \n     pro, no longer nervous, Cushingham maneuvered to be among the \n     group Bush was scheduled to shake hands with in the afterglow \n     of the international media event.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n       Pressing presidential flesh was good, Cushingham said, but \n     the photo is best. It's proof of his few moments of glory.\n       ``It's something I'm going to keep to show to my children \n     and my grandchildren. I can say, `Hey, I met the president.' \n     ''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                   Bush Continues Seagoing Tradition\n\n                           (By Otto Kreisher)\n\n       Washington.--President Bush's stay aboard the Abraham \n     Lincoln off San Diego today will continue an unbroken record \n     of presidential visits to U.S. Navy aircraft carriers that \n     goes back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957.\n       Nearly half of those carrier visits have occurred in the \n     same Southern California waters that Bush will sail through \n     during his overnight cruise aboard the Lincoln as it nears \n     the end of a war-extended deployment to the Persian Gulf.\n       The Lincoln will be the first U.S. warship Bush has gone \n     aboard as president, an apt recognition of the major role \n     that carriers have played in the conflicts that he ordered in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       Because the Lincoln will be too far off San Diego for a \n     helicopter, Bush will fly to the carrier in a tactical \n     aircraft, a historic first for a president.\n       After arriving at North Island Naval Air Station aboard Air \n     Force One this morning, Bush will board a twin-jet S-3B \n     Viking from Sea Control Squadron 35. The plane will make a \n     cable-assisted landing on the Lincoln.\n       Though he served in the Texas Air National Guard, Bush will \n     be merely a passenger strapped in next to the pilot, \n     according to White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``For the \n     sake of the landing,'' Fleischer said. ``I'm sure he will be \n     doing no piloting.''\n       Closer to land tomorrow, Bush will return by helicopter and \n     leave North Island before the Everett, Wash.,-based carrier \n     arrives in San Diego Bay.\n       The Navy will not discuss where Bush will stay during his \n     night on the nuclear-powered carrier, citing security \n     concerns. But the president could use either the spacious \n     suite provided for the carrier battle group commander, Rear \n     Adm. John M. Kelly, or the large cabin available to the \n     Lincoln's commanding officer, Capt. Kendall Card.\n       Both provide a comfortable bedroom with adjoining \n     ``head''--Navy for bathroom--and large conference or dining \n     room located several levels above the flight deck.\n       Presidential staff likely will be put into some of the \n     officer staterooms vacated by about half of the air wing's \n     squadrons, which will have flown off to their home stations \n     before Bush arrives.\n       Eisenhower started the trend of commanders-in-chief touring \n     carriers with his overnight stay on the Saratoga in June \n     1957. But every U.S. president has spent time on a Navy \n     vessel since John Tyler in 1844, although for several the \n     only nautical exposure was on the presidential yachts.\n       Other presidents have spent a lot of time on warships, with \n     the two Roosevelts--both one-time assistant Navy \n     secretaries--leading the pack in visits.\n       Theodore Roosevelt, who had served as acting Navy \n     secretary, visited at least six warships as president, \n     including a primitive submarine in 1905.\n       Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been assistant Navy \n     secretary, spent months aboard 12 different warships, \n     including many wartime voyages for overseas conferences with \n     allied leaders.\n       Although neither Roosevelt ever visited a carrier, both \n     have had flattops named for them.\n       George H.W. Bush followed FDR's example of using warships \n     for security overseas. He stayed aboard the cruiser Belknap \n     during a 1989 summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev \n     in Malta and on the amphibious assault ship Tripoli during a \n     New Year's 1992 visit to troops in Somalia.\n       The elder Bush, a World War II Navy carrier pilot, also \n     visited the carrier Forrestal during his Malta stay.\n       John F. Kennedy, a PT boat captain in World War II, became \n     the first president to visit a carrier off San Diego when he \n     toured the Oriskany on June 6, 1963. He then spent that night \n     aboard the Kitty Hawk, watching flight operations.\n       Lyndon B. Johnson spent a night aboard the nuclear-powered \n     Enterprise off San Diego on Nov. 10-11, 1967.\n       Richard Nixon used two carriers to broadcast Armed Forces \n     Day message to the troops: The Hornet on May 17, 1969, off \n     the Virginia coast and the Independence on May 19, 1973, \n     docked at Norfolk.\n       Jimmy Carter's visits aboard the carrier named for \n     Eisenhower in 1978 and the Nimitz in 1980 occurred in the \n     Atlantic. The former nuclear-qualified submariner toured the \n     Eisenhower's nuclear reactor spaces--probably the only \n     president ever to visit that highly restricted area.\n       Ronald Reagan spend part of Aug. 20, 1981, on the San \n     Diego-based Constellation, off the California coast.\n       Bill Clinton visited three carriers and spent a night \n     aboard the George Washington on June 5-6, 1994, sailing from \n     England to Normandy for the 50th anniversary of the D-day \n     invasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5992-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5992-S5993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SMITHSONIAN BROUHAHA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, turning to another subject, I have been \nconcerned about the newspaper reports and stories about the \nSmithsonian's exhibit that was moved within the museum by its managers. \nMany of those newspaper stories and other news stories have indicated \nthat I pressured the Smithsonian Museum to move that exhibit. That is \nabsolutely not true. No member of my office nor I contacted the \nSmithsonian. I checked with the other two members of the Alaska \ndelegation. None has commented on that exhibit or interfered in any \nway.\n  When I looked into it, I concluded the Smithsonian was right. It was \nnot just an exhibit of beautiful pictures of Alaska--and I love \nbeautiful pictures of my State. It was an attempt to use the \nSmithsonian as a place to carry forward the position of the Wilderness \nSociety on the question of whether or not oil and gas development \nshould take place on the Arctic coast.\n  That is a public issue. Suppose I had taken all the photos and all \nthe exhibits I have displayed on the floor and took them to the \nSmithsonian and said I wanted them positioned so the people coming in \ncan understand why we should go forward in drilling ANWR. I believe the \nSenate would come apart at the seams.\n  This action that has been taken is contrary to the basic concept of \nthe Smithsonian. It should not be a place for advocacy on a public \nissue. Clearly, that is what happened. It was an exhibit based on a \nbook with contributors William Meadows of the Wilderness Society; \nDebbie Miller, of the Alaska Wilderness Society; Fran Mauer, former \nrefuge manager; and former President Jimmy Carter, of the Alaska \nWilderness League.\n  Let me describe the cover of the book. The book talks about seasons \nof life and land and a photographic journey through Alaska. That is \nwonderful. They are great photographs. What is the purpose of the book? \nThe purpose of the book is to make people think the land depicted in \nthis book is endangered. There is a picture of a red sign with caribou, \nlabeled ``endangered.'' ``Why is this land connected to us all?''\n  Of the 19 million acres of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, all but 1.5 \nmillion is protected. The Arctic Wildlife Refuge is already protected. \nIt is not endangered. The other 1.5 million acres is an area set aside \nby an amendment offered by Senator Tsongas of Massachusetts, a \nDemocrat, and Senator Jackson of Washington, a Democrat. It was passed \nby the Senate, passed by the House, and the bill was signed by \nPresident Jimmy Carter in 1980 after the election.\n  President Carter has a foreword in this book. It says:\n\n       In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the \n     original 8.9 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Range to \n     preserve its unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational \n     values.\n\n  I know that; I helped draft that order. I was at the Interior \nDepartment as a solicitor of the Department of the Interior.\n  President Carter continues:\n\n       Twenty years later, I signed the Alaska National Interest \n     Lands Conservation Act, monumental legislation safeguarded \n     more than 100 million acres of national parks, refuges, and \n     forest lands in Alaska.\n\n  That is true.\n\n       This loss specifically created the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, doubled the size of the former range, and restricted \n     development in areas that are clearly incompatible with oil \n     exploration.\n       Since I left office, there have been repeated proposals to \n     open the Arctic Refuge coastal plain to oil drilling. \n     Those attempts have failed because of tremendous \n     opposition by the American people. . . .\n\n  This is a propaganda book. President Carter signed that law that had \nthe Tsongas-Jackson amendment that authorized us to go forward with oil \nand gas development as long as an environmental impact statement \ndemonstrated there would be no irreparable harm to the Arctic Plain.\n  President Carter has now developed opposition after signing the law \nthat authorized oil and gas development. And the law would never have \npassed if it had not permitted it.\n  The basic thing today is what to do about these people both in the \nSenate and elsewhere who are trying to persecute the Smithsonian \nofficials who saw what they were trying to do. They were trying to use \nthe Smithsonian to further their cause in opposition to the discussions \ngoing on in the Congress on\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nANWR. The House had just passed a bill containing the approval to \nproceed with oil and gas leasing. They knew that. They wanted to put it \nup in the Smithsonian and have all the visitors to the beautiful \nSmithsonian look at this exhibit and come to the conclusion that those \nwho propose proceeding with the authority under the 1980 act that \nPresident Carter signed, are somehow wrong.\n  That is advocacy on an issue that is pending before the U.S. \nCongress, and it is wrong to use the Smithsonian for that purpose. I do \nnot believe we should let it go unnoticed. People are criticizing the \nmanagement of the Smithsonian for having recognized that. I will defend \nthem. They were right.\n  As a matter of fact, I would defend them if someone from my point of \nview went to the Smithsonian and demanded space to use the Smithsonian \nto advocate my point of view. That is not right.

Mr. President, I rise to give my comments on \nan act that we passed yesterday. It is the Air Cargo Security \nImprovement Act. I think it is worth noting some of the particulars of \nthis legislation which passed the Senate last night because it is \nanother important step toward fully protecting the United States and \nall Americans from terrorists who intend to use our aviation system to \ncommit future attacks.\n  While there are a bunch of provisions in this bill, it includes the \ncreation of a security program to protect our air cargo from terrorist \nattacks. This bill mandates crucial studies on blast-resistant cargo \ncontainers. It also provides for TSA, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, passenger screening. That is known as CAPPS II. It also \nprovides how to defend our airliners from shoulder-fired missile \nattacks. That is a shoulder-mounted, heat-seeking missile, similar to \nthat used in the attack of last December on an Israeli charter jet in \nthe skies over Kenya.\n  This legislation is clearly in the interest of the United States and \nin the interest of freedom-loving people around the world. It also \naddresses a deep concern of mine regarding foreign citizens coming to \nthe United States to receive pilot training on all sizes of aircraft. \nDoes that have a resonance? Does that call to mind something that had \ndisastrous consequences to this country?\n  Well, indeed, because what we have seen is what can happen when \npeople come to our country with the specific intent to do us great \nharm. Many of the September 11 hijackers had learned to fly airplanes \nright here in the United States. They used those airplanes, then, as \ndeadly weapons against the interests of Americans and the people who \nwere in those buildings. They learned to fly in flight schools right \nhere in the United States.\n  Now, section 113 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, \nwhich was enacted in the last Congress, requires background checks of \nall foreign flight school applicants seeking training to operate \naircraft that are 12,500 pounds or more. I had attached that particular \nprovision in the Commerce Committee, and that was part of the package \nthat ultimately became law.\n  Clearly, that was a step in the right direction because, had that \nbeen in effect, it would have screened out those who did harm to us by \nlearning to fly airliners in our own flight training schools here. But \nthat provision--with a cutoff of only learning to fly 12,500-pound \naircraft or more--doesn't help us from preventing different types of \npotential attacks against our domestic security.\n  To rectify that problem, we attached another amendment to the bill \nthat passed last night which addresses the issue of background checks \nfor all foreign flight students who come to flight schools to learn to \nfly in the United States.\n  Why? Besides the obvious--the events on September 11--the FBI has \nissued terrorism warnings indicating that small planes might be used to \ncarry out suicide attacks. Small aircraft can be used by terrorists to \nattack nuclear facilities, carry explosives, or to deliver biological \nor chemical agents. We remember what they found on the computer of one \nof the suspected hijackers: information about learning to fly a crop \nduster.\n  For example, if a crop duster is filled with a combination of \nfertilizers and explosives and were it to be taken into an area of high \nconcentration of people, such as a sports stadium, that could do some \nserious damage and some serious injury, not even to speak of the \npossibility of distributing biological or chemical agents from \nsomething like a crop duster. It is in the interest of this country to \nensure we are not training terrorists to perform those acts.\n  The bill that passed last night will close an important loophole and \nanswer the critical warnings issued recently by the FBI by extending \nthe background check requirement to all foreign applicants to U.S. \nflight schools regardless of the size of aircraft they seek to learn to \nfly.\n  The flight schools naturally have been concerned: Is this going to be \nmore redtape for them? The fact is, when we passed this provision over \na year ago, it was assigned to the Department of Justice. The \nDepartment of Justice never implemented the bill, to the great \nfrustration of the owners and the operators of flight schools, so that \nthey could never get the foreign flight students in because the \nDepartment of Justice had not implemented the rules to allow those \nbackground checks, which is a simple little fingerprint test that can \nbe done in our embassies and consulates abroad before the foreign \nflight student ever comes to America. Naturally, the flight schools \nwere frustrated.\n  We are rectifying that situation for the flight schools because this \nis not going to be in the Department of Justice, where the holdup \noccurred; it is going to be in the new Department of Homeland Security, \nspecifically designated to the TSA, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, and it is my expectation that the TSA, which provided \nexcellent advice in the fine-tuning of this legislation, will apply an \nappropriate level of background screening to all foreign nationals who \nseek flight training in the United States, and then the frustrations of \nthe flight schools will be taken care of. The flight schools will be \nable to know that the background check has already been done abroad \nbefore the flight student from a foreign land arrives.\n  That procedure is not going to allow anyone to slip through the \ncracks. We cannot aid anyone who intends to do harm to Americans and to \nour Nation.\n  I thank all the Senators who helped me with this legislation. It has \nbeen a couple of years in the making to finally get it to this point. \nThe chairman and ranking members, Senators McCain and Hollings, and \ntheir staff have worked with us to ensure the inclusion of this \nprovision in the bill. Finally, we are on the way to solving this \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5993-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5993-S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AIR CARGO SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I would like to explain why I opposed the \nnomination of Deborah Cook to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit earlier this week.\n  As I have stated, before, appointees to the Federal bench must be \nable to set aside their personal philosophies and beliefs. They must be \nable to administer and enforce the law in a fair and impartial manner. \nBecause the U.S. Supreme Court hears fewer and fewer cases each year, \nthe circuit courts are the court of last resort for many ordinary \ncitizens and businesses. The circuit courts often have the last word on \nimportant cases dealing with civil rights, environmental protection, \nconsumer protections, and labor issues, among many others. Circuit \ncourt judges must demonstrate a record of integrity, honesty, fairness, \nand a willingness to uphold the law. It doesn't matter if that person \nis nominated by a Democrat or a Republican--the standard remains the \nsame.\n  In reviewing Ms. Cook's record, I noted several instances in which \nshe clearly ignored her own State's Constitution or her own court's \nprior precedent in issuing her opinion or dissent. This was \nparticularly striking in cases involving worker and consumer rights and \nprotections. Her record indicates she lacks the sensitivity and legal \nintegrity so vital to any person worthy of a lifetime appointment as a \nU.S. circuit court judge. Her record indicates she cannot set aside her \nown personal philosophies and beliefs in deciding the cases before her.\n  In short, I could not in good conscience, exercising my duty under \nthe Constitution, vote to confirm Deborah Cook to a lifetime \nappointment on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5994-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE GUN INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a declaration recently filed in a \nCalifornia lawsuit by Mr. Robert A. Ricker, former assistant general \ncounsel for the National Rifle Association and former executive \ndirector of the American Shooting Sports Council, revealed that many in \nthe gun industry have long known that their business practices make it \neasier for criminals to gain access to guns yet often fail to do \nanything about it.\n  In his declaration, Mr. Ricker cites an example of irresponsible \nbusiness practices in the gun industry known as straw purchasing. Straw \npurchases are a primary avenue by which a relatively small number of \nfederally licensed firearm dealers supply the criminal market. A straw \npurchase involves a buyer with a clean record purchasing a gun for \nsomeone who is prohibited by law from doing so. Mr. Ricker asserts that \nit has long been known in the gun industry that many straw purchases \nand other questionable sales can be stopped if dealers are trained in \npreventing illegal activity. However, in the absence of such training \nand a commitment to responsible business practices, many straw sales \ncontinue to take place undetected. Instead of requiring their dealers \nto act responsibly, Mr. Ricker says that it has been a common practice \namong some gun manufacturers to adopt a ``see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, \nspeak-no-evil'' approach. This approach does nothing to discourage the \nevasion of firearms laws and regulations.\n  Mr. Ricker's accounts confirm what has long been suspected. Some gun \nmanufacturers and dealers know their practices facilitate criminal \naccess to firearms but they do nothing about it. The Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act that recently passed the House and that has been referred to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee would shield those negligent and \nreckless gun dealers and manufacturers from many legitimate civil \nlawsuits. Certainly, those in the industry who conduct their business \nnegligently or recklessly should not be shielded from the consequences \nof their actions. Mr. Ricker's declaration contributes further evidence \nthat this bill would assist some in the gun industry in avoiding \nresponsibility for their business practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5994-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          NATIONAL NURSES WEEK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I acknowledge the importance of \nthis week and pay tribute to a very important sector of our health care \nworkforce. This week marks ``National Nurse Week,'' which highlights \nthe critical role that nurses play in our Nation's health care system. \nNurses are the backbone of our health care system and their continued \ndedication and commitment to both patients and doctors deserves our \npraise during this special week. I am thankful for all the hard work \nthat the men and women of this profession provide to the people of \nSouth Dakota and our Nation.\n  South Dakota is fortunate to have several successful nursing programs \nthroughout the State dedicated to providing outstanding service to the \npeople of South Dakota. It is important that these institutions \ncontinue to grow and work to bring bright young professionals to the \nnursing field. This job has become more difficult in recent years as \nthe profession faces increased workforce shortages. The average \npracticing nurse is in her midforties and will soon leave the workforce \nfor retirement. At the same time, we have less and less young nurses \nentering the field. This is especially a problem for rural States, such \nas South Dakota, which have chronic health care worker recruitment and \nretention problems. The nursing shortage also puts great strain on \nthose currently working in the profession. Initiatives need to be taken \non both fronts, professional and educational, to address these \nchallenges and bolster the nursing workforce in preparation for an \naging baby boom generation.\n  Last year, I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the Nurse Reinvestment \nAct, which was signed into law. This critically important legislation \nhas established five standards that will help alleviate many of the \nproblems facing the nursing profession, including a specific focus on \nimplementing these programs in rural areas. First, it creates a \nNational Nurse Service Corps Scholarship Program, which provides \nscholarships in exchange for at least 2 years of service in a critical \nnursing shortage area or facility. Second, it will recruit nurses by \nestablishing Nurse Recruitment Grants and by creating both national and \nState public awareness campaigns. Third, it creates ``career ladder'' \nprograms that will encourage individuals to pursue additional \neducation, training, and advancement within the profession. Fourth, it \nincludes a loan, scholarship, and stipend program for graduate level \neducation in the nursing profession in exchange for teaching at an \naccredited school of nursing. Finally, it establishes a National \nCommission on the Recruitment and Retention of Nurses to conduct \nstudies and make recommendations on the vital issues facing the nursing \nprofession.\n  The fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill designated $20 \nmillion in funding for the Nurse Reinvestment Act. While this marks a \nstep in the right direction, I would like to see this funding increased \nto accurately reflect what is really needed to curb the workforce \nshortage crisis. I joined several of my colleagues in fighting for $250 \nmillion in new money for this program last year, and as a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for \nadditional resources towards that goal.\n  As I have noted, the nursing workforce is the foundation of our \nhealth care system. The continued dedication and commitment of our \ncountry's nurses is truly inspirational and has made patients' lives \nbetter and doctors' jobs easier. I look forward to seeing this \nworkforce grow as a result of the wonderful programs authorized by the \nNurse Reinvestment Act. I will do what I can to help foster the \nexpansion of these programs and I celebrate Nurses Week by thanking the \nnurses of this country for all that they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S5994-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5994-S5995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:44 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 874.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the \nage for receipt of military retired pay for nonregular service from 60 \nto 55; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould reduce the retirement age for members of the National Guard and \nReserve from 60 to 55. This change would allow 93,000 reservists \ncurrently aged 55 to 59 to retire with full benefits and would restore \nparity between the retirement systems for Federal civilian employees \nand reservists.\n  In the interests of fairness, the United States must act quickly to \nrestore parity between the retirement age for civilian Federal \nemployees and their reserve counterparts. When the reserve retirement \nsystem was created in 1947, the retirement age for reservists was \nidentical to the age for civilian employees. At age 60, reservists and \ngovernment employees could hang up their uniforms and retire with full \nbenefits. However, since 1947, the retirement age for civilian retirees \nhas been lowered by 5 years, while the reserve retirement age has not \nchanged.\n  The disparate treatment of Federal employees and reservists would \nhave been serious enough had the nature of the work performed by the \nreserves not changed substantially over the past five decades. But \nAmerica has never placed greater demands on its ready reserve than it \ndoes now. More than 200,000 reservists are serving their country in the \nwar against terrorism at home, abroad, and in the conflict with Iraq. \nAmerica's dependence on our ready reserve has never been more obvious, \nas reservists are now providing security at our Nation's airports and \nair patrols over our major cities. As Charles Cragin, the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, recently noted, ``The nature and \npurpose of reserve service has changed since the end of the cold war. \nThey are no longer weekend warriors. They represent almost 50 percent \nof the total force.''\n  With call-ups that last several months and take reservists far from \nhome, serving the Nation as a reservist has taken on more of the \ntrappings of active duty service than ever before. The recent conflict \nhas only further underscored the demands placed on the National Guard \nand Reserve. Before the war on terrorism began, reservists were \nperforming about 13 million man-days each year, more than a 10-fold \nincrease over the one million man-days per year the reserves averaged \njust 10 years ago. These statistics, the latest numbers available, do \nnot even reflect the thousands of reservists who have been deployed \nsince September 11 nor do they take into account the number of \nreservists who have been deployed in the current military action \nagainst Iraq. There is little doubt there will be a dramatic increase \nin the number of man-days for 2002 and 2003. In my view, with \nadditional responsibility should come additional benefits.\n  The Department of Defense typically has not supported initiatives \nlike this. The Department has expressed concern over the proposal's \ncost, which is estimated to be approximately $20 billion over 10 years, \nalthough CBO figures are not yet available. However, I am concerned \nthat the Department's position may be shortsighted.\n  At a time when there is a patriotic fervor and a renewed enthusiasm \nfor national service, it is easy to forget that not long ago, the U.S. \nmilitary was struggling to meet its recruitment and retention goals. In \nthe aftermath of September 11, defense-wide recruitment and retention \nrates have improved. However, there is no guarantee that this trend \nwill continue. Unless the overall package of incentives is enhanced, \nthere is little reason to believe that we will be able to attract and \nretain highly-trained personnel.\n  Active duty military personnel have often looked to the reserves as a \nway of continuing to serve their country while being closer to family. \nWith thousands of dollars invested in training active duty officers and \nenlisted soldiers, the United States benefits tremendously when \npersonnel decide to continue with the reserves. But with reserve \ndeployments increasing in frequency and duration--pulling reservists \naway from their families and civilian life for longer periods--the \nbenefit of joining the reserves instead of active duty has been \nseverely reduced. The more we depend on the reserves, the greater \nchance we have of losing highly trained former active duty servicemen \nand women. The added incentive of full retirement at 55 might provide \nan important inducement for some of them to stay on despite the surge \nin deployments.\n  Enacting this legislation will send the clear message that the United \nStates values the increased sacrifice of our reservists during these \ntrying times. The legislation has been endorsed by key members of the \nMilitary Coalition, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Air \nForce Sergeants Association, the Air Force Association, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Naval Reserve \nAssociation, and the National\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nGuard Association. The bill would restore parity between the reserve \nretirement system and the civilian retirement system, acknowledge the \nincreased workload of reserve service, and provide essential personnel \nwith an inducement to join and stay in the reserves until retirement.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN AGE FOR RECEIPT OF MILITARY RETIRED \n                   PAY FOR NONREGULAR SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Age.--Section 12731(a)(1) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``at least 60 \n     years of age'' and inserting ``at least 55 years of age''.\n       (b) Application to Existing Provisions of Law or Policy.--\n     With respect to any provision of law, or of any policy, \n     regulation, or directive of the executive branch, that refers \n     to a member or former member of the uniformed services as \n     being eligible for, or entitled to, retired pay under chapter \n     1223 of title 10, United States Code, but for the fact that \n     the member or former member is under 60 years of age, such \n     provision shall be carried out with respect to that member or \n     former member by substituting for the reference to being 60 \n     years of age a reference to the age in effect for \n     qualification for such retired pay under section 12731(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first month \n     beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and shall apply to retired pay payable for that month and \n     subsequent months.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Campbell, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1036. A bill to provide for a multi-agency cooperative effort to \nencourage further research regarding the causes of chronic wasting \ndisease and methods to control the further spread of the disease in \ndeer and elk herds, to monitor the incidence of the disease, to support \nState efforts to control the disease, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last year, I joined eleven colleagues in \nan effort to pass legislation that dealt with the eradication, \nmonitoring, and surveillance of chronic wasting disease. Today, I am \noffering similar legislation, the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act \nof 2003.'' Before I discuss the legislation further, I first want to \nthank Senator Feingold for his leadership on this matter and for \nworking diligently to eradicate the disease. I also want to \ncongratulate the State of Colorado, especially those Departments and \nDivisions that have been on the leading edge of disease management and \neradication. They faced a horrendous task--processing tens of thousands \nof tests on a tight time frame. While more work lies ahead, they are to \nbe commended for their effort.\n  What was first a serious problem in the western United States, \nchronic wasting disease now poses a serious threat to every State of \nthe union. As a United States Senator, chronic wasting disease presents \nnot only a great animal health challenge, but a scientific quandary as \nwell. As a veterinarian, chronic wasting disease presents an even \ngreater challenge to the scientific communities of both the States and \nthe Federal Government because we know so little about the disease. \nThis legislation, cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Kohl, Roberts, \nCampbell, Burns and Craig, is a bipartisan effort to defeat the disease \nand to send a message that CWD must remain a priority for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The importance of this bill to both the State and Federal Government \ncannot be emphasized enough. It authorizes $34.5 million in the battle \nagainst chronic wasting disease. Although the bill authorizes a \nsubstantial amount Federal funding to fight and eradicate the disease, \nthe States will retain their undisputed primacy and policy-making \nauthority with regard to wildlife management. Nothing in this act \ninterferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in \nmanaging wildlife generally, or managing, surveying and monitoring the \nincidence of chronic wasting disease. It is important that all members \nof our delegation and in both the House and the Senate, coordinate our \nefforts as we fight the disease.\n  Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, may be a new threat to some. Others \nmay not be familiar with it at all. However, it is not new to those of \nus in Colorado and Wyoming, who have been dealing with it for over \ntwenty years, and if the disease continues to spread, those unfamiliar \nwith the fatal disease will, unfortunately, become experts in CWD \npolicy. The scientific community has gone to great lengths to deal with \nthe disease on limited budgets. These experts, through scientific \npublication and Congressional hearings, have told us that, although we \nhave learned a tremendous amount about chronic wasting disease, there \nis much that we do not know and much that we must do to eradicate it.\n  One thing we do know is that sound science is the answer, and that \nthe Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 is intended to greatly \nincrease research, monitoring, surveillance, and management of the \ndisease on all levels. It bolsters testing capacity, diagnostics \ncapabilities, and funding authorization.\n  Increased research and research funding is necessary because the \ndisease is quite simply a mystery--the origin and transmission of CWD \nremains unknown. Unfortunately, the only way to treat an animal with \nCWD or to contain the disease is to destroy the animal and cull the \nherd. Together, we must embark on an ambitious and sound scientific \ncommitment for research and investigation to end chronic wasting \ndisease. That is what this bill calls for--cooperation and \ncollaboration, working together at both the State and Federal level to \nachieve a common objective. We must end chronic wasting disease, and we \nmust begin our eradication efforts now.\n  The impact CWD will have on wildlife and agriculture is undeniable, \nand the economic and emotional toll of the disease cannot be \noverstated. Communities that are economically reliant upon deer and elk \nrelated enterprises will feel the impact of CWD as concern about the \ndisease grows. But we can stop this, and we must stop this. We have an \nopportunity to restore cervid health, to contain the disease, and, most \nimportantly, to eradicate the disease. This is the challenge that I \nurge my colleagues to accept, and to take decisive action; adequate \nresearch funding that is directed toward the complete eradication of \nchronic wasting disease starts with this authorizing legislation.\n  In those States that are already dealing with CWD, the fiscal demands \nrequired to manage the disease is quite apparent. State budgets are \nstretched thin as they cull wild and captive herds and research for \nworkable solutions to stop the disease. With State budgets already \nstrained, an infusion of Federal resources and technical assistance is \nrequired to help the States keep CWD from spreading, to treat infected \nor exposed populations, and to greatly expand research for testing and \npossible cures. This bill does just that by providing assistance in the \nform of grants, Federal research programs and incidence reporting, as \nwell as scientific assistance. State and Federal cooperation will \nprotect animal welfare, safeguard our valued livestock industry, \nprovide relief to family elk ranchers, help guarantee America's food \nsafety, and protect the public health.\n  The Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 provides the \nfoundation for a nationwide increase in diagnostic capabilities. \nUndoubtedly, the spread of CWD and the increased awareness of the \ndisease, will cause the demand for testing to grow exponentially--this \nbill helps us prepare to handle a large volume of cases efficiently and \nreliably. The legislation calls for the development of new testing \nmethods to help us understand the disease, as well as developing a live \ntest.\n  Chronic wasting disease presents a common problem to the States and \nthe Federal Government. The Federal conduit role that is provided in \nthe bill will allow animal health experts to unravel the CWD mystery. \nThe challenge we face is to achieve what we all recognize as a common \nobjective--to understand CWD and to eradicate it. But, we must act \nquickly or this disease will redefine the wildlife characteristics of \nour States.\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\n  Thank you, Senator Feingold.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain \n     undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to \n     wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with \n     or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing \n     wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring \n     the incidence of chronic wasting disease.\n       (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease \n     found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and \n     vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased \n     occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse \n     locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in \n     research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities \n     focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal \n     disease.\n       (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of \n     chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and \n     captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal \n     Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic \n     financial and technical support to these States.\n       (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant \n     Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and \n     integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of \n     State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic \n     wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild \n     cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local \n     land management jurisdictions.\n       (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can \n     provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems \n     under existing legal authorities.\n\n             TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 101 GRANTS FOR STATE AND TRIBAL EFFORTS TO MANAGE \n                   CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE IN WILDLIFE.\n\n       (a) Availability of Assistance.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior shall develop a grant program to allocate funds \n     appropriated to carry out this section directly to the State \n     agency responsible for wildlife management in each State that \n     petitions the Secretary for a portion of such fund to develop \n     and implement long term management strategies to address \n     chronic wasting disease in wildlife.\n       (b) Funding Priorities.--In determining the amounts to be \n     allocated to grantees under subsection (a), priority shall be \n     given based on the following criteria:\n       (1) Relative scope of incidence of chronic wasting disease \n     in the State, with priority given to those jurisdictions with \n     the highest incidence of the disease.\n       (2) Expenditures on chronic wasting disease management, \n     monitoring, surveillance, and research, with priority given \n     to those States and tribal governments that have shown the \n     greatest financial commitment to managing, monitoring, \n     surveying, and researching chronic wasting disease.\n       (3) Comprehensive and integrated policies and programs \n     focused on chronic wasting disease management between \n     involved State wildlife and agricultural agencies and tribal \n     governments, with priority given to grantees that have \n     integrated the programs and policies of all involved agencies \n     related to chronic wasting disease management.\n       (4) Rapid response to new outbreaks of chronic wasting \n     disease, whether occurring in States in which chronic wasting \n     disease is already found or States with first infections, \n     with the intent of containing the disease in any new area of \n     infection.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated $10,000,000 to carry out this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Allard) in introducing comprehensive legislation to \naddress the problem of chronic wasting disease. This legislation is \nsimilar to legislation we introduced last year, updated to reflect \ncurrent status of this issue. I am delighted to be continuing my \nefforts with him on this bill and to again also be working with my \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) and commend them and their \nstaff for all their tireless efforts.\n  This disease is a serious problem affecting both wild and captive \ndeer in my home State of Wisconsin. It has spread from Wisconsin to the \nneighboring states of Minnesota and Illinois. This legislation is \nacutely needed, as Wisconsin's experience in getting Federal assistance \nto address this problem, though eventually forthcoming, has been \nextremely slow and frustrating. The Federal Government must make \nchronic wasting disease a higher priority, and Congress must provide \nthe relevant federal agencies with the additional funds and authority \nso that they can do so.\n  Congress delayed action on this bill in the last Congress, under \npromises that the Department of the Interior, DOI, and the Department \nof Agriculture, USDA, would be acting quickly to put together and \nimplement a comprehensive CWD management plan. It has now been nearly a \nyear, and no such plan has emerged. I was successful in getting a \nprovision included in the 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill calling for \nthe plan to be released no later than May 20, 2003. That deadline is \nrapidly approaching, and the legislation we introduce today will \nprovide a clear message--CWD must be a priority for the Federal \nGovernment and for this administration.\n  A coordinated approach is needed, due to the severity of this \ndisease, its ability to spread, and our urgent need for information to \naddress it. Chronic wasting disease belongs to the family of \ntransmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, diseases. TSEs are a \ngroup of transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative diseases of \nthe central nervous systems of several species of animals. Animal TSEs \ninclude, in addition to chronic wasting disease, CWD, in deer and elk, \nbovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, \nfeline spongiform encephalopathy in cats, and mink spongiform \nencephalopathy in mink.\n  The State of Wisconsin has just completed an historic effort to test \nthe deer in our State. Results from more than 41,000 whitetail deer \ntested in our State have turned up 207 CWD positive animals. Almost all \nof the infected deer, 201 of the total, came from a 411 square mile \neradication zone of Dane,\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\nIowa and Sauk counties. My State began intensive testing of deer after \nCWD was discovered on February 28, 2002. Over 1,200 people in my State \nhave been involved, conducting thousands of hours of work at millions \nof dollars of expense. CWD has also been found in several captive herds \nin my State as well.\n\n  In that vein, the legislation we are introducing in comprehensive, \naddressing both captive and wild animals and short term and long term \nneeds. It authorizes a $34.5 million Federal chronic wasting disease \nprogram that will be administered by the United States Departments of \nInterior and Agriculture, USDA. It is similar to legislation being \nintroduced today in the House of Representatives by the Representatives \nfrom Colorado (Mr. McInnis), and from Wisconsin (Mr. Green), and was \ncosponsored on a bipartisan basis by Wisconsin delegation members in \nthe House Of Representatives in the last Congress. I think it is \nextremely appropriate that legislators from Colorado, the state that \nhas the longest history in chronic wasting disease, have made a \nconcerted effort to work with Wisconsin members who are struggling with \na new outbreak. I deeply appreciate the commitment of the \nRepresentative from Colorado (Mr. McInnis), toward finding a solution \nthat works for both our States. I think these are good comprehensive \nefforts, and I would like to highlight a few provisions in detail.\n  The bill I am introducing with the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nAllard), authorizes $16 million for grants to States and tribal \ngovernments battling CWD. The Interior Department to give up to $10 \nmillion in grants to States to help them plan and implement management \nstrategies to address chronic wasting disease in both wild herds of \ndeer and elk. The Interior Department is directed, in addition, to \ndevelop a national chronic wasting disease incident database, building \non the existing USDA reporting program. The USDA is authorized to award \nup to $6 million in grants to those same entities for the management of \nCWD in captive deer and elk. These amounts are nearly triple $5.6 \nmillion that USDA made available to States for use to address CWD in \nboth captive and wild cervids.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nAllard), has incorporated provisions that I authored to address \nWisconsin's ongoing need for enhanced testing capacity to move toward a \nsystem of widely available testing for hunters. Under the bill, USDA is \nrequired to release, within 30 days, protocols both for labs to use in \nperforming tests for chronic wasting disease and for the proper \ncollection of animal tissue to be tested. USDA is further required to \ndevelop a certification program for Federal and non-Federal labs, \nincluding private labs, conducting chronic wasting disease tests within \n30 days of enactment. I hope all these measures will enhance \nWisconsin's capacity to continue its deer testing program. To address \nlonger term needs, the USDA is directed to accelerate research into the \ndevelopment of live animal tests for chronic wasting disease, including \nfield diagnostic tests, and the development of testing protocols that \nreduce laboratory test processing time.\n  This bill is needed, because State wildlife and agriculture \ndepartments do not have the fiscal or scientific capacity to adequately \nconfront the problem. Their resources are spread too thin as they \nattempt to prevent the disease from spreading. Federal help in the form \nof management funding, research grants, and scientific expertise is \nurgently needed. Federal and state cooperation will protect animal \nwelfare, safeguard our valued livestock industry, help guarantee \nAmerica's food safety, and protect the public health.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Colorado (Mr. \nAllard), to seek passage of this measure. This is a good bill and it \ndeserves the Senate's support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Collins, Mr. Carper, Mr. Allen, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \n        Craig, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1037. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the Medicare program of all oral anticancer \ndrugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, the Access to \nCancer Therapies Act, which will extend Medicare coverage for all oral \nanticancer drugs. This legislation will help ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries with cancer have access to the most advanced and \neffective drug therapies. I am pleased to be joined today by 19 of my \ncolleagues in introducing this legislation. The strong bipartisan \nsupport the bill has received, even before introduction, indicates its \nimportance to members of the Senate.\n  As we know, presently Medicare does not include an outpatient \nprescription drug benefit. While this is a tremendous hardship for all \nbeneficiaries, it is especially difficult for seniors who have cancer, \nwhich prevents them from receiving the most appropriate drug treatments \nas recommended by their physicians.\n  Enacting a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit is certainly one of my \ntop priorities. However, even if we are successful and enact a bill \ninto law this year, the comprehensive benefit is not expected to be \navailable until 2006 at the earliest. This bill, on the other hand, \nwould allow Medicare to begin coverage of oral anticancer drugs within \n90 days of enactment. These patients are facing life and death choices, \nI believe it is our responsibility to provide access to the most \neffective and appropriate drug therapies.\n  Congress recognizes the importance of expanding coverage to vital \ncancer treatments and in 1993 created a unique Medicare drug benefit \nfor oral anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, coverage under this law only \nis provided if the drug is equivalent to drugs provided ``incident'' to \na physician visit; for example, drugs that must be injected. At \npresent, upwards of 95 percent of cancer drug therapy is covered by \nMedicare either in a physician office or as an oral form, which \nqualifies under the 1993 legislation. However, in the very near future \nas much as 25 percent of cancer drug therapies will be oral drugs not \ncovered. By enacting this legislation into law, we can ensure these new \noutpatient cancer treatment therapies will be available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This is a developing trend. Today, there are about 40 oral anti-\ncancer drugs, but less than 10 are reimbursed by Medicare. In fact, one \nof the most common and effective drugs used in the treatment of breast \ncancer, tamoxifen, is among those drugs that currently are not \nreimbursed by Medicare.\n  As cancer therapy becomes more reliant on oral drugs, Medicare \ncoverage policy must be updated to cover the new therapies. Otherwise \nthe intent of the very limited 1993 policy will become meaningless and \nMedicare beneficiaries will increasingly lose access to the best cancer \ntherapies.\n  Let me provide some very encouraging examples of oral anti-cancer \ndrugs that illustrates the urgency of both this policy change and of \nenacting Medicare prescription drug legislation. Over the past two \nyears, the FDA has approved a number of remarkable oral anticancer \ndrugs that are producing outstanding results. Two such examples include \nGleevec, which was approved in 2001 and IRESSA, which was approved on \nMay 5.\n  Gleevec is used to treat one type of leukemia and may also be \neffective against a rare but lethal stomach cancer. It is the first, \nlet me repeat, first, cancer drug to specifically address a molecular \ntarget, which not only is in the cancer, but actually is the cause of \nthe cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. More precisely, \nGleevec eliminates a specific enzyme needed for the cancer to thrive. \nBy contrast, most current cancer therapies act like a shotgun, killing \nboth cancer and normal cells.\n  IRESSA, another revolutionary oral anticancer drug that the FDA \nrecently approved, treats advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, NSCLC. \nConsidering lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the \nUnited States, estimated to account for approximately 157,000 deaths in \n2003, and NSCLC is the\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\nmost common form of lung cancer, accounting for 80 percent of all lung \ncancer cases, it is imperative that Medicare beneficiaries have access \nto this new drug. For many who do not respond to chemotherapy \ntreatments, IRESSA is the last line of defense.\n  However, both of these cancer treatments are expensive. For instance, \nwhile Gleevec is a revolutionary and highly effective treatment, it is \nnot a cure. It simply arrests the cancer and returns most lab tests to \nnormal, requiring many patients to take the drug for life. Considering \nthe extraordinary costs of these treatments--a month's supply of \nGleevec costs upwards of $2,400 and IRESSA, the last treatment option \nfor many NSCLC patients, costs approximately $1,900 per month of \ntreatment, with the average treatment lasting seven months--Medicare \ncoverage is a necessity.\n  It is imperative that Medicare provide reliable access to these \nadvanced medications to help beneficiaries with cancer. Biomedical \nresearch is providing new, more targeted, and less toxic methods of \ntreatment through new oral anti-cancer drugs that patients can safely \ntake in the comfort of their own homes, which will help improve \noutcomes and enhance patient quality of life.\n  We must act now to ensure all oral anti-cancer drugs are available to \nour seniors. The Access to Cancer Therapies Act will build on current \nMedicare policy by ensuring coverage of all anti-cancer drugs, whether \noral or injectable, are available to Medicare beneficiaries. The Act \nwill provide beneficiaries with access to innovative new therapies that \nare less toxic and more convenient, more clinically effective and more \ncost-effective than many currently covered treatment options. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a small \nbill, but one with important consequences. My measure, the ``Access to \nCancer Therapies Act,'' would provide coverage of all oral anti-cancer \ndrugs under the Medicare program. I am pleased to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing this measure.\n  As my colleagues know, there is no Medicare outpatient prescription \ndrug benefit today. If there was, we would not need this legislation. \nThere should be and there must be a meaningful and fair Medicare \nprescription drug benefit this year. Seniors are reeling from the \nburden of their prescription drug expenses, and they can't defer their \nillnesses or their costs.\n  This legislation also reminds us of how crucial prescription drug \ncoverage will be in the future. In 1993, Congress created a unique \nMedicare drug benefit for oral anti-cancer drugs--but only if the drug \nis equivalent to drugs provided ``incident'' to a physician visit; for \nexample, drugs that must be injected. At present, upwards of 90 percent \nof cancer drug therapy is covered by Medicare either in a physician \noffice or in a reimbursed oral form. But by 2010 as much as 25 percent \nof cancer drug therapy will be in the form of oral drugs that are not \ncurrently covered.\n  As cancer therapy moves more toward reliance on oral drugs, Medicare \ncoverage policy must be updated to cover the new therapies, or else \neven the intent of this very limited policy will be meaningless and \nMedicare beneficiaries will increasingly lose access to the best cancer \ntherapies. And without this legislative change, beneficiaries will \nincreasingly bear the burden of buying these drugs from their own \npockets, which most seniors can ill-afford.\n  While biomedical research is providing new, more targeted, and less \ntoxic methods of treatment through new oral anti-cancer drugs that \npatients can safely take in the comfort of their own homes, Medicare \npolicy is currently unable to provide reliable access to these \nmedications for beneficiaries with cancer.\n  This legislation is important not only to seniors surviving cancer, \nbut to all Americans. A recent poll conducted for the National \nCoalition of Cancer Survivorship found that 9 out of 10 Americans \nbelieve that Medicare should pay for all medically approved cancer \ntherapies.\n  Even if we do not succeed in enacting a comprehensive Medicare drug \nbenefit this year, it is time to do what Americans want for cancer \nsurvivors by passing the Access to Cancer Therapies Act in the 108th \nCongress. This legislation gives people with cancer immediate access to \nlife-saving drugs. This is a stop-gap provision that would be phased \nout when a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit is put into place that \nwould cover oral anti-cancer drugs consistently with all other drugs.\n  At the very least, we must ensure all oral anti-cancer drugs are \navailable to our seniors. The Access to Cancer Therapies Act will build \non current Medicare policy by ensuring coverage of all anti-cancer \ndrugs, whether oral or injectable, are available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The act will provide beneficiaries with access to \ninnovative new therapies that are less toxic and more convenient, more \nclinically effective and more cost-effective than many currently \ncovered treatment options. In the last Congress, 57 Senators \ncosponsored this bill. This is an opportunity to improve our Medicare \nprogram immediately. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Craig, Mr. Stevens, and \n        Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1038. A bill to limit the acquisition by the United States of land \nlocated in a State in which 25 percent or more of the land in that \nState is owned by the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``No-Net-Loss of \nPrivate Lands Act.'' This legislation is a common sense proposal which \nwill limit additional Federal land acquisition in the public land \nStates.\n  Throughout our country, the Federal Government continues to acquire \ngreater amounts of land. It is time to stop the growth of the Federal \nGovernment and begin to protect private property.\n  This is especially true for those of us living in the West. Roughly \n50 percent of the land in my home State of Wyoming is owned by the \nFederal Government. Many other western States have an even higher \npercentage of Federal ownership, including Nevada and Alaska that have \nover 80 percent of their surface land owned by the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not always been a good \nneighbor to the people of the West. The Federal land management \nagencies continue to acquire vast amounts of land and restrict access \nto these areas for multiple use purposes. This creates great hardship \nfor local communities, destroying jobs and depressing the economy in \nmany areas around the West.\n  The time has come to curb the Federal Government's insatiable \nappetite for additional land in the United States. The ``No-Net-Loss of \nPrivate Lands Act'' is a reasonable approach to stopping the ever-\nincreasing growth of Federal land ownership. This measure requires the \nFederal Government to release an equal value of land when it acquires \nproperty in States which are at least 25 percent federally-owned. \nProperty would be released at the time of the new acquisition, and land \ndisposal would not necessarily have to come from the same agency making \nthe acquisition. In addition, the legislation includes a provision \nwaving the disposal requirement in time of war or national emergency.\n  During my time in Congress, I have worked extensively to protect \nunique public lands such as national parks and other special areas. \nThis legislation would do nothing to limit our ability to acquire more \nof these pristine and special areas in the future. Unfortunately, the \nFederal Government's quest for more land has included too many areas \nthat do not contribute to our natural resource heritage. Rather, \nacquisitions often simply lock-up areas that should remain private and \nproductive.\n  It is time for Congress to protect the rights of private property \nowners and instill some restraint in Federal land acquisitions. The \n``No-Net-Loss of Private Lands Act'' is a reasonable proposal that will \nprovide this much needed discipline.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\n                                S. 1038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The required \n     vote shall then be a simple majority.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nintroduction of this resolution which offers a more than reasonable \nproposal to fix a confirmation process that Members on both ides of the \naisle agree is broken.\n  Simultaneous filibusters of two circuit court nominees who would \nclearly be confirmed in up-or-down votes are unprecedented. From what I \nunderstand, the minority has plans for even more filibusters of \njudicial nominees. The resulting politicization of the confirmation \nprocess threatens the untarnished respect in which we hold our third \nbranch of Government--the one branch of Government intended to be above \npolitical influence.\n  There is also a significant constitutional consideration at stake \nhere. In its enumeration of Presidential powers, the Constitution \nspecifies that the confirmation process begins and ends with the \nPresident. The Senate has the intermediary role of providing advice and \nconsent. Here is the precise language of article II, section 2:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . \n     Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of \n     the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for, and which shall be established by Law[.]\n\n  There is no question that the Constitution squarely places the \nappointment power in the hands of the President. As Alexander Hamilton \nexplained the The Federalist No. 66:\n\n       It will be the Office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have \n     made.\n\n  It is significant that the Constitution outlines the Senate's role in \nthe appointments process in the enumeration of Presidential powers in \narticle II, rather than in the enumeration of congressional powers in \narticle I. This choice suggests that the Senate was intended to play a \nmore limited role in the confirmation of Federal judges.\n  Hamilton's discussion of the appointments clause in The Federalist \nNo. 76\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nsupports this reading. Hamilton believed that the President, acting \nalone, would be the better choice for making nominations, as he would \nbe less vulnerable to personal considerations and political \nnegotiations than the Senate and more inclined, as the sole decision \nmaker, to select nominees who would reflect well on the presidency. The \nSenate's role, by comparison, would be to act as a powerful check on \n``unfit'' nominees by the President. As he put it, ``[Senate \nconfirmation] would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism \nin the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of \nunfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from \npersonal attachment, or from a view to popularity.'' This is a far cry \nfrom efforts we have seen over the past couple of years to inject \nideology into the nominations process, and to force nominees to \ndisclose their personal opinions on hot-button and divisive policy \nissues like abortion, gun control, and affirmation action.\n  Historically, deliberation by the Senate could be quite short, \nespecially when compared to today's practice. Take, for example the \n1862 nomination and confirmation of Samuel F. Miller to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He was nominated, confirmed, and commissioned all on the \nsame day! The Senate formally deliberated on his nomination for only 30 \nminutes before confirming him. His experience was not the exception. \nConfirmations on the same day, or within a few days, of the nomination \nwere the norm well into the 20th century.\n  Contrast the nominations of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. They \nwere appointed 2 years ago and have yet to be afforded an up-or-down \nvote by the Senate. Mr. Estrada has now endured six cloture votes more \nthan 3 months after debate on his nomination began. Justice Owen's \nnomination has been subjected to two cloture votes. Clearly, this is a \nfar cry from the role for the Senate that the Framers contemplated. \nWhat was enumerated in the Constitution as advice and consent has in \npractice evolved to negotiation and cooperation in the best cases, and \ndelay and obstruction in the worst cases--like that of Mr. Estrada and \nJustice Owen.\n\n  The Estrada and Owen nominations illustrate what is wrong with our \ncurrent system of confirming nominees. Despite a bipartisan majority of \nSenators who stand ready to vote on these nominations, a vocal minority \nof Senators is precluding the Senate from exercising its advice and \nconsent duty. This is tyranny of the minority, and it is unfair.\n  It is unfair to the nominee, who must put life on hold while hanging \nin endless limbo. It is unfair to the judiciary, our co-equal branch of \nGovernment, which needs its vacancies filled. It is unfair to our \nPresident, who has a justified expectation that the Senate will give \nhis nominees an up-or-down vote. And it is unfair to the majority of \nSenators who are prepared to vote on this nomination.\n  Many of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, agree that the \nconfirmation process is broken. Senator Feinstein stated in a recent \nletter to the White House that the judicial confirmation process is \n``going in the wrong direction'' and is potentially ``spiral[ing] out \nof control.'' Senator Schumer has also indicated that his goal is to \nrepair the ``broken'' judicial confirmation process and the ``vicious \ncycle'' of ``delayed'' Senate nominees.\n  The resolution submitted today sets forth a proposal that strikes a \nbalanced solution by allowing for ample, yet not endless, debate on \nnominations. It provides that cloture may be filed only after a \nnomination has been pending before the Senate for a minimum of 12 \nhours. Sixty votes are required to invoke cloture on the first motion. \nAfter that, the number of required votes on successive cloture motions \nwould decrease to 57, then to 54, then finally to a simple majority of \nSenators present and voting. A successive cloture motion cannot be \nfiled until disposition of the prior cloture motion, thereby ensuring \nthat a nomination cannot be confirmed by a simple majority vote until a \nminimum of 13 session days have elapsed.\n  This proposal has its roots in S. Res. 85, which was submitted by \nSenator Miller on March 13 of this year. In addition, it is similar to \na 1995 proposal of Senator Harkin and Senator Lieberman, which also \nprovided for graduated vote requirements to invoke cloture. In support \nof their proposal, Senator Harkin stated, ``I may not agree with \neverything that Republicans are proposing, but they are in the majority \nand they ought to have the right to have us vote on the merits of what \nthey propose.'' With regard to judicial nominations, I could not agree \nmore.\n\n  Senator Harkin also cited the research of a bipartisan group named \n``Action Not Gridlock,'' which commissioned a poll in the summer of \n1994 showing that ``80-percent of independents, 74-percent of \nDemocrats, and 79-percent of Republicans said that when enough time was \nconsumed in debate, that after debate a majority ought to be able to \nget the bill to the floor. That a majority ought to be able, at some \npoint, to end the debate.'' I would be surprised if a similar poll \ntoday would yield substantially different results. I think that the \nAmerican people understand the fundamental injustice of a minority's \nability to block an up-or-down vote on nominations.\n  In support of their 1995 proposal, Senator Lieberman stated, ``Some \nsay there is a danger of a tyranny of the majority. I say that there is \na danger inherent in the current procedure of a tyranny of the minority \nover the majority, inconsistent with the intention of the Framers of \nthe Constitution.'' Today, the ``tyranny of the minority'' to which \nSenator Lieberman referred over 8 years ago is in effect and wielding \nthe filibuster in a most unjust manner against President Bush's \nexceptional nominees who have bipartisan support. I support today's \nresolution because it will dilute the tyrannical power of the \nfilibusters against these nominees.\n  I have alluded to my frustrations with the current filibusters of \nPresident Bush's nominations. But the bottom line is this: many of us \nagree that we must try to repair the broken confirmation process. A \nbipartisan majority of Senators stands ready to vote on the two \nnominees who are currently being filibustered.

Res. 140\n\n       Whereas community, migrant, public housing, and homeless \n     health centers are nonprofit, community owned and operated \n     health providers and are vital to the Nation's communities;\n       Whereas there are more than 1,000 such health centers \n     serving 13,000,000 people at more than 4,000 health delivery \n     sites, in urban and rural communities in all 50 States, the \n     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin \n     Islands;\n       Whereas such health centers have provided cost-effective, \n     high-quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \n     underserved (including the working poor, the uninsured, and \n     many high-risk and vulnerable populations), acting as a vital \n     safety net in the Nation's health delivery system by meeting \n     escalating health needs and reducing health disparities;\n       Whereas these health centers provide care to 1 of every 5 \n     low-income babies born in America, 1 of every 8 uninsured \n     individuals, 1 of every 9 medicaid beneficiaries, 1 of every \n     9 people of color, and 1 of every 10 rural Americans, and \n     these Americans would otherwise lack access to health care;\n       Whereas these health centers and other innovative programs \n     in primary and preventive care reach out to almost 750,000 \n     homeless persons and nearly 850,000 farmworkers;\n       Whereas these health centers make health care responsive \n     and cost-effective by integrating the delivery of primary \n     care with aggressive outreach, patient education, \n     translation, and enabling support services;\n       Whereas these health centers have increased the use of \n     preventive health services such as immunizations, Pap smears, \n     mammograms, and glaucoma screenings;\n       Whereas in communities served by these health centers, \n     infant mortality rates have been reduced between 10 and 40 \n     percent;\n       Whereas these health centers are built by community \n     initiative;\n       Whereas Federal grants provide seed money that empowers \n     communities to find partners and resources, and to recruit \n     doctors and needed health professionals;\n       Whereas Federal grants on average contribute 25 percent of \n     a health center's budget, with the remainder provided by \n     State and local governments, medicare, medicaid, private \n     contributions, private insurance, and patient fees;\n       Whereas these health centers are community oriented and \n     patient focused;\n       Whereas these health centers tailor their services to fit \n     the special needs and priorities of communities, and work \n     together with schools, businesses, churches, community \n     organizations, foundations, and State and local governments;\n       Whereas these health centers contribute to the health and \n     well-being of their communities by keeping children healthy \n     and in school, and helping adults remain productive and on \n     the job;\n       Whereas these health centers engage citizen participation \n     and provide jobs for 60,000 community residents; and\n       Whereas the designation of the week of August 10, 2003, as \n     ``National Health Center Week'' would raise awareness of the \n     health services provided by health centers: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of August 10, 2003, as ``National \n     Health Center Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \ndeclaring the week of August 10, 2003, as a National Health Center Week \ndedicated to raising awareness of health services provided by \ncommunity, migrant, public housing, and homeless health centers. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by 17 of my colleagues.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that these health \ncenters contribute to the health and well-being of their communities by \nkeeping children healthy and in school and helping adults remain \nproductive and on the job.\n  The resolution also recognizes health centers for providing cost-\neffective, high-quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \nunderserved and by acting as a vital safety net in the Nation's health \ndelivery system. These non-profit, community based centers are \nperforming a vital service to our country's more vulnerable populations \nand they are to be commended for their efforts.\n  Health centers throughout the country have a 30-year history of \nsuccess. Studies continue to show that the centers effectively and \nefficiently improve our Nation's health.\n  Over the past 2 years, the number of patients seen by community \nhealth centers in my state of Colorado has increased 20.8 percent and \nthe number of visits provided has increased by 26 percent over the same \nperiod. Of the patients seen in Colorado in 2002, 48 percent had no \nhealth insurance, 26 percent were Medicaid recipients and 94 percent \nhad family incomes less than $36,200 a year for a family of four. \nCommunity health centers are truly America's healthcare safety net.\n  I believe it is important that we support and honor this nation-wide \nnetwork of community based providers. That is why I urge my colleagues \nto act quickly on this legislation. Let's show our community health \ncenter network that we value its significant contribution to the health \nof our citizens by declaring the week of August 10, 2003, a National \nHealth Center Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S6004-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 539.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF MTBE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in \n     this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low \n     levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or \n     anti-knocking agent;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     established a fuel oxygenate standard under which \n     reformulated gasoline must contain at least 2 percent oxygen \n     by weight;\n       (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygenate \n     standard, Congress was aware that--\n       (A) significant use of MTBE could result from the adoption \n     of that standard; and\n       (B) the use of MTBE would likely be important to the cost-\n     effective implementation of that standard;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and\n       (C) to maintain the environmental performance of \n     reformulated gasoline;\n       (11) Congress has--\n       (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in gasoline; \n     and\n       (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel additive;\n       (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel \n     additive must be established in a manner that achieves an \n     appropriate balance among the goals of--\n       (A) environmental protection;\n       (B) adequate energy supply; and\n       (C) reasonable fuel prices; and\n       (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited \n     transition assistance--\n       (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE in \n     response to a market created by the oxygenate requirement \n     contained in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n       (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply problems \n     that may result from elimination of a widely-used fuel \n     additive.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate; and\n       (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in \n     making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other \n     fuel additives.\n       (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--\n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after \n     ``Administrator any'';

Madam President, for the information of all Senators, on \nMonday the Senate will begin consideration of the reconciliation bill. \nThe bill was passed out of the Finance Committee last evening. The \nSenate will debate the jobs and economic growth package for up to 2 \nhours on Monday. However, we will not be considering amendments on that \nday. Therefore, as announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes \non Monday.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate will begin consideration of amendments, and \ntherefore Senators may expect rollcall votes. I anticipate that the \nfirst vote on Tuesday will occur at approximately 12 noon. That vote \nmay be in relation to an amendment to the reconciliation bill, or \nperhaps any executive matter that can be cleared.\n  Throughout next week, as I said in the opening this morning, we will \nhave busy sessions. I will share with my colleagues the importance of \naddressing three major issues, all of which have to be addressed next \nweek.\n  We have the jobs and economic growth bill, which we will begin \nMonday; and at that point we have certain time limits we will be \ndealing with on Monday and Tuesday and, likely, into Wednesday.\n  Next week, we will also be considering the bipartisan global HIV/AIDS \nbill, a bill that is very important to this country, and \ninternationally, as we look at the ravages of this virus, as well as \nthe debt limit legislation--legislation about which we have had \ndiscussions on both sides of the aisle, and we have agreed that it \nneeds to be dealt with soon and in a timely manner.\n  In order for the Senate to complete action on these measures, late \nnights next week are likely. Rollcall votes should be expected \nthroughout the week, including throughout Friday. Again, I mentioned \nthis morning that if we work efficiently during the week, I think we \ncan finish Friday afternoon. If not, there is a chance we will have to \ngo into the weekend. I mention that because I know, as the week goes \nforward, I will be hearing about scheduling conflicts. I want my \ncolleagues to know upfront that we need to address these important \nissues. If we cannot do it in a timely way, we may have to go into \nSaturday.\n  I have no further announcements to make at this time. I will be \nmaking further announcements next week regarding specifics of the \nschedule as we progress on the items I have mentioned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/09/senate-section/article/S6011-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2 P.M.
