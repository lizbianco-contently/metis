Mr. President, we have an opportunity this week, as we \ndo every year, to celebrate American agriculture. This is the week we \ntraditionally recognize. It is called National Agriculture Week.\n  Ask any friend or neighbor what is eating them and you are likely to \nget an earful about rising gas prices, military action in Iraq, the \nhigh cost of health care, prescription drugs, or the downturn in the \nU.S. economy.\n  In my most recent town meetings, I listened to Iowans express anxiety \nabout job security, retirement security, health care security, energy \nsecurity, national security, and homeland security. But never once did \nI have a single person in my State list as one of their concerns the \nconcern of food security. That is because we in the United States are \nblessed with a rich agricultural bounty to provide more than enough \nfood to feed U.S. consumers and a growing world population. American \nfarmers are the most productive food producers in the world and, as a \nresult, each American farmer can feed more than 120 people at home and \nabroad.\n  That is reason enough to give Americans an extra peace of mind. Yet I \nguess a majority of Americans take their food and how it got to their \nfork somewhat for granted. That is, in fact, a shame.\n  American agriculture serves an instrumental role in the life of every \nAmerican. As George W. Bush has noted:\n\n       A nation that can feed its people is a nation more secure.\n\n  Beyond the benefits to national security, American agriculture also \nanchors the economy because the production of food and fiber from the \nfarm to the consumer represents one-fifth of the U.S. economic pie. It \nprops up our balance of trade. Agricultural exports exceed $1 billion \nper week. It creates jobs. Twenty percent of America's workforce is \nemployed in the food chain from production to processing, marketing, \nand retailing. It saves the American consumer money because each \nAmerican consumer spends only 9 percent of their income on food, the \nlowest percentage in the world.\n\n  Every year in March those of us with interests in agriculture join \nforces to celebrate National Agriculture Week and spread the word about \nagriculture's affordable, high-quality abundance and its social, \neconomic, and environmental influences on America.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  Located in the heart of America's breadbasket, Iowa's agricultural \nheritage goes back many generations. Iowans appreciate how significant \nour food system is, not only to basic human existence, but to the \nState's economy and also to our way of life.\n  As the leading producer of corn, soybeans, hogs, and eggs in America, \nIowa's high-quality agricultural bounty would make George Washington \nproud. The farmer and our first President, George Washington, once \nsaid:\n\n       Agriculture is the most healthful, most useful, and most \n     noble employment to man.\n\n  At the turn of the 21st century, Iowa is working to stay on the \nleading edge of the research and use its bounty to benefit \nbiotechnology and advances in life science. Whether growing crops for \npharmaceutical use or raising cattle capable of producing proteins that \ncan be used for human drug therapies, Iowa has significant potential to \ncreate good, high-paying jobs and reap economic benefits in ways \nunimaginable at the turn of the last century when the production of \nfood was all that was on farmers' minds.\n  With several farmer-owned ethanol plants up and running, Iowa also is \nfueling local economic activity and helping to increase our energy \nindependence by turning home-grown corn into ethanol, lessening our \ndependence upon a foreign source such as Iraq, for instance.\n  As a life-long family farmer, I take advantage of every opportunity \nin Washington, DC, in Congress, like now in this Senate Chamber, to \nserve as a farmer's advocate because I want to make sure that family \nfarmers' voices are heard at the policy tables in Washington. \nNotwithstanding the need to keep our food production and supply system \nsafe from sabotage, Americans are blessed to live in a Nation where \nfood security does not mean wondering if there is enough food available \nto feed one's family every day.\n  National Agriculture Week, March 16 to 22, is a good opportunity to \nshowcase American agriculture and to give thanks to those who work hard \nto get high quality, affordable food from the farm to our table. I hope \nevery one of those people living in urban America who might think that \nfood grows in super markets rather than on farms would give a thought \nto the usefulness of the family farm and what it contributes to the \nquality of life of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first want to commend the Senator for \nhis eloquent statement. I think it is always important to remind \nAmericans, no matter where they live, of the productivity of American \nagriculture and the importance, particularly, of our family farmers. \nThere is no one who is a greater advocate for America's farmers than \nthe Senator from Iowa. So I am very pleased to have had the privilege \nof hearing his comments today.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of the \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3766-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POST-BALANCED BUDGET ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to discuss the upcoming budget \nresolution and its impact on home health agencies. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in \nhome health care have totaled more than $72 billion between fiscal \nyears 1998 and 2002. This is more than four times the $16 billion that \nCBO originally estimated for that time period and it is a clear \nindication that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far deeper \nthan Congress ever intended.\n  As a consequence of these reductions, cost-efficient home health \nagencies across the country have experienced acute financial \ndifficulties and cashflow problems which have inhibited their ability \nto deliver vital care. Home health spending has been cut in half since \n1997. More than 3,400 home health care agencies have either closed \ntheir doors or stopped serving Medicare patients. Moreover, the number \nof Medicare patients receiving home health care nationwide has dropped \nby 1.3 million, more than a third. This points out the most central and \ncritical issue: Cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be sustained \nwithout ultimately affecting patient care, without ultimately \ndiminishing the provision of care to some of the most vulnerable \ncitizens in our Nation.\n  It, therefore, is my intent to offer an amendment to the budget \nresolution this week calling on the Senate to stabilize and promote \nfairness in Medicare home health reimbursements by avoiding further \ncuts in home health spending, preserving the full market basket update, \nand restoring funding for this important benefit, including the \nextension of the 10 percent rural add-on reimbursement I have discussed \ntoday. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this \namendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will make a few comments in morning \nbusiness. I agree with the Senator from Maine. As cochairman of the \nRural Health Caucus in the Senate, we have been working for a very long \ntime and will continue to work for equity payments between urban and \nrural areas. In this instance, in-home health care costs are often \nhigher in rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3766-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3766-S3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT REFORM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will talk a moment about an issue that \nhas been important to Wyoming and to the entire country. As in many \ncases, the things we do here and the national laws we pass have \ndifferent effects in different places. Wyoming, being a rather large \nState, a rural State, is 50 percent owned by the Federal Government. \nWhen we talk about endangered species, the program works much \ndifferently than it does in Delaware. There needs to be a certain \namount of flexibility, as is the case with many things we do.\n  I am for endangered species acts. It is proper we have programs that \nprotect various endangered species, whether they be plants or animals. \nThat should continue. However, we have been in this program now since \nabout 1970 and there are, from our experience, changes we ought to \nconsider. I am convinced this program needs some kind of change.\n  Unfortunately, the results we have had are not the kind of results we \nintended. There has been a large amount of listing of endangered \nspecies but very little recovery. Of course, the purpose, the bottom \nline, is intended to protect special species and to recover them so \nthey are self-supporting. We are hopeful we can strengthen the program \nto some degree so we can emphasize the recovery rather than simply the \nlisting. The listing has an impact, particularly where there are \ninterspersed private and public lands. What is done in public lands \naffects those on private lands.\n  Because of the way lands were developed in the West with the \nHomestead Act, part of the lands were homesteaded and are now private. \nThose that were public are used by those folks with leases and they \nintermingle. It is an overlapping issue.\n  We have had several experiences in our State and particularly with \nthe States surrounding Yellowstone Park--Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming--\nparticularly with grizzly bears. Everyone recognizes the importance and \nwants to maintain the grizzly bear. They were developed in the park to \nrefurbish them. We have long since, several years ago, surpassed the \nnumbers in the plan for total recovery numbers, but they are still not \nde-listed; they are still listed and treated as endangered because we \ncannot come together on what the range ought to be. We cannot figure it \nout to get them de-listed.\n\n  The same thing is true with wolves. We have wolves that were there \nyears ago and they left. The Park Service reimported them from Canada \nand put them in Yellowstone Park. We knew they would not stay in \nYellowstone Park and, of course, they did not. We have the same sort of \nproblem with a predatory animal that is now in Wyoming, Montana, and \nIdaho, and it is managed as an endangered species. For people who have \nproperty at risk, sometimes even humans at risk, there is not much that \ncan be done as long as these critters are endangered.\n  We seek to get a plan so they can be endangered in Yellowstone Park, \nbut the States surrounding can have a plan to manage the animals so \nthere is some\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\ncontrol. We need to shift it. Under the program that very seldom \nhappens.\n  This program has been around for about 30 years. Most people would be \nsurprised to know there has been over 1,000 animal species and 750 \nplant species that have been listed under the act. There have been only \nabout 15 animals recovered. The emphasis has been on the listing, and \ncontinuing to be listed, rather than to find a way to get them \nrecovered, which is what it is all about.\n  My bill would continue to have the program and would strengthen the \nprogram rather than weaken it. It did two fairly basic things. One, it \nrequires in the listing process there be substantive and substantial \nscientific information. Animals can currently be listed easily by \nnomination, sometimes without sufficient documentation of the facts. \nThat is clear with the so-called jumping mouse in eastern Wyoming. \nAfter it was listed, no one could find evidence it was actually there. \nSo there really was not any scientific and useful evidence before being \nlisted. That ought to be changed.\n  In addition, when there is a listing, there has to be a plan for \nrecovery. So the range of the animal or plant is known. We know the \nnumbers, and when appropriate, they will be de-listed.\n  I introduced a bill now before the Congress. I hope we can take it up \nin the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senator Craig and \nSenator Hagel are currently cosponsors. We are circulating materials \nand have quite a bit of support. Interestingly enough, the group that \nwas in my office last week that represents shopping centers was very \nmuch in favor of this bill. I was pleased but surprised.\n  This impacts local land owners and public land managers and impacts \ncommunities and State governments particularly. We can make the program \nuseful but also workable for the people who live in the area.\n  We have listed over 1,800 species, including plants and animals, and \nthere have been only 15 recoveries. There is something wrong with that. \nWe need to look at that. Hopefully, we will have a chance to make some \nchanges in the committee and in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some pertinent \ninformation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Threatened and Endangered Species System \n      (TESS)--Listings by State and Territory as of March 4, 2003\n\n\n                                wyoming\n\n     Notes:\n       Displays one record per species or population.\n       Includes experimental populations and similarity of \n     appearance listings.\n       The range of a listed population does not extend beyond the \n     states in which that population is defined.\n       Includes non-testing sea turtles and whales in State/\n     Territory coastal waters.\n       Includes species or populations under the sole jurisdiction \n     of the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n     Animals--14\n       Bear, grizzly lower 48 States, except where listed as an \n     experimental population (Ursus arctos horribilis);\n       Crane, whooping (except where XN) (Grus americana);\n       Crane, whooping U.S.A.

Madam President, I appreciate the chance to speak for a \nfew minutes on the critical economic situation we are facing in the \nUnited States and the direct effect that low crude oil inventories, \ncombined with high energy prices, are having on the American economy. \nThis is a particularly important time to focus on this issue because of \nthe impending conflict with Iraq that we all are keenly aware of.\n  We have a situation today of constrained supply of crucial products \nand very high prices. We saw nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day \ncome off the market during the Venezuela crisis which began in \nDecember. This--combined with an unusually cold winter in the eastern \npart of the United States and refiners drawing down their crude oil \ninventories--has left crude oil and crude product markets extremely \ntight.\n  From a supply standpoint, we are operating on very thin margins. Any \naccident that unexpectedly shuts a refinery or interrupts flow through \na major pipeline is capable of producing real shocks in our supply of \nthese products. It has happened before. In 1996, a pipeline emergency \nblocked deliveries to refineries in the Midwest during a similar period \nof tight supplies. In the year 2000, a dock collapsed along the \nIntracoastal Waterway near Lake Charles, LA, curtailing supplies to two \nmajor gulf coast refineries.\n  The sharp increase in energy prices that we have seen so far this \nyear has caused a major problem for our economy. The Nation's \nmanufacturing sector continues to struggle. Consumers across America \nare faced with real hardships because of these high prices. Nearly all \nof the inflationary pressures that our economy is experiencing are \ncoming from increased energy costs, which jumped 4.8 percent in \nJanuary. They jumped an even sharper 7.4 percent in February--the \nlargest 1-month jump since 1990. Excluding increases in the food and \nenergy items, the core inflation index actually dropped 0.5 percent in \nFebruary, instead of rising as it did.\n  The simple truth of the matter is this. Rising energy prices are \nkeeping Americans from spending their hard-earned dollars elsewhere. \nGiven the current energy price environment, consumers are likely to pay \nmore than $200 billion in higher energy costs this year. This $200 \nbillion works out to be about 2 percent of our gross domestic product, \nwhich is no small item.\n  The obvious question we need to be asking is, Where does this money \ncome from? Companies are not hiring. In fact, they are laying people \noff.\n  A looming crisis that should worry all of us exists in the Nation's \nchemical industry. We are in danger of losing our domestic chemical \nindustry as high natural gas prices push it to operate offshore. That, \nof course, will result in the loss of thousands of more good, high-\npaying American jobs.\n  U.S. oil and natural gas stocks are dangerously low and the risk that \nenergy price spikes will continue to significantly damage our economy \nis a very real prospect.\n  Gasoline and diesel prices are at near decade highs. In fact, in my \nhome State of New Mexico and across the country, diesel prices are at \nan all-time high--$1.75 per gallon today.\n  High diesel prices have a direct impact on the trucking industry. \nThere was an article in the Albuquerque Journal this weekend that \ntalked about the impact of high energy prices on consumers and on the \ntrucking industry. I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In my home State, again, 12 percent of the State's \npopulation is estimated to be involved in the trucking industry. High \ndiesel prices are shutting down small trucking companies every day. \nThese are real economic effects. We are all well aware of the problems \nin the airline industry as well and the threatened bankruptcy of some \nof our major airlines; in part traceable to the high price of energy.\n  In our discussion of the current situation and use of the SPR, we \nhave used several phrases. One--``Likely to cause a major adverse \nimpact on the national economy. . . .''--that description matches very \nclosely the statutory provisions we wrote into the law when we created \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  As I read that statute and look around at what is happening, it is \nclear to me that the time has come to act on that statutory authority. \nI have repeatedly asked the administration to clearly state what its \npolicy is with regard to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and they have \nrefused to do so as\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nyet. It has become apparent from what has been said by the \nadministration that it is not likely to use the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve to correct this rapidly deteriorating situation. Rather, the \nadministration seems to be relying on OPEC to increase production and \nto send that production to our shores.\n\n  At their meeting last week, OPEC Ministers asserted that they would \nprovide additional supplies in the event that there is a war with Iraq, \nbut they also made it clear that those new supplies would be costly.\n  The administration appreciates the promise of the Saudis to raise \nproduction in the event of a shortage, and I appreciate that as well. \nSome Saudi oil, evidently, is already on its way to United States \nports. But the fact is, given the present situation, this is not \nenough. This is long-haul oil. We need oil in our system now to keep \nthe system functioning and prevent refineries from running on empty.\n  We have a timing problem. If war begins--and we all are well aware it \nmay begin at any time--Iraqi oil production and perhaps some Kuwaiti \nproduction will cease. This will cause a shortfall of somewhere between \n2 percent and 6 percent of the world oil supply. We seem to be assuming \nthat the Saudis can make up that difference, and it is possible that \nthey can. Some analysts estimate however that they are already \noperating at full capacity.\n  But let's suppose they can make it up. They still have to get that \noil here. It takes 40 days for an oil tanker to get here from the \nPersian Gulf, and we need to release oil from the SPR now in order to \nkeep liquidity in the system, to keep our refineries running, and to \nprevent further harm to our economy. If it takes 40 days for Persian \nGulf oil to reach our shores, and those tankers set sail perhaps 10 \ndays ago, there are still 30 days left before we will see any of that \noil.\n  The delivery process has started, but the extra oil is still far away \nat sea. We need liquidity in the system now, and I am saying the smart \nthing to do is to take out a little insurance policy to cover that \nperiod, from today until that oil can arrive.\n  I am urging the President to allow private companies to exchange up \nto 750,000 barrels of oil per day from the SPR, until this long-haul \ncrude from the Middle East reaches our ports. Companies taking part in \nthis swap that I am proposing would pay the Government a fee plus a \nfuture price differential for leasing the oil, and would replace the \noil with an equivalent grade of crude within 6 to 12 months.\n  This modest release would complement and not compete with the oil \nthat is headed this way. It would provide supply in a crucial time. I \nbelieve this swap drawdown could begin immediately and could continue \nuntil additional oil that OPEC producers have promised actually \narrives.\n  This 750,000 barrels-per-day swap is well-short of the 4.3 million \nbarrels-per-day of drawdown capacity we have within the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I understand President Bush does not want to release \nall of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as our Nation is on the brink of \nwar. But what I am proposing leaves nearly 85 percent of that total SPR \ndrawdown capacity untouched. We will be minimizing the damage to our \neconomy by putting these extra barrels out there into the system now, \nand we will be helping to prevent a gasoline supply shortage and \nfurther price spikes.\n  The U.S. refining sector already is functioning at minimum operating \nlevels. Without new crude supplies, refiners may be forced to reduce \nthose production levels, leading to higher gasoline, higher jet fuel, \nand higher diesel prices, and causing even more damage to our economy.\n  Our economic security is at stake. We cannot afford not to do this. \nThe American people also cannot afford for us not to do this. I urge \nthe administration to seriously consider this proposal. In my view, it \nis time for us to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Mar. 15, 2003]\n\n                        N.M. Gets Shock at Pump\n\n                           (By Diane Velasco)\n\n       ``It's just ridiculous,'' said Bill Andes of Albuquerque as \n     he pumped $1.69-a-gallon gasoline into his company car at a \n     Chevron station in the Northeast Heights.\n       Andes' reaction on Thursday evening was typical of many \n     motorists as gasoline prices spiraled to record levels in \n     Albuquerque, Las Cruces and statewide this week.\n       Andes doesn't pay personally for gasoline in his company \n     car, but his wife's Suburban has a 60-gallon tank.\n       ``$1.69 times 60--you do the math,'' he said.\n       Andes was paying the average statewide price of $1.69 a \n     gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, five cents higher than \n     a week earlier and a record. The previous record, set May 31, \n     2001, was $1.68 a gallon.\n       Albuquerque's average price per gallon was lower than the \n     statewide average. In Albuquerque, the price climbed 6 cents \n     to $1.66 a gallon for regular unleaded fuel, according to AAA \n     New Mexico's Weekend Gas Watch, which was released Friday. \n     The price tied a record set two years ago.\n       Santa Fe's average price rose 4 cents to $1.73 a gallon, \n     higher than the national average of $1.72 but still below the \n     city's record $1.75 set two years ago.\n       In Las Cruces, the average price climbed 3 cents last week \n     to $1.63 a gallon, tying that city's record.\n       Rising prices have caused Albuquerque resident Lorenzo \n     Gutierrez to think about parking his 1999 Dodge Ram pickup, \n     which he said gets just 11 miles a gallon, and buying a \n     motorcycle for daily use.\n       Nicole Monge used to spend $20 a week to fill her Toyota \n     Tacoma pickup. Now she spends $26.\n       ``The prices won't restrict my travel plans, but they will \n     restrict my spending money,'' she said.\n       It could be worse.\n       Some places around the country are seeing prices above $2 \n     per gallon.\n       Rising prices at the pumps are caused by the record-high \n     price of crude oil, said Bob Gallagher, president of the New \n     Mexico Oil and Gas Association.\n       At the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday, April crude \n     oil futures closed at $35.38 a barrel.\n       Crude now represents 50 percent of the cost of a gallon of \n     gasoline, up from its usual 25 percent, he said.\n       The crude oil price has risen by $7 to $10 per barrel \n     because of uncertainty about what will happen if the United \n     States goes to war with Iraq.\n       ``At this point, you have to start to become concerned that \n     (price increases) will impact the daily activities of \n     individuals as well as small and large businesses,'' \n     Gallagher said.\n       ``If daily activities are impacted, that will have a \n     negative impact on the economy because there will be less \n     money available to spend,'' he said. ``I am hopeful we are \n     all but topped out for the price of gasoline.''\n       High gasoline prices will hinder Yvonne Shije's 45-mile \n     trips from Zia Pueblo to Albuquerque. She will try to do all \n     of her shopping at once to eliminate extra trips, she said.\n       The world political situation is also making her a more \n     discerning consumer.\n       ``I don't want to be purchasing gas from particular \n     stations (whose companies) buy oil from Iraq,'' she said. \n     ``Why would you want to put money into their pockets when you \n     could buy American?''\n       Diesel prices are also at an all-time high--more than $1.75 \n     a gallon nationwide--said Vic Sheppard, managing director of \n     the New Mexico Trucking Association.\n       ``We see a lot of people just closing their doors in New \n     Mexico,'' he said. ``We hear daily of people just saying, `I \n     can't make it any more.' ''\n       About 86 percent of the state's trucking firms have six or \n     fewer trucks and are thus more vulnerable to price swings in \n     fuel, Sheppard said.\n       While Sheppard does not know how many jobs have been lost \n     in the industry since prices began spiraling, he estimates 12 \n     percent of the state's population is involved in trucking, \n     including warehousing and distribution.\n       Henry Pacheco, owner of Pacheco Trucking Co., is currently \n     charging his customers a 5 percent surcharge to cover rising \n     fuel costs. He said he plans to increase that to 7 percent \n     next week.\n       ``It's put a slowdown on us--I'm not getting as much \n     freight as I used to because I added the surcharge to my \n     rates,'' he said.\n       Although he is getting more calls, potential customers are \n     reluctant to pay the surcharge, Pacheco said.\n       His 20-year-old Pacheco Trucking Co. has 10 trucks and \n     employs as many as 14 drivers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3769-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3769-S3774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nspeak about the current situation in Iraq.\n  There has been a broad consensus that Saddam Hussein is a murderous \ntyrant and that the world is a more dangerous place if he has weapons \nof mass destruction. There has also been consensus that he has not \ncomplied with his obligations under the U.N. ceasefire resolution at \nthe end of the Gulf War and the numerous resolutions that followed, \nwhich called for him to disarm, particularly with respect to weapons of \nmass destruction. And\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\nthere has been consensus that the U.N. should enforce its resolutions \nmore forcefully than it had in recent years. This led to passage of \nU.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 which resulted in the resumption \nof weapons inspections by the U.N.\n  Now there is division at the U.N.\n  Many members of the United Nations want to complete the inspections \nand keep Saddam contained and in a box until those inspections are \ncompleted. Just a few days ago, the President said he would call for a \nvote at the U.N. Security Council to authorize the use of force so that \nevery member nation could state its position. The President has now \napparently reversed himself in the face of a likely rejection by the \nSecurity Council.\n  The issue, until yesterday, was whether to proceed militarily without \nthe support of the world community as expressed by the Security Council \nor, alternatively, to give the inspectors the months they said they \nneed to complete their work, the position which many members of the \nSecurity Council apparently favor.\n  The President has apparently chosen the former course. I have felt \nthat course was unwise for a number of reasons. By failing to rally the \nSecurity Council to a common view, we have lost the best chance to \nforce Saddam Hussein to capitulate because it is likely that only if \nSaddam Hussein sees a united world at the other end of the barrel will \nhe see no potential to turn the tide to his favor. A world solidly \nagainst him would be a world that an anti-U.S. propaganda machine would \nhave great trouble stirring up. Just as in the gulf war, Saddam was \nunable to score any propaganda points when 28 nations, including a \nnumber of Muslim nations, provided military forces against him.\n  Another reason I have felt that proceeding without the U.N. would be \nunwise is we would lose some support in the region, with the resulting \nloss of staging areas and overflight rights, as is apparently the case \nin Turkey, which, in turn, could increase the length of the war and the \nnumber of casualties.\n  There are also serious long-term risks in proceeding without support \nof the world community as expressed through the U.N. Such an attack on \nIraq would be viewed by much of the world as an attack by the West \nagainst an Islamic nation, rather than of the world against Saddam. We \nwould fuel the anti-Americanism that is already so prevalent, and stoke \nthe terrorism which is already our No. 1 threat.\n  Admiral Lowell Jacoby, the Director of the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February:\n\n       Much of the world is increasingly apprehensive about U.S. \n     power and influence. Many are concerned about the expansion, \n     consolidation, and dominance of American values, ideals, \n     culture, and institutions. Reactions to this sensitivity to \n     growing ``Americanization'' can range from mild ``chafing'' \n     on the part of our friends and allies, to fear and violent \n     rejection on the part of our adversaries. We should consider \n     that these perceptions mixed with angst over perceived ``U.S. \n     unilateralism'' will give rise to significant anti-American \n     behavior.\n\n  I have also felt that proceeding without the U.N. would make it less \nlikely that other nations will join us in the difficult tasks of \nproviding stability in reconstructing Iraq in the aftermath of the \nconflict. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan recently said the \nfollowing:\n\n       If they [the members of the U.N. Security Council] cannot \n     agree on a common position and if some of them launch action \n     without the support of the [Security] Council, the legitimacy \n     of this action will be widely questioned and it will not \n     obtain the political support required to ensure its success \n     in the long term, once the military phase is over.\n\n  The European Union's External Relations Commissioner, Chris Patten, \nlikewise pointed out recently that ``if it comes to war, it will be \nvery much easier'' to make a case for other countries to contribute to \nthe reconstruction of Iraq ``if there is no dispute about the \nlegitimacy of the military action that has taken place.''\n  Further, and of great significance, President Bush's principal basis \nfor launching a military action is Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1441 and other U.N. resolutions. But how is \nit credible to invoke the Security Council's resolutions as a basis for \nour action and then ignore that same Security Council if it does not \nagree with us on the wisdom of military action at this time and does \nnot give us the resolution we want?\n  Stressing the importance of a U.N. authorization does not give the \nU.N. a veto over American action. Nobody has a veto over America's \nforeign policy or decisionmaking. The decision is America's and \nAmerica's alone. The issue is not whether we need the U.N.'s permission \nto use force; we don't. The issue is whether it would be wise to have \nthe U.N.'s support and whether we will be more secure from terrorists \nand other threats if we initiate a military action against Iraq without \nthe support of the world community. If there were an imminent threat \nagainst us, we would not--and should not--hesitate to use force. But \nattacking in the absence of an immediate threat is a very different \nscenario with very different risks.\n  The President has said that the U.N. will become irrelevant if it \ndoes not authorize member states to use military force at this time \nagainst Iraq. But the Security Council's decision in this matter, \nwhichever way it would have gone, would have been highly relevant.\n  If the Security Council authorized force by member states, that would \nbe relevant as a statement of the world community against Saddam. But \nif the Security Council rejected authorizing force at this time, as \nthey apparently would have, it would still be relevant because our use \nof military force in the face of such a Security Council rejection \ncould have a worldwide negative political impact with great peril to \nus.\n  The issue is not whether we will prevail militarily without the \nU.N.'s support; we will. The issue is whether our long-term security \nwould be enhanced in that circumstance or whether chaos and instability \nin the Middle East, following our unilateral action, will be deep and \nlong and more costly, and whether the level of terrorism against us in \nthe world will rise to a higher point than it otherwise would.\n  The U.N. too often has been seen by the administration as an obstacle \nto overcome instead of an opportunity to rally the world. And the \nadministration has also weakened its case at the U.N. in a number of \nways.\n  It has used divisive rhetoric and denigrating attitude towards the \nviews of other nations whose support we seek. Countries have been told \n``you are either with us or against us.'' The U.N. has been told that \nwhile we welcome U.N. endorsement, we can do just fine without you. \nU.N. inspectors were called ``so-called'' inspectors. And before U.N. \ninspections even began, they were called useless. Germany and France \nwere sneered at as being part of ``old Europe.'' This kind of rhetoric \nalienates our friends and fuels the inflammatory propaganda of our \nenemies. Divisive and dismissive rhetoric is no way to rally the \nSecurity Council. It comes across as bullying and domineering.\n  The White House spokesmen have also spun facts in a transparent way, \ncontradicting themselves from day to day. The refusal of Iraq to assure \nthe safety of U-2 surveillance planes was at first called a serious \nbreach of resolution 1441. When agreement was reached between U.N. \ninspectors and Iraq to fly the planes shortly thereafter, the White \nHouse spokesman said the agreement was no big deal. Similarly, when the \ninspectors determined that Iraqi missiles violated U.N. resolutions \nlimiting their range, the White House pointed to the violation as \nsignificant evidence of noncompliance. When, soon thereafter, Iraq \nagreed to destroy those missiles, with U.N. inspectors looking on, the \nWhite House spokesman said that action was evidence of the Iraqis' \ndeception. That kind of spinning and reversal of field by White House \nspokesmen has not helped our credibility or our cause.\n\n  We will prevail militarily in Iraq on our own, albeit with increased \nrisk, but it will be more difficult to win the larger war on terrorism \nwithout the world community in our corner. We need the eyes and the \nears and the intelligence of the people of the world if we are going to \ndetect and ferret out, deter, and destroy those who care nothing for \ninternational law and do not even accept the rules of war.\n  Historically, America has been strongest when we found common cause \nwith other nations in pursuit of common goals. The path to a safer \nworld and a more secure America has\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nrarely come from a go-it-alone approach. Thomas Friedman wrote recently \nin the New York Times:\n\n       [I]f Mr. Bush acts unilaterally, I fear America will not \n     only lose the chance of building a more decent Iraq, but \n     something more important--America's efficacy as the strategic \n     and moral leader of the free world.\n\n  If war against Iraq comes, far better it be seen as the decision of \nthe world community, not just a U.S.-British decision.\n  The President said accurately on January 3 that Saddam Hussein has no \nrespect for the Security Council and does not care about the opinion of \nmankind. But surely we should.\n  President Bush has now decided to end the diplomatic effort. Those of \nus who have questioned the administration's approach, including this \nSenator, will now be rallying behind the men and women of our armed \nforces to give them the full support they deserve, as it seems certain \nwe will soon be at war.\n\n  Last October a majority of both Houses of Congress voted to authorize \nthe President to use military force with or without the authority of \nthe United Nations. While I disagreed with that decision and offered an \nalternative, the overriding fact is that this democracy functions \nthrough debate and decision. The decision to give the President wide \nauthority was democratically arrived at.\n  The courageous men and women whom we send into harm's way are not \njust carrying out their orders with bravery and the highest form of \nprofessionalism. They are also implementing the outcome of the \ndemocratic debate which this Nation protects and honors. Those men and \nwomen should know that they have the full support and the fervent \nprayers of all of the American people as they carry out their missions.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my recent remarks to \nthe Council on Foreign Relations and the Boston World Affairs Council, \nalong with two of my opening statements at recent Armed Services \nCommittee hearings, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Remarks of Senator Carl Levin, Chairman, Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, ``U.S. Policy Towards Iraq,'' Council on Foreign Relations, \n                            October 8, 2002\n\n       Thank you, Walt, for your kind introduction. I understand \n     that with the change in Administrations, you have returned to \n     your tax law practice. I think it was John Maynard Keynes who \n     remarked that ``The avoidance of taxes is the only \n     intellectual pursuit that carries any reward.'' We'll ask you \n     about the truth of that statement when I'm finished speaking \n     about U.S. policy towards Iraq!\n       I want to thank Les Gelb, the Council on Foreign Relations \n     President, and Pete Peterson, the Council's Chairman of the \n     Board, for inviting me this evening, and I want to thank the \n     Council for its 80 years of outstanding service to our Nation \n     and to the world as the ``privileged and preeminent \n     nongovernmental impresario of America's pageant to find its \n     place in the world.'' Those are the ``objective'' words of \n     Les Gelb, by the way.\n       Last night, President Bush described in detail the threat \n     that Saddam Hussein's regime poses. I have relatively few \n     differences with that description, and there is also a \n     consensus that if Saddam Hussein continues to refuse to meet \n     his obligation to destroy his weapons of mass destruction and \n     prohibited missile delivery systems, the United Nations \n     should authorize member states to use military force to \n     destroy those weapons and systems and that the United States \n     Armed Forces should participate in and lead a United Nations \n     authorized force.\n       So the issue that is in dispute is whether unilateral force \n     should be authorized by Congress now in case the U.N. does \n     not act. How we answer that question could have a profound \n     and lasting impact on the safety of our children and \n     grandchildren for decades to come. Because the difference \n     between attacking a nation with the support of the world \n     community or attacking it without such support is \n     fundamental, and it can be decisive.\n       The President answers the question by seeking a resolution \n     from Congress that gives him the authority to use force under \n     the auspices of the United Nations or to go-it-alone if the \n     United Nations fails to act. He seeks this unilateral \n     authority even though he does not condition its use on the \n     threat to the United States by Saddam being imminent. Indeed, \n     he argued in the National Security Strategy that was released \n     by the White House last month that preemptive attacks to \n     forestall or prevent hostile acts by our adversaries can now \n     be undertaken although a threat is not imminent. The new \n     strategy states explicitly that ``We must adapt the concept \n     of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of \n     today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not seek \n     to attack us using conventional means.'' The President's Iraq \n     resolution and the National Security Strategy, therefore, \n     both take the position that an ``imminent'' threat is no \n     longer required as a basis for our military action in self-\n     defense. The President is explicitly seeking to modify the \n     traditional concept of preemption by deleting the need for \n     ``imminence'' and substituting that of ``sufficient'' \n     threat in the Strategy and ``continuing'' threat in the \n     proposed resolution.\n       That the President is seeking the authorization for \n     unilateral preemptive attack without U.N. authorization is at \n     the heart of the Senate debate that is presently taking \n     place, and the vote on that resolution will come soon.\n       Under the traditional international law concept of \n     preemption in self-defense, the United States would be \n     justified in acting alone in the case of a serious threat to \n     our nation that is imminent. In a case where such a threat is \n     not imminent, military action would be justified only if it \n     were carried out pursuant to an authorization for the use of \n     force by Member states by the United Nations.\n       The choice facing the Senate is whether Congress should \n     now--at this time--give the President the authority to ``go-\n     it-alone,'' to act unilaterally against Iraq if the United \n     Nations fails to act. Congress is being presented with this \n     issue at the very same time our Secretary of State is trying \n     to get the United Nations to back a tough new resolution \n     authorizing member states to use military force to enforce \n     Iraqi compliance with inspections and disarmament.\n       Last night the President said, ``I have asked Congress to \n     authorize the use of America's military if it proves \n     necessary to enforce U.N. Security Council demands.'' But, \n     the White House resolution asks for much more. It isn't \n     limited to the use of force if the United Nations authorizes \n     it; on the contrary, it specifically authorizes, now, the use \n     of force on a unilateral, ``go-it-alone'' basis, that is, \n     without Security Council authorization. The President's \n     rhetoric doesn't match the resolution. Moreover, the White \n     House approach authorizes the use of force beyond dealing \n     with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of \n     delivery.\n       The resolution I introduced is consistent with how I think \n     most Americans want us to proceed. It emphasizes the \n     importance of dealing with Iraq on a multilateral basis and \n     it withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether \n     the United States should ``go it alone,'' that is, should act \n     unilaterally against Iraq, if the United Nations fails to \n     act.\n       My resolution does the following: First, it urges the U.N. \n     Security Council to adopt a resolution promptly that demands \n     unconditional access for U.N. inspectors so Iraq's weapons of \n     mass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles may be \n     located and destroyed; and within that same U.N. resolution, \n     authorizes the use of necessary and appropriate force by U.N. \n     Member States as a means of enforcement in the event Iraq \n     refuses to comply.\n       My resolution also specifically authorizes the use of the \n     United States Armed Forces, pursuant to that U.N. Security \n     Council resolution, if Iraq fails to comply with its terms \n     and the President informs the Congress of his determination \n     that the United States has used appropriate diplomatic and \n     other peaceful means to obtain Iraqi compliance with such a \n     U.N. resolution.\n       My resolution affirms that under international law and the \n     U.N. Charter, especially Article 51, the United States has at \n     all times the inherent right to use military force in self-\n     defense, affirming the fact there is no U.N. veto over U.S. \n     military action. It also affirms that Congress will not \n     adjourn sine die so that Congress can return to session, if \n     necessary, and promptly consider proposals relative to Iraq \n     if, in the judgment of the President, the U.N. Security \n     Council does not promptly adopt the resolution I described \n     above.\n       My resolution, therefore, supports the President's appeal \n     to the United Nations and approves--right now--the use of our \n     Armed Forces to support the action of the United Nations to \n     force compliance by Saddam Hussein with inspections and \n     disarmament. It does not, however, authorize now--before we \n     know what the United Nations intends to do, before we know \n     whether or not we have the world community on our side--it \n     does not authorize the United States Armed Forces going-it-\n     alone. Should we need to consider that possibility at a \n     future time, the resolution provides for the immediate recall \n     of Congress to do so. My resolution doesn't--on a matter of \n     war and peace/life and death--exceed the grant of authority \n     needed at the present time.\n       If Congress instead endorses the resolution proposed in the \n     Senate by Senator Lieberman and others allowing the \n     unilateral use of force at this time--even in the absence of \n     a U.N. authorization--we will be sending an inconsistent \n     message. We will be telling the United Nations that, if you \n     don't act, we will--at the same time that we are urging them \n     to act. We will be telling the United Nations that they are \n     not particularly relevant--at the same time we are urging \n     them to be very relevant.\n       If we want the United Nations to be relevant and credible--\n     if we want the United Nations to succeed--if we want the \n     United Nations not to be limited to humanitarian and disaster \n     relief and other tasks that are\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\n     mighty useful but are not essential--and I think most of us \n     do--then we have to focus our efforts there and give those \n     efforts a chance to succeed.\n       If we act wisely--authorizing the use of our forces \n     pursuant to a U.N. resolution authorizing Member states to \n     use force--we will not only unite the Congress; ultimately, \n     we would unite the world community, on a course of action \n     that we all seek: the elimination of Saddam Hussein's ability \n     to threaten the world with weapons of mass destruction. \n     That's where our focus should be: uniting the world, not \n     dividing it.\n       Moreover, a go-it-alone approach in which we attack Iraq \n     without the support and participation of the world community \n     entails serious risks and could have serious consequences for \n     us in the Middle East and around the world. It makes a \n     difference, when deciding to use force, whether that use of \n     force has the support of the world community.\n       It makes a difference for us in the current situation \n     involving a possible attack on Iraq:\n       If we go it alone, will we be able to secure the use of \n     airbases, ports, supply bases, and overflight rights in that \n     region? Those rights and those capabilities are so \n     important to the success of a military operation against \n     Saddam.\n       If we go it alone, will there be a reduction in the broad \n     international support for the war on terrorism, including the \n     law enforcement, financial, and intelligence cooperation that \n     is so essential?\n       If we go it alone, will that destabilize an already \n     volatile region and undermine governments such as Jordan and \n     Pakistan? Could we possibly end up with a radical regime in \n     Pakistan, a country that has nuclear weapons?\n       If we go it alone, will Saddam Hussein or his military \n     commanders be more likely to use weapons of mass destruction \n     against other nations in the region and against our military \n     forces in response to our attack than would be the case if he \n     faced a U.N.-authorized coalition, particularly if that \n     coalition included Muslim nations as the coalition did during \n     the Gulf War?\n       If we go it alone, will other nations view our action as a \n     precedent for threatening unilateral military action against \n     their neighbors in the future?\n       If we go it alone, will we be undercutting efforts to get \n     other countries to help us with the expensive, lengthy task \n     of stabilizing Iraq after Saddam is removed?\n       Beyond the current situation relative to using force in \n     Iraq, going-it-alone without U.N. authorization, based on a \n     modified concept of preemption that no longer requires the \n     threat to be imminent, will lead to a serious risk to \n     international peace and security.\n       If we act unilaterally, without U.N. authority or an \n     imminent threat, that will create a dangerous situation for \n     international peace and stability in the long term. We would \n     be inviting other nations to forego an important rule of \n     international law requiring a serious and imminent threat \n     before one nation can attack another in the name of self \n     defense.\n       By seeking a U.N. resolution that will authorize U.N. \n     Member States to use force if Iraq does not comply with its \n     terms, we are not giving the United Nations a veto over the \n     conduct of our foreign policy. Rather, we are getting from \n     the United Nations strength and international credibility and \n     legitimacy, should military force be needed.\n       We should be seeking to unite the world against Saddam \n     Hussein, not dividing it. Our immediate objective should be \n     to get the United Nations to act--to locate and destroy \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the means of \n     delivering them. The threat Saddam presents is real, and we \n     should deal with it. But authorization for preemptive, \n     unilateral U.S. action in Iraq does not need to and should \n     not be granted at this time. If the U.N. doesn't act, \n     Congress can be called back promptly to consider a request to \n     authorize force unilaterally and to consider the serious and \n     different risks involved in pursuing that course at that \n     time.\n       Last Monday's Washington Post carried a story in which a \n     senior European official's response to the United States \n     going-it-alone was, ``A lot of Europeans would feel they'd \n     been put in an intolerable position.'' For those who would \n     agree to participate militarily, ``it would be less a \n     coalition of the willing than of the dragooned.''\n       Javier Solana, former NATO Secretary General and currently \n     High Representative for the European Union's Common Foreign \n     and Security Policy, the EU's top foreign policy official, in \n     an address at NATO Headquarters last Thursday, stated ``Ad \n     hoc coalitions of docile followers to be chosen or discarded \n     at will is neither attractive nor sustainable.''\n       Just last week, after hearing from Prime Minister Blair and \n     Foreign Minister Straw, the ruling Labor Party's Conference \n     issued a formal position on Iraq that included the following: \n     ``Conference believes that the authority of the U.N. will be \n     undermined unless it is enforced, and recognises that in the \n     last resort this could involve military action but considers \n     that this should be taken within the context of international \n     law and with the authority of the U.N.''\n       And just last Friday, Turkey's presidential spokesman said \n     that his nation would participate in a campaign against Iraq \n     only if the world body blessed it, stating ``An operation not \n     based on international law cannot be accepted.''\n       The best chance of having Saddam Hussein comply with U.N. \n     Security Council resolutions is to make sure that when he \n     looks down the barrel of a gun, he sees the world at the \n     other end, and not just the United States.\n       Congress should give the President what he said last night \n     he was asking for--the authority to use U.S. military force \n     to enforce U.N. Security Council demands, not what the White \n     House resolution also provides--go-it-alone authority. Our \n     focus then would be where it belongs: securing a United \n     Nations resolution that can unite the world; that has the \n     best chance of forcing compliance; that reduces the risk to \n     our forces and to our interests throughout the world; that \n     avoids to the maximum extent possible the negative \n     consequences if force is required, including the loss of \n     cooperation on the war on terrorism; and that has the best \n     chance of isolating Saddam Hussein rather than isolating the \n     United States.\n       Thank you for listening. That concludes my remarks. I would \n     be happy to answer your questions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Senator Carl Levin's Remarks to the Boston World Affairs Council \n       Regarding the Christian A. Herter Award, December 2, 2002\n\n       Thank you for honoring me with this prestigious award.\n       The past recipients of the Christian A. Herter Award are a \n     distinguished group of people who have made significant \n     contributions to better understanding among nations, and I am \n     honored to be included in this group.\n       It is a particular pleasure to be receiving this award with \n     Dick Lugar, who will become the Chairman of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee in January. No member of the \n     Senate is better qualified for this important position than \n     Dick. He is a true internationalist who enjoys the confidence \n     of both Senate Democrats and Republicans, as well as the \n     respect of foreign leaders and parliamentarians around the \n     world.\n       A Senator from Michigan can't talk about the importance of \n     national consensus and bipartisanship in America's foreign \n     policy without recalling the career of Arthur Vandenburg, who \n     was an ardent champion of a bipartisan American foreign \n     policy. Senator Vandenberg helped draft the 1945 United \n     Nations Charter and steered its passage through the Senate. \n     He later played a leading role in constructing the Marshall \n     Plan and in the formulation of NATO. Over the years, his name \n     has become synonymous with the expression that ``politics end \n     at the water's edge.''\n       That expression is a good one to keep in mind in the weeks \n     after a hard-fought mid-term election and a lengthy debate in \n     Congress over U.S. policy in Iraq. Both these events revealed \n     differences over foreign policy between Democrats and \n     Republicans, and even in some cases among Democrats and \n     Republicans.\n       For the most part, Democrats and Republicans will be in \n     agreement on a foreign policy agenda in the coming year.\n       We agree on the need to continue an all-out effort against \n     al Qaeda and other international terrorist groups.\n       We agree on the need to follow to the finish the effort to \n     disarm Saddam Hussein, especially if the multilateral path \n     that the President started at the United Nations is followed.\n       We agree on the need to deal with the problem presented by \n     North Korea's recently acknowledged nuclear weapons program, \n     working calmly and determinedly with South Korea, Japan and \n     others.\n       We agree on the need to strengthen the authority of the \n     central government in Afghanistan.\n       We agree on the need to combat the proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, a goal to which Dick Lugar has \n     contributed so much by creating the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction Program.\n       We agree on the value of expanding NATO and modernizing its \n     mission and operations.\n       But leaving politics at the water's edge doesn't mean that \n     there won't be differences over foreign policy. While a \n     bipartisan foreign policy is important for both domestic and \n     international purposes, it is healthy--indeed essential at \n     times--for constructive alternative positions to be \n     expressed, as long as these alternatives are not prompted by \n     partisan motivations.\n       The Bush Administration's initial foreign policy positions \n     on a host of issues had a pronounced unilateral, and at \n     times, even an isolationist tone. Despite Candidate Bush's \n     call for humility on the part of the world's sole superpower, \n     President Bush too often ignored Candidate Bush's good \n     advice. For instance, his early statements on international \n     treaties and peacekeeping in the Balkans served to undercut \n     or offend even close Allies and, perhaps more importantly, \n     unnecessarily provoked feelings of hostility among the \n     peoples of many nations.\n       Constructive criticism of some of the Administration's \n     foreign policies and foreign policy statements over the past \n     year has had a positive impact on both the policies and the \n     rhetoric. That criticism came from within the Administration, \n     from members of Congress of both parties, from the media, and \n     from the leaders of allied and friendly nations.\n       For example, during the weeks leading up to the \n     Congressional vote on an authorization for the use of \n     military force against Iraq, many members of Congress sought\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\n     changes to the Administration's initial proposal. The \n     Administration, in essence, originally sought authority to \n     act unilaterally to bring about regime change in Iraq at a \n     time of the President's choosing.\n       Senator Lugar joined forces with Senator Biden to modify \n     the Administration's proposal to refocus the grant of \n     authority to use military force on Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction and on seeking a new U.N. Security Council \n     resolution authorizing the use of force.\n       I offered an alternative resolution, which was not adopted, \n     which was designed to give even greater importance to a \n     multilateral approach through the United Nations. It deferred \n     a Congressional decision on authorizing the unilateral use of \n     force until such time as the multilateral approach proved to \n     be beyond our reach. My alternative would have called on the \n     United Nations to promptly adopt a new resolution demanding \n     that Iraq provide immediate, unconditional and unrestricted \n     access to the U.N. weapons inspectors so its weapons of mass \n     destruction could be destroyed, authorizing the use of \n     military force by U.N. Member States to enforce the \n     resolution in the event that Iraq refused to comply. My \n     alternative would have authorized the President to use U.S. \n     military force to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n     pursuant to such a U.N. resolution, and would have provided \n     that Congress not adjourn so we could consider proposals \n     relative to the use of unilateral force if the U.N. Security \n     Council failed to adopt a resolution authorizing the use of \n     force by member states.\n       I have urged a multilateral approach to the Iraq threat \n     because I believe that approach has the greatest chance of \n     success. A multilateral approach reduces the risks involved \n     in military action and minimizes the fallout from vengeful, \n     violent retaliatory responses which often result if we're \n     perceived as a unilateral bully. The events of 9/11 made \n     clear that dealing with international terrorism must be our \n     first priority, but we can't effectively deal with \n     international terrorism without the political, law \n     enforcement, intelligence, and, at times, military assistance \n     and cooperation of the world community. That same \n     multilateral approach is essential to combating the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or to \n     dealing with the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear \n     program.\n       I believe the efforts of many within and without the \n     Administration had an impact on the course of action chosen \n     by the Administration and on the legislation on Iraq that was \n     enacted by Congress, which endorsed the multilateral approach \n     and conditioned the unilateral use of force on the President \n     certifying that diplomatic means will not succeed. I also \n     believe those efforts helped Secretary Powell to prevail, at \n     least temporarily, over other views within the Administration \n     during the painstaking negotiations that led to the unanimous \n     adoption of U.N. Security Council resolution 1441 on November \n     8th.\n       The U.N. resolution was a victory for those who favor a \n     multilateral approach to the use of force. It's great to be \n     the world's only superpower, and I hope it stays that way. \n     But I do not believe that our national interests are well \n     served when we engage in rhetoric that needlessly inflames \n     passions and incites hostility towards the United States and \n     its citizens. Teddy Roosevelt's soft rhetoric and big stick \n     approach was about the right balance.\n       We must be more than powerful; we must be wise in the use \n     of our power and wise in the use of our rhetoric. The United \n     States must be a leader, not a loner. Otherwise, we will turn \n     what has been admiration for our values and our beliefs into \n     fear of domination by us and hostility towards our apparent \n     arrogance.\n       Recently I was struck in reading an excerpt from Bob \n     Woodward's new book, ``Bush at War,'' in the Washington Post. \n     Woodward was reporting on an interview with the President, \n     and at the end which Laura Bush joined them. The President \n     had just told Woodward that the First Lady wished the \n     President's rhetoric wasn't quite so harsh about getting them \n     ``dead or alive.'' When the President asked her why, the \n     First Lady said, ``It just didn't sound that appealing to me, \n     really.'' The First Laey added that she tells the President \n     from time to time, ``Tone it down, darling,''\n       In the spirit of the Christian Herter award, I pledge to \n     work with others in the Congress to seek consensus in support \n     of the Administration's foreign policies whenever possible \n     and, when necessary, to support constructive alternatives \n     that I believe will better suit the interests of the United \n     States. And relative to the Administration's rhetoric, I also \n     will from time to time will urge them to ``tone it down, \n     darlings.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n Opening Statement of Senator Carl Levin, Hearing on Worldwide Threats \nWith George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence and Lowell Jacoby, \n       Defense Intelligence Agency, Wednesday, February 12, 2003\n\n       All of us want Saddam Hussein to be disarmed. The best way \n     to accomplish the goal of disarming Saddam Hussein without \n     war is if the United Nations speaks with one voice relative \n     to Iraq. I also believe that if military force is used, the \n     best way of reducing both the short-term risks, including the \n     risks to U.S. and coalition forces, and the long-term risks, \n     including the risk of terrorist attacks on our interests \n     throughout the world, is if the United Nations specifically \n     authorizes the use of military force.\n       That's the bottom line for me--the best way of increasing \n     any chance of disarming Saddam Hussein without war and of \n     minimizing casualties and future attacks on the United States \n     if war does ensue is if the United Nations acts relative to \n     Iraq.\n       Supporting U.N. inspections is an essential step if we are \n     going to keep the Security Council together. We can support \n     those U.N. inspections by sharing the balance of our \n     information about suspect sites, by quickly getting U-2 \n     aircraft in the air over Iraq, with or without Saddam \n     Hussein's approval, and by giving the inspectors the time \n     they need to do their work as long as the inspections are \n     unimpeded.\n       I disagree with those, including high officials in our \n     government, who say that U.N. inspections are useless. We \n     heard that before the inspections began. We heard it from Dr. \n     Rice at the White House last week. I am astounded that some \n     of those high officials have gone so far as to refer in a \n     derogatory way to the ``so-called'' U.N. inspectors. If these \n     inspections are useless without Iraqi assistance in pointing \n     out where they have hidden or destroyed weapons of mass \n     destruction, why are we sharing any intelligence at all with \n     the inspectors; and why are we apparently finally \n     implementing U-2 flights to support the inspectors?\n       It's one thing to be realistic about the limitations of the \n     U.N. inspections and not have too high hopes about what they \n     can produce.\n       It's another thing to denigrate their value, prejudge their \n     value, be dismissive and disdainful about the beliefs of \n     others on the U.N. Security Council about their value, and be \n     cavalier about the facts relative to those inspections.\n       Referring to being cavalier about facts brings me to my \n     next point, the sharing of intelligence information in our \n     possession with the U.N. inspectors.\n       This is an issue that I have followed very closely. For the \n     last several weeks, at my request, the CIA has been providing \n     me with the classified details of how much information we \n     have been sharing with the U.N. inspectors in Iraq. We just \n     began sharing specific information in early January, \n     according to Secretary Powell as quoted in the Washington \n     Post on January 9th. While I can't go into those classified \n     details in an open hearing, I can say that the information \n     the CIA has provided me made it very clear that we had shared \n     information on only a small percentage of the suspect sites \n     in Iraq and that we had not shared information on the \n     majority of the suspect sites, which was confirmed by CIA \n     staff.\n       At yesterday's hearing, I was astounded when Director Tenet \n     told us that we have now shared with U.N. inspectors \n     information about every site we have where we have credible \n     intelligence. Then, last night, in Director Tenet's presence \n     and in the presence of Senator Warner, his staff acknowledged \n     that we still have useful information that we have not shared \n     with the inspectors--which is the opposite of what Director \n     Tenet told the Intelligence Committee yesterday in open \n     session. If we haven't shared yet all the useful information \n     that we have with the U.N. inspectors, that would run counter \n     to the Administration's position that the time for \n     inspections is over.\n       When President Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly on \n     September 12th of last year, he said that ``We want the \n     United Nations to be effective, and respectful, and \n     successful. Well we have some responsibility to help the \n     United Nations achieve that. Saying to other countries, \n     including allies, that if you don't see it our way, you must \n     have some ulterior motive, doesn't help.\n       While a number of heads of State and Government have called \n     for the U.N. Security Council to take the necessary and \n     appropriate action in response to Iraq's continuing threat to \n     international peace and security and some have pledged to \n     contribute military forces to that effort, others believe \n     that we should give the strengthened inspections the time \n     they need to finish their job. Both groups agree on the \n     necessity of disarming Iraq. Rather than following a course \n     that divides the United Nations and separates us from some of \n     our closest allies, we should at least fairly consider \n     courses of action that unite the world community against \n     Iraq.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Opening Statement of Senator Carl Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on \n Armed Services Hearing with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and \n   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Richard B. Myers, Thursday, \n                           February 13, 2003\n\n       Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers, thank you for coming.\n       Mr. Chairman, as we meet today, America's Armed Forces \n     stand on the brink of possible military action. In the next \n     few weeks, as many as 250,000 of our soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen and marines will be in the Persian Gulf region, \n     preparing for a possible war against Iraq. Almost 40,000 more \n     stand on the front lines in Korea, within range of North \n     Korean artillery and rockets. Thousands of additional \n     American troops are risking their lives every day in \n     continued operations in the global war on terrorism in \n     Afghanistan and other hot spots around the world. And of \n     course many more continue to work to keep the peace and work \n     to build a more stable future in the Balkans and elsewhere. \n     To support these efforts, the President has already called up \n     more than 110,000 members of the Reserve components to active \n     duty.\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\n       Many questions have been raised in recent months about our \n     policy moves on Iraq, Korea, and elsewhere. Concerns have \n     been raised about our proclivity to proceed unilaterally; \n     about a rising tide of anti-Americanism overseas; about the \n     risk that the focus on Iraq has reduced our focus on the war \n     against terrorism, which has to be fought and won here at \n     home as well as overseas; about whether our refusal to talk \n     directly with the North Korean regime as urged by our South \n     Korean allies may be undermining our interests in that area \n     of the world; and about the degree of our commitment to \n     rebuilding Afghanistan and the possible consequences of a \n     similar lack of follow-through in Iraq.\n       I share many of these concerns. I believe that America is \n     at its strongest and best when we make common cause with \n     other nations in pursuit of common goals. I believe that the \n     path to a safer world and a more secure America rarely comes \n     from a go-it-alone approach. Specifically, I believe that, in \n     the absence of an imminent threat, it is in our interest to \n     have a U.N. resolution authorizing member States to take \n     military action before initiating a pre-emptive attack \n     against Iraq.\n       If there is any chance of disarming Saddam Hussein without \n     war, it is for the United Nations to speak with one voice. \n     And if military force is used, the best way of reducing both \n     the short-term risks, including the risks to U.S. and \n     coalition forces, and the long-term risks, including the risk \n     of terrorist attacks on our people throughout the world, is \n     also a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force.\n       Supporting U.N. inspections is an essential step if we are \n     going to keep the Security Council together. We can show \n     support for those U.N. inspections by sharing with the U.N. \n     inspectors the balance of our significant intelligence \n     information about suspect sites, by quickly getting U-2 \n     aircraft in the air over Iraq without conditions and with or \n     without Saddam Hussein's approval, and by giving the \n     inspectors the time they need to finish their work as long \n     as the inspections are unimpeded.\n       Yesterday, I talked about statements by the administration \n     that all useful intelligence information in our possession \n     has now been shared with the U.N. inspectors.\n       Condoleeza Rice told us that at the White House 10 days \n     ago. George Tenet told us that at an open Intelligence \n     Committee hearing two days ago. They were in error. Director \n     Tenet acknowledged yesterday here that we still have \n     information and will be sharing it.\n       The premature declaration that we've already shared all \n     useful intelligence makes us seem excessively eager to bring \n     inspections to a close.\n       Top administrative officials from the beginning said \n     inspections were useless and that inspectors couldn't find \n     anything without Saddam showing them where it was.\n       Well, that's what he is supposed to do, but there's at \n     least a chance inspections will prove useful even without his \n     cooperation. Inspectors caught him in lies about his \n     biological weapons program in the '90s. And in this morning's \n     paper it appears they are catching him in lies about the \n     range of missiles he's developing.\n       Another way to support the inspectors is to back up their \n     request for U-2 surveillance planes, with a U.N. resolution \n     that any interference with them by Saddam Hussein would be \n     considered an act of war against the United Nations.\n       During the State of the Union speech, President Bush noted \n     that ``Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by \n     the United Nations.'' Secretary Powell, during his address to \n     the U.N. Security Council a week ago noted that ``Iraq also \n     has refused to permit any U-2 reconnaissance flights that \n     would give the inspectors a better sense of what's being \n     moved before, during and after inspections.''\n       Indeed the New York Times on January 30th quotes a senior \n     White House official as describing Iraq's refusal to allow \n     the U-2 surveillance flights ``the biggest material breach of \n     all, so far.''\n       I met with Dr. Blix and his staff in New York on January \n     31st. They told me that U-2 flights would be very useful \n     because of their ability to observe large areas of Iraq and \n     to loiter for extended periods of time. U-2 flights would be \n     particularly helpful to track trucks that appear to be moving \n     items from one suspicious place to another, and to track \n     mobile labs. Satellites can't track suspicious vehicles; U-2s \n     can.\n       For this reason, I was astonished to read on Tuesday that \n     State Department spokesman Richard Boucher characterized what \n     appears to be an agreement to implement U-2 flights as \n     nothing ``worth getting excited about.'' If Iraq's refusal to \n     allow U-2 surveillance flights is cited by the President and \n     characterized by the White House as ``the biggest material \n     breach of all,'' if Secretary Powell is right when he says \n     that U-2 surveillance flights would give the inspectors a \n     better sense of what's being moved before, during and after \n     inspections, then minimizing their usefulness at this point \n     can only be explained as further disdain for the inspections \n     effort.\n       It may be unlikely that inspectors will catch Saddam with \n     the goods without his cooperation. But it's at least possible \n     and we should increase that possibility by sharing all our \n     useful intelligence and using the U-2s.\n       Supporting the inspectors in these and other ways is not \n     inconsistent with the position that administration has \n     correctly taken that the burden is on Saddam Hussein to show \n     where the prohibited material is or what he's done with it. \n     The fact that he hasn't carried his burden is undeniable. But \n     how best to deal with his deceit and deception is still ours \n     and the world's challenge.\n       There is unanimity around here about one thing at least: \n     all of us and the American people will stand behind our \n     uniformed forces if they are engaged in military conflict. \n     Should they be so engaged, we will provide our men and women \n     in uniform with everything they need to ensure that they \n     prevail promptly and with minimal casualties.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Res. 23, a resolution for fiscal year 2004--\nactually, 2004 through fiscal year 2013. I urge my colleagues to \nseriously consider this resolution.\n  I will readily say it is not perfect. It is a result of a lot of work \nfrom individuals on both sides of the aisle who considered and put this \nresolution together.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  We had a 2-day markup in the Senate Budget Committee. We had 20-some-\nodd votes. And I thank my colleague Senator Conrad for his cooperation \nthat we were able to finish and conclude the resolution we are now \nreporting to the Senate this week.\n  This resolution has a lot of provisions in it. It provides for how \nmuch money we are going to spend, how much money we are going to tax, \nhow much money we are going to take in. It also has a few other \nprovisions in it, and I will go into those in a moment. It is most \nimportant that we pass a budget resolution. We have passed budget \nresolutions every year since the enactment of the Budget Act in 1974, \nexcept for last year when we did not get it done. I am not throwing \ncomplaints at anybody. I think it is vitally important, if Congress is \ngoing to get its work done; that we pass a budget resolution; that we \ntell the appropriators how much money they are going to spend; that we \ntell the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee how much \nmoney we are going to spend on Medicare; that we set the outlines or \nthe framework on the size of government; that we tell the Finance \nCommittee whether they should have a growth package.\n  In this resolution, we do call for a growth package. It is similar or \nidentical to the number that the President requested. Actually, I think \nthe President requested a number of about $670 billion for the growth \npackage. The Committee on Joint Taxation scored it and said it is $725 \nbillion. That is what we have in our resolution. It is a resolution \nthat says we want to figure out how we can grow the economy.\n  It is vitally important that we do grow the economy, and I will make \na couple of comments about that. We have inherited a very difficult \nsituation. We have very large deficits. Some people might say that was \ncaused by President Bush's tax cut in 2001. I say that is not the case. \nThe very large deficits that we have, have primarily happened because \nwe have had a precipitous decline in revenue, and that decline in \nrevenue was not because of the tax cut, it is because the economy has \nbeen very soft, because a lot less money is coming into the Federal \nGovernment, both on personal income tax and corporate income tax.\n  The chart behind me shows that in the year 2000, the Federal \nGovernment total receipts were over $2 trillion--actually $2.025 \ntrillion. In 2001, that declined about 2 percent to $1.9 trillion. It \nwas $2 trillion, and then $1.9 trillion. Last year, it declined to \n$1.85 trillion. That is a reduction of $175 billion over that 2-year \nperiod of time. That is a reduction of 9 percent.\n  Because of that reduction in revenue and because of an increase in \nexpenditures, expenditures went from $1.8 trillion in 2000 to $1.86 \ntrillion, to last year over $2 trillion. So spending went up by about \n12 percent and revenues went down by 9 percent. That kind of \nintersection meant we went from a surplus of $127 billion in the year \n2001 to a $158 billion deficit in the year 2002. So we went from a \nsurplus of $127 billion to a deficit of $158 billion in that period of \ntime because revenues have gone down and expenditures have gone up. It \nis about that simple.\n\n  One might say, why? Well, let's look a little bit more at the \neconomy. There has been a very precipitous drop in the stock market, \nwell beyond what our computers were able to estimate as to what is the \nflow going to be, what does this mean in actual revenues that will come \nin to individuals, both in capital gains and also in personal income \ntax.\n  This gives an example. Nasdaq, which peaked in March of 2000, was \ndown. It was almost 5,000. I believe it did hit 5,000 in March, went \ndown to 2,500 or 2,600 by the end of the year 2000--almost a 50 percent \nreduction in the last 9 months in the year 2000. It continued to \ndecline somewhat in 2001 and 2002.\n  As a result of that flow, everybody missed it, including the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \nwhen they gave their estimates of what the fiscal situation was in \nJanuary of 2001. They missed it big time. They greatly overestimated \nthe amount of money that would be coming in to the Federal Government.\n  Both CBO and OMB were projecting revenues would continue to climb, \nmaybe a little slower than what they did for the last several years in \nthe 1990s, but they assumed that they would continue to ascend. In \nreality, they dropped by 9 percent. So the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is a nonpartisan office--and I do not fault them for their work; \nI am saying they missed it. Then we also had a little event on \nSeptember 11, 2001, that was a real tragedy that cost 3,000 lives in \nthe United States and caused untold damage to this economy. It would be \ninteresting to see if the economists could ever figure the costs of \nthat to our economy, but it has been in the billions of dollars and \ntherefore and ultimately in revenues to the Federal Government.\n  So we had a recession that was already starting in 2000. We had a \nstock market decline that was enormous, and then we also had 9/11/01, \nwhich was a double hit. If we add these things together, revenues are \nway down. They are actually down for the first 4 or 5 months of this \nyear compared to last year.\n  So we have been hit by a lot: The war on terrorism, that terrible \ntragedy of September 11, and the fact that we have had a very large \ndecrease in the value of the stock market. All combined means that \nrevenues coming into the Federal Government, like maybe revenues coming \ninto a lot of States, are way down. So we went from surpluses of over \n$150 billion to last year we had a deficit of over $120 billion, which \nis forecast by the Congressional Budget Office to rise this year to, I \nbelieve, $246 billion. That is if we do nothing.\n  I do not believe doing nothing is satisfactory. I guess we could just \ndo nothing and hope that maybe things will get better, but I think we \nshould do something. What can we do to help grow the economy? The \nPresident has a growth package. I understand people on the other side \nof the aisle have a growth package. Good. Let's consider a growth \npackage. How can we grow the economy? I think we should consider any \nand all ideas. The President requested us to set aside as much as $700 \nbillion for a growth package. That is what we have done, and we have it \nin a reconciliation instruction.\n  Now, we do not write the tax bill, and all of our colleagues should \nbe aware of that. We do not write the tax bill in the Budget Committee. \nWe do give instructions to the tax-writing committees: Here is the \namount of money they can use to put together a growth package.\n  What we have proposed is about $725 billion. I believe about $30 \nbillion of that is for actual spending, what we would call refundable \ntax credits, and the balance of the President's proposal is mostly \ngeared toward various tax cuts that would help grow the economy.\n  I believe many of those tax cuts would do that, they would help grow \nthe economy. They would help get these figures on the revenues, that \nblue line, instead of going down, to go up. Frankly, it will not go up \nunless we really have a growing economy.\n  The President has several proposals. I will touch on a couple of \nthem. Probably the most controversial is eliminating the double \ntaxation of dividends. We are long overdue for eliminating the double \ntax on dividends. Many have called for it, Democrats and Republicans.\n\n  I don't see how anyone can defend the present policy which taxes \ndistributions from corporations higher than almost any other country in \nthe world. We tax the distribution profits, called dividends, to the \nstockholders at rates of 65 or 70 percent. There is only one country in \nthe world that taxes dividends higher than the United States, and that \nis Japan. We are about even with them. We tax dividends higher than \nFrance. We tax dividends higher than the Swiss and almost higher than \nanyone with the exception of Japan. That is absurd.\n  We are supposed to be this defender of free markets, \nentrepreneurship, and we are saying if you make money in the \ncorporation, and you distribute to the owners, we want two-thirds, \nmaybe three-fourths of it. That is terrible tax policy. The President \nsaid we should eliminate double taxation of dividends. If we did that, \nwe would encourage a lot of changes in behavior. Right now, the present \nTax Code encourages debt and discourages investment in equities. I \ncompliment the President for his proposal. If we can get the taxation \nof\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\ndividends down at a more realistic level, we would have encouragement \nfor investment which would create jobs. That would be positive. We need \nto think what can we do--not to score political points but what can we \ndo to help grow the economy. That is a fundamental part of the \nPresident's growth package, the elimination of the double taxation of \ndividends.\n  He has several other provisions that would help. I used to run a \nsmall business, and he has a provision that would allow people to \nexpense up to $75,000. That is a good provision. That would encourage \njobs. That is positive. We should pass that.\n  The President has several provisions that would be very helpful to \nfamilies. Basically, eliminating the marriage penalty for couples with \nincomes less than $56,000 would be very positive. Right now, a married \ncouple with combined incomes up to $56,000 have a marginal rate of 27 \npercent. Say they make $50,000. Any additional dollar they make is \ntaxed at 27 percent. The President said you should be taxed at no more \nthan 15 percent, all the way up to $56,000. Not to get too wonkish, \nthat equates to $1,100 more per couple with combined incomes up to \n$56,000.\n  Some say this just benefits the wealthy. That is not true. You are \nnot wealthy if you make $56,000. The President says you should pay \ncombined tax together, husband and wife, not in excess of 15 percent. \nThat is a positive proposal.\n  The President has a proposal that says we should increase the per-\nchild tax credit from $600 to $1,000. If you have four kids, that is \n$4,000 you do not have to pay taxes on. That would be an increase of \n$1,600 that you get to keep from present law. Present law on the child \ncredit and on the marriage penalty and on the 1-point rate deductions \nwe have had is $600. That is scheduled to expire at the end of the year \n2010. In the budget, we extend that for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013.\n  We do not propose to do it in the so-called reconciliation package. \nThe reconciliation package is the growth package. In the growth \npackage, what we proposed to the Finance Committee is an amount that \nwould allow the per-child tax credit, that would allow elimination of \nthe marriage penalty, that would allow expensing for small business, \nand that would allow for eliminating the double taxation of dividends, \nsomething I believe would very much help grow the economy.\n\n  I had business people who saw me today and thought that would help \ngrow the economy by hundreds of thousands of jobs. I heard others say \nthat just eliminating double taxation of dividends alone would be \nseveral hundred thousand jobs.\n  We need to consider how we can grow the economy. We have a measure in \nthe budget that is under reconciliation that says we should consider \nopening the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and allow exploration to \noccur in the refuge. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that \nproposal. I understand there may be an amendment to strike. That is one \nproposal that would create jobs. That is one proposal that will reduce \nour dependency on imported oil which right now is right at 60 percent \nand increasing. A lot of that is from the Middle East. Some of it \nhappens to be from Venezuela and other places. Oil costs are high. So \nwe need to figure out how we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nThis is a main provision where we can do it. And for those who say they \ndon't think we should do that because it might not be sensitive to the \nenvironment, I guess they have not been there.\n  I have been in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and the Coastal \nPlain area. It can be done. If you have been to Prudhoe Bay, you can \nsee that is where we have been getting up to 2.1 million barrels per \nday. That is now under 1 million barrels a day. We need to supplement \nthat. We can do that with exploration in a very scientific, \nenvironmentally safe and sound manner that will not have any negatives \nwhatever on wildlife and will help reduce our dependence on foreign \nsources of oil. And we will keep billions and billions of dollars in \nthe United States instead of sending those dollars to the Middle East \nand other countries. We are exporting so many dollars in purchasing \nimported oil; this is a way we can create jobs. There will be thousands \nand thousands of jobs created, good jobs created if we are able to \nenact the provision dealing with the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.\n  It is also important to note we constrain the growth of government \nunder this budget. I have no doubt that many people will be complaining \nabout the budget and will complain about the deficit, but they will \nprobably be some of the same people who will be voting to increase \nspending far and above what is proposed in this resolution.\n  The President has proposed and we have adopted in our resolution \nbudget caps on the amount of money that we will have on discretionary \nspending both for 2004, 2005, and 2003, as well. We have caps for all 3 \nyears. We would increase the spending cap amount to a total of $784 \nbillion in 2004, compared to what we have enacted in 2003 of $765 \nbillion. In nondefense, it is a $10 billion increase. And we also have \nmandatory, total outlay increase for 2003 and 2004, 4.4. A majority of \nthat is mandatory. We are holding down nondefense. The growth of \nnondefense between 2003 and 2004 is 2.9 percent. The growth in defense \nbetween 2003 and 2004 is 2 percent.\n  Now, why only 2 percent? The year before in defense, 2003, we are \nalready at 8.6 percent. We added $10 billion, actually $6 billion for \ndefense, $4 billion for intelligence-related in the 2003 appropriations \nbill just passed last month. I mention that to my colleagues. It is \nvery important.\n  We hear about the growth package and people want to cut the growth \npackage. I am sure we will have amendments. That is perfectly right. I \nhope we have the amendments to eliminate the growth package or to cut \nthe growth package in half. We had those amendments in the committee. I \nexpect we will have them on the floor. I hope they will be defeated. \nThey want to take the growth out of the growth package. I want the \neconomy to grow. How much is enough? Is $350 billion enough? Is $700 \nbillion enough? We anticipated having revenues of over $27 trillion \nover this 10-year life of this budget. So $350 billion is a very small \npercentage. It is about 1 percent; $700 billion is about 2 percent.\n  Can we make some changes that would have a dramatic impact on \nrevenues? I think we can. We have a little history on our side showing \nif we do what is right, we can make the economy grow. In 1997, we had a \nsignificant tax cut. We actually passed one in 1995 and President \nClinton vetoed it. We passed one in 1997 and he signed it. If you look \nat the results, you also see the revenues went way up.\n\n  What was one of the main components of the tax bill that we passed in \n1997? It was reducing the tax rate on capital gains from 28 percent to \n20 percent. There was a flood of money coming into the Federal \nGovernment as a result of that change, a flood of money--more money \nthan the Government ever anticipated because we didn't use dynamic \nscoring. We used static scoring. We actually assumed maybe this was not \ngoing to raise very much money. It raised a lot of money. Because we \nreduced the tax on financial transactions, we had a lot more financial \ntransactions, and it caused and encouraged an explosion in the stock \nmarket. It encouraged a lot of investment. It encouraged growth.\n  The changes we make can make a world of difference. That is why I \nencourage my colleagues to consider the President's growth package. \nWhat changes can we make now that will help grow the economy?\n  If you look at taxation, we were taxing exchanges, financial \ntransactions, and we were taxing those at 28 percent. If we reduced \nthat to 20 percent and we had a lot more transactions, that would \ngenerate a lot more money.\n  What about dividends? If they are taxed at 60 percent--combined rate, \ncorporate and individual, at 65 percent or 70 percent, if we can reduce \nthat and only tax it once so corporations are taxed at 35 percent, it \nis going to greatly encourage corporate investment and distribution to \ntheir owners. I think that would encourage investment and I believe \nhave a very positive impact on the stock market and, frankly, on \neverybody.\n  Somebody would say that only benefits the wealthy guy who owns a lot \nof stock. That is not true. Ask the person who works for the telephone \ncompany, who has a 401(k), and they have watched their stock \ninvestments go back down as Nasdaq did. They want it\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nto go back up. They want the entire market to go back up. Ask a Federal \nemployee who invested in the C fund, the common stock fund. Are they \ninvested? Sure they are. They want to see the stock market go up. When \nit does, I think it has a very positive impact on the economy. I just \nmention those things. The President has that proposal.\n  He does have a cap and we put the cap in our budget, a cap on \ndiscretionary spending, a cap that grows just a couple of percent, 2.4 \npercent, for 2004. So this very important figure, 784 figure--last year \nyou might remember we heard a lot of discussion, talk about 751. That \nwas the discretionary cap figure the President had. Then, 759 or 751, \nwe discussed that figure like it was the total Federal budget. It is \nnot. But it is the amount of money we say we are going to appropriate. \nWe ended up appropriating 765, now 784; it is a 2.4-percent increase.\n  I hope we do not increase that figure during the course of all the \namendments we are going to consider. I know there are dozens of \namendments that say we need to spend more money. We are already \nspending something like $7,000 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States.\n  Spending has been growing dramatically over the last several years. \nWhen these revenue figures were going up, our outlay figures said let's \njust catch up. Just on the discretionary side, outlays, nondefense, \nwent up 17.1 percent; in 2002, they went up 12.5 percent. Both of those \nfigures are greater than what we did in defense for 2001 and 2002. That \nis not sustainable. That is not affordable.\n\n  Our proposal said let's at least limit the growth. We did better in \n2003 in nondefense discretionary. Now we are saying let's hold it at \n2.4 percent, about the rate of inflation. Many of our colleagues say \nthat is not enough. We need to have more money for everything you can \nimagine, and I am sure those amendments will come. I urge my colleagues \nto show some fiscal discipline. Do we want to have the President's \ngrowth package, a bigger one or a smaller one? Let's vote and then \ndecide how much money we are going to spend.\n  We do not dictate to the Finance Committee the composition of the \ngrowth package. We are assuming the composition is similar to the \nPresident's.\n  We also do not dictate to the Appropriations Committee. We make \nassumptions: This is how it will break down. But I might mention they \ncould reallocate the money in any way they want.\n  There are a couple of other things I will mention that are part of \nthe resolution. We have assumed $400 billion for improvements in \nstrengthening Medicare; not just offering a prescription drug package, \nwhich would be a component of it, but to improve and strengthen and \nsolidify, make Medicare a better system for seniors and for future \nseniors. That is in the proposal, of the $400 billion increase.\n  Homeland security--we have the President's request, an 18.4 percent \nincrease over last year.\n  In education, we have increased funding for title I by $1 billion; \nfor IDEA, $1.2 billion.\n  We have a reserve fund for uninsured of $50 billion, an instruction \nto the Finance Committee.\n  We have a highway figure of $32.1 billion; that is 10 percent over \nthe President's request. I know there is going to be a request to \nincrease that figure dramatically--some people say by as much as $5 \nbillion or $8 billion or $10 billion more per year. There is not enough \nmoney in the trust fund to do it. There is not enough money generated \nby gasoline taxes to do it.\n  I am a believer that highways should be paid for by user fees, by \ngasoline taxes. Some people would want to increase the deficit by \nwhatever amount it is to expand on that figure. I hope we do not do \nthat. I am sure that will be one of the contentious issues with which \nwe wrestle.\n  I encourage my colleagues, I hope they review this budget proposal. \nIt tracks largely what the President requested for defense and \nnondefense for the first couple of years. It tracks the President's \nrequest for expanding and improving Medicare, homeland security, \neducation--we bumped over the President's figures in education. I hope \nmy colleagues will consider it. I hope they will say, What can we do \nthat will help grow the economy? If they have a better idea, let's \nconsider it.\n  We will consider an amendment also at the appropriate time. I look \nforward to working with all my colleagues and particularly my ranking \nmember, my friend and colleague, Senator Conrad, on this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today we begin a fundamental and \ncritically important debate on the fiscal future of our country. We do \nit as our country is poised on the brink of war. We do it when our \ncountry is now in record budget deficits. We do it at a time when we \nsee challenges facing our country on many fronts. This is a debate of \nenormous consequence.\n  I, first, thank our chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles, for the way he has conducted our committee. He is new as the \nchairman. He has walked into a difficult, challenging situation, but he \nhas conducted himself as a real gentleman and we, on our side, \nappreciate that very much. He has also gathered an exceptionally good \nstaff. We appreciate working with them as well.\n  This debate is about the fundamental question of where this country \nwill go in its fiscal future. We will decide whether this country will \ncontinue down the dangerous path of deficits, debt and decline, or \nwhether we will take a step back toward fiscal responsibility, balanced \nbudgets, and economic strength.\n  In the 2 years since the Bush administration has come into office, \nour Nation has suffered a dramatic and disturbing downturn in our \nfiscal and economic affairs. We went from a position of unparalleled \ngrowth, job creation, and opportunity to one of deficits, growing debt, \ngrowing unemployment, and doubt about our Nation's economic future. \nThis budget resolution that we will begin debating today will determine \nwhether we continue on the path set by this administration, a path that \nis rapidly undermining our fiscal strength, or whether we begin to \nreverse this dangerous course.\n  The budget resolution that we have before us, the majority passed out \nof the Budget Committee on a party-line vote, I believe is not the \nanswer to what ails this country. It follows closely the President's \nproposal for massive tax cuts for the wealthiest among us that will \nonly drive us deeper into deficit and debt.\n  The chairman of the committee calls part of those tax cuts a growth \npackage, which is what the President terms it. We respectfully \ndisagree. I do not believe, and many on our side do not believe, that \nit is a growth package. We believe instead that it will inhibit growth \nbecause deficits and debt will explode and the heavy weight of those \ndeficits and debt will hold down economic growth. When you run \ndeficits, you reduce the pool of societal savings. When there is less \nof a pool of societal savings, there is less money available for \ninvestment. And without investment, you cannot grow. I think on both \nsides of the aisle we agree on that basic premise.\n\n  The majority's resolution includes fully $1.4 trillion in new tax \ncuts, $726 billion for the so-called growth package, and more than $600 \nbillion to make the President's 2001 tax cuts permanent. With interest \ncosts, these tax cuts will add $1.7 trillion to the deficit.\n  Let's make no mistake, these are not tax cuts that are being paid for \nby cutting spending; they are not tax cuts that come out of a surplus. \nThey are tax cuts that will be funded by borrowing the money. I should \nalso add, they will also be financed by taking over $2 trillion out of \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses to pay for them.\n  At a time when we are on the brink of war in Iraq, we face a crisis \nwith North Korea, we face an ongoing global fight against terrorism and \nal-Qaida, deficits are at record levels and continue to grow, job \nlosses are mounting, and the retirement of the baby boom generation \nlooms just over the horizon, I cannot think of anything more \nirresponsible than enacting this plan.\n  Now is a time that we should be focusing on strengthening our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\ndefenses and homeland security, improving our economy, and restoring \nfiscal discipline over the long term to assure that future generations \nare not saddled with these debts.\n  If Congress were to actually adopt the plan before us, it would \nplunge the country off a fiscal cliff and threaten the education of our \nchildren, the financial security of our seniors, the stability of our \neconomy, and the ultimate strength of our Nation.\n  First of all, it disturbs me we are even considering a massive tax \ncut package at a time when we are on the brink of war. How can we call \non our troops to be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice but ask for \nno sacrifice here at home to fund their endeavors? I do not think that \nsends the proper message, when our troops are in the field, on the \nbrink of battle.\n  Past Congresses and past Presidents have almost always called on the \nAmerican people to help share the burden of conflict by buying \nGovernment bonds, by forgoing tax cuts, or even paying higher taxes to \npay for a war. The American people proudly carried this burden and \nrecognized it was their responsibility and a small price to pay for the \nprivilege of living in the greatest and strongest country in the world. \nThey certainly did not consider tax cuts for the wealthiest when their \nfellow countrymen were in battle and their Nation was in deep deficit \nand growing debt.\n  Amazingly, despite the fact that we are on the verge of war, neither \nthe President's budget nor the majority's resolution includes any \nresources for such a conflict. How can we consider cutting revenues by \n$1.9 trillion, with the interest costs included, as the President has \nproposed and have not one penny in the budget for the looming war?\n  Some say, well, it is hard to predict what the war will cost. Indeed, \nthat is true. But one thing we know for certain is the right number is \nnot zero. But that is what is in this budget resolution--zero, zero for \nputting our troops in position to launch an attack on Iraq, zero for \nthe conflict almost certain to come, zero for the reconstruction of \nthat country, zero for the occupation.\n  We do have estimates of what all those things cost. Before the Armed \nServices Committee, they were told in some detail that the costs of \njust having our troops in place, without going to war--just having them \nin place--between now and the end of September, would be from $64 to \n$84 billion. But there is not a dime in this budget. What sense does \nthat make? Are we in total denial that having a quarter of a million \ntroops poised for a war against Iraq is not going to cost anything? \nSurely we know that is not true. The cost is substantial, and we ought \nto provide for it in this budget.\n  Let's consider just how much this war could cost.\n  Officially, the administration has refused to provide Congress with a \ncost estimate. The press reports have cited administration officials \nacknowledging that they could request a supplemental appropriation of \n$60 to $95 billion to cover war costs in 2003 alone.\n  This chart shows how much the administration could request in a \nsupplemental for these war costs, and it shows how much has been put in \nthe budget resolution before us. The number is zero.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, we know that is not right. That should not \nbe our budget for this looming war. And nowhere has the administration \naccounted for the possibly large postwar costs, such as occupation, \nhumanitarian assistance, and reconstruction, not to mention any \nindirect costs to the United States, such as an extended spike in oil \nprices.\n  That is why it is so important that Congress be provided with a war \ncost estimate before we proceed with large tax cuts or large new \nspending initiatives. Congress should have the information before we \nmake these long-term commitments, not after.\n  It is disturbing to read press reports that Republican leaders may be \nasking the administration to delay their supplemental request until \nthese tax cuts are locked into a budget resolution.\n  This is how Congress Daily reported the situation:\n\n       Vice President Cheney met with Senate Majority Leader Frist \n     [on] Thursday to discuss, among other things, the timing of a \n     spending request on military action in Iraq. It is not \n     expected that such a request would come until after the House \n     and Senate complete floor action on the budget resolution, a \n     key aide said.\n       . . . [H]owever, having a supplemental that could total \n     somewhere between $65 and $95 billion come up while the tax \n     cuts and the budget resolution are being debated could \n     threaten the Republicans' economic agenda. House leaders have \n     also said they want the supplemental war request delayed as \n     long as possible to provide breathing room between the tax \n     cuts and war spending.\n\n  If this report is accurate, and the war supplemental is really being \nheld to give breathing room for the tax cuts, we are in worse shape \nthan I even imagined.\n  To understand why the majority's budget plan is, I believe, making \nincorrect assumptions with respect to the economy, it is worth \nreviewing what has happened to the budget over the last 2 years.\n  When the President was advocating his first tax cut in 2001, he \npromised we could easily afford it. He ignored warnings that the tax \ncut he was proposing was too large. In a speech just 2 years ago, the \nPresident said:\n\n       Tax relief is central to my plan to encourage economic \n     growth, and we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \n     budget deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  He was wrong. We now know how wrong he was. Instead of the $5.6 \ntrillion in projected surpluses over the next 10 years that were \nprojected when the President came into office, now, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office's latest estimates, if we adopt the \nPresident's budget plan, we will face a $2.1 trillion deficit over that \ntime period. That is a stunning downturn of nearly $7.7 trillion in \njust 2 years.\n  I listened to our chairman give the reasons for this downturn. The \none thing I did not hear him mention was the effect of the tax cuts. \nAnd yet the tax cuts over the 10-year period are the biggest single \nreason for this deterioration in our financial condition.\n  What could be more clear? Let's just do the math. We were told we \nwould have $5.6 trillion over the next decade in surpluses.\n  Now we are told if we adopt the President's tax and spending plans, \nwe will be $2.1 trillion in the hole over that same period. The tax \ncuts we passed in 2001 were $1.35 trillion plus the associated interest \ncosts. If you reduce revenue, and that means you have more deficit and \nmore debt, that means your interest cost goes up. The total cost of \nthose tax cuts, about $1.7 trillion.\n  Now the President comes before us with an additional $1.6 trillion of \ntax cuts over this period of time. The associated interest cost takes \nthat to a total cost of $1.96 trillion. If you add the $1.7 trillion \nfrom the previous tax cuts, the $1.96 trillion from these tax cuts, you \nget almost $3.7 trillion; $3.7 trillion of the $7.7 trillion of \ndeterioration. That is about 40 percent of the variance. That is the \nbiggest reason.\n  The second biggest reason is the increased cost associated with the \nattack on this country--increased defense cost, increased homeland \nsecurity cost, which we all have supported.\n  The third biggest reason, quite apart from tax cuts, is the economy \nis not throwing off the tax revenue anticipated for this level of \neconomic activity. That is a simple mistake in the calculations.\n  The fourth reason is the economic downturn.\n  Those are the key reasons for this collapse in our fiscal fortunes. \nBut let's be clear, the tax cuts are the biggest single reason.\n\n  In last year's State of the Union address when this change in our \nfiscal fortunes was becoming more clear, the President saw what his \npolicies were doing and he began to acknowledge that deficits had \nreturned. He said then:\n\n     . . . [O]ur budget will run a deficit that will be small and \n     short-term . . .\n\n  Again he was wrong. It is now very clear that the deficits will be \nneither small nor short term. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office \nhas told us that the deficit would total $338 billion in 2004 if we \nwere to adopt his plan. And if, as the law requires, we are to exclude \nSocial Security from that calculation, the deficit in this coming year \nwould be $512 billion. In fact, we would see throughout the rest of \nthis entire decade deficits would never be below $400 billion.\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n  This chart shows it. This is what CBO told us back in May would occur \nwithout the President's policies, the top line. And we would have \nemerged from deficit in about 2011. If, instead, the President's \npolicies are adopted, and this is the balance line, this is where you \nhave no deficits, this is what happens if the President's policies are \nadopted. We never escape from deficits the entire rest of this decade, \nand they are not small. They are very large. In fact, they are record \ndeficits, record in dollar terms, over $500 billion in 2004 alone on a \nbudget of $2.2 trillion. That is a deficit of over 25 percent. That is \nnot a small deficit.\n  In 2001, the President gave a radio address to the Nation. He said \nthen:\n\n     . . . [M]y budget pays down a record amount of national debt. \n     We will pay off $2 trillion of debt over the next decade. \n     That will be the largest debt reduction of any [nation] ever. \n     Future generations shouldn't be forced to pay back money that \n     we have borrowed. We owe this kind of responsibility to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n\n  The President was absolutely right in his values and in his \nsentiment, but that is not what we are getting in terms of a policy. \nWhat we now see is endless deficit and endless debt passed on to our \nchildren and grandchildren. In fact, when he said he would virtually \neliminate the debt back in January of 2001, he said there would only be \n$36 billion of debt left by 2008. Now we see, instead of almost \neliminating the debt, it is growing. In fact, it will be over $5 \ntrillion by 2008, over $5 trillion. That is just the publicly held \ndebt. That doesn't include the debt we are running up to the trust \nfunds of Medicare and Social Security, debts that will also be in the \ntrillions and trillions of dollars.\n\n  The consequences of this dramatic increase in debt are many. But one \nof them that hurts this Nation the most is the increased interest cost \nwe will face. Back in January of 2000, we were told the interest cost \nduring this period would be $622 billion. Now we see that instead of \n$622 billion, the interest cost will be $2.3 trillion; $1.7 trillion in \ninterest cost, money that can't be used to build a destroyer to protect \nthe Nation, money that can't be used to eliminate the terrorist threat \nto our country, money that can't be used to educate a child or feed a \nhungry person or do anything else that government does. Instead, it is \nwasted money, wasted in the sense it won't do anything positive other \nthan pay our bills.\n  That increase in debt, that increase in deficits is, to me, the \ngreatest threat posed to our national economic security. Again, if we \nlisten to President Bush, we know his heart is in the right place. In \nhis State of the Union address this year he said he would not pass on \nour problems to future generations. He said then:\n\n       This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will \n     not ignore, we will not pass on our problems to other \n     Congresses, to other presidents and other generations.\n\n  That is precisely what the President's budget plan, and what the \nbudget plan before us, does. It passes on the burden to future \ngenerations. It asks our children to shoulder the debts we are running \nup.\n  It is interesting to look at what the President's policies will do \naccording to his own analytical perspectives. From page 33 in his \nbudget, what this chart shows is the next 10 years, the budget sweet \nspot. Even though we are in very large deficit, even though we are in \nrecord deficit, even though the debt is mounting, we can see this is \nthe good times because this is the chart from the President's own \nbudget document looking out as far as 2050.\n  What it shows is, if the President's policies are adopted, his \nproposals for tax cuts, his proposals for spending, we are going to \ntake a leap off the cliff into deficits that are unsustainable and that \nare dramatic and that are devastating to this country's economic \nstrength and economic future.\n  We need to remember this is the worst possible time for us to be \naccumulating such a mountain of debt.\n  This is precisely the time when we should be paying down debt, or \nprepaying the coming liability of the baby boom generation.\n  When we look at the next two decades, we can see that the President's \ntax cut explodes in costs at exactly the same time the Social Security \nand Medicare tax surpluses disappear. Right now, the tax cuts are \nsomewhat less than the trust fund surpluses from Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  But look what happens when those trust funds go cash negative in the \nnext decade. At the very time the trust funds of Social Security and \nMedicare go cash negative, the cost of the President's tax cuts \nexplode. That is what this chart shows us.\n  The blue bar, which is the smallest, is the Medicare surplus. \nUltimately, it becomes Medicare deficits. The green bar is what Social \nSecurity is running now in surplus, which will also turn to deficits \nwhen the baby boomers start to retire. The red bar shows the \nPresident's tax cuts.\n  What this chart shows is as clear as it can be. None of this adds up. \nIt doesn't come close to adding up. Right now, while the trust funds \nare running substantial surpluses, those funds are being used to pay \nfor the tax cuts and other expenditures of Government. They are not \nbeing banked. They are not being used to pay down our other debt so \nthat we would be in a better position when the baby boomers retire. And \nthose surpluses are not being used to prepay the liability we all know \nis to come. Instead, those trust fund surpluses are being spent. They \nare being spent to fund these tax cuts; they are being spent to fund \nother expenses of Government.\n  Look what happens when we get out into about the next decade. Then as \nthe baby boomers retire, the trust fund turns to cash negative, instead \nof throwing off big surpluses.\n  For example, this year, the Social Security trust fund surplus is \nover $160 billion. That is real money--$160 billion in this year alone. \nBut all of that is going to change when the baby boomers start to \nretire. Then the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare go cash \nnegative. As the years progress, we go cash negative in a big way. That \nis the very time that the cost of the President's tax cuts explode. The \nresult: massive deficits, massive debt.\n  This chart is looking out to 2018, when we will have a deficit \napproaching a trillion dollars for that year alone. That is what these \ncharts show. That tells me that this budget plan can only have one \nconclusion, and that is to take us on a course to massive cuts in \nMedicare, in Social Security, and in all the rest of Government. That \nis the only conceivable outcome of a policy that has been laid down by \nthe President and that has been largely adopted in the budget \nresolution.\n  I don't think that is the direction in which the American people want \nto go. But they need to know that the logic of this plan is \ninescapable. It is massive deficit; it is massive debt.\n  The President has proposed what he calls an economic growth package. \nClearly, we need to have an economic growth strategy. That is something \non which we can all agree. We need an economic growth strategy because \nwe have lost 2.5 million jobs in the private sector since January of \n2001. Let's be clear. What has caused that? No. 1, economic downturn. \nNo. 2, the attack on this country that made the economic downturn more \nsevere. Those are the culprits in the near term for what has happened \nto us. So we simply must respond to 2.5 million jobs lost during that \nperiod of time.\n  But the President has told us that his growth package, which doesn't \ncost $725 billion--when you include the interest costs, it costs $994 \nbillion from 2003 to 2013--almost a trillion dollars of costs, only a \nvery small part of it is effective this year when the economy is weak \nand needs a boost. This doesn't make sense to me, nor does it make \nsense to many economists. Clearly, we need a growth strategy. This is \nwhere the chairman and I are in complete agreement. We need a growth \nstrategy.\n  But we need a growth strategy that will really grow the economy, one \nthat will provide lift at a time of economic weakness, but one that \nwill return us to fiscal balance in the long term so we are not putting \nupward pressure on interest rates that would only slow economic growth \nand kill a stronger economic future.\n  Some have said deficits don't matter, deficits don't affect the \neconomy. Chairman Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, believes \ndeficits matter. He said in testimony before the Senate Banking \nCommittee:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy, unless \n     attended.\n\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n\n  Well, it is not just Chairman Greenspan who believes it. Mark Zandi, \na well-respected economist with Economy.com has evaluated the \nDemocratic plan for economic growth and contrasted it with the \nPresident's plan. What he concluded is that, in the short term you get \nmore economic growth from the Democratic plan because we put more into \ngiving lift to the economy now, when it is weak.\n  He shows that, in 2003, we would have almost twice as much economic \ngrowth as the President's plan. The same is true in 2004. And perhaps \neven more interesting, he concludes that over the long term, the \nPresident's economic growth plan actually hurts economic growth.\n  Let's be clear. We believe the President's so-called growth plan will \nhelp in the short term--not as much as our plan would, but it would \nhelp--but it actually hurts in the long term. Why? Because the tax cuts \nare not paid for by spending reductions in the President's plan. \nInstead, the President's tax cuts are financed by borrowing and taking \nthe money out of the Social Security trust fund surpluses. That is a \nprescription for putting upward pressure on interest rates and for \nhurting long-term economic growth.\n  Again, that is not just my view, that is not just the view of Mr. \nZandi; it is also the view of Macroeconomic Advisers. They happen to be \nthe group that is hired by the White House, hired by the Congressional \nBudget Office, to give long-term assessments of what different policies \nwill do for economic growth. This is what they have said the effect of \nthe President's plan will be.\n  This chart shows the President's policy compared to the base. The \nbase is the green line; the President's policy is the black line. What \nit shows is that in the short term the President's policy would \nincrease economic growth--again, not as much as the Democratic plan; \nnonetheless, it would be positive. Over the long term, it would be \nworse than doing nothing. It would actually hurt long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  Again, the reason for that is very simple. The reason is, if you \nfinance these tax cuts with borrowing, you are increasing deficits, \nincreasing debt, and that provides a dead weight on this economy.\n  We have the Federal Government in there competing with the private \nsector to borrow money. That drives up the cost of borrowed money, \ndrives up interest rates, and that hurts economic growth.\n  It is just not my view, or the view of Macroeconomic Advisers, or Mr. \nZandi; it has now been expressed by a group of the most distinguished \ncorporate leaders in America.\n  The nonpartisan Committee for Economic Development, a group of some \n250 CEOs of major companies, has looked at the President's plan, and \nthey have come forward with the following conclusions. I should \nemphasize the Committee for Economic Development is a nonpartisan, \nnonpolitical group of 250 leading businessmen and academics, a group \ncomposed of largely fiscally conservative business leaders and \nacademics, including executives from the Bank of America, Bell South, \nAllied Signal, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, Ford Motor \nCompany, and many more.\n  This group issued a report opposing the President's tax cut and \nnoting that it would explode deficits and debt right in the face of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation. That is exactly right. Here is \nwhat they found.\n  No. 1, current budget projections seriously understate the problem.\n  No. 2, while slower economic growth has caused much of the immediate \ndeterioration in the deficit, the deficits in later years reflect our \ntax-and-spending choices. So this is the debate between the chairman \nand me. He is saying the tax cuts are not the reason for the opening up \nof these deficits, and he is right, in the first few years of this 10-\nyear plan. But over the full 10 years of the 10-year plan, the biggest \nreason for the return to deficits is the tax cuts. That is not just my \nconclusion, that is the conclusion of this group of corporate leaders.\n  No. 3, deficits do matter. When you have to be borrowing money for \nthe Federal Government, that puts the Federal Government in competition \nwith the private sector and that puts upward pressure on interest \nrates, especially at a time when the economy is recovering.\n  No. 4, the aging of our population compounds the problem.\n  I do not know what could be more clear. We have record deficits now. \nThe President says cut another $2 trillion out of the revenue base and \ndo not offset it by cutting spending, but increase spending and do it \nwhen we all know the baby boomers are about to retire and will really \nexplode costs to the Federal Government. What earthly sense does this \nmake? We are cooking a stew here that will be impossible to choke down. \nWe will be choking on deficits and debt in this country, and you do not \nhave to just take my word for it. The President's own budget documents \nhave reached precisely the same conclusion. They show we never emerge \nfrom deficit and that as the baby boomers retire and the costs of the \ntax cuts explode, the deficits mushroom, the debt grows geometrically \nto unsustainable levels.\n  Let me put up the reasons for the decline we were discussing earlier. \nThe reasons for the disappearance of the $7.7 trillion--remember 2 \nyears ago, we had a forecast of $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the \nnext decade. We now know, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nif we adopt the President's tax-and-spending plans, instead of $5.6 \ntrillion of surpluses, we will have $2.1 trillion of deficits. That is \na swing of $7.7 trillion in 2 years.\n  Where did the money go? Over the 10 years, 38 percent went to the tax \ncuts, those already passed and those proposed; 26 percent went to the \nproblem of the models not correctly forecasting revenue for various \nlevels of economic activity. That is apart from the tax cuts. It is \nless revenue, but not caused by the tax cuts. The two of them together \nare 64 percent of the reason for the disappearance of the surplus. \nSixty-four percent is less revenue than anticipated. Most of it is the \ntax cuts, but the other is mistakes in forecasting. Twenty-\nseven percent of the reversal is additional spending caused by the \nattack on the country, the additional defense spending, and the \nadditional spending for homeland security. Only 9 percent is the \neconomic downturn.\n\n  Now we have the Committee for Economic Development telling us that we \nare on a course that does not make sense. So we look at the proposal \nbefore us by the chairman of the Budget Committee that passed on a \nparty-line vote out of the committee. What does it show us?\n  It shows us that if you do not use Social Security, if you do not \nthrow that money into the pot, if instead you treat it like a trust \nfund, if instead you protect it, if you treat Social Security as a true \ntrust fund, the deficit in 2004 under the budget chairman's mark will \nbe $503 billion out of a budget of approximately $2.2 trillion. That is \na huge deficit. What we see is never emerging from deficit if we do not \nuse Social Security for other purposes for the whole rest of the \ndecade. In fact, we never get below $300 billion in shortfall on an \noperating basis.\n  Where is the money coming from? Mr. President, $2.7 trillion is being \ntaken from Social Security surpluses and used to pay for these tax cuts \nand being used to pay for the other expenses of Government.\n  These chickens are going to come home to roost. This is a profound \nmistake, I believe. I believe we should have either used this money to \npay down debt or prepay the liability we know is to come, but to take \nthis money from Social Security surpluses when we are right on the eve \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation, we know what it is going \nto do. It is going to force incredible choices on a future Congress and \na future administration. They are going to have to run up massive debt \nor have enormous tax increases or deep cuts to Social Security and \nMedicare. This is reality talking now, and it is a hard reality, but it \nis something we have to face up to.\n  Instead of paying down debt, here is what is happening to the gross \nFederal debt. It is exploding. It was $6 trillion in 2002. If we adopt \nthe chairman's mark, it will be $12 trillion at the end of this budget \nperiod; $12 trillion in debt.\n  The chairman said the tax proposals of the President are not weighted \nto those at the top. I must say I differ. I do not know what tax plan \nhe is studying, but the tax plan I look at that the\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nPresident has advocated shows the overall tax cuts are almost totally \nweighted to the top end. This is from the Center on Tax Policy, and it \nshows that taxpayers with over $1 million of income a year will get an \n$88,000 tax cut--$88,873. That is pretty generous. Taxpayers who are in \nthe middle of the income scale, those earning from $21,000 to $38,000, \nget a $265 tax cut. If that is not weighted to the top, I do not know \nwhat is.\n  By the way, this AGI, adjusted gross income, of $21,000 to $38,000, \nis 20 percent of taxpayers who are in the middle of income distribution \nin this country. They take the income of all those in America and \ndivide them into groups of 20 percent. The group that is in the middle \n20 percent has an adjusted gross income of between $21,000 to $38,000. \nThey get very little by way of this tax cut. Those at the top--and, of \ncourse, people earning over $1 million a year are in the top 1 percent \nof this country--get a tax cut of over $88,000. This is trickle-down \neconomics all right. It did not work before, and I do not think it will \nwork now.\n  This shows the benefit by quintile of the President's proposal. It \nshows the bottom 20 percents get two-tenths of 1 percent of the \nbenefit; the second 20 percent gets 10.8 percent; the third 20 percent \nget 23 percent; the fourth 20 percent get 32 percent; the top 20 \npercent get a third of the benefit. So that is clearly heavily weighted \nto the top.\n\n  I conclude by saying I hope we pause, think, and reflect about what \nadopting these policies would mean to the economic future of the \ncountry. I think these are fateful decisions that are about to be made, \nfateful decisions that will have an effect on this country for many \nyears to come. I very much hope that before we are finished our work on \nthis budget resolution that we change course, that certainly we enact a \ngrowth package, one that includes tax cuts, one that gives a lift to \nthe economy but one that does not burden us with deficit and debt for \nyears to come; that we return to an understanding that fiscal \nresponsibility is critical to long-term economic growth. That must be \nthe conclusion that we come to during this debate on the budget \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have heard many people say the tax cut \nis really weighted towards the upper income people, and sometimes I do \nnot know if we are talking about the 2001 tax cut or the tax cut that \nPresident Bush is now proposing for growth or the extenuation of the \n2001 tax cut.\n  In his total 10-year budget, the President had about $1.5 trillion of \nreduced revenues. Of that, $695 billion, I believe, was in the growth \npackage and tax cuts; about $30 billion in expenditures. Some of the \ntax cuts were refundable, so Government will write a check. So that \ngoes on the expensing side. About $600 billion of that figure is the \nextension of the 2001 tax cuts that will sunset at the end of the year \n2010. Those are tax cuts that are the per-child tax credit, the \nmarriage penalty, and also the reduction in rates.\n  I might mention the reduction in rates, what we already passed in \n2001, particularly as far as income strata is concerned, who benefited \nthe most percentage-wise, low income benefited a much greater \npercentage than upper income. Those are the facts. We reduced the 15-\npercent bracket to 10 percent, and we did it retroactive in June of \n2001. We made it retroactive to January of 2001. Now, that is a \nreduction of rates of about 30-some-odd percent. That is from 15 \npercent to 10 percent, and it was made retroactive for individuals who \nwere in that income tax bracket.\n  For individuals who were at the maximum tax bracket, we went from \n39.6 percent to 38.6, 1 percentage point. Incidentally, we went 1 \npercentage point in the other rates as well. The 28-percent rate went \nto 27 percent, for example. So percentage-wise, they did not do near as \nwell, about a 3-percent reduction compared to a 33-percent reduction \nfor lower income.\n  As a matter of fact, the Tax Code is more progressive now as a result \nof the 2001 tax cuts than it was without the 2001 tax cuts. Upper \nincome people pay a greater percentage of the income tax. Senator \nGrassley will probably allude to this when he makes some of his \ncomments.\n  If we pass the President's entire package as presented, the tax cut \nwould still be more progressive. One might say, why? Well, because we \nare increasing the number of people who will pay no income tax. If one \nhas four kids, passing a child credit of $1,000 per child is $4,000 \nthey do not pay taxes on. If one has income less than a certain amount, \nthey may not pay any in connection with tax. So percentage-wise, that \nmay be a 100-percent reduction of their income tax. That is rather \nsignificant.\n  I mentioned the marriage penalty. Couples with taxable income less \nthan $56,000 would be taxed at a 15-percent bracket instead of \nmarginally at a 27-percent bracket. So that benefits them dramatically. \nIt goes from a 27-percent bracket to 15-percent bracket. That is almost \na 50-percent reduction. That is very significant. Sometimes people want \nto play class warfare. I don't. I want to come up with good tax policy. \nIt is absolutely not good tax policy to be taxing distributions from \ncorporations to the tune of 67 or 70 percent.\n\n  And now a personal example. I used to run a manufacturing company \nbefore coming to the Senate. It was a corporation, Nickles Machine \nCorporation. We made money for a while. Unfortunately, we turned into a \nnonprofit organization--but not by choice. When we were making money, \nwe wanted to distribute some of the money to our shareholders, to the \nowners of the company. At that time, corporate tax was 48 percent and \nthe tax on individuals was 50 percent, for our purposes. If you have \n$1,000 and distribute that to the owners, the net result is the Federal \nGovernment gets 75 percent and the owners get 25 percent.\n  What is it today? If a corporation wants to distribute $1,000, they \npay 35 percent corporate tax and the individuals might be paying 27 \npercent, possibly 33 percent or 38.6 percent. If a corporation wants to \ndistribute $1,000 in earnings to the owners, the Federal Government \ngets 70 percent and the owners get 30 percent. This is not a very good \ndeal.\n  A lot of corporations said: Let's do something else; let's pay \nbonuses. So there were bonus schemes. The goal of a business is to \ngenerate a profit and distribute that to the owners. It makes no \neconomic sense to pay a lot of dividends if the Government gets over \nhalf, maybe as much as two-thirds, maybe more than two-thirds, even up \nto 70 percent. That is how present law is written.\n  The President proposes changing that, and I compliment him for doing \nso. Alan Greenspan has spoken in favor of that needed change. Many who \nfollow the markets, including Charles Schwab and others, say this would \nbe very positive and would help raise the markets. We would stop this \nterrible suffocating policy of overtaxing corporate distributions, \nwhich is what we are doing. We are currently grossly overtaxing \ncorporate distributions. We need to change that.\n  Again, this will help anyone, including Senate employees. I don't see \ntoo many millionaires walking around here, but it would benefit every \nSenate employee who works for me who has money in the retirement \naccount. It would help employees of corporations who have money in \nretirement funds. A teacher retirement fund is one of the largest in \nthe country. I believe it is the California teachers retirement plan. \nThey invest in the stock market. They would benefit from this proposal. \nIt would benefit everyone, including our country.\n  I don't think we should be talking about class warfare. Percentage-\nwise, the lower income group has a greater percentage reduction of its \nincome tax than any other group. That is a fact.\n  Some are talking about this leading to cuts in Social Security and \nMedicare. I find that not to be the case. The Social Security trust \nfund will be just as large in 10 years whether we pass this budget or \nnot. We do not do one thing that would have any impact on the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\n  Right now, the Social Security trust fund is financed by payroll tax. \nThere is more money going out than coming in if you look at Social \nSecurity and Medicare combined. If you take the two trust funds \ncombined, there is more money going out because we subsidize Medicare \nsubstantially in Part B. I will have charts on the total money in those \npots of funds.\n  We want to have a very good, enlightened debate on this entire \nbudget. I encourage my colleagues, if they find this budget deficient, \nto please offer their own. We will have ample time to consider \nalternatives. I am sure others have ideas, and we would be happy to \ndebate those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate when one is assessing \neffective tax rates on corporations, it is a very tricky business. The \nchairman is citing the tax rates found in the tax tables. But those are \nnot the effective tax rates that companies pay. It gets to be much more \ncomplicated than it appears superficially in terms of top rates.\n  For example, the chairman is making the point regarding everyone who \nhas retirement account benefits. Our employees benefit--although they \nare, for the most part, well-to-do people--from the dividend taxation \nproposal. The way tax law works, they do not pay those taxes in a \nretirement account. Those are tax-free accounts. They are not paying \nthe dividend tax. It might be true they would benefit if the value of \nthe stocks went up, but that is very much a crapshoot. No one knows for \ncertain what the effect of a dividend tax proposal would be in terms of \nstock valuation. But we do know the effect on deficits and debt. It \nwill drive up deficits. It will drive up debt.\n  Many Members believe, and many economists believe, increased deficits \nand increased debt will inhibit long-term economic growth, not improve \nit; it will hurt people, not help people.\n  When the chairman talks about lower income people getting a bigger \npercentage reduction in their income taxes than higher income people, \nthat leaves out a profoundly important point. That is, most lower \nincome people--in fact, most taxpayers--pay much more in payroll taxes \nthan they pay in income taxes. There is no payroll tax relief in this \nplan. It is all geared to income taxes. Automatically, that is giving \nthe greatest benefit to those who are the best off.\n  When you take all the President's proposals together and evaluate who \nthe big beneficiaries are, it is indisputable that it is heavily \nweighted in the top end. Certainly, the dividend top proposal is \nweighted in the top end heavily, and that is half of the President's \nso-called growth package.\n  I will yield the floor so colleagues have their chance to express \ntheir views on the budget resolution before the Senate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased we are at the point of having \nthe debate now on the budget. It is extremely critical to the operation \nof the Nation to have this done in a very timely fashion. I appreciate \nthe cooperation on both sides of the aisle to bring it to this point.\n  I enjoyed the insights and debate we had last week as it congenially \nwent through committee. There was a lot of cooperation, a lot of \nexploration, a lot of decisionmaking last week that resulted in the \nbudget that is here today so we can begin the floor debate. I look \nforward to making progress on the budget this week and getting it \nwrapped up so the authorizing committees can look at the exact projects \nthey have coming, have some kind of idea of the amount of money that is \nin there and, at the same time, the projects they want to do over the \nyears that are necessary to accomplish. Then, of course, the timely \nwork of the authorizing committees will allow the timely operation of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n\n  Last year we were not able to approve an appropriation until this \nyear, in January. That is supposed to be done in October, not January--\nOctober. We got it done in January. But we ought to be able to get it \ndone in October, before October 1, so all the agencies know what they \nare operating on for that year so we are not guessing for part of the \nyear and then operating on an appropriation.\n  All of that ties back into this budget process. The budget process is \nnot the details of where the money goes, but it is the broad blueprint \nfor where it goes. Most importantly, it establishes the rules that \npeople have to operate under when they do authorizing and \nappropriations.\n  This is an extremely critical piece of the puzzle. It is a piece \ndesigned to be done in relatively rapid fire, so those other parts of \nthe process can be done.\n  Today I rise in support of the budget resolution as reported by the \nBudget Committee last Thursday. I do commend the chairman of the \ncommittee and my colleagues for developing a fiscally responsible and \nrealistic budget, and for doing it in a timely manner. The hard work of \nthe committee has set the stage for final adoption before the April 15 \ndeadline.\n  You may not know that the April 15 deadline has only been \naccomplished four times since 1976. We have a great opportunity to have \nit accomplished this year. I look forward to doing that.\n  The resolution as introduced today will not only enable us to win the \nwar on terrorism, to secure the homeland, and to generate long-term \neconomic growth, but it will also provide critical funding for \nAmerica's children and our national transportation system.\n  As a new member of the Budget Committee, this has been my first \nopportunity to work on the Federal budget in depth. The week the \nPresident's budget was released I read the entire thing from front to \nback. Since then, I have studied the summary tables for each of the \nbudget functions and have worked through the costs and benefits of the \nPresident's economic growth and development plan. As an accountant and \nbusinessman, I believe I have a unique understanding of the President's \ngrowth package and the budget, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \npass this budget as introduced.\n  I would like to speak specifically about the President's economic and \ngrowth package for a moment. I have taken the last several weeks to \nclosely analyze that Economic Growth and Jobs Plan because I think we \nmust ensure that each initiative will act as a stimulus and not as just \nanother expenditure. While I have a degree in accounting, you do not \nneed to be an accountant to know we cannot spend our way out of debt. \nAccounting does not work that way. We either have to increase revenue \nor decrease spending in order to balance the budget in the coming \nyears.\n  I had a little lesson right after the first of the year in balancing \nbudgets and the importance of it. The President asked me to go to \nBrazil and represent the United States at the inauguration of the new \nPresident down there. I was delighted to make the trip. It was quite an \nadventure. They invited heads of state to their inauguration, unlike \nour inaugurations, and the heads of states around the world do respond. \nThere were 130 countries represented.\n  They take the credentials on a seniority basis that goes to heads of \nstate and then crown princes and then vice presidents and eventually it \ngets down to the delegation that we had over there. We were 40th in \nline, so there were a lot of heads of state there. I had an opportunity \nto talk to many heads of state. Our delegation had an appointment every \nhour with a different head of state or with a cabinet member of the new \nPresident, and a meeting with the new President.\n  He is from a leftist government, so it was interesting to find out \nwhat he had in mind for his country. One that was particularly critical \nto him was balancing the budget. He recognized that the future of his \ncountry depends on that more than, perhaps, any other item that he can \ndo. He is also interested in moving the programs to as close to the \npeople as possible, giving them flexibility and reducing the \nbureaucracy.\n  That sounds like a lot of the issues I have been talking about, and I \ndo not consider myself to be leftist, but I did notice with most of the \nheads of states to whom I spoke, they did put an emphasis on that \nbalancing of the budget. I am convinced that is what we can do for this \ncountry to ensure the future of the country, and the sooner it is \npossible to do it, the more important it is--but the more sure that we \ncan do it, the more important it is.\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\n  Unfortunately, while the Federal Government accounting offices are \ngood at estimating expenditures, they are not very good at projected \nrevenues. They use static numbers. That means that no matter what kind \nof economic plan we have, those numbers are not going to be reflected \nin any budget, toward helping to balance the budget at all. Keep that \nin mind when we are talking about budget here.\n  The static numbers provided by the Congressional Budget Office do not \ntake into account the long-term positive effects of the President's \ngrowth package, the effects that would have on the economy. I believe \nthis erroneously skews the debate. Positive results should be reflected \nalong with negative results, and increased revenues should be taken \ninto account when making decisions about an economic growth package.\n  The answer to improving our economy is not through increased \nexpending of Government programs. You cannot spend yourself into a \nbetter economy. Try that on your own budget. It works kind of the same \nway. You have to do it with the Government by growing tax revenue from \nthe private sector.\n  As we know from past economic reports, dollars invested by private \ncompanies tend to circulate through the private sector nearly twice as \nmuch as those spent by the Government on domestic programs. Some of \nthose estimates go up as high as seven times when you spend in the \nprivate sector as opposed to spending in the Government sector. For \nexample, when one business buys something, the business that sold it to \nthem receives the money. The business that sold it to them turns around \nand spends it at another company, which takes it and spends it at \nanother company, which spends it. Some say this action circulates the \ndollar as many as seven times through the economy--seven taxable times \nthrough the economy. That is one of the differences between a \ngovernment expenditure and a private expenditure.\n  The result is the efficient use of capital and more Federal revenue. \nThe trick is to get the private sector into that expanded mode fast \nenough that the tax revenue comes in at greater amounts than had been \nanticipated. From past times we have seen that providing an economic \nplan, providing some tax relief, has stimulated the economy. It can do \nthat again. But what we are talking about is the efficient use of \ncapital; where it can be best applied to get the best results.\n\n  This does not mean we have to decrease spending for critical programs \nin order to spur investment. Instead, I believe we must hold our \nspending in check and then increase revenue by creating an environment \nthat allows businesses to grow and subsequently pay more into the \nFederal pot.\n  We need to grow the economy back to where it was before the recession \nthat started 3 years ago, and then was added to by September 11, and \nthen we have to grow it beyond.\n  When I first got to the Senate, the first item of business was a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. We were going to force \nourselves to balance the budget. I have to tell you, the constitutional \namendment came within one vote of passing--one vote. I have to tell \nyou, that was pressure from the American people, and we paid attention \nto it in this body and we began balancing the Federal budget. When we \ndid, the economy skyrocketed. That is what can happen if we have a plan \nfor getting back to a balanced budget. We can grow the economy faster \nthan it grows right now.\n  It wasn't that we cut spending during that time. Lord knows, we did \nnot cut spending. But we increased the revenues. That is the key. It is \neasier to balance the budget when you rapidly increase the revenues. \nThat is what I think the President's economic growth plan will do. I \nbelieve the President's proposal is the most effective engine for \nspurring that growth.\n  We need to aid the people and businesses that make up our economic \nmachine and get it moving down the tracks at full speed again. That is \nthe businesses, particularly the small businesses.\n  The President's economic growth package makes sense. Eliminating the \ndouble taxation on dividend income is fair and right, as income should \nnot be taxed twice. The proposal will eliminate the current tax bias \nagainst equity investment, and because a little over 50 percent of \nAmerican households own equities, it will benefit a wide range of \nincome levels.\n  I have to mention, there are seniors in this country who have done \nsome planning for their retirement, and one of the ways they did that \nwas to pick out companies that pay dividends, and to pick out companies \nthat pay dividends in different months so they get a dividend check \neach month. I will tell you, those senior citizens know what it is to \nhave their income taxed twice. In fact, they have a lot of instruction \non unfair taxation that falls on them.\n\n  Further, eliminating the double taxation may encourage investors to \nreward companies that pay out a healthy dividend, not just by \npurchasing their stock but by purchasing the stock at a higher multiple \nof corporate earnings.\n  I have to tell you, that balance can be paid out. That has to be real \nmoney. That cannot be phony accounting. That straightens out some of \nthe accounting process. Look to the dividends.\n  The President's proposal to accelerate the 2001 tax cuts will rightly \nput money back into the hands of hard-working taxpayers. I believe the \nmost important acceleration would be the reduction in the highest tax \nrate because sole proprietorships, partnerships, and subchapter S \ncorporations are taxed at that level.\n  We talk about it as though it were a few wealthy individuals. I had \npeople talking to me about the unfair double taxation of dividends \nbefore the President ever mentioned it. It was coming from Wyoming \npeople who had small businesses who have grown those small businesses \nand have grown them very successfully. They started to mount as regular \ncorporations rather than subchapter S corporations. They were able to \nbuild those businesses. They have very successful businesses with some \nretained earnings now that could go into some other projects, but they \nare not about to pay that out if they have to get taxed on it one more \ntime. They already paid the tax. They do not think it is fair to be \ntaxed on it again.\n  As some of you know, I owned a shoe store in Gillette, WY. So I \nunderstand this subchapter S and C corp taxation and know that those C \ncorp small businesses are taxed at a different rate. Subchapter S \ncorporations pay at the individual rate. And for many of those in \nbusiness, because of the money that is flowing through the \ncorporation--not money they are getting, money flowing through the \ncorporation, money they are putting back into inventory and equipment \nand buildings so they can grow that company--they are paying taxes on \nit, if they have it as a subchapter S corporation, and they are paying \nit at the highest individual rate, which cuts into the amount they can \nput back into the business.\n  So, simply put, the more money that corporation has to pay in taxes, \nthe less money they have to invest in inventory, to maintain the \nbuilding, or, more importantly, to hire more people to take care of \ncustomers--jobs.\n  As such, I think reducing this tax burden on small businesses will be \nthe most effective growth mechanism. I also believe the President's \nefforts to encourage long-term economic growth, through higher \nexpensing caps for small business expenditures, is extremely helpful \nand long overdue. Again, the money that they are investing in equipment \nand buildings would be able to be written off quicker, which would \nencourage them to go ahead and make those expenditures sooner, which is \nshort-term growth for the economy. Months and years before the \nPresident released his growth package, small business owners from \nWyoming were asking me for that kind of relief as well.\n  I have to tell you, it is small business that has been building this \ncountry. For the past several years we have had the megamergers, we \nhave had a big company buying up another huge company. The numbers they \ntalk about from those purchases are absolutely astronomical to me. I \ndon't even have the concept for how much money they are talking about. \nBut one of the things I have noticed is, after they make that \nmegamerger, they have what they call a downsizing, or a \n``rightsizing.'' I call it laying off people--10,000, 20,000 people \nlaid off.\n\n  Until the decline of 3 years ago--and actually up until about a year \nago--the\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nslack from those megamergers was being picked up. Those people were \nbeing hired. Those people were being put to work. Those people were \ngiven jobs. Where? In small business. Small business was growing the \neconomy. They are able to define a niche and able to provide a need. \nAnd they are able to respond to change quickly. That is the advantage \nof small business.\n  Fortunately, we have people in this country who are willing to take \nthe risk of developing a special niche, filling a need for this \ncountry, and selling the people of this country on that need. That is \nwhat has grown the business. A lot of those little businesses have \ngrown into very big businesses, but that is how they started.\n  That is where we really need to fuel this engine. We need to fuel it \nfrom the small business aspect. We have that opportunity. We have that \nopportunity with the President's economic growth plan. I hope we will \ntake advantage of it.\n  Small businesses should not bear the brunt of taxes. As corporations \nstruggle to meet income projections and cost reductions, small \nbusinesses are the ones providing jobs and putting food on the table \nfor our working families. They are the ones growing the jobs. Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of the American economy, and we must allow \nthem to grow and prosper.\n  While I support the President's plan and the package we assumed in \nthe budget resolution, it is important to remember the Budget Committee \ncannot dictate how the Finance Committee structures the tax package. \nThis resolution simply reconciles the Finance Committee to reduce \nrevenues by $698 billion, which is consistent with the President's \ngrowth plan. I urge my colleagues to support the reconciliation package \nwithout amendment.\n  During this uncertain time, we must be mindful of the fiscal impact \nof the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq. These are threats we may \nnot be able to avoid, and we must be prepared to provide the resources \nnecessary to keep the men and women of our armed services safe and \nstrong.\n  However, I caution my colleagues. We should not add the cost of the \nwar to the baseline of our budget. God willing, this war will be short, \nif it happens. And we should not treat it as an ongoing expense. We \nshould not put it in as a baseline so that next year we can build from \nthat baseline at even greater expenditures. It has to be treated as a \none-time emergency.\n  Mostly, I fear that the money used this year to fund the war will be \nswallowed up next year by the spending machines we can't wait to dip \ninto as a new pool of money.\n  Finally, in closing, I would briefly like to mention another issue \nthat is important to the people of Wyoming and to many Senators who \nhail from rural States. This issue is drought assistance. During the \nBudget Committee markup, I worked with my colleagues to include a sense \nof the Senate that would direct Congress to develop a long-term drought \nplan and establish a reserve that would fund emergency and disaster \nassistance to livestock as well as agricultural producers hurt by \ndrought.\n  I think this provision goes a long way in making a clear statement \nthat we are systematically preparing for the negative impacts of \ndrought and other disasters through a long-term strategy rather than a \nknee-jerk reaction.\n  Something that has disturbed me in the budget for our country has to \ndo with our knowledge of impending disasters. We don't know which \ndisasters they are; we don't know where they are going to strike; we \ndon't know what they are going to be or we might be able to do more in \nthe way of prevention. That just isn't the way Mother Nature works. But \nwe do know every year--since I have been here, and looking back several \nyears before that--there are around $6 billion worth of disasters in \nour country.\n  We do not budget for that. We treat them strictly as emergencies. \nAnybody in the private business sector who knows there is going to be a \nhuge expenditure builds that into the budget. I am hoping, through a \nprocess, we can eventually get to the point where the known \nemergencies--that is, the known amount of dollars of the emergency--\neven though we don't know which they are or where they will occur, that \nthey will be provided for up front as part of the budget.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator is speaking so well on these \nissues as an accountant. I think he is the only accountant in the \nSenate, and a small businessman himself. I would like to ask this \nquestion on the double taxation.\n  I have heard economists and others, like Larry Kudlow, for example, \nsay that big corporations are withholding earnings. They are not paying \nthem out in the form of dividends because they are taxed. And they are \nretaining those earnings. Then they are using those earnings, when they \ndon't know what to do with them, basically, to buy up small competitive \ncorporations. Does the Senator think, based on his experience in \nbusiness, that could be one factor in the consolidation of big \nbusinesses more and more in America? And is that unhealthy for the \ncountry?\n  Mr. ENZI. I think our tax system has encouraged companies to get \nbigger and to enfold more kinds of operations into their current \noperations, even if they were not compatible with the current \noperation, just so they could do as you have expressed, avoid some of \nthe double taxation there would be on dividends and also drive up the \nprice of the stock by making these other acquisitions.\n\n  Growth, sometimes, of another business will drive up the price of the \nstock because it increases the number of sales for the host \ncorporation. It did not increase the number of sales for the purchased \ncorporation, but by adding that to the new one or by sticking some \nother units out there, they can drive up the stock prices. We have seen \na number of mechanisms for being able to drive up the stock prices.\n  I do expect we will see kind of a reversal in the way companies have \nbeen doing that. If we can put some plans in place to better stimulate \nsmall businesses, we will see some of those big businesses spinning off \nsome of the businesses that they have had before, taking the cash, \npaying some dividends and increasing the value of their stock based on \nthe true accounting, the cash that they are able to generate. They will \nbe able to do that because they won't have that double taxation burden \nsome of the investors look for, those opportunities. They don't want to \nreceive the dividends. They want to see the increase in stock value \ninstead. So instead of encouraging cash to be distributed so they can \nput it into the economy, perhaps for smaller business earnings, it is \ngoing exactly the opposite way.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Just to follow up, is it the view of the Senator that \nby eliminating the double taxation on dividends, this would encourage \nbusinesses to distribute dividends to shareholders and not hoard it and \nend up purchasing and consolidating their business interests, expanding \nit by purchase of competitive smaller businesses?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Alabama is absolutely correct. It will \ngrow a lot of new businesses. It will put it in the hands of people who \nwill be looking for opportunities of small businesses that fill niches, \nand there will be money available for small businesses through venture \ncapital to be able to get the money to put that idea they have had in \nplace for a long time and actually produce the product, market the \nproduct, get it out there where it is providing a service to people and \ngrowing the business at the same time. It will change the way people in \nthis country invest. It will improve the way corporations operate.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution as reported by the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am pleased to yield 25 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before my friend from Wyoming leaves the \nfloor, I want him to know I listened carefully to his arguments. I had \ndifficulty following the argument that we\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nshould not include any funding in the budget for the war in Iraq. I am \nsure he has attended--I have seen him there--a number of meetings where \nwe have listened to the Secretary of Defense and others say we couldn't \nproject what the war is going to cost because we didn't know what other \nallies were going to contribute, how many troops they were going to \nhave, what they were prepared to spend. Now on the eve of the \nPresident's statement, we have a very good idea about where the burden \nof this conflict is going to fall. It is going to fall on American \ntaxpayers.\n  I am troubled about why we don't include any of that in the budget. \nWe know it cost $25 billion to send the service men and women over \nthere. That is a CBO figure. It will cost $25 billion to get them back. \nWe know now that to build the Iraqi oil industry, if we were to go in \nthere today without any kind of impact or any destruction, it is going \nto cost about $15 billion more to bring it up to speed. We know that \nelectricity is about half pace and it is going to cost another $10 \nbillion to bring that up to speed. We are trying to bring Iraq back to \nits former self. We know that communications is about half speed and \nthat will cost another $10 billion.\n  We know we will need a minimum of 50 or 75,000 troops. General \nShinseki says 200,000 troops. General Nash, a previous commander over \nthere in the first Gulf War, mentioned a couple hundred thousand \ntroops. We had 70,000 in Bosnia. It is difficult for me to think that \njust as an opener we will not need $50 to $75 billion. I find it \ndifficult to understand why we are not including that and discussing \nthat when we are talking about the budget for the future, when we know \nwe are going to have to get the expenditures.\n  As I heard, the argument was, we don't want to put it in because it \nwill be part of a baseline in terms of future spending, which suggests \nthat we are not rational enough or sensible enough or responsible \nenough to be able to deal with these figures down the road.\n  I don't want to be unfair to my colleague from Wyoming. If I don't \nhave it right, I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Budgets are the way a nation sets its priorities, and the priorities \nin the Republican budget are profoundly wrong for America. It fails to \naddress the real problems of real families. It appears to have been \ndrafted in a sound-proofed room so that the voices of working men and \nwomen, students and senior citizens could not be heard. It's a harmful \nrehash of the same failed economic policies that have caused so much \nmisery and pain for so many Americans.\n  In the 2 years since President Bush took office, the well-being of \nAmerican families has declined at an alarming rate. Ask most Americans \nhow their lives have changed since President Bush took office, and they \nwill tell you. Declining job security. Disappearing retirement savings. \nPlummeting school budgets. Rising college tuition. Skyrocketing health \ncare and prescription drug costs. Duct tape and plastic sheeting \ninstead of real steps to make neighborhoods secure. Federal budget \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. The White House has not only failed \nto feel their pain, it has made their pain worse.\n  Even when it comes to the Government's highest obligation--the safety \nof our country--this budget falls short. Al Qaeda and other terrorist \ngroups are planning every day how they can inflict yet another terrible \nact of terror on our soil. We deserve better than duct tape and orange \nalerts to protect our communities from terrorism. We need a budget that \nensures that fire fighters and police officers and health care workers \nand other first responders have the resources and training they need to \nprotect us. We need to protect not only our airports, but our seaports \nand bridges and schools and other public buildings.\n  At the same time, President Bush is preparing for a new war with \nIraq. At this very moment, a quarter of a million American men and \nwomen in uniform are poised in the Gulf, awaiting the order from their \nCommander-in-Chief. They are prepared to sacrifice their lives for \ntheir country. Even after the war, we face an uncertain future in Iraq \nas we struggle to win the peace. We all know that to do the job right \nin Iraq may well require a huge commitment of dollars and troops over \nmany years, and it is far from clear that we will have significant \nsupport from other nations in this mission.\n  But what does this budget propose? Yet another round of tax breaks \nfor the very wealthiest Americans.\n  How will more tax breaks for the wealthy hire more qualified teachers \nto teach our children? How will another tax break for millionaires help \nworking men and women get job training and find a new job? How will \nanother tax break for the wealthy help families afford health insurance \nor provide prescription drugs under Medicare? How will another tax \nbreak for the wealthy help them recover their lost retirement savings? \nHow will another tax break for the wealthy win the war against \nterrorism? How will a mountain of budget deficits help us build a \nbetter future for our children? And how will more tax breaks for \nmillionaires help us defeat Saddam Hussein?\n  With the economy in shambles and continuing threats from terrorists, \nthese are not normal times. Our responsibility in Congress is to pass a \nbudget that meets the challenges of our times. Instead of more tax \nbreaks for the wealthy, we should be concentrating on our national \nsecurity and our economic security.\n  We should enact no further permanent tax breaks until the costs of \nwar with Iraq are determined. Giving our troops everything they need to \ndo the job, and to do it safely, should come first.\n  Surely, when our troops come home, we want them to come home to \nbetter schools, not schools facing drastic budget cuts, fewer teachers, \nand with crowded classrooms. We want them to come home to a strong \neconomy, with jobs that let them care for their families and save for a \nsecure retirement. We want them to be able to afford health insurance \nand look forward in their retirement years to a strong Medicare program \nthat helps them afford the prescription drugs they need.\n  This budget fails these tests. It rejects the steps needed to restore \nthe economy, and instead embraces ideologically rigid policies that \nhave not worked and will not work. In 2001, President Bush pushed a \n$1.3 trillion tax cut through Congress that disproportionately benefits \nthe wealthiest taxpayers. Now, the administration is seeking an \nadditional $1.6 trillion in tax cuts, even more heavily slanted toward \nthe rich. That is not the solution to the problems facing working \nfamilies. That is a strategy that will only add to their problems.\n  These problems have grown steadily worse since President Bush took \noffice in January 2001. Certainly, his policies are not the sole cause \nof the economic downturn we have witnessed in the last two years. The \nstock market began its decline before he took office, and so did the \nrecession. The economic shock caused by the September 11 attack was \nbeyond his control. However, the response of the administration to \nthese economic challenges has been ineffective. The President's single-\nminded commitment to tax cuts for the wealthy as the cure for every \neconomic ailment has made a bad situation worse. The administration has \nignored remedies that would provide a significant short term stimulus, \nwhile undermining our long-term economic strength. As a result, the \neconomy continues to stagnate, and the number of families facing \nhardship continues to grow.\n  Huge numbers of working men and women have lost their job security. \nAs layoffs mount, they live in fear of being the next to be let go. \nThere are two and a half million fewer private sector jobs in America \ntoday than there were just two years ago. Those looking for a job are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to obtain one. The number of long-\nterm unemployed workers has increased by nearly 200 percent since \nPresident Bush took office. The Bush administration is the first \nadministration in fifty years to have a net loss of private sector \njobs. In the face of these problems, Republicans have been slow to \nsupport an extension of unemployment benefits. They continue to oppose \nassistance for one million workers facing long-term unemployment and \nfor hundreds of thousands of part-time and low-wage workers who \ncurrently receive no benefits.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows the 2.5 million private sector jobs \nthat have been lost in the last 2 years. From\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\n111.7 million jobs in January 2001, to 109.2 million in February of \nthis year.\n  Health insurance is becoming less and less affordable for millions of \nworkers and their families. Over two million more Americans are without \nhealth insurance today than there were two years ago. One in ten small \nbusinesses which offered their employees health insurance in 2000 no \nlonger do. The average cost of health insurance is rising at double \ndigit rates--up by 11 percent in 2001 and another 12.7 percent in \n2002--nearly four times the rate of inflation. The health care squeeze \non working families is getting tighter and tighter.\n  The cost of higher education is rising beyond the reach of more and \nmore families. The gap between the cost of college tuition and the \ntuition assistance provided by the federal government has grown by \n$1,900 in the first 2 years of the Bush administration. Yet, \nRepublicans oppose efforts to meaningfully increase financial aid for \nqualified students. As a result, the number of worthy students being \ndenied the chance to go to college is growing each year.\n  For millions of families, their retirement savings have seriously \neroded in the last two years. The value of savings in 401(k) plans and \nother defined contribution plans has declined by $473 billion in the \nlast two years. The value of individual retirement accounts dropped by \n$229 billion in 2001. The 2002 data are not available yet, but given \nthe poor performance of the stock market, it will be another steep \ndecline. Many middle-aged workers who thought their retirements were \nsecure are suddenly being forced to consider staying in the workforce \nlonger and reduce their standard of living in retirement.\n  These are the realities American families face today. It is no \nsurprise that consumer confidence has dropped more than fifty percent \nsince President Bush took office.\n  The fiscal well-being of the Federal Government has suffered as \ndramatic a reversal as the financial well-being of America's families. \nWhen President Bush took office, CBO projected a $5.6 trillion surplus \nover the next ten years. Two years later, that surplus has disappeared. \nCBO's most recent projection is a $378 billion deficit over that same \nperiod. Part of the surplus disappeared with the economic downturn, but \na major portion of it was dissipated by the policies of the Bush \nadministration. It is even more disturbing that the White House has not \nlearned from this sad experience. If Congress enacts the proposed \nbudget submitted last month by the Bush administration, the deficit \nwill grow to over $2.1 trillion. These numbers have a serious real \nworld impact. The President's plan would make it impossible for the \nFederal Government to meet its most basic obligations to the American \npeople.\n  To all these problems, the Bush administration has one answer--more \nand more tax cuts predominately benefitting the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  In this current situation, the most irresponsible action Congress \ncould take would be to accept the proposal of the Bush administration \nto enact major new permanent tax cuts. The combined cost of the \nPresident's plan to exempt dividend income from taxation, accelerate \nthe tax cuts for the upper income brackets, and make the 2001 tax cuts \npermanent would be over $1.3 trillion in the next 10 years. This \nimmense increase in the deficit would also trigger an additional $300 \nbillion in interest costs on the larger national debt. We cannot afford \nthe loss of an additional $1.6 trillion from the Treasury. Temporary \ntax cuts to stimulate the economy are affordable, but the President's \nlarge, permanent tax breaks are not. If the Bush plan is adopted, the \nFederal Government will not have the resources to meet urgent domestic \nneeds in education, in health care, and in homeland security. Even more \ntroubling, their plan will make it virtually impossible for us to keep \nthe commitment of Social Security and Medicare in future years.\n  If Congress accepts the budget which Senate Republicans have \nproposed, the on-budget deficit will be nearly four trillion dollars by \n2013. That fact is not in dispute. The number comes right from the \nChairman's mark. The cumulative on-budget deficit in fiscal year 2013 \nwill be $3.948 trillion--an extraordinary amount. More than three-\nquarters of that amount is directly attributable to the Bush tax cuts \nenacted in 2001 and the additional cuts proposed in 2003.\n  The impact of these new tax cut proposals is clear from the \nadministration's own budget. When the President says ``no'' to \nobviously needed spending on urgent domestic priorities such as \neducation and health care, he says the war on terrorism requires us all \nto tighten our belts. The burden of these sacrifices falls mainly on \nlow and middle income individuals and families. The President refuses \nto ask the wealthiest taxpayers to share the burden.\n  In the midst of his repeated calls on others to sacrifice, he is \nadvocating over $1.3 trillion in new tax breaks--$726 billion for his \n``economic growth'' package and $624 billion to make the reduction of \nthe higher brackets and the estate tax repeal permanent--primarily for \nthose with the highest incomes. That policy is wrong.\n\n  As a result of the Bush tax plan already enacted, the wealthiest 1 \npercent of the taxpayers will each save an average of $50,000 a year, \nand now he wants to give each of them even more--an additional $25,000 \na year.\n  This chart indicates who benefits from President Bush's tax cut \nproposal. This is a Brookings analysis. We see on this chart $88,000 to \nmillionaires, $239 for working families.\n  It cannot be wartime for middle America, but still peacetime for the \nrich.\n  The Bush administration is using the recession to justify major new \npermanent tax breaks for the wealthy. Exempting dividend income from \ntaxation will take $400 billion out of the Treasury over the next 10 \nyears. Half of that enormous amount--$200 billion--will go directly \ninto the pockets of the richest taxpayers.\n  The information on this chart is from Citizens for Tax Justice. Under \nthe Bush plan to eliminate the tax on dividends, the richest taxpayers \nget half the savings, pocketing $200 billion; 49 percent goes to the \nrichest 1 percent; 31 percent goes to the next 10 percent. Effectively, \n80 percent of the benefit goes to the richest 10 percent.\n  The American people deserve better from the White House. We should be \nfreezing the rates of the top income tax brackets at their current \nlevel and maintaining the estate tax on estates over $4 million. We \nshould not be enacting any new permanent tax breaks for the wealthy \nwhen we are so clearly failing to address so many of our most basic, \nurgent national needs.\n  For the cost of reducing the tax rate--listen to this, Mr. \nPresident--for the cost of reducing the tax rate on the top income \nbrackets, we could provide the additional education funding needed to \nkeep the promise made in the No Child Left Behind Act for a decade. We \ncould fund that program for a decade.\n  For the cost of permanently repealing the estate tax on multimillion \ndollar estates, we could help to ensure that Social Security has the \nfinancial resources needed to keep the promise of a secure retirement \nfor future generations. That is the alternative.\n  For the cost of President Bush's newly proposed $726 billion package \nof additional tax breaks tilted to the most wealthy taxpayers, we could \nfully fund a generous program of prescription drug assistance for \nsenior citizens and extend health insurance to more uninsured families. \nThat is the alternative.\n  Which does this body want to do? Which of these choices will make the \nAmerican community stronger and better able to face the challenges of \nthe future? The decision to pass more and more tax cuts for the richest \namong us is a decision to ignore America's greatest needs. Now is the \ntime for Congress to bring our policies back in line with our national \nvalues.\n  The economy needs a real stimulus plan. A genuine economic stimulus \nmust meet three criteria. It must have an immediate impact, it must be \ntemporary, and it must be fair, bringing the recovery to all Americans \nand not just to the wealthy few. The Bush proposal fails on all three \naccounts.\n  Less than $40 billion of the $726 billion cost of the \nadministration's plan would reach the economy in 2003 when it is needed \nto stimulate growth. That is, of the $726 billion of the President's \nproposal, only $40 billion of it would be stimulative right now, Mr. \nPresident. Most of the revenue will be spent long\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nafter the recession has ended. More than $570 billion of the total \namount would not be spent until 2005 or later. In contrast, our \nDemocratic stimulus proposals would put much more money into the \neconomy in 2003, with little additional long-term costs. Temporary tax \ncuts to stimulate the economy are affordable, but the President's large \npermanent tax breaks are not.\n  The cost of the new permanent tax cuts of the President's plan is so \nhigh--$1.3 trillion over 10 years--that it would dramatically expand \nthe deficit, leading to higher long-term interest rates. These higher \nrates could actually prolong the recession by making it more expensive \nfor businesses to borrow the money they need to grow. The overall White \nHouse proposal is unfair to most Americans. It will provide a tax cut \nwindfall to the wealthy few, while neglecting the needs of working \nfamilies, and it will not provide the timely and targeted stimulus the \neconomy needs.\n  The stimulus plan proposed by the Democratic leader would inject $140 \nbillion into the economy this year, and it is designed in a way that \nwill maximize the stimulus effect of each dollar. Half of the total \namount--$70 billion--would be used to provide immediate tax relief to \nworking families. Each person who pays either income tax or payroll tax \nwill receive $300, and families with children will receive additional \ntax relief. Thus, a family of four would receive a $1,200 tax cut this \nyear. It is a fair plan that will provide tax relief to the hard \nworking families who need it most and are most likely to spend it \nquickly. In designing a stimulus tax cut, it is particularly important \nto include relief for low wage workers who pay substantial payroll tax \nbut owe no income tax. The Democratic plan covers the millions of \nworkers in this category who are excluded from the administration's \nmuch more costly plan.\n  The Senate Democratic plan also provides immediate, targeted tax \nrelief for businesses to stimulate new investment. It accelerates \ndepreciation to 50 percent for this year and triples the amount small \nbusinesses can expense this year. The goal is to provide businesses \nwith strong tax incentives to invest in new plants and equipment now, \nrather than postponing those expenditures until further years.\n  Our plan also recognizes the dire fiscal problems that state and \nlocal governments across America are facing. These governments must \nbalance their budgets each year. When a recession cuts revenue sharply, \nstate and local governments must either raise taxes or cut spending. \nEither step will deepen and prolong the recession, and undercut our \nstimulus efforts at the Federal level.\n  It is also important to remember that more people need to rely on \nstate and local programs in an economic downturn. The number of people \neligible for Medicaid grows substantially in times of recession, and \nmany other costs rise as well. Without jobs and without health care, \nfamilies have no where else to turn. We should make certain that the \nneeded resources are available for them. The Democratic stimulus plan \nwill provide $40 billion to hard-pressed states and communities. It \nwill provide additional dollars to maintain health care, education, and \nsocial services. It will also help with the substantial costs of \ndealing with the threat of terrorism. It is money well spent which will \nhelp stimulate the economy now. Unfortunately, the Republican budget \ntotally ignores this need.\n  The American people face a health care crisis. The administration and \nRepublicans in Congress have responded with a budget that not only \nfails to address this crisis, but advances an extreme right wing agenda \nthat will make the crisis worse.\n  Every American family is experiencing some aspect of this crisis. \nHealth care costs are skyrocketing, and families with insurance are \nfacing unaffordable premium increases at the same time benefits are \nbeing reduced. The number of Americans without any insurance at all is \nunacceptably high and rising rapidly. No family with insurance today \ncan be sure that it will be there tomorrow if serious illness strikes. \nAnd for senior citizens, the national promise of affordable health care \nthrough Medicare is being broken every day because Medicare does not \nprovide prescription drugs.\n  In the face of this crisis, the administration and the Republicans in \nCongress have proposed a budget that pays lip service to meeting the \nneeds of senior citizens for prescription drug coverage, but fails to \nprovide resources that are adequate for the job.\n  Even worse, they have proposed to dismantle Medicare and force senior \ncitizens into HMOs and other private insurance plans in order to obtain \nthe drug benefit they are offering. They are proposing to use Medicare \nas a piggy bank to fund tax credits for the rich. Under the House \nbudget resolution, the Ways and Means Committee is directed to come up \nwith $214 billion in Medicare savings so that the wealthy few can \nbecome even wealthier.\n  It is no accident that the Bush administration's program depends on \nforcing senior citizens into HMOs and other private insurance plans. \nWhether the issue is Medicare or the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Bush \nadministration has consistently stood with the powerful special \ninterests that seek higher profits and against the patients who need \nthe medical care. If all senior citizens are forced to join an HMO, the \nrevenues of that industry would increase more than $2.5 trillion over \nthe next decade. Those are high stakes. There is a big reward for HMOs \nand the insurance industry if the Bush administration plan is enacted. \nBut there is an even greater loss for senior citizens who have worked \nall their lives to earn their Medicare, and that loss should be \nunacceptable to all of us. No senior citizen should be forced to give \nup the doctor they trust to get the prescription drugs they need. No \nbudget accepted by this Congress should put the interests of the rich \nand powerful ahead of the interests of senior citizens and their \nfamilies.\n  The Republican prescription for Medicaid is equally unacceptable. \nTheir proposal would victimize 46 million of the most needy and most \ndependent of our fellow Americans. The administration is proposing the \nsame type of destructive block grant program for Medicaid that the \nGingrich Congress failed to enact almost a decade ago. The Republican \nblock grant would leave many innocent victims in its wake--sick and \nneedy children and their parents, the disabled, and low-income elderly.\n  In each year's budget process, the Bush administration shows less and \nless support for education. At a time of enormous unmet student needs, \nit is shameful for the President year after year to submit anti-\neducation budgets that provide zero overall growth in financial support \nfor education and that cut priority programs for schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 25 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I get 5 more minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to provide to the Senator whatever time \nhe consumes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is shameless for this administration \nto talk about the promise of the school reforms contained in the No \nChild Left Behind Act while submitting a budget to cut the resources \nnecessary to make school reform a reality for millions of children.\n  The administration proposes massive new tax breaks for the wealthy, \nbut it has no compunction in proposing that over 6 million needy \nchildren must be left behind for every year for the foreseeable future. \nThe administration has no hesitation in proposing that over half a \nmillion children be dropped from after school programs.\n  It even proposes to cut aid to the schoolchildren of the Nation's \nsoldiers serving in the war against terrorism who have been sent off to \nfight a war against Iraq.\n  The Senate Republican budget before us rejects the President's cut on \nthe Impact Aid Program for military schoolchildren, but it still cuts \nfunding for the No Child Left Behind Act school reform bill by $700 \nmillion.\n  On this chart, if we look at the years 1997 to 2001 in terms of \nsupport for education, it was an 11-percent increase on average during \nthat period of time. Now these figures are the requests, not the actual \nnumbers: In 2002, 3.6 percent increase requested by President Bush; \n2003, 2.8 percent; and for fiscal year 2004, half of 1 percent. These \nfigures\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\nwere up higher because of the work that was done ultimately on the \nfloor of the Senate, but these are the budget requests over the past \nfew years.\n  In the past, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have worked \ntogether to reject the Bush administration's anti-education budgets by \na substantial bipartisan majority, and we should do the same this year. \nWe have to make sure Congress lives up to its promise to leave no child \nbehind.\n  At the same time, we have to provide more college students with \nfinancial aid to meet rising tuition costs. The President proposes not \none penny, not a single penny, in individual student Pell grants. \nWithout an increase in Pell grants, over 110,000 students are in danger \nof being shut out of college.\n  The gap between the cost of college tuition and the level of tuition \nassistance has grown by $1,900 since President Bush took office. Yet \nthis budget does nothing to narrow that gap.\n  Young Americans now have an average of $17,000 in student loan debts. \nLow- and moderate-income students face more than $3,000 in annual \ncollege costs not covered by financial aid, work study, or savings. \nThis budget does nothing to help these students.\n  Just as Social Security is a promise to senior citizens, we should \nmake education security a promise to every young American. If one works \nhard, finishes high school, is admitted to college, we should guarantee \nthat they can afford the costs of the 4 years it takes to earn a \ndegree. That was President Kennedy's goal in the 1960s and it must be \nour mission today, and we will fight on the Senate floor this week to \nmake the dream of a college education a reality for all. We will fight \nthis month, this year. We will not stop because the fight is for \nAmerica's future.\n  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, this budget fails to include the \ncosts of the impending war in Iraq. The Senate Republican budget \ncontains no money to pay for the war in Iraq, which may begin in a \nmatter of hours, and no money for the cost of occupying and rebuilding \nIraq after the war.\n  The President has refused to submit a cost estimate to Congress \ndespite repeated requests. Over 200,000 military personnel have been \nmoved into place for the war; 90,000 more are on their way. Many of \nthem are from the National Guard and Reserve. They had to be mobilized \nespecially for this mission. The Pentagon is already soliciting \nproposals from major contractors for the rebuilding of Iraq, yet the \nadministration continues to stonewall us on the costs of the war.\n  The President knows that the overall costs will be enormous and is \nobviously afraid of sticker shock when he discloses the facts to the \nAmerican people. The President does not want to tell Congress what the \nwar will cost until his tax cut proposals are locked in. He is afraid \nif he tells us, Congress might do something sensible, such as reducing \nthe size of the tax cut to help pay for the war. That is the last thing \nthis administration wants--Congress making responsible fiscal \ndecisions.\n\n  So instead, this Republican budget is asking us to pretend that the \nwar is not on the horizon. The Senate of the United States cannot \naccept such a sham. Let's do the responsible thing: Pay for the war \nwith Iraq and the aftermath before we have another tax cutting raid on \nthe Treasury.\n  The timing of the President's tax cut could not be worse. We already \nhave record deficits. We are about to go to war. We have never cut \ntaxes in wartime before in the history of the country, and now is not \nthe time for new permanent tax cuts.\n  The Republican budget fails to provide even one dollar to address the \ncosts of the impending war with Iraq. It places more tax breaks for the \nwealthy ahead of the needs of our men and women in uniform who are \nmaking the greatest sacrifices. Funding for their needs should be our \nhighest priority, not an afterthought.\n  As I have said, it cannot be wartime for most Americans but still \npeacetime for the wealthy. The wealthy should have to wait for their \ntax cuts, at least until the costs of the war and reconstruction of \nIraq are addressed.\n  I thank our ranking member for the time he has yielded, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield whatever time he consumes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss \nthis important issue. This week we are going to be discussing a number \nof critical issues, as has already been mentioned by a number of those \nwho have spoken. It is expected that the possibility of war with Iraq \nwill come closer, if not become a reality, sometime in the near future. \nAt the same time, we are debating probably the biggest economic issue, \nand the biggest issue for the management of this country, that the \nSenate will deal with this year, as we put together the budget \nresolution. In that context, I will basically give a brief overview of \nhow we got to where we are, where it is that we are, and the decisions \nwe will be making.\n  Many people will remember that a few short years ago we were talking \nabout major surpluses across the board and for as far as we could see \ninto the future. In fact, I have in front of me a projection that was \nbased back in January of 2001, which estimated that in this budget year \nthat we are working on right now, the 2004 budget year, the surplus was \nprojected to be around $396 billion. This same sheet shows what the \nprojection today is as opposed to what was projected in the year 2001, \nand the projection is around a $199 billion deficit. In other words, \njust for the budget year in which we are working, the projections over \nthe last essentially 2-plus years have gone from a projection of a $396 \nbillion surplus to a $199 billion deficit.\n  Now, what caused that? We will hear a lot of debate about what caused \nit. In fact, it has already been said today that President Bush's tax \ncut from a few years ago caused it, that President Bush's economic \npolicies have caused it. In reality, we are going to see some of the \nnumbers that have been put together.\n\n  What happened is that on 9/11 the United States was attacked by \nterrorists and people saw the World Trade Center collapse. People saw \nwhat happened very vividly as the United States responded to the fact \nthat we were at war with terrorists. Following that, there were massive \nincreases of spending at the Federal level; spending required to \nrespond to the 9/11 attacks; spending required to address the war \nagainst terrorism, for example, the war which we have fought already in \nAfghanistan; spending to deal with our homeland security; spending to \ndeal with strengthening our national security and preparing ourselves \nto be sure that America and Americans are safe throughout the world as \nwe deal with an increasingly dangerous world.\n  In addition to that, spending has gone up on health care. Spending \nhas been driven up in a number of the other social areas of our budget. \nWe saw very little relief, if not in fact dramatic increasing \npressures, for spending in the last 2 years. At the same time, the \neconomy collapsed.\n  I will put up our first chart. We have seen this chart already today, \nbut this chart shows that at the same time our spending started to go \nthrough the roof, as spending started to go up dramatically, revenue, \nwhich is the blue line, dropped off dramatically. The revenue dropped \noff dramatically for a number of reasons. It has been said that the \nrevenue dropped off because of President Bush's tax cut. In part, that \nis true, because although that tax cut was phased in over 10 years and \nalthough most of that tax cut has not even occurred yet and cannot be \nthe responsibility of these declines in revenue, a part of it was. \nThere was tax relief, and as a result of that tax relief there was some \ndecline in revenue. However, let's go to the next chart.\n  This next chart is another way of looking at the same thing. Again, \nthe blue is revenue and the red is spending. The revenue since 2000 has \ngone down precipitously. The spending in Washington has not. This is \nanother way of showing we are facing the dual problem of increasing \npressures on spending and reducing our falling revenue to support the \nFederal budget.\n\n  Why did the fall-off on revenue happen? This chart shows what \nhappened in our economy. This is the Nasdaq. Starting in 2001, it hit \nabout 5,000. It is now down to--when the chart was\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\nmade--around 1,200 and is hovering in that neighborhood today, about a \n75-percent reduction in the values just on this market. The same type \nof charts could be put here for the New York Stock Exchange or for \nother exchanges across the world which have seen worldwide dramatic \nreductions in economic activities.\n  Virtually everyone who pays any attention to the economy these days \nknows the bubble popped and the economy went into a serious collapse. \nMany have called it recession. We have held dozens of hearings in \nWashington to understand what happened, why it happened, and how soon \nwe will be able to climb out. People know about the Enron debacle, the \nWorldCom debacle, and the loss of confidence the American people have \nin our markets today, which loss of consumer confidence has generated \nfurther difficulty in the economy. People are also aware we are \npotentially going to have to go to war in Iraq. That cloud over the \neconomy itself is generating the kind of lack of confidence in economic \nactivity that causes us to have difficulty in seeing a rebound in the \nmarkets.\n  The next chart shows what it was that caused us to see the dramatic \nchange in our deficit. This chart shows the year 2004. There are charts \nthat can predict it out for 10 years and add in some of the proposed \nstimulus package. But this chart shows what caused us to end up where \nwe are today in the budget.\n  Over half of the problem we are facing is what I have been \ndiscussing, the weak economy and changes in the estimates of what \nrevenue will be coming into the Federal Government through our current \ntax and revenue structure. As I indicated, a portion is attributable to \ntax relief, although this is static scoring, and if one looks at what \ntax relief does to the economy, I suspect that number will go down \ndramatically. Static scoring shows nothing but 100 percent loss of \nrevenue for any tax dollar relief.\n  But we know when there is tax relief, that causes an impact in the \neconomy. That dollar is not spent by the Federal Government but spent \nsomewhere else, and if the relief is effectively projected, it could be \nsignificant. So this number could be reduced significantly. But even if \nwe use static scoring and say a tax cut reduces revenue, dollar for \ndollar for the Federal Government, only 19 percent of what we look at \nnow is attributable to the tax relief we passed a few years ago in the \nSenate and the House. That is another 6 percent for tax relief not \nattributable to the vote a few years ago and the increased spending.\n  Take just the increased spending that has been caused in Congress by \nSeptember 11, the war on terrorism, the need to beef up our national \nsecurity, the increases in health care costs, and a number of other \ncost drivers we have in our budget. Take the increased spending and the \ncollapse of the economy. It represents 75 percent of why we are where \nwe are.\n  I suspect during the week we will hear how President Bush's economic \nplan caused us to be where we are. Here are the facts. There will be a \nlot of projections and a lot of charts, but nothing can change the \nreality of what happened on September 11, what our response to it has \nbeen, and what happened in the economy following that. That, in a \nnutshell, is what caused us to end up where we are.\n\n  With that explanation of what happened, we get to a situation where \nthis economy has put forward a budget. I will be rough in my numbers \nbecause I don't have the charts in front of me. If we do nothing, if \nthis committee simply says we will keep Federal spending at its current \nlevels--we will not drive it up or down, we will not reduce taxes or \nincrease taxes, we will take current law as it now sits--someone could \ngive me a more accurate number, but it is in the neighborhood of $150 \nto $200 billion of deficit, if we do nothing.\n  The question is, Should we do something? Should we cut spending in an \neffort to keep the difference down? Should we raise taxes? I don't \nbelieve there is anyone who is suggesting raising taxes right now is a \ngood idea. But there are those who are suggesting because of this, \nbecause the economy is no longer contributing what it was contributing \nbefore, and because if we learned any lesson in the last few years, it \nis that the way to get out of these economic difficulties in the \nFederal budget is to have a strong, flexible, dynamic, vibrant, \nresilient economy--if we want to do something to make this gray part of \nthe chart get stronger and become better in terms of generating revenue \nfor the Federal Government, then we should have some kind of a stimulus \npackage.\n  So the debate comes around: Should we cut spending? Should we freeze \nspending? Should we keep spending controlled? Should we reduce taxes? \nShould we have a stimulus package? And if so, what, and how?\n  Looking at the spending side of this equation, the spending drivers \nin this budget are the beef-up in our national security. In fact, these \nnumbers do not even include the possibility of a war with Iraq. I will \ntalk about that in a moment. The increase in our national security \nspending, the increase in the costs of fighting the war on terrorism, \nthe increases in homeland security, and the increases in health care--\nand there are a few others--are the main drivers of the increases in \ncosts in this budget. I don't believe there are very many in the \nSenate, or in America, who would say right now is the time to cut \ndefense spending or right now is the time to cut homeland security \nspending. We can hold the line, and we are going to do that, and this \nbudget does put significant pressure on holding those lines, but there \nis not a lot of room in the circumstances we see right now to reduce \nthose spending areas, although we will work our hardest to do so. I \nbelieve we will do so in a bipartisan fashion to get to the right \nnumbers on the budget.\n  To make a quick aside, I have fought for a balanced budget amendment \nfor years. I still believe we should have one. As I and others have \nfought for a balanced budget amendment, one of the examples for \nexceptions we have always acknowledged is we could see a situation \nwhere we would need to tolerate deficits for a period of time if we \nwere facing war or a national emergency declared by the President. \nToday I believe those circumstances face us. I believe we are at war \ntoday with terrorists. I believe it is very possible we will be at war \nwith Iraq soon. And I believe we face a national emergency in terms of \nour homeland security needs. Those are the unfortunate realities that \ncause us to have very little flexibility on the spending side of this \nbudget, although again I say we are going to do everything we can to \nbring it under control on the spending side.\n  The question is, What do we do then, after we have done everything we \ncan on the spending side? By the way, contrary to some of the arguments \nheard today, the budget proposed works its way back to a balance. It \ntakes 10 years to do so. I am very disheartened by the fact, with the \nspending pressures we see and with the revenue drop-off we have seen, \nthat our projections are going to take us 10 years to get back into \nbalance. The fact is, this budget balances over the 10-year period.\n  What do we do when we look at this revenue side? The question is, Do \nwe do nothing? There are those who have advocated today that we should \nnot have any tax relief. One argument is, have no tax relief until we \nknow what the cost of the war is. Another argument is, have no tax \nrelief because we should not have tax relief when we face this kind of \nspending pressure in the budget. And when we face these kinds of \nproblems we have talked about that legitimately cause us to have to \nincrease expenditures in major categories, we should not be looking at \ntax relief.\n  There is another side of the argument, and that side of the argument \nis, unless we do something to give a basic boost, a shot in the arm, a \nrevitalization to our economy, we will see the grow-back of this \nweakened economy be much slower. It gets back to that argument about \ndynamic scoring, of what a tax cut really will do. That is one of the \nreasons President Bush has proposed--and this Budget Committee has \nproposed to the Congress--that we have tax relief.\n\n  As our chairman of the Budget Committee has indicated, this Budget \nCommittee does not write the tax bill. We simply tell the rest of the \nCongress, and in this case the Finance Committee, how much money we are \nwilling to budget for them to utilize in establishing a tax cut. Then \nthe Finance Committee can come together and, in\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nits best wisdom, craft the most effective tax cut designed, in their \nopinion, to do the best for our economy.\n  That having been said, there are proposals out there. The President \nmade his proposal. This budget accommodates the President's proposal. \nThe President's proposal is to do basically three things.\n  It is to take the tax cut that we passed in the year 2000 and make it \npermanent. Most people in the country never quite understood why it was \nthat Congress would pass a tax cut and make it only last for 10 years, \nphase it in over 10 years, and then have it expire basically as soon as \nit is phased in. It has to do with some interesting procedural \nrequirements on the floor of the Senate which I will not get into now, \nbut the fact is the tax cut which was implemented a few years ago will \nexpire in 10 years, and the first part of the President's plan is to \nmake it permanent.\n  The second part is to say we should not phase it in over 10 years. We \nshould accelerate it and implement it all now.\n  The third part has a number of pieces, but the core of it is \nelimination of double taxation on dividends.\n  Let's put up the next chart.\n  There is a big attack on this. Frankly, in all these areas the attack \nstarts out--you will hear this said dozens of times in the next few \ndays--it is a tax cut for the wealthiest of Americans.\n  I have been in Congress now 10 years. I served 6 years in the House, \n4 years in the Senate. I am in my fifth year in the Senate. Over that \n10 years, in virtually every year I and others like me who want to see \ntaxes cut and reduced, when we have fought for tax relief, every single \nsolitary time that we proposed a tax cut of any kind or nature, it has \nbeen attacked as a tax cut for the wealthy. Every time. Even when all \nwe did was propose the marriage tax penalty elimination, it was \nattacked as a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  The common rhetoric of those who do not support reducing the Federal \ntax burden begins with ``a tax cut for wealthy Americans,'' because the \nattack is that any tax cut is going to benefit the wealthy. If you look \nat the numbers, as to who pays taxes in America, it is primarily those \nin the upper income brackets who pay by far the largest percentages of \nthe taxes. So if you look at actual dollars, you can make that \nargument.\n  But if you look at what is being done in the tax relief proposed by \nthe President on a proportional basis, on a percentage basis, the \nbiggest amount of tax relief is going to those in the lower income \nbrackets.\n  As this chart shows, those earning from zero to $30,000 will have \ntheir taxes reduced by 17 percent. Those earning from $30,000 to \n$40,000 will have their taxes reduced by 20 percent. In the $40,000 to \n$50,000 category, the reduction is 14.5 percent.\n  You can see as you go up in income categories, until you get past the \n$75,000 to $100,000 figure, the higher percentage reductions are all \noccurring in the lower brackets. The higher income brackets have the \nlowest percentage of income reduction.\n\n  Again, one could take the actual dollars, but because very few \nnumbers of Americans fit in these categories proportionately, but they \nmake the higher levels of income, a smaller reduction in their taxes is \ngoing to give them a higher dollar benefit and people can use dollar \nnumbers to show that. But the reality is that the higher percentage of \nrelief is going to those in the lower income categories. It is pretty \nmuch impossible to have a tax cut, unless it is just a tax cut for the \nlower brackets, that doesn't have some relief across the board, and \nthen allow those to make that argument about the tax cut for the \nwealthy.\n  In my opinion, it is class warfare. It is attempting to say those at \nthe upper ends of the income brackets in America should have no tax \nrelief and all tax relief should be favored toward this end, toward the \nlower income brackets. What happens if you follow that logic is that \neventually no tax cut is ever acceptable because the tax down in these \ncategories gets to the point where, no matter what you do with it, \nunless you eliminate it, it doesn't generate the revenue reductions or \ndoesn't generate the stimulus to the economy that is necessary to get \nthe impact that is desired. That is where we are today. That is why we \nare seeing these arguments.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that every time we try to cut taxes in \nthis Congress the first response is that whatever the tax is that is \nproposed to be reduced, it is a tax cut for the most wealthy Americans.\n  Let's go back to the chart I just took down. With regard to the \nproposal that we eliminate double taxation of dividends, Charles \nSchwab, the founder and chairman of Charles Schwab Company, indicated \nin a Washington Post commentary on March 11 of this year:\n\n       I can't think of any other tax policy that would, at one \n     stroke, be more beneficial to ordinary investors.\n\n  I suspect somebody could say only rich people invest, and therefore \nthis is a tax cut for the wealthy. But I do not think that argument is \ngoing to be made too strongly on the floor this week because most \nAmericans are now involved in the markets in one way or another, even \nif it is only through their retirement plans. But most Americans know \nit is critical to see things like the New York Stock Exchange and the \nNASDAQ and others get a boost.\n  Charles Schwab goes on to say:\n\n       The impact [of dividend relief] would be enormous.\n\n  I believe in that same commentary he indicated his personal belief to \nbe he would expect to see the stock market rise 10 or 15 percent with a \nrenewed bolt of confidence throughout the entire economy just by doing \nwhat the President has proposed with regard to the double taxation of \ndividends.\n  We have another financial expert in the country who has weighed in on \nthis issue, Alan Greenspan, on February 12, before the House Financial \nServices Committee:\n\n       In my judgment, the elimination of the double taxation of \n     dividends will be helpful to everybody.\n\n  I think he was responding directly to this notion that it only helps \na certain class in society. He was responding to this class warfare \nargument that continues to be brought up as we try to address tax \npolicy. He said:\n\n       There is no question that this particular program will be, \n     net, a benefit to virtually everyone over the long run, and \n     that's one of the reasons I strongly support it.\n\n  The reason it is strongly supported by these experts is because \ntoday, as has been indicated by others who have spoken on the floor, \nthere is very little incentive in a corporation to generate dividends. \nThat is because, if those dividends are paid out, they are taxed twice. \nAs the chairman of the committee indicated, the net tax burden is about \n70 percent. Whereas, if the corporation instead incurs debt, and \nfurther leverages itself, then it gets a deduction for that debt or it \ngets a deduction for a portion of the debt costs. So it can actually \nget a tax benefit for going further into debt, and it pays a tax \npenalty if it sends out dividends to its shareholders.\n  What we have seen is corporations increasingly following this path \nbecause of the pressure that is put on them by our Tax Code, putting \nthemselves further and further into leveraged positions which I believe \nis one of the reasons we saw what happened to Enron. That is why Enron \nhad to go through these incredibly complicated sets of transactions to \ntry to mask the amount of debt it was really carrying. It is the same \nwith many other corporations.\n\n  If we want to encourage corporate America, which generates strength \nand jobs for this country and the families which depend on those jobs, \nif we want to generate pressure in the business community for the kinds \nof proper decisionmaking that will give us stable, strong businesses \nthat will generate strong and lasting jobs, then we need to address the \npolicies by which we tax them. We need to encourage policies that will \nsupport dividend payment rather than debt. That is one of the reasons \nwhy you see so many experts saying it is critical for us to move into \nthis new kind of tax policy.\n  The question is--given it is good policy--can we do it now with this \nvery dire budget situation we face? That is a tough question. It is a \ntough question for me to answer because in the short term it will cause \nour deficits to go up, although the amount of that is in discussion and \nin dispute because some will use static scoring, and some will use \ndynamic scoring, and we really don't know the dynamics of it.\n  There will probably be charts here today that show all these \nprojections\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nhave the potential to be widely inaccurate; and we all agree with that. \nBut the fact is, we do know there is a dynamic that occurs when we \nchange our tax policy, and the experts are telling us that dynamic will \nbe beneficial to making our economy more flexible and more resilient.\n  So the question is, Do we take this stand now? Do we do what is \nnecessary to give a boost to the economy, realizing it may take a \nperiod of years for the real strength of it to build us back to where \nwe have made our posture stronger, do we sit tight and do nothing now \nand hope the economy grows out of it on its own or, as some will \nprobably suggest, do we spend ourselves into prosperity? Does the \nFederal Government take the position that we need to have a lot of \nspending, a lot of stimulus in the economy, and we should just not \nconcern ourselves with the deficit but spend ourselves back into a \nstrong position economically?\n  As you might guess, I strongly reject that ``spend ourselves back \ninto prosperity'' argument. It will probably never be said that way \ntoday or throughout this week. But I encourage people who follow this \ndebate to note, when amendments are proposed, do those amendments drive \nup the deficit or do they not? Do those amendments drive up Federal \nspending or do they not?\n  Let's go back to that first chart with the lines, because as we \ndebate amendments on this budget, the amendments will generally have \none of two or three impacts. They will either be deficit-neutral, which \nmeans they could increase spending by increasing taxes or they could \nreduce taxes, which is reduce this line, or they could increase \nspending, which is this line.\n  I think it is very important for people to pay attention to the \namendments that are offered because this whole week I hope we do not \nget any amendments on the floor that would drive the deficit up with \nmore spending. I would hope we would recognize the deficit increases \nthat are caused by the tax reductions can be addressed with an \nunderstanding of the dynamic impact they will have over time.\n  Just a couple of other arguments I want to address.\n  It has been said the proposals of this budget spend the Social \nSecurity trust fund. I understand what is being said there. Let me \nclarify what the situation is because I do not believe Americans should \ngo away from this debate believing that somehow the Social Security \ntrust fund is being robbed. The fact is, regardless of whether the tax \ncut is eliminated from this budget or whether it is put into this \nbudget, the Social Security trust fund, at the end of the 10-year \ncycle, will be about $4.1 trillion. It will be the same trust fund no \nmatter what happens. Because what occurs is that, in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, the excess that comes in from payroll taxes that \nis not spent out into the Social Security system is a part of that \nsurplus. That surplus is turned into Federal debt instruments.\n\n  Then, what are those Federal debt instruments used for? Spending, or \nfor tax relief, or for whatever is a matter for Congress to address. \nBut the fact is, those Federal debt instruments are there, and they are \nstill there to protect Social Security.\n  My last point. Some have said we should not do anything because we \nare possibly going to be going to war. Again, the argument there seems \nto be that tax relief is not wholesome for the economy; therefore, we \nshould not be doing anything to destabilize the economy.\n  I believe what I have said indicates where I come down on that point, \nthat the fact is we must do something to stimulate and strengthen this \neconomy. The medicine we need is in the President's proposal and is \nmade possible by the projections of this budget.\n  Although we will face some very expensive and very difficult budget \ndecisions, if the United States goes to war in Iraq, that simply \nincreases the need for us to do our best to make this economy strong \nand to do what we can, through our tax policy decisions, to put us in \nthe best posture to have a flexible, resilient economy in these \ndifficult world circumstances. So for all these reasons, I encourage \nthis Senate to support this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business \nand I will use my leader time to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3791-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3791-S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALUTING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, about 3 months ago, a remarkable \ndiscovery was made. In an abandoned storeroom in the subbasement of \nthis Capitol, two Senate staffers discovered the long-lost, handwritten \npayroll records of the Senate from 1790 to 1870.\n  The ledger contains a vast wealth of information about the birth and \nthe history of this Senate. It also contains authentic signatures of \nJohn Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr. Historians say it is very \nlikely the only document in the world signed by all three of those \ngiants of American history.\n  Three days after it was found, I was able to hold that ledger in my \nhands. Every page I turned revealed more legendary names: James Monroe, \nGeorge Mason, Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John \nCalhoun. It was a rare privilege to be able to hold such a tangible \nlink to the giants of this Senate. For the last 16 years, I have had \nthe privilege to be able to serve with--and learn from--a living link \nto those giants: the incomparable senior Senator from West Virginia, \nRobert C. Byrd.\n  Today, we celebrate yet another milestone in Senator Byrd's \nextraordinary career. As of today, Senator Byrd has served in Congress \nfor 50 years, 2 months, and 14 days. Since the beginning of our Nation, \nonly two Members of Congress have served longer than Senator Byrd.\n  For the last 44 years--more than half his life--Senator Byrd has \nserved in this Senate--longer than all but one other Senator. I come to \nthe floor today to congratulate Senator Byrd on reaching this historic \nmilestone and to thank him for the many lessons he has taught me and \nfor the kindnesses he has shown me over these many years. I also thank \nErma Byrd, Senator Byrd's wife. I have heard Senator Byrd say often \nthat he could not do this job were it not for her support and her love. \nI thank Mrs. Byrd for sharing so much of her husband with their State, \nand our Nation, for so long.\n  At the beginning of our Nation, there was another couple who shared a \ngreat passion for democracy and public service. Their names were John \nand Abigail Adams. On July 3, 1776, the day the Declaration of \nIndependence was signed, John Adams wrote to Abigail about the world-\nchanging events that had occurred that day in Independence Hall in \nPhiladelphia. In that letter, John Adams wondered whether future \ngenerations would understand how much the signers of the Declaration \nhad risked so that the Americans who would come after them could know \nfreedom.\n  Somewhere, I think, John and Abigail Adams must be smiling down on \nSenator Byrd. In these anxious days, when some argue that the United \nStates must curtail some of our Constitutional rights, or rewrite the \nbalance of powers in our Government, Robert Byrd reminds us that \nprincipled compromise is a worthy goal--but our basic constitutional \nprinciples themselves must never be compromised.\n  Robert Carlyle Byrd seems as much a part of West Virginia as the \nAppalachian Mountains themselves. In fact, he was born, in 1917, in \nNorth Carolina. After his mother died of scarlet fever, his father gave \nhim up before his first birthday. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle, \nwho took him to West Virginia's coal country. His family had little \nmoney.\n  After graduating from high school and working for a time as a butcher \nin a coal company store, he yearned for a political life. He began that \npolitical life in 1946, when he was elected to the West Virginia state \nlegislature. Six years later, he was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. And 6 years after that, he was elected to this Senate. \nTwo years ago, he was elected to his eighth term in the Senate. Only \none Senator--Strom Thurmond--ever served longer in the Senate. He is \none of only a handful of Senators ever to cast 15,000 votes in this \nbody.\n  Over the years, Robert Byrd has served as majority leader, minority \nleader, President pro tempore and\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\nPresident pro tem emeritus of the Senate, not to mention Democratic \nwhip and chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations. He is the preeminent historian of the Senate and the \nauthor of the definitive history of this institution. He is a legendary \norator. His speeches cover everything from the great issues of the day \nto the framers of the Constitution and the need for civility in the \nSenate to the virtues of the King James Bible and even the greatness of \ndogs. He is a master of the Senate's rules and traditions. Two years \nago, he offered to share his knowledge of those rules with newly \nelected Senators. Most of the new Senators took advantage of those \npriceless tutorials. So did a few Senators who had been around for a \nlot longer.\n  All of his life, Robert Byrd has been driven by the desire to know \nand understand more. He was already serving in the Senate when he \nearned a law degree from American University in 1963, after a decade in \nnight school. He received his bachelor's degree from Marshall \nUniversity in 1994.\n  Besides great constitutional issues, another development that always \nprovokes eloquence from Senator Byrd is when one of his fellow Senators \nmarks a personal milestone. I was deeply touched by his beautiful words \nto my family and me on the birth of my first grandchild nearly a year \nago. I know those words were not easy ones for a man whose heart still \nbreaks over the death of his own grandson 20 years ago. And my family \nand I treasure them.\n  Last November, the New York Times ran a profile on Senator Byrd on \nthe occasion of his 85th birthday. The article described how, during \nthe debate on the homeland security bill, Senator Byrd would come to \nthis floor every day and, for hours, voice his concerns about what he \nregarded as serious flaws in the bill.\n  The reporter asked Senator Byrd: ``Why are you spending so much \ntime--and irritating some of your fellow Senators--prolonging a battle \nyou're sure to lose?'' Senator Byrd replied, ``To me, that question \nmisses the point, with all due respect to you for asking it.'' ``To \nme,'' he said, ``the matter is there for a thousand years in the \nrecord. I stood for the Constitution. I stood for the institution. If \nit isn't heard today, there'll be some future member who will come \nthrough and will comb through these tomes.''\n  To that, I will add a prediction of my own: Years from now, Americans \nwill read the name ``Robert C. Byrd'' and they will read the words of \nthis extraordinary Senator. And when they do, they will feel that same \nrespect and gratitude I felt when I held that ledger in my hands and \nlooked at the names of some of the giants of our past. Robert C. Byrd \nis a vital link to the patriots who created our democracy . . . I am \nhonored to know him and serve with him, and to call him my teacher and \nfriend.\n  By the way, on December 2, 2009, Senator Byrd will become the \nlongest-serving member in the history of Congress. I look forward to \ncelebrating that day with him and to the many days I hope to be able to \nserve with him and learn from him between now and then.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3792-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3792-S3798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to respond briefly to my colleague \nwho spoke previously on the question of the budget before us. He put up \na chart that showed just the effects in 2004 and said that the tax cut \nwas not the biggest reason for the decline in our fiscal condition. But \nlet us recall that the chart he put up was for 2004 alone.\n  The President's proposals are not 1-year proposals. They are \nmultiyear proposals. Two thousand four is one of the years where the \ntax cuts have the least cost and the least effect. The reason for that \nis the tax cuts that have already been passed and the tax cuts the \nPresident has proposed are back-end loaded.\n  The biggest cost comes toward the end of the 10-year period. When we \nlook at the whole 10-year period of 2001 going forward, what we see is \na much different picture than our colleague from Idaho showed.\n  There we see that the biggest single reason for the decline in our \nfiscal condition is the tax cuts. We can see, just as a reality test, \nthe tax cuts already passed, including the interest cost, are $1.7 \ntrillion. The tax cuts going forward, the President has proposed, \nincluding interest costs, are $1.96 trillion. That is a total of nearly \n$3.7 trillion. The decline in our fiscal circumstance is $7.7 trillion. \nSo just as a reality test, the biggest single reason for the overall \ndecline in our fiscal condition is the tax cuts.\n  The next biggest is the spending that occurred because of the attack \non this country, 27 percent. Twenty six percent is also revenue \ndecline, revenue decline not attributed to tax cuts but because there \nwas an overestimation of revenue. The smallest part of the reason for \nour declining fiscal condition is the economic downturn.\n  Our colleague from Idaho also said that this budget balances by 2013. \nIt does on a so-called unified basis. That is when you put all the \nmoney in the same pot--all the money from whatever source going in the \npot, all the spending coming out of that pot.\n  I have never believed that that is the right way to handle Federal \nrevenue and Federal spending because, for example, the Social Security \ntrust fund ought to be treated differently. All the money should not go \nin the same pot. You should not be taking operating expenses out of \nSocial Security revenues. We didn't put on a payroll tax to raise \nrevenue to pay for the other functions of Government. We raised payroll \ntaxes in order to pay for Social Security benefits.\n  In the year 2013, the amount of money from the Social Security trust \nfund that will be used to pay the operating expenses of the Federal \nGovernment will be $331 billion.\n  That doesn't strike me as a balanced budget. No private sector firm \ncould take the retirement funds of their employees and use them to fund \nthe operating expenses of the company. If you tried to do that, you \nwould be on your way to a Federal institution, but it would not be the \nU.S. Congress.\n  On the issue of who benefits from the tax cut, the Senator showed \npercentage reductions for various income categories. But if we look at \nwho gets the dollars, we get quite a different picture. This is from \nthe Department of Treasury. It shows those earning $30,000 to $40,000 \nget, on average, $252. Those earning over $200,000 get $12,500. And if \nyou earn over $1 million, you get an $88,000 tax cut. It is true that \nthe wealthy pay a higher proportion of taxes in this country than do \nthe rest of us, but they don't pay that much more.\n  Our friends always want to exclude payroll taxes. The fact is, 80 \npercent of American taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than they pay \nin income taxes. So that has been left out of the calculation \ncompletely.\n\n  Finally, on the question of what do we do about our circumstance, I \nwas glad that our colleague put up a chart that showed the revenue of \nthe Federal Government and the spending of the Federal Government. It \nis both of those elements that create deficits. So if you have a tax \ncut that costs $100 billion, that adds $100 billion to the deficit just \nlike if you spent $100 billion.\n  In this budget proposal, even though we are already in record \ndeficit, they propose cutting another $1.4 trillion. With interest \ncosts, that will be an additional deficit of $1.7 trillion. I don't \nthink you can stand up and be against deficits and, on the other hand, \nvote to explode them. You either walk the walk and talk the talk, or \nelse you wind up where we are headed, which is into deep deficit and \ndeep debt.\n  The fact is that we are not making the choices that are going to be \nnecessary. If we are going to have that level of tax cut, then you have \nto cut the spending to offset it, unless you want to put it on the \ncharge card, create deficit.\n  Finally, the Senator from Idaho indicated that some of us are \nadvocating doing nothing. Well, I am not advocating doing nothing. I am \nadvocating that, with our country in the position of record deficits, \non the brink of war, with not a dime of war costs in this budget, it \nwould be wise for us not to add new spending unless it is for national \ndefense or homeland security--not to add additional tax cuts, unless it\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nis for a stimulus package for the economy, until we know more about \nwhat this war cost might be.\n  It seems to be common sense to me that we know more about our \ncircumstances. I will offer an amendment tomorrow that does that. It at \nleast creates a 60-vote point of order against new spending, unless it \nis for national defense or homeland security, and it will preclude \nadditional tax cuts unless they are for a stimulus package because it \nseems to me to head off the cliff on the brink of war is \nextraordinarily unwise.\n  With that, I thank the Chair. Does the Senator seek time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I do. I would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama and my \ncolleague from North Dakota. I also thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his tremendous work on this budget.\n  Mr. President, I can really think of only one word to describe the \nbudget now before the Senate. In the middle of a war on terrorism--and \non the eve of a war in Iraq--this budget offers a huge tax cut to the \nfew, projects massive deficits for decades, and ignores the cost of war \nin Iraq.\n  There is only one word for that approach: reckless.\n  Lacking in caution--reckless.\n  Deliberately courting danger--reckless again.\n  It is time for a reality check. Hundreds of thousands of our soldiers \nare poised on the knife's edge, ready to perform their duty at any \nmoment. On this critical day, we hope and pray for their safety, \nsecurity, and speedy return. There is no doubt that Congress will \nprovide for our soldiers, both on and off the field of battle.\n  We know it will cost a lot of money. We know the money is well spent \nin keeping our Nation's best and brightest as secure and safe as \npossible.\n  But the cost of winning this war and winning the peace afterward is \nnot reflected anywhere in this budget. That is irresponsible. That is \nburying our heads in the sand as the danger approaches. I cannot \nimagine any American family going out and running up their credit cards \nwhen they know they are going to have a major expense in the next \nmonths.\n  Ignoring the financial costs of war will not make those costs go \naway. Driving our country further into debt will certainly make it \nharder for us to pay those bills when they come due.\n  Mr. President, the only word for that approach is ``reckless.'' This \nbudget would pile on record deficits, give a tax cut to the few, and \nignore the costs of war and peace. But even worse, this budget doesn't \neven adequately fund the basics, such as homeland security, education, \nand transportation.\n  A budget is a statement of priorities. In an environment where we \ncannot fund everything, we have to make choices based on our values. I \nthink we have to get our priorities straight.\n  Today, we are fighting a war on terrorism, we are on the brink of a \nwar in the Middle East, and we have many other international \nchallenges, including North Korea and Iran. Historically, when our \nNation is facing war and so many challenges, we sacrifice, we make \nevery dollar count, but not in this budget.\n  I cannot recall another time in our history when we have faced so \nmany challenges, yet have been so reckless with our budget. This budget \nwould provide a massive giveaway to the few, while our sons and \ndaughters fight a war overseas. That is not sacrifice, that is not \nresponsible and I think it is wrong.\n  The President's budget, with its freewheeling tax cuts and lack of \nsacrifice in the face of war, is more appropriate for the roaring \ntwenties than for the challenges we face today, in 2003.\n  I am very skeptical of a budget that says we can have it all, even as \nwe stare down massive financial commitment for years in places such as \nIraq. Ignoring the cost of war and its aftermath is reckless. Running \nup huge deficits to fund a misguided tax plan is reckless. Failing our \nneeds at home, such as homeland security, border security, education, \nand transportation, is reckless.\n  Just look at homeland security, which will become, by the way, even \nmore important if our country is at war. September 11 showed us, in a \nmost horrific way, that we are vulnerable at home. Our intelligence \nofficials have told us that another attack at home is not a question of \n``if'' but ``when.''\n  We know our first responders--our firefighters, EMTs, and police will \nbe on the front lines if, Heaven forbid, there is another attack. I \nrecently got a letter from Kelly Fox, president of the Washington State \nCouncil of Firefighters. They represent 6,500 firefighters in my State. \nThese are the people who are in the trenches of the homeland security \nfront. They told me they don't have the training, the equipment, or \nstaffing to respond to various attacks.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a letter that Kelly Fox, president \nof the Washington State Council of Firefighters, wrote to me:\n\n       Let me assure you, we are prepared to do whatever is \n     necessary to protect the citizens of this State--even if it \n     means putting ourselves in harm's way. Although the job we \n     need to perform in this war on terrorism is familiar, the \n     magnitude of the challenges before us is unprecedented--as \n     the enemy now comes to our cities and towns.\n\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       Last August, Congress (led by a Democratic majority in the \n     Senate) provided President Bush $2.5 billion in emergency \n     homeland security funding, for him to release to local police \n     and fire departments if he thought it was needed. \n     Regrettably, he rejected that funding and vowed, ``we'll \n     spend none of it.''\n\n  President Bush held back hundreds of millions of dollars for \nequipment, training, and other needs for our first responders.\n  Fifteen months ago, we were told that $3.5 billion was being \nearmarked for first responders in the Bush administration's fiscal year \n2003 budget. But to date that money is nowhere to be found. \nFirefighters in Washington and across our Nation have received plenty \nof praise and accolades since 9/11. We have been invited to many photo \nops.\n\n       But our cities and towns, our counties, our fire districts, \n     and their fire departments are still waiting for that \n     funding. In fact, our State has yet to see a dime of money \n     that was promised by the Bush administration to help our \n     firefighters and paramedics.\n\n  Kelly Fox speaks for 6,500 firefighters in my State. We need to heed \nhis call.\n  Last year, Congress passed funding for homeland security. The \nPresident rejected it. The President then actually blamed Congress for \nnot funding homeland security.\n  The bottom line is we must fund the security needs in our \ncommunities--from our fire departments and police departments to State \npublic health labs. With States facing budget deficits, first \nresponders need our help to protect our citizens. We can do better than \nthis budget. I will support an amendment to adequately fund homeland \nsecurity, and I will likely even offer my own amendment.\n  I am also concerned that this budget does not provide enough funding \nfor education. When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we passed \nit based on two commitments. First, we would hold schools accountable \nfor their progress. And second, we would provide schools with the \nresources to meet those new requirements. Those two always went \ntogether--otherwise schools cannot make real progress. But now it seems \nthat Congress and the President have forgotten about the funding part. \nWe still have an obligation to fund the new requirements that Congress \nimposed on local schools. We cannot leave local schools holding the \nbag, so I intend to offer an amendment to fully fund the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  I also think this budget falls short in supporting our transportation \ninfrastructure. We know that transportation problems plague our biggest \ncities and isolate our rural communities. In my home State of \nWashington, our inadequate transportation network is hindering our \neconomy, our productivity and our quality of life.\n  When we make sound investments in our transportation infrastructure, \nwe create good jobs today, and we build the foundation for our future \neconomic growth. When we make our transportation systems more \nefficient, more productive, and safer, that will pay real dividends for \nour economy and our communities. Throughout this process, I am going to \nsupport efforts to adequately fund our transportation infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\n  Another area where this budget is severely flawed is in its treatment \nof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is an important and unique national treasure. It is the only \nconservation system in North America that protects a complete spectrum \nof arctic ecosystems. It is the most biologically productive part of \nthe Arctic Refuge. And it is a critical calving ground for a large herd \nof caribou, which are vital to many Native Americans in the Arctic. \nEnergy exploration in ANWR would have a significant impact on this \nunique ecosystem.\n  The proponents of this measure argue that over the years, energy \nexploration has become more ``environmentally friendly.'' While that \nmay be true, there are still significant environmental impacts for this \nsensitive region. Exploration means a footprint for drilling, permanent \nroads, gravel pits, water wells, and airstrips.\n  The oil reserves in ANWR--in fact, the oil reserves in the entire \nUnited States--are not enough to significantly reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. There are four ways to really reduce our need for foreign \noil.\n  First, we can increase the fuel economy of our automobiles and light \ntrucks. That will reduce air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, \nsave consumers significant fuel costs, and reduce our national trade \ndeficit.\n  A second way to reduce our need for foreign oil is to expand the use \nof domestically produced renewable and alternative fuels. That will \nreduce emissions of toxic pollutants, create jobs in the United States, \nand reduce our trade deficit.\n  Third, we can invest in emerging technologies like fuel cells and \nsolar electric cars.\n  Fourth, we can increase the energy efficiency of our office buildings \nand homes.\n  These four strategies will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nprotect one of our Nation's most precious treasures.\n  Let us all remember that the amount of oil in ANWR is too small to \nsignificantly improve our current energy problems. The oil exploration \nin ANWR will not actually start producing oil for as many as 10 years. \nExploring and drilling for oil and gas at ANWR is not forward thinking. \nIt is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem.\n\n  Mr. President, these are just some of the flaws that make this budget \nreckless.\n  As I close, let me put this into context because I have served on the \nBudget Committee since 1993. During that time, I have seen our \ncountry's economy turn around twice now. In 1993, we started with huge \nbudget deficits. On the Budget Committee, we made tough decisions, and \nthroughout America families worked hard and got our economy moving \nagain. Employment rose; the stock market soared; and Americans \nbenefited from low interest rates and declining poverty.\n  But today it seems as if we are back where we started: the surplus is \ngone; we are facing looming deficits; Americans are out of work, and \nthey need help.\n  If the President and the majority in this Congress have their way, \ntheir plan will grow our Nation's debt from $5 trillion to over $12 \ntrillion as their plan reaches full maturity--$12 trillion. And for \nwhat? So millionaires can get an average tax break of $90,000, \naccording to the Tax Policy Center, and the rest of us get a $12 \ntrillion debt. That debt and our annual deficits will make it harder \nfor us to fund urgent national priorities. It will hit every American \nwhen they buy a house or finance a car.\n  I hope we can find a way to produce a bipartisan budget that \naddresses these issues for the benefit of the American people. Doing \nanything less would be reckless.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nAlabama desire?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Fifteen to twenty minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Alabama as much as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to speak \non this important budget issue, and I thank Senator Nickles for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Nickles and express my \nadmiration for him, quite sincerely, for the superb job he has done as \nchairman of the Budget Committee. It is a very important committee in \nthis Congress. He has handled it with great skill. He knows, and we all \nknow, that this year we need a budget.\n  Last year we did not pass a budget. Last year we did not pass 11 out \nof the 13 appropriations bills during the tenure of the Democratic \nleadership, and we were left to commence this year with the very \ndifficult problem of funding the Federal Government by passing in an \nomnibus bill 11 appropriations bills that should have been passed last \nyear before October 1 when the fiscal year began. We were operating on \na continuing resolution and operating in a way that made no sense if \nanybody studied it. If the American people had known how poorly we had \noperated last year, they would have perhaps been even more upset than \nthey have been with us.\n  This year, we have a Budget Act and we passed it out of committee. We \nhave it before the Senate. If we continue our timely operation, we will \npass it according to the time limits of the Budget Act. We will have a \nframework for our spending program in the Congress, and only then will \nwe know what our limits are and what we have to spend, what we can do \nin terms of tax cuts, and how we can stimulate and grow this economy. \nThose are the issues that I think are important.\n  I note, in response to some of the comments, my good friend Senator \nConrad complained that Senator Crapo had not been accurate or described \nthe full picture when he discussed the problems with surpluses this \nyear, the deficit this year, and how it occurred. What Senator Crapo \nsaid was absolutely correct. Senator Crapo pointed out that they had \npredicted a $300 billion-plus surplus this year, and with that \nprediction hanging out there, spending went up substantially the last \ncouple of years. Now with the economic slowdown and the 9/11 attack, \nthe stock market taking hits, those predictions have not been \naccurate. He posed a question: Why is there a deficit this year? Why is \nit being projected for next year? And he explained without dispute, I \nthink, that it was not the 2001 tax cut passed by this Congress and \nrequested by President Bush. It represented only 19 percent of the \nreduction in revenue. That 51 percent of the reduction in revenue to \nthe Federal Government was a result of the economic slowdown, and 24 \npercent of the disappearance of our surplus was the direct result of \nincreased spending.\n\n  The point he was making, and that is so important for us to know, was \nthat economic growth is the way we are going to get out of deficit. It \nis not counting numbers. It is what we can do to strengthen the \nAmerican economy, to get people working again.\n  There are some good aspects in the President's package for growth, \nbut one of them is ANWR. I flatly dispute the argument that if we could \nbring on the oil production out of Alaska, that the Alaskans want us to \nproduce, that would not positively impact our economy. As a matter of \nfact, the National Group of Unions has come before Congress and urged \nus, pleaded with us, to pass ANWR. Their estimates are that it would \ncreate 600,000 jobs. That is jobs in the United States of America.\n  When we buy oil from other countries such as Venezuela and Saudi \nArabia, who gets the jobs? People in those countries get the jobs. They \npay taxes to their countries on the income they make. If we had \nAmericans working on this pipeline and steel mills build the pipe and \ndo all that would be a part of this tremendous endeavor economically, \nthey would be paying taxes to the United States of America. When we buy \noil from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela, and places such as that, it is \na transfer of our wealth to those countries. We want to keep as much of \nthat wealth home as possible.\n  Does anyone think the environment is important in Venezuela? I do not \nthink they would. I submit that with the technology, and control by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the watching by the \nenvironmentalist groups, there is no doubt in my mind we will produce \noil cleaner in the ANWR region than we would in any of\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nthese other countries. So I believe that is a red herring, and it is a \ntremendous economic potential for us to work on that. So growth is \nimportant.\n  I also would point out to my friend, Senator Conrad, there is no \ndynamic scoring whatsoever in his numbers. They do not suggest there is \nany growth in the economy that comes from allowing people to have \nrevenue and be able to keep money in their own pocket. It does create \nan economic growth situation. That is unaffected, and it even becomes \nmore significant as the years go by in the outyears.\n  Our friends across the aisle are proposing some sort of growth \npackage, but it is very anemic, $300 or $350 per person. That is no \nanswer at all. What we want to do is get our country back on steady \ngrowth progress. If we can do that on a healthy level so that we are \nleading the world, as we have and really as we do today in terms of a \nlarge economy that is growing, I think we can make progress that will \nbegin to erase these deficits and we will not do it by taxing American \npeople more.\n  We have heard Senator Kennedy complain with gloom and doom that \neverything is going so horribly bad, this war is going to put us in \nbankruptcy, and the American economy is going to fail. Oddly, on the \nannouncement that hostilities may be nearby, the stock market has been \nsurging today. I do not think we should be so gloomy. I think we ought \nto see the possibilities for the future.\n\n  I say this about funding this war: We voted last October, and we had \na full debate by all the Members of this body. Senator Kennedy, I guess \nto his credit, from his point of view--and he is consistent--opposed \nthe war. But overwhelmingly, we voted to support it, 77 to 23. We \ntalked about the costs at that time. Everybody knew it was going to \ncost, and everybody knew it would be paid for by a supplemental because \nit is not a part of the normal defense budget.\n  We made a commitment to our troops. We have a quarter of a million \ntroops in the Iraq region, and they are prepared to put their lives at \nstake for us. I do not think there ought to be the slightest suggestion \nin any way that we are not going to honor that commitment. When we \ncommitted to put our troops there, we committed to pay the cost of it.\n  I, for one, believe we ought to keep it low. I believe we ought to \nget our troops out when the war is successfully completed, if it goes \nto a conflict, as soon as we possibly can. I think we ought to do \neverything we can to strengthen Iraq. But I do not believe this Nation \nshould permanently attach itself in a military way to Iraq, for a whole \nlot of reasons, and I do not think it is going to happen. I do not \nbelieve the Secretary of Defense believes that. I do not think the \nPresident does.\n  Some of these figures that are being floated around have been \nexaggerated. So we voted. We are going to back him. As a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I point out that on February 27 of this year, \nin a letter signed by our chairman, Senator John Warner, and the \nranking Democratic member, Carl Levin, they suggested clearly that we \nwould fund the costs of a war by a supplemental. In the letter they \nwrote on February 27, it says:\n\n       The administration is expected to request a supplemental \n     appropriations for these concurrent and future military \n     operations. We urge our colleagues' consideration for any \n     such request. We must show strong support of our troops in \n     the field.\n\n  Signed, Carl Levin and John Warner. \n  Now, that is what we have been doing all along, and everybody knows \nit. I know the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has been promoting \nthe idea--was quoted in the paper, and it came up at the Budget \nCommittee; now it has come up on the floor--that they would start \ncarping about the fact that we cannot have a budget until the President \nsets forth in detail exactly what money is going to be spent on this \nconflict, a conflict that has not even occurred yet. He should not be \nexpected to do that.\n  We had the Congressional Research Service to check on budgeting for \nwars in the past, and they stated this, if it makes any difference to \nanybody:\n\n       Presidents have not requested and Congress has not provided \n     funding for wars in advance of the start of operations. \n     Rather, administrations have requested funding after \n     operations have begun and Congress has subsequently \n     appropriated money to meet specific documented budgetary \n     requirements.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Congress has provided the executive branch with \n     considerable flexibility in financing military operations in \n     advance of specific congressional action on appropriations.\n\n  Of course, that is the way it has been historically because that is \nthe way it is. We cannot predict how these things are going to go with \ncertainty. I believe that is a red herring and an improper thing to be \nsaying now, to suggest that we may not be willing to fund this effort. \nWe are going to keep the cost as low as possible. But this Congress, \nthrough its vote last fall, when Democrats were in the majority, \nauthorized the President to act if he needed to and we would pay for \nit.\n  I will make a couple of points in general about where we are with the \nbudget and what we can do about it. The economy has been sinking. In \nfact, as I recall, during the last month of President Clinton's tenure \nin office, the economy was in negative growth. The President inherited \nan economy that began to stall. It began to make some progress, and \nthen there was 9/11, and the economy has not moved.\n  We do not need to get into recriminations or blame. The question is, \nWhat do we do now to grow this country, get our economy moving? That is \nthe question we ought to deal with. When there is a robust economy, \nunemployment falls. This allows American workers choices on jobs. \nCertainly some workers will be able to find a job and other workers \nwill have choices and can pick a better job.\n\n  Growth helps employment. It provides more overtime to workers and it \nprovides more revenue for the Government. That ought to make our big \ngovernment friends happy. The more people work, the more they make \novertime, the more they pay taxes, and the more we can spend it in \nCongress.\n  We clearly are at a point where we need to strengthen economic \ngrowth. Americans believe and the characteristics we display as a \nNation are to focus on growth in the private sector. Innovation occurs \nthere; investment occurs there; jobs are created there. That is how we \nmake progress as a nation. That is why we remain strong economically. \nWe are not where we want to be.\n  I saw recently unemployment in Germany was at 13 percent. The French \neconomy is in trouble. The Japanese economy has been in trouble for a \nlong time. Consistently, our economy has been stronger than the other \nindustrialized nations in the world. We have done it because we have \nbelieved in the private sector. We learned through the big government \nyears, it does not work. Tax and tax and spend and spend does not \ncreate jobs. We remember President Clinton made that dramatic \nannouncement, the era of big government is over. It represented the \ncollection of intellect and economic offense of tax-and-spend \ngovernment. It was a big deal when he said that. It was an important \nchange in our psychology.\n  I suggest we ought not go back to tax and spend. We need to watch \nwhat we do. We need to contain the growth in spending. We have another \ngrowth plan this year. We need not follow that European model that has \nstilted their economy.\n  It is the time of less taxes, less regulations, and a greater \ncommitment to the free market has allowed us to be a vibrant and strong \neconomy and allowed us to have money to spend on a military, have money \nto spend on incredible amounts for our research and health care, to be \nable to help the fight for AIDS around the world, because we have a \nstrong economy. We need to defend and cherish that aggressively.\n  There are a number of components of this tax package. I don't know \nwho my colleagues refer to as the rich, but let's talk about some of \nthe people who are going to benefit from eliminating the marriage \npenalty, reducing tax rates for all groups, accelerating and enhancing \nthe tax credit individuals get for children, enhancing the child tax \ncredit, and eliminating double taxation on dividends.\n  The President has proposed moving forward the cuts in the marginal \ntax rates. Those are the rates paid, depending on your income level, \nwith lower rates made retroactive to January 1 of this year, which will \ngive a stimulus to the economy. What does that mean? Tax brackets in \nexcess of the 15 percent\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nrate, already slated to decrease in 2004 and in 2006 based on the \nexisting law, will be made effective immediately. In other words, we \nare phasing in tax cuts and the reduction of that 15 percent rate at 10 \npercent and making that happen by 2006.\n  The President said let's make that effective immediately. These are \nworking Americans, lower-income working Americans. Currently, the tax \nbrackets in this range are 27 percent, 30 percent, 35 percent, and 38.6 \npercent at the top. The President's proposal will immediately reduce \neach of these tax brackets to 25, 28, 33, and 35 percent. At their \nlowest levels, these benefit married couples with taxable income \nof $47,000 and up, and single taxpayers with taxable incomes of $28,000 \nand up. Who would benefit from the change? The Treasury Department \nestimated 28 million taxpayers would receive an average tax reduction \nof $1,100. That is almost $100 per month this Government will not be \nextracting from hard-working American citizens. They will be allowed to \nkeep that money. There is no tax on this. Remember, there is no \nwithholding on this reduction in tax. It is right off what you would be \npaying the Federal Government. A taxpayer who gets a $90 a month \nbenefit receives a benefit of $90 a month.\n\n  Second, the plan calls for acceleration of the reduction of the 10 \npercent bracket expansion that has been scheduled for 2008 and brings \nit to 2003, this year. That means effective immediately, for married \ncouples, their first $14,000 in taxable income is taxed at only the \nrate of 10 percent. It does not mean their first $14,000 they earn, but \nthe first $14,000 taxable income after their deductions. That is a 33 \npercent reduction. Under current law, only the first $12,000 in taxable \nincome is allowed to be received at this preferential rate. Single \ntaxpayers would see their first $7,000 in taxable income immediately \nfall under the lower rate. Who benefits? The Treasury estimates it \nwould reduce taxes for over 69 million taxpayers.\n  The President is also proposing an accelerated reduction in the \nmarriage penalty. As we have all learned, there is a penalty on \nmarriage in this country. It is the result of a quirk in the Tax Code \nwhich assesses additional tax liabilities on couples who choose to \nmarry and file jointly rather than remaining single where they can file \nseparately. The marriage penalty is an unfair and incredibly unpopular \npart of the Tax Code. In fact, we are in the bizarre position in this \ncountry of penalizing that which we would want to encourage--marriage. \nI know someone who got divorced in January. They said had they been \nclever and gotten their divorce in December they would have saved \n$1,800 on their taxes. We had the spectacle of the U.S. Government \npaying bonuses to people who divorced and penalizing people who marry. \nIt is not good social policy. It is not good tax policy. It is \nsomething we ought to eliminate. It is past due to be eliminated. We \nare working on that. We were going to phase this in by the year 2009, \nand the President proposes making that effective this year so people \nget the benefit now. A married couple earning a taxable income of \n$47,000 or more will be able to claim twice the standard deduction they \nare currently allowed.\n  Who benefits from this? According to the Treasury Department, 35 \nmillion married couples would receive an average tax deduction of $574 \nfrom this alone. That is meaningful money for any family. The economic \nprinciple is when you tax something, you get less out of it. When you \nsubsidize something, you get more. We have been taxing marriage and \nsubsidizing divorce. That is not good for this country to be doing.\n  Another of the President's proposals is to accelerate the child tax \ncredit, immediately raising this credit to $1,000 in 2003 from its \ncurrent $600 level. When I got elected to the Senate in 1996, I \ncampaigned on this issue. I talked to young families all over America. \nThey are trying to buy a house. They have to have a car. Maybe both are \nworking. They have to have two cars. They are trying to raise children \nand meet those expenses. The tax deductions that were significant for \nchildren in the 1950s have been totally eroded, and they are getting \nwhacked in taxes. They are trying to raise the next generation of \nchildren taking care of us when we are drawing Social Security.\n\n  I think this is a huge deal. I remember how excited I was when we \npassed the $500-per-child tax credit in 1997. They said this was \ncutting taxes too much. It was too much of a tax cut and we could not \nsustain it. But we continued, ending up later having the huge surplus \nwe had just a couple of years ago.\n  This is a fairness issue. In this country, the people who may be \nhurting the most when you look at it fairly are young couples, just \nworking, just beginning in their careers. They have not raised up and \ngotten seniority, been promoted and making higher wages, but they have \nyoung children they are trying to take care of, to educate, to buy \nshoes for, to take to Disney World on occasion if, Lord willing, they \nhave the opportunity.\n  We ought to pass this tax deduction and accelerate it as good public \npolicy. This will also put money in the pockets of families to spend on \nbehalf of their children. It will help the economy when they buy \nproducts. Somebody makes those products. Somebody at the store benefits \nfrom that. You pay sales taxes on it. The State and local governments \nbenefit from that also.\n  According to the numbers I have, 26 million families would receive an \naverage tax benefit of $623. That is $40-plus or $50 per month as a tax \nbenefit as a result--per child under this plan.\n  We have a plan for small businesses to be able to accelerate their \ndepreciation, their expensing of new investments from $25,000 to \n$75,000. We want to encourage businesses to expand, to invest. When \nthey do that, they hire people to do the expansion. They buy equipment. \nThey expand their building. They improve their parking lot. They create \neconomic growth. Small businesses, for a lot of reasons, are not being \ntreated fairly in today's business environment.\n  I strongly believe, in the course of passing legislation that would \ncreate a budget for us and that would allow for a growth package and \nwould set the spending levels for America, we need to create an \natmosphere, not of dependence on government benefits; what we need to \ndo is create an atmosphere that invigorates employment in the private \nsector, creating jobs, creating choices of jobs for American workers, \nwhere they can get raises and leave one business and go to another one \nfor a higher paying job if they want, where they can get bonuses, and \nwhere they can have overtime and bring home more money. That is what we \nneed to do, to strengthen our economy. Our goal should be to do that.\n  One of the reasons the Council of Economic Advisers has recently \nestimated that the President's plan will spur the American economy to \ncreate over 2.1 million jobs in the next 3 years is this focus on the \nprivate sector. The President is focused on assuring America's \ncontinued economic growth. This plan is one large indication of his \ncommitment to promoting job creation.\n  The President's plan also calls for the elimination of double \ntaxation on corporate dividends. Under his plan, dividend income \nreceived by individuals would be excluded from their taxable income, if \nthose dividends are paid out of previously taxed corporate earnings. \nThis is a very important provision. Many people in America's investor \nclass understand that when they buy stock and receive dividends, they \nare paying probably a third or more of that in taxes in addition to the \nfact that it has been paid previously by the corporation.\n\n  According to the numbers that have been put together, the United \nStates of America has the second highest tax in the world on corporate \nearnings, second only to Japan--over 70 percent when you total it up. \nSo this is an unhealthy situation. What is happening for a lot of \nreasons is the American businesses realize if they distribute--after \nthey make a profit and they pay their 35 percent corporate tax on \nthat--if they distribute it to their stockholders, they have to pay \nanother 35 or so percent on it--or more.\n  So what do we think, and what do the experts think, this reduction \nwould do to help the economy? I think one thing it would do, clearly, \nis it would make stocks more attractive. It would cause people to have \nan additional reason to invest in the stock market. Whatever the level \nthe stock market would be, whether it was low or high, by passing\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nthis tax it would make it higher than it would be otherwise.\n  I don't guarantee the stock market will go up because it passes, but \nI guarantee it will be higher than it would otherwise have been. Why? \nBecause when you make the purchase of a stock that produces a dividend, \nand that dividend comes to you tax free, it is a more attractive \ninvestment. That is why people buy tax-free bonds instead of other \nbonds. So that would be helpful in raising the stock market. It would \nmake it more attractive.\n  I think it important for us to recall that revenue to our Government \nis volatile. One reason revenue income to our Government is volatile is \nthe stock market. When the market is up and people sell stock, they \nhave to show a capital gain, and they will pay a tax on the sale--20 \npercent normally. When the market is down and they sell a stock, they \ndo not take a gain, so they do not pay 20 percent tax on that profit; \nthey take a capital loss.\n  If they have some other product they sold--real estate they sold and \nshowed a gain on--they can use the loss in the market to offset that \ngain. Also, they are allowed, under the Tax Code, to take $3,000 per \nyear and offset that capital loss against their ordinary income, \nreducing the ordinary income tax they would pay.\n  To me, this is a clear indication that if the stock market is high \nand doing well, the Government will receive more revenue. That is not \nfactored into any of these projections whatsoever, what impact the \ndividend tax reduction would have. If the market is up, revenue will be \nup. It will give businesses more value if their stock goes up, and they \nwill be able to invest more and grow more. With a higher value stock, \nthey can do that.\n  In summary, the dividend tax is an unfair double tax. It is the \nsecond highest in the world. The elimination of this tax will help the \nstock market; it will help the recovery; it will help businesses be \nable to borrow and invest. It will allow individuals to receive income \non which they do not have to pay taxes. They will have more money to \nspend. Because of the change from taking losses to growth, revenues to \nthe Government will go up. I think it is the right thing to do. Dollar \nfor dollar, it is a good plan.\n  I tell you, there are many good things in the President's proposal. \nIt is something we have to deal with this week. This budget will set \nthe framework for where we are going. It will set the outline for what \nour spending and our taxing plans will be.\n  I hope we will focus on two things: containing spending, making it at \na reasonable level, and growing this economy, because it is only \nthrough growth we will be able to return to surpluses and eliminate the \ndeficits that are now occurring.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just take a few moments to respond \nto my colleague, Senator Sessions, who is a valued member of the Budget \nCommittee, I might add, and whom I serve with on the Ethics Committee. \nHe has served there with real distinction as well. But we fundamentally \ndisagree. That is what debate is all about. That is what democracy is \nall about. And that is what is healthy for the country.\n  The Senator described the growth package on our side as puny, I \nthink. Let me just say, here is the difference between our two plans \nfor this year. I would describe the President's plan as puny for this \nyear.\n  Of the total cost of his plan, which is over $900 billion, less than \n5 percent of it is for this year, at the time the economy clearly is \nweak and needs a lift.\n  Our plan is more than twice as large as the President's plan for this \nyear: $102 billion of economic stimulus.\n  An analysis has been done by the distinguished economist Mr. Mark \nZandi of Economy.com, comparing the lift our plan will give the economy \nover this year and next over the President's plan. It shows the plan we \nhave provided will give almost twice as much in terms of economic \nstimulus in 2003 and 2004 as the President's plan.\n  Interestingly enough, for the long term, he finds the President's \neconomic growth plan actually hurts economic growth. Why? Because it \nexplodes deficits and debt. It does not offset the cost of the tax cuts \nwith spending reductions. It finances the tax cuts with borrowed money.\n  Our friends on the other side seem to have fallen into this notion \nthat you can borrow your way to wealth and economic strength. That has \nnever been true in history. You cannot borrow your way to economic \nstrength. It is as if you had decided you would go out and run up the \ncredit cards and make believe you are wealthy. No, no, no. No, we are \nnot going to buy into that new theory.\n\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle used to believe deficits \nmatter. Many of us on this side still believe deficits matter. I am \nhappy to say some on the other side still believe deficits matter. But \nit is not just Mr. Zandi who has found that the plan of the President \nwill hurt economic growth in the long term. Macroeconomic Advisers, who \nis under contract to the White House, under contract to the \nCongressional Budget Office, to do macroeconomic analysis, has \nconcluded that after 2004, the President's plan actually hurts economic \ngrowth. We would have less economic growth than if we did nothing. Now, \nthat is not my idea of economic growth.\n  I would say this to my colleague: The one thing that is certain about \nthe plan on the other side, the thing that is going to grow is the \ndeficit. The deficit is going to grow. We are already going to have \nrecord deficits under this plan, and they are going to continue as far \nas the eye can see.\n  According to the President's own documents, we are never going to get \nout of deficit. It is just like falling off a cliff. Because the cost \nof the President's tax cuts explodes at the very time the cost of the \nFederal Government explodes by the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration.\n  But it is not just my view. Newspaper after newspaper--here is the \nDeseret News, in Salt Lake City:\n\n       War is unpredictable . . . a long, protracted campaign that \n     triggers counter-attacks by terrorists and Iraqi sympathizers \n     could be hugely expensive. Coupled with giant tax cuts, it \n     could send the budget deficit back into levels not seen in a \n     decade or more, which would stifle growth and hamper \n     investment.\n\n  It isn't a growth plan they have on the other side; it is a grow-the-\ndeficit plan, a grow-the-debt plan, that will hurt economic growth.\n\n       Congress ought to put the president's tax plan on the shelf \n     for awhile until it knows better how the men and women in \n     uniform are going to be spending their year.\n\n  Newspaper after newspaper. Here is the Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\n       . . . [B]e careful what's given away in the name of any \n     ``growth and jobs'' plan. Federal budget deficits are back. \n     States are reeling from their own deficits while shouldering \n     new homeland security chores. The demographic train wreck \n     facing Social Security and Medicare as baby boomers age \n     hasn't gone away just because politicians have stopped \n     talking about it. Money is so tight President Bush can't pay \n     for even his own cherished initiatives such as education \n     reform.\n\n  This is from the News & Observer, Raleigh, North Carolina:\n\n       When the Republicans won the White House there was a \n     projected surplus of about $200 billion for this fiscal year \n     and talk about fully protecting Social Security and even \n     digging out from beneath the national debt. Now, in large \n     part because of the earlier Bush tax cut and necessarily \n     higher spending for the anti-terrorism fight, the nation has \n     plunged into red ink again. . . .\n       In the meantime, President Bush goes on pushing hard to \n     make tax-rate reductions permanent and to cease federal \n     taxation of stock dividends. Both the federal and state \n     budgets could face dire consequences from this economic plan. \n     On and on it goes. ``Unfair tax proposal rewards wrong \n     group.''\n  This is from the Kansas City Star:\n\n       There's no real debate over the fact that Bush's proposal \n     on dividends would largely benefit the rich. Some apologists \n     talk about wanting to help the elderly, which doesn't tell \n     the whole story; Bush's dividend proposal would help elderly \n     people with lots of money in the stock market.\n       Bush's tax package is unfair, short-sighted and fiscally \n     irresponsible. He and members of Congress--particularly \n     Republicans, who now control Capitol Hill--must develop a far \n     better plan in the months ahead.\n\n  Let me just finish with this one. I have many more because newspapers \nall around the country--not Democrats, not Republicans--that have tried \nto analyze the President's plan have come back and said it is a \nnonstarter. Here is the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       . . . Bush's trickle-down package threatens to swamp the \n     economy in a wave of debt. And that's before taking into \n     account the\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\n     huge but unknowable cost of preparing for and perhaps \n     fighting a war with Iraq. The White House's tax-cutting yet \n     free-spending ways defy history, and taxpayers will be the \n     ones left responsible for decades to come.\n\n  That is just a part of what the Senator from Alabama said that I \nthink requires a response. He said some are saying: Do nothing. That is \nreally not what Senator Daschle has proposed nor what I have proposed. \nBut I do believe it would be wise, on the brink of war, when there is \nno provision in this budget for the costs of that war--and none of us \nare suggesting--I want to make clear to my colleague, if I could have \nhis attention, none of us are suggesting this administration or your \nparty has any intention but to fund our men and women in uniform. I \nhave no doubt of that. I want to make very clear, we make no \nsuggestion, none, that there is any reluctance to back our men and \nwomen in uniform. That is not the point.\n  The point is this: When we are on the brink of war, and there has \nbeen no provision in the budget for the cost of that war, even though \nwe know there are substantial costs associated with it, it seems unwise \nto some of us to increase spending, to have new spending initiatives--\nexcept for defense and homeland security--or to have new tax cuts, \nunless they are for a stimulus package.\n  That is the point we are making. And I think it is a wise one and a \nprudent one.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand that. I think the suggestion is our budget \nprocess has to stop until that occurs. And I think it is impossible for \nthe President to give us a number now. I believe it does cause some \nconfusion in our unity, which I would not favor.\n  But I want to ask the Senator this.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me just respond to that first.\n  Look, we are not suggesting the budget process stop. No. We are \nsaying there ought to be a point of order, a 60-vote point of order \nagainst new spending initiatives, unless for defense or homeland \nsecurity, or for new tax initiatives, other than for a stimulus \npackage.\n  We are not suggesting the budget process stop. We are suggesting it \nproceed, but that it proceed with some restriction, some disincentive \nfor new spending, other than for defense and homeland security, or for \nnew tax cuts, other than for a stimulus package.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator is committed to whatever figure we \nhave to do to fund the effort of our fine men and women in uniform. I \nwas looking at the Democratic proposed stimulus plan, and it is pretty \nanemic. I ask Senator Conrad if he knew that not only was it basically \nlimited, most of it in just 1, 2, or 3 years, but that in fact in 2004, \nas a result of eliminating the depreciation provisions that are in \nexisting law, it would amount to a $16.7 billion tax increase on small \nbusinesses in 2004 and a $14.8 billion increase in 2005?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Part of the plan that I have endorsed would include \nenhanced depreciation for small business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We passed it as part of a stimulus package before. The \nbill that has been put forward as the Democrat stimulus plan calls for \nthe elimination of those which would amount to a tax increase over the \ncurrent law of $16.7 billion in 2004 and $14.8 billion in 2005.\n  I ask the Senator if he believes this kind of very large increase in \ntaxes on small businesses would be wise in a time of economic slowdown?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. In fact, the plan I have endorsed would expand \nexpensing for small business. I think that is a better course and would \nbe a real stimulus. We should aggressively have a plan of small \nbusiness expensing, expanding small business expensing in this year.\n  I see Senator Allard is in the Chamber. Is he seeking time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have a statement I would like to make when we get an \nopportunity during the debate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are under a time limit. There needs to be a granting \nof time in order for Senators to have an opportunity to speak. Senator \nNickles is not here at the moment. Perhaps he is on his way.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Colorado such \ntime as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I need time to get set up.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support, once again, of \nAmerica's teachers by joining with Senator Collins in introducing the \nTeacher Tax Relief Act of 2003.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked closely for some time now in \nsupport of legislation to provide our teachers with tax relief in \nrecognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses they incur as part of \ntheir profession. In the 107th Congress, we were successful in \nproviding much needed tax relief for our Nation's teachers with passage \nof H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush, \nincluded the Collins/Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 provisions \nthat provided a $250 above-the-line deduction for educators who incur \nout-of-pocket expenses for supplies they bring into the classroom to \nbetter the education of their students. These important provisions will \nprovide almost half a billion dollars worth of tax relief to teachers \nall across America over the next two years.\n  While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's \nteachers, our work is not yet complete.\n  It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $521 out of his \nor her own pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as \npens, pencils and books. First-year teachers spend even more, averaging \n$701 a year on classroom expenses.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt, the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage by \nproviding a $250 above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pocket to better the education of our \nchildren.\n  Accordingly, Senator Collins and I have joined together to take \nanother step forward by introducing the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2003.\n  This legislation will build upon current law in three ways. The \nlegislation will:\n  No. 1, increase the above-the-line deduction for educators from $250 \nallowed under current law to $500;\n  No. 2, allow educators to include professional development costs \nwithin that $500 deduction. Under current law, up to $250 is deductible \nbut only for classroom expenses; and\n  No. 3, make the Teacher Tax relief provisions in the law permanent. \nCurrent law sunsets the Collins/Warner provisions after 2 years.\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. In my view, the Federal \nGovernment should recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make in \ntheir career.\n  The Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2003 is another step forward in \nproviding our educators with the recognition they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3799-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3799-S3800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ARE WE READY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR WITH IRAQ?\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concerns \nthat we are not as prepared as we should be for the consequences of a \nwar with Iraq.\n  I have complete confidence in the ability of our armed services to \ndefeat Iraq. We have a superb military which is, without a doubt, the \nmost effective and most professional fighting force ever fielded in the \nhistory of mankind.\n  We can all be proud of our dedicated military men and women. It is \ntheir dedication and willingness to risk their lives in the service of \ntheir country that places a special responsibility on our shoulders. \nOur responsibility is to ensure that their service is not expended in \nthe vain pursuit of ill-defined objectives and that our national \nsecurity is truly enhanced.\n  In my capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nmeet with many of our field commanders. Prior to our debate last \nsession on H.J. Res. 114 concerning war with Iraq, I met with one of \nour senior commanders just returned from the war against terrorism. He \ntold me ``keep asking the hard questions'' about the consequences of \ncommitting American troops to a war on Iraq. I have heeded his advice, \nand it is the reason I stand today to discuss the consequences of war \non Iraq.\n  I am concerned that we are not sufficiently prepared either \nmaterially or psychologically for a protracted occupation of Iraqi \nterritory, nor are we sufficiently well prepared domestically for \npossible terrorist attacks on American soil.\n  My constituents ask me why the President has chosen to fight Iraq at \nthis time or what his objective is in so doing. I do not have a good \nanswer for them because the President has yet to provide one.\n  Certainly it is true that Saddam Hussein has resisted and ignored \nover the past 12 years United Nations resolutions calling for Iraqi \ndisarmament of its weapons of mass destruction. Certainly it is true \nthat Saddam Hussein has oppressed the Iraqi people and carried out \nterrible attacks against the Kurds and Shia tribes of Southern Iraq. \nCertainly it is true that Saddam Hussein has paid only grudging \nlipservice to recent efforts by the United Nations Monitoring, \nVerification and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC, to discover and \neliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  However, none of those issues justifies going to war now if we are \nunprepared for the consequences of war and if we do not have a clear \nexit strategy for getting out of Iraq. It would be far better to take \nthe time to ensure that we are prepared for both the consequences at \nhome and abroad before sending our superb military into combat in a \ndistant land.\n  The reasons for war have increased in number and difficulty as we \nbuild up our forces in the gulf. At first, the President asserted that \nwar was to end Saddam Hussein's program for developing weapons of mass \ndestruction. More recently, the President has added that our objective \nis to ``help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy, and create the \ninstitutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its \nneighbors.'' The President argues for war because he believes that \n``success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern \npeace, and set in motion progress towards a truly democratic \nPalestinian state.'' Mission creep is already occurring, and the \nmission has not begun.\n  In February testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nretired General Anthony C. Zinni asked, ``do we want to transform Iraq \nor just transition it out from under the unacceptable regime [. . . \n.]'' and he added, ``defining the problem, however, is only half the \ntask. The other half deals with how you solve the problem. I have not \nseen a lot of specifics in this area.''\n  The mission of an American occupation to establish a democratic Iraq \nis well-meaning but difficult to implement. Indeed, as I read testimony \nand speeches by administration officials, I am struck by how many new \nobjectives are being added to our mission: for example, establish the \nrule of law and an independent judiciary; create a free enterprise \nsystem; end weapons of mass destruction programs; make an American \nally; create a bulwark against terrorism; forge a secular and \ndemocratic state; reform the educational system; and develop a free \npress. These are extremely ambitious programs for a country that has \nlittle, if any, historical experience and no recent experiences in any \nof these conditions. Perhaps we should be bringing democracy to our \nallies in the region.\n  A well-defined objective is crucial for a mission's success. Will the \nobjective be a discrete military mission: seek and destroy Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction, or an open-ended goal to bring democracy \nto a country that has no experience in democracy? The administration \nnow indicates that both goals are intertwined: to rid Iraq of its \nweapons of mass destruction we must create a democracy in Iraq. Perhaps \nthat is the case. But the opposite is also possible: a democratic Iraq \nresponsive to the will of the Iraqi people, continuing to share borders \nwith countries traditionally hostile to Iraq--including Iran which we \nhave learned this week is well on its way to developing nuclear \nweapons--may feel compelled to restart its weapons of mass destruction \nprogram out of self-preservation.\n  Let us be clear: we can take weapons away from Iraqi leaders but we \ncannot erase the knowledge of how to make those weapons from the minds \nof Iraqi scientists. That capability will always remain. Weapons \nscientists and engineers will not unlearn what they have learned. To \nmake another Iraqi WMD program impossible, we need to develop solid \nsupport for an international regime with enforcement mechanisms to \nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means \nto deploy them.\n  Unfortunately, the President's rush to war is undermining the very \ninternational consensus we need to forge to prevent proliferation.\n  International cooperation is essential both in the short term and in \nthe long term. In the short term, it is essential for our goal of \nending the threat from Iraq. A stable international coalition is the \nbasis for managing any future crisis. In the long term, it is essential \nto prevent the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The administration insists that all it needs is a ``coalition of the \nwilling'' to go to war. That may be true for war, but will there be a \ncoalition to pay the costs of an indefinite occupation of Iraq? Without \ninternational support, the United States will pay the direct cost for \nour military presence and reconstruction. Our struggling economy will \nalso pay an indirect cost adding to our sky-high deficit. Already it \nlooks more like a coalition for war of the compensated than a coalition \nof the willing.\n  I believe we are not ready for the cost of such an occupation both in \nterms of money and our military.\n  When the British conquered Iraq in 1917, the British military \ncommander, Lieutenant General Sir Stanley Maude, said ``our armies \ndo not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies but as \nliberators.'' When the British departed Baghdad in the 1930s, Sir \nKinahan Cornwallis observed, ``my own prediction is that they will all \nfly at each other's throats and that there will be a bad slump in the \nadministration which will continue until someone strong enough to \ndominate the country emerges, or alternatively, until we have to step \nin and intervene.''\n\n  We should heed history before we attempt to make a future. The danger \nis that the war will end in a few weeks while crisis endures for a long \ntime.\n  Just recently, the administration announced a $900 million contract \nfor postwar Iraqi reconstruction. This is just a small down payment on \nwhat people in and outside the Government estimate may amount to over \n$100 billion, not including the cost of maintaining a long-term \nAmerican troop presence in Iraq. A military presence will cost \nadditional billions and tie down American forces, affecting training, \nrotation cycles, and recruitment of\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nour entire military. The cost will be borne largely by the American \ntaxpayer unlike the first gulf war which saw Saudi Arabia and Germany \ncontribute 44 percent of the operation.\n  Some suggest that Iraqi oil exports will pay for the occupation force \nand reconstruction efforts. But a recent study by the Council of \nForeign Relations warns not to expect such a ``bonanza.'' The Iraqi oil \nindustry is estimated to need $5 billion in investment and 3 years just \nto return to pre-1990 production levels, and Iraq is already carrying \nan external debt burden of $300 billion.\n  If, as some experts predict, our forces confront ethnic, tribal, and \nreligious in-fighting and are besieged by terrorist attacks emboldened \nby pan-Islamic hostility to the American occupation, we may need a much \nlarger force than the current 45,000 to 75,000 under review by the \nPentagon. No doubt, as in the first gulf war, there will be score \nsettling among Iraqis with vigilante justice and possibly open warfare. \nMany are predicting that Kurdish refugees expelled in 1968 from their \nhomes in Kirkuk will pour back into this center of Iraqi oil wealth, \nbringing with them the possibility of war with Turkey seeking to \nprotect Turkmen minority interests.\n  The Pentagon is reported to be planning on a 2-year military \noccupation of Iraq under a military governor that may be expanded to 5 \nyears. Ironically, one of the first things this governor general will \nhave to do is to rebuild the Iraqi military with professional training \nand new weapons. Time magazine reports that the Pentagon has ``only a \nrudimentary plan for rehabilitating the bulk of the [Iraqi] Army.'' But \nit is clear that we cannot demobilize over 400,000 Iraqi troops without \nadding to the problems in the civilian sector.\n  We are just beginning to plan for all these postwar problems. On \nFebruary 11, 2003, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith \nannounced that the President ``has directed his administration to begin \nplanning now'' for reconstruction and testified that the administration \nwas still ``conceptualizing'' peace. Now is too late for a war that may \nstart this month. The Defense Department's Office of Reconstruction was \nopened only on January 20, 2003. Time magazine reported on March 2 that \n``at this late hour, the Administration is not very ready for the \npeace.''\n  As Middle East expert Anthony Cordesman warned in testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee on February 7, 2003, ``we are rushing \nplanning efforts without making adequate efforts to make up for our \nlack of knowledge. As a result, planners both outside and inside the \nU.S. government may end in doing more harm than good. . . .''\n  President Bush has stated that ``we will remain in Iraq as long as \nnecessary and not a day more.'' I appreciate his candor, but I am \ndeeply disturbed by such an open-ended commitment to deploying American \ntroops. We may wear out our welcome long before we have accomplished \nthe democratic transformation of the Middle East envisioned by the \nPresident.\n  I am also concerned over the lack of preparation at home for the \npossibility of terrorist attacks. Even the President is dissatisfied \nwith the counterterrorism budget passed for this fiscal year. I am \ndissatisfied that we have not done more during the past 2 years. As \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs International Security \nSubcommittee, I began holding hearings on our preparedness against \nterrorist attacks in July 2001. I have continued to press for reform of \nour national and local preparedness. I agree with the President that \nthe budget for this fiscal year was too small. We have done too little \nto defend ourselves against attack.\n  I am disturbed by the letter from FBI Special Agent Colleen Rowley to \nFBI Director Robert Mueller indicating that the FBI would not be able \nto ``stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the \nwake of an attack on Iraq.'' Last month the FBI issued a warning that \n``lone extremists represent an ongoing terrorist threat in the United \nStates.'' Certainly, steps have been taken to improve our law \nenforcement capability, but I believe much more needs to be done before \nwe are as prepared as we should be. The President acknowledged as much \nwhen he announced in his State of the Union Address his intent to \ncreate by May 1 a new Terrorist Threat Integration Center. This Center \nis at least 3 years away from being fully staffed according to \nadministration plans.\n  In other areas we are also behind. The Transportation Security \nAdministration has just begun to assess the vulnerabilities of American \nairports to terrorist attack, especially from shoulder-launched \nmissiles--that task force was set up after the deadly November 28 \nattack against an Israeli airline in Kenya. The President's plan to \nimmunize 500,000 health care workers against smallpox in 30 days has \nonly inoculated 4,200 and is draining money and personnel from other \nprograms in State and local public health departments.\n  Many State and local law enforcement officials have yet to receive \nfederal security clearances so that they can receive information about \npotential terrorist attacks. Our emergency health care system is \nalready stressed to the breaking point as hundreds of emergency \ndepartments have been closed due to budgetary constraints even as the \nnumber of patient visits has increased. Few of the respirators operated \nby local firefighters and other first responder rescue teams were found \nto be effective against poison gas. Many reservists in our first \nresponder units have been called to active military duty, depleting \ncritical services at home.\n  The list of problems is endless. The ability to solve these problems \nis limited by time and by money. The bottom line is that we have a lot \nto do and a long way to go before we are as ready at home for war as we \nare for waging war far away.\n  If war does come, both in Iraq and here at home, we will all support \nour troops and do the best we can to confront the problems here. I \nbelieve that the security of all Americans would be better served by \ntaking the time to be better prepared. Allowing United Nations \ninspectors to do their work in Iraq will deplete the number of weapons \nSaddam Hussein might aim at our troops--already 46 Al Samoud missiles \nhave been destroyed--and build international support for resolving the \nIraq crisis. We will have not only a coalition of the willing but a \ncoalition of the strong.\n  If we pursue our current path, we will have a war lacking in many \nthings essential to achieving complete success. It will be a war \nwithout broad international support, without sufficient planning for \npostconflict reconstruction and stability, without a definite exit time \nand strategy, and without a firm pricetag. Moreover, it will be a war \nwith serious ramifications for our long-term readiness capabilities for \nhomeland security and for managing other crises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3800-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3800-S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF THOMAS A. VARLAN\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last week the Senate confirmed the \nPresidential nomination of Thomas A. Varlan to be a United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. While I did not \nhave an opportunity that day to make a floor statement in support of \nMr. Varlan, I did want to come to the floor to express my support for \nhim and to express my gratitude to my colleagues for the expeditious \nconfirmation of this superb nominee.\n  Mr. Varlan was recommended last year by the current Senate majority \nleader, my colleague, Senator Frist, and former Senator Thompson. As \nsomeone who, as Governor of Tennessee appointed some 50 judges, I am \nconfident that Mr. Varlan will be an able Federal judge.\n  Mr. Varlan was born and raised in Oak Ridge, TN. He received a \nBachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee in 1978, \ngraduating with the highest honors. He received his Juris Doctorate \nfrom Vanderbilt University School of Law in 1981, where he served as an \neditor of the law review and was selected for membership in the Order \nof the Coif, the national law school honor society.\n  After receiving his law degree, Mr. Varlan worked for 6 years as an \nassociate with the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan in Atlanta, \nGeorgia. In 1988, he returned home to Tennessee and from 1988 through \n1998 he served as Law Director for the city of Knoxville, managing all \nthe legal affairs for Tennessee's third largest city. Mr. Varlan\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nhas been a partner at the Knoxville law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims, PLC \nsince 1998.\n  Mr. Varlan has practiced law in the areas of employment, school, \ncommercial, patent and trade secrets, antitrust, contracts, product \nliability, civil rights, tort, annexation, tax, zoning, condemnation, \nworkers' compensation, constitutional, telecommunications, real \nproperty, governmental relations, and labor law. Mr. Varlan has \npracticed in federal, state, and administrative law courts throughout \nhis career and has conducted a number of jury and bench trials.\n  Mr. Varlan has also been active in his community, providing legal \nservices to disadvantaged persons and for organizations such as \nVolunteer Legal Arts Services in Atlanta, GA, and the Knoxville Bar \nAssociation's Mentor for the Moment Program.\n  I am confident that Mr. Varlan will be a fine addition to the Federal \nbench in Knoxville, and I thank all of my colleagues for their \noverwhelming support for him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3801-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF JOSEPH KELLIHER TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY \n                               COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I cannot allow the Senate to proceed with \nMr. Kelliher's nomination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \ntoday or anytime soon.\n  This is a position of enormous importance to my constituents in \nOregon who have had their energy prices soar through the roof during \nthe past few years while the Commission has failed to serve as an \neffective watchdog over energy markets.\n  In the limited time I was able to question Mr. Kelliher at his \nconfirmation hearing, he demonstrated little understanding of the \nimpact on the Northwest of the manipulation of west coast spot markets \nby Enron using the various strategies described in the Enron memos. \nThese strategies have had a devastating impact on Northwest energy \nconsumers and on long-term contracts that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration (BPA) and many other Northwest utilities subsequently \nwere induced to sign in order to protect themselves from the volatility \nof the manipulated spot markets. In response to my question about \nwhether the Enron memos provided grounds to get out from overpriced \ncontracts, Mr. Kelliher states: ``As a legal matter, I do not know sir. \nI thought those memos were designed to manipulate spot markets.''\n  To date, there has been a total failure on the part of the Commission \nto make any kind of connection between the manipulation of spot markets \nand the impact on long-term contracts that have raised rates for \nNorthwest ratepayers. In fact, the Commission currently appears to be \npursuing two completely different standards for when ratepayers may be \nentitled to refunds for manipulation of spot markets as compared to \nwhen overpriced, long-term contracts that were a direct result of that \nmanipulation can be voided or reformed. The net effect could be that \nNorthwest ratepayers could be struck in long-term, overpriced contracts \neven if the rates in those contracts are not considered just and \nreasonable according to FERC's own standards.\n  What is also of concern to me is that there are a number of critical \nissues to Northwest energy consumers that will be coming before the \nCommission in the next several weeks. These include Commission \ndecisions on filings by the Bonneville Power Administration and other \nNorthwest utilities for relief from contracts with Enron and other \nenergy traders, enforcement cases against the marketers accused of \nmanipulating west coast energy markets and the Commission's proposal to \ncreate a one-size-fits-all standard market design for transmission \nsystems that would be ill-suited to our region's transmission system \nand could create new opportunities for manipulation of Northwest energy \nmarkets. With these critical issues coming before the Commission, the \nNorthwest needs to be assured our region's interests will be fully and \ncarefully considered.\n  Mr. Kelliher has not convinced me he fully understands the impact of \nmanipulation of west coast energy markets on Northwest ratepayers or \nthe problems the Commission's standard market design proposal could \ncreate for the Northwest electric power grid. For these reasons, I \nwould object to a unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up \nMr. Kelliher's nomination until my concerns can be addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3801-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 15, \n2001. Two men taunted and attacked four lesbian students outside a cafe \nnear Louisiana State University. The attackers approached the women and \nasked them if they were ``boys or girls.'' The victims said that one of \nthe attackers threw a drink at them and another attacker punched the \nvictims repeatedly.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3801-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SIERRA LEONE SPECIAL COURT INDICTMENTS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to call my colleagues' attention \nto the historic developments that have unfolded in Sierra Leone in \nrecent days.\n  On Monday, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, a body charged with \nbringing to justice those most responsible for the horrific war crimes \nthat occurred in that country, issued its first indictments. Seven \npeople were indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \nviolations of international humanitarian law: Foday Sankoh, Johnny Paul \nKoroma, Sam Bockarie, Issa Hassan Sesay, Alex Tamba Brima, Morris \nKallon, and Sam Hinga Normam. The subjects of these initial \nindictments--ranging from infamous RUF leader Sankoh to former junta \nleader Koroma to Cabinet Minister Norman--clearly illustrate the \ncommitment of the Court and of Sierra Leone to genuinely break with the \npast, and to firmly asset the illegitimacy of all of the abuse and \natrocities of the past, not just that portion committed by one faction \nor another. Five of the indicted individuals are under arrest today; \ntwo remain at large. I urge the international community to ensure that \nthey are found, arrested, and turned over to the court.\n  This development is an important step toward breaking the cycle of \nviolence and impunity in West Africa--a cycle that plunged the people \nof Sierra Leone into a long national nightmare from which they have \nonly begun to recover. That same cycle is responsible for the ongoing \nsuffering of the people of Liberia, and now threatens the once-stable \ncountry of Cote d'Ivoire. It is true that fear of accountability may \nprovoke some actors to try to disrupt the progress made in Sierra Leone \nthus far, but the history of that beautiful country has shown that \nturning a blind eye to the abuses of the past only ensures more in the \nfuture. The people of Sierra Leone are bravely pursuing justice. They \ndeserve international support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3801-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3801-S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LLOYD J. OGILVIE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, ever since I first arrived in the Senate, I \nhave always looked forward to starting each new day with a prayer. \nWhether that prayer came from one of his excellent books, like One \nQuiet Moment, or on the Senate Floor, we have all received a great deal \nof inspiration and encouragement from our Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie. Each \nday, as we prayed together on the floor or in our offices, Dr. Ogilvie \nhas helped us to focus on the tasks of the day and the importance of \nworking together as one family to solve the problems we face as a \nnation. His words have also reminded us of the beliefs of our Founding \nFathers and their inherent trust in God for all things.\n  Looking back over the years he has served in the Senate, Dr. Ogilvie \nhas\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nhelped us through a long list of trials, tribulations and difficulties. \nIn particular, he prayed with us each morning as we began to recover \nfrom the pain of the attacks of September 11. As the Chaplain of all \nthe Senate, he took the pain and isolation that some of us felt from \nthose days, and through prayer and understanding, he brought us \ntogether as one, the Senate family, and taught us how to console each \nother and how to help each family member through the pain of that day.\n  Now, after all he has done for us, Dr. Ogilvie will be leaving to \nhelp his own special family and his wife, Mary Jane. Their's is a \nremarkable story, and someday it may be written, about teamwork, love \nand happiness. Now she needs his time, his caring and his attention and \nso he will be working with her, just as she has worked with him as part \nof his team for all of the years of their marriage, to bring her back \nto health.\n  As he prepares to return to California to be with his wife, a lot of \nus have taken a few moments to think about the difference he has made \nin our lives, in our staff's lives, and in the every day routines of \nthe Senate.\n  I have always believed that there was no better gauge of how well you \ndid your job than to measure your results against what you said you \nwanted to do on your first day in the office. For Dr. Ogilvie, that \nmeant pursuing a role as ``intercessor, trusted prayer partner and \nfaithful counselor to members of the Senate family as they seek to know \nGod and discover His will in the monumental responsibilities entrusted \nto them.''\n  I don't think there is any doubt that he has fulfilled his own charge \nto the letter. He has been a counselor, comforter and a source of \nstrength for us all, no matter our status or rank in the Senate or in \neach office because those things don't matter to the other members of a \nfamily when someone is in need.\n  One of my favorite moments from the New Testament has to do with the \nstory of the apostles who were in a boat with Jesus Christ when a \nterrible storm came up all around them. As Christ slept peacefully, the \napostles were in the throes of a terrible panic about their situation \nand what was to become of them. As Christ was awakened and sensed their \nfear, He stretched out His arms and quelled the seas and the winds and \neverything around them became peaceful and calm once again.\n  Our lives are often like that. We see the storm clouds and the very \nreal rough winds and seas that seem like they will batter and demolish \nthe little boat of our life. The thought can often leave us feeling \nvery afraid of what is to become of us. In those moments, Dr. Ogilvie \nwas a constant reminder that the strength of God was never far off, and \nwe were never far from Him. All we needed to do was to imitate Christ, \nstretch out our arms to God and listen for the peace and calm that is \nalways within us. That is God's gift to the troubled and confused and \nit always lies within us, in the depths of our hearts and souls. \nAnother of God's gifts was surely Dr. Ogilvie, who has a wonderful \ntalent of helping us to find that small, still place in ourselves where \nwe can find the peace, strength and comfort of God for those times when \nlife seems unfair and our boat feels adrift and lost in the turbulent \nseas of the world.\n  After coming to know Dr. Ogilvie over the years, and seeing him in \nprayer with my staff, and so many others, I have no doubt that a book \nabout our Chaplain and the many ways he has made a difference in our \nlives would be a very thick one. Every office, and every staff has at \nleast a handful of stories about Dr. Ogilvie and the difference he made \nin their day or their lives just by being available and joining in \nprayer--or by being there to listen. To those who are fortunate enough \nto know him, he has been more than a Chaplain to us--he has been a \ntrusted friend who could always be relied on for a good word of advice \nor to help with an idea or suggest a different approach to a problem.\n  We all know that all prayers are answered, it is just a difficult \nthing when the answer we pray for isn't the one we receive. Through the \nyears, Dr. Ogilvie helped so many of our staff members through the \nstorms of their own lives and he did so with great humility, kindness \nand a gentleness of spirit.\n  As I thought about the problems faced by my staff, I remembered the \nmother of one of my staff members who has a problem with pain. When he \nfound out about it, Dr. Ogilvie called her and personally expressed his \nsupport for her and his intention to keep her in his prayers. It meant \na lot to his mother and to my staff member to know just how much he \ncould count on and rely on the Chaplain for help.\n  Another member of my staff had just received the devastating news \nthat both of her parents were ill and facing a crisis in their health. \nAgain, Dr. Ogilvie offered his prayers, his support and his spiritual \nstrength for the battle. When a miracle came to pass and both parents \nrecovered, he was there to express the joy and happiness that he found \nin another's victory. As the old adage says so well, each person's joy \nwas his own.\n  Another staff member's wife was battling cancer. Dr. Ogilvie was \nthere again to support and encourage as he prayed with them and helped \nthem to face and battle the illness together.\n  Those are just a few examples of a long list that I could put \ntogether of the times when Dr. Ogilvie joined us in prayer, silently \nand in the background, helping to strengthen the ties between us and \nthe Lord--because, as he said in his mission statement--it was more \nthan his job, it was his charge from God.\n  For my own office, we will never forget all that Dr. Ogilvie shared \nwith us when one of our staffers, a young man named Ben, faced the \nultimate crisis of his life.\n  Ben was a remarkable young man, someone you took a liking to as soon \nas you met him. He had a remarkable spirit that comes from being young \nand being convinced you can do pretty much anything you want to. I \ndon't think I've ever seen anyone at so young an age that was so full \nof promise and potential--mixed in with a lot of personality and \nspirit. We all knew when we met Ben that he was one colt that would be \nimpossible to break--but sometimes the spirited ones make the whole \nherd run better. Such was the case with Ben.\n  He had come to us in the middle of a battle with cancer and every day \nwe could sense his joy at the gift he was given of another day, another \nmoment of life. Every day he seemed to be getting better and stronger \nuntil one terrible day when he seemed to lose a lot of ground and \nstrength--all of a sudden. That was the day it started to seem clear \nthat he might lose his battle with cancer.\n  Each day, as Ben battled for his life, we battled to be heard as we \nprayed in earnest for his recovery. Although each passing day seemed to \nput that elusive goal further from us, we joined together with Dr. \nOgilvie in our prayers for a miracle. Sadly, we didn't get what we \nprayed for. I still remember the day we got the news we had come to \ndread but expect. Ben had passed away.\n  Once again, Dr. Ogilvie was with us, to comfort those of us who had \nlost a good friend, a hard working colleague, and an all around nice \nguy who had made a difference in all our lives. As we remembered our \npast years together many of us wondered why God had taken his future \nfrom him and from us at such a young and tender age.\n  Together with Dr. Ogilvie we prayed for answers to these and to all \nthe questions that haunt those who have lost a loved one.\n  Those answers will come from God at His own speed and at His own \ntime. For then, and for now, it was enough to have our good friend, Dr. \nOgilvie, lead us in prayer and provide the words that resonated in our \nhearts as he helped us find the strength and courage to support each \nother as we continued to reach out to his family as they mourned the \nloss of a special son.\n  Dr. Ogilvie never said this in his prayers or lectures, but it was so \nclear from the way he lives his life that he knows it's not about him--\nit's about his service and it's about our God. He is God's servant and \nhe continues to serve Him with great strength and an abundance of good \ncheer and good will. In many ways he's like a beacon of light that \nhelps to light the way we must walk to draw closer to God and His holy \nheaven.\n  One of the greatest preachers of our time was Billy Graham. When \nasked what made for a good preacher he said, ``The test of a preacher \nis that his congregation goes away saying, not,\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\n``What a lovely sermon!'' but ``I will do something.''\n  If that is the test, Dr. Ogilvie is one of the best. In fact, I don't \nthink there is a single one of us who met with Dr. Ogilvie to discuss a \nproblem who didn't leave feeling absolutely certain that he or she knew \nwhat to do and when to do it.\n  That was one of Dr. Ogilvie's great gifts. He could listen and \nprovide strength and support while he helped us all to find the answer \nthat was right for us--from the silence and peace that lies within our \nhearts.\n  God bless you, Dr. Ogilvie, for you certainly were a blessing to each \nof us while you were here.\n  I have always believed that God puts us where He needs us, where He \nwants us to be found. I have no doubt that He is doing that with you \nright now. Wherever you go from now on, and whatever path He chooses to \nhave you follow, I have no doubt you will continue to do a good job and \nrepresent well He who has sent you. As it teaches us in the Bible, \n``you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over \nmany things. Enter into the joy of your Lord.'' God bless you, Dr. \nOgilvie, and may you continue to find the joy of your Lord wherever you \ngo and in everyone you meet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3803-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TAYLOR AGATHEN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to Taylor Agathen, winner of the Conservation Art Contest. Over \n100,000 students ranging from first to fifth grade throughout the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky participated in the Conservation Art Contest. \nAs part of the Conservation Art Program, the contest's purpose is to \nteach students about the importance of soil conservation in their \ncommunities. This year's theme was ``Kentucky Soil . . . It touches all \nof us.''\n  Taylor's poster, titled, ``Kentucky Soil . . . it touches my life,'' \ndetailed erosion problems throughout Taylor County and ways to prevent \nit. Along with the help of her family, Taylor discovered that such ways \nto prevent erosion included the use of rocks, logs, and cement walls, \nand had pictures in her poster to prove it. It was a creative design \nthat underscored the need to address the erosion problems throughout \nour Commonwealth.\n  Taylor Agathen's first grade teacher, Ms. Laura Dickens, informed her \nof the Conservation Art Contest. As the first place recipient, Taylor \nwill receive a $500 savings bond and will be an honored guest at The \nCourier-Journal Awards Luncheon on May 22. She worked hard for this \nachievement and has earned these rewards. One day Taylor hopes to be a \nmarine biologist and I am sure she will make a good one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3803-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT CATAMOUNTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, today it is my honor to \nrecognize Michael Neil Nelson for his many years of dedicated and \nselfless service to the State of Nebraska.\n  Since 1992, Michael Nelson has worked for the Lincoln, NE Department \nof Housing and Urban Development. As a housing rehabilitation \nspecialist, he has aided hundreds of Lincoln families by rehabilitating \ntheir homes and improving their quality of life. Mr. Nelson has also \nassisted first-time home buyers in finding suitable housing for their \nfamilies, and has taught many homeowners how to maintain their \ninvestment and enhance the neighborhood.\n  Mr. Nelson was instrumental in establishing a Rebuilding Together \naffiliate organization in Lincoln. Rebuilding Together preserves and \nrevitalizes houses and communities, assuring that low-income \nhomeowners, particularly those who are elderly and disabled, and \nfamilies with children, live in warmth, safety, and independence. \nThrough this worthwhile initiative, Mr. Nelson spent countless hours \nrecruiting and organizing volunteers in our community. He worked \ntirelessly to secure donations from community members and often spent \nhis weekends arranging project publicity and outreach efforts.\n  Mr. Nelson has always viewed his job with housing initiatives as his \nway of improving our community. His construction management expertise, \ncoupled with his ability to connect with citizens, makes him a valuable \nasset to our community. His hard work was often noticed, and he \nreceived many accolades from his clients and awards from the city for \ngoing above and beyond his responsibilities.\n  I am proud to represent Nebraskans like Michael Nelson who are \ncommitted public servants. Volunteer services are an essential part of \ncommunities. The selfless efforts of committed citizens like Mr. Nelson \nmake our communities a better place to live and improve the quality of \nlife for our neighbors. The city of Lincoln and State of Nebraska are \nfortunate to have Michael Nelson as a member of their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3803-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3803-S3804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. WYDEN:\n       S. 629.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to assist \nindividuals who have lost their 401(k) savings to make additional \nretirement savings through individual retirement account contributions, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over a year ago the greed of some senior \nexecutives at the Enron corporation finally caught up with them. \nEnron's financial house of cards began to tumble, and along with it \nwent the pensions and retirement dreams of thousands of employees and \ninvestors. Among the employees whose pensions were crushed in Enron's \naccounting avalanche were nearly all of Portland General Electric, or \nPGE's 2,700 employees in Oregon.\n  Enron took over PGE in June of 1997, and two years later merged the \nPGE employee 401(k) retirement plan into a single plan. That plan \nallowed employees to contribute up to 15 percent of their income, with \nthe company matching in Enron stock. When Enron took over PGE in 1997, \nPGE's stock was trading at $27 a share; three years after the merger, \nEnron stock was trading at $85 a share, enticing employees to invest \n100 percent of their 401(k) money in Enron stock.\n  Enron's stock had begun to slide in August 2001, and it was not until \nOctober that real panic set in. At that time the captains of the Enron \nship knew it was sinking. In an effort to prevent a massive stock sell-\noff, senior executives on the deck locked workers in the boiler room, \npreventing them from selling off 401(k) shares while they dumped their \nown. By the time the pension lockdown ended, an Enron share was worth \nless than ten dollars. In early December, Enron filed for bankruptcy.\n  Earlier this year Congress enacted significant corporate \naccountability legislation so that executives and accountants can no \nlonger use certified financial statements to play a game of financial \nhide-and-seek. But little was done for the workers who were locked in \nthe boiler room. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing today, \nthe ``Catch-Up Retirement Savings Act,'' is to give those PGE employees \nwho were harmed by the greed of Enron executives the opportunity to \ncatch-up on some of their lost retirement. My bill does two things to \nhelp workers. First, it allows employees to triple the deductible \namount they may otherwise contribute to an IRA, and second, it gives \nemployees a 50 percent tax credit on the amount they contribute to \ntheir IRA. The tax incentives would be available for five years to \nemployees whose employer filed for bankruptcy and who was the subject \nof an indictment or conviction resulting from business transactions \nrelated to such case, and whose employer matched at least 50 percent of \nthe employee's contributions to the pension plan.\n  No act of Congress can ever respond fully to the egregious harm that \nhas been caused to thousands of Oregonians by the collapse of Enron. \nBut I believe that something must be done to help recoup some of the \nlost pension savings. The ``Catch-Up Lost Retirement Savings Act'' is a \nsmall but important step that Congress should take to help employees to \nbegin to catch-up on their retirement savings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a chart be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and chart were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na study of the San Gabriel River Watershed, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be re-introducing today a \nbill that will take an important first step in restoring the San \nGabriel River, which runs through Los Angeles, CA. During the 107th \nCongress, this bill received unanimous support from the House of \nRepresentatives and from the Senate as part of an omnibus California \nParks bill. However, due to a technical error, unrelated to this \nlegislation, the bill was never sent to the President. I am hopeful \nthat this legislation will quickly receive the consideration it \ndeserves so it can be enacted into law.\n  The San Gabriel River has suffered from years of abuse and neglect \nand needs our help. For far too long, we have channeled, redirected, \nconstricted, polluted, and simply ignored it. The result is that \nsubstantial portions of the river look nothing like its natural form. \nInstead of soft bottoms covered with aquatic grasses, stream banks \nlined with trees and bushes, and waters teaming with fish, these rivers \nhave cement bottoms, cement banks, and little remaining wildlife.\n  Today, we begin what will be a long, slow process in turning the tide \nfor this urban watershed. This bill directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to conduct a study of the San Gabriel River watershed to \nconsider various mechanisms for providing federal protection and \nassistance to this river and its watershed.\n  It is particularly important to restore the San Gabriel River so it \ncan serve as a source of outdoor recreation for one of our Nation's \nmost congested urban areas. Most communities in Los Angeles are \ndesperate for open space. They seek outdoor areas where children can \nplay, adults can meet, and people of all ages can find respite from the \ndaily hustle and bustle of some of our most economically and socially \nstressed neighborhoods. The San Gabriel River system can and should \nprovide that to them.\n  This vision is shared by Congresswoman Hilda Solis, who first \nintroduced this bill in the House of Representatives in the last \nCongress. I look forward to working with her on passing this bill \nquickly and then taking the additional steps needed to restore the San \nGabriel River.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 633. A bill to modify the contract consolidation requirements in \nthe Small Business Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be re-introducing \nlegislation, the ``Small Business Federal Contractor Safeguard Act,'' \ndesigned to protect the interests of small businesses in the Federal \nmarketplace.\n  Currently as the Ranking Member, and last Congress as Chairman, of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nfocused a considerable amount of energy on increasing the role of small \nbusinesses in the Federal marketplace. Not only is it an issue of \nfairness, but it is in the best interest of our economy and our \nnational security. In fact, the Small Business Administration was \ncreated after World War II to ensure that small businesses would be \nviable for defense-related production, to build a diverse pool of \nsuppliers so that the country would not be dependent on only a handful \nof companies. As this country prepares for war in Iraq and continues \nthe on-going war on terrorism, we should be improving that viability \nand expanding that diverse pool. We should be increasing our business \nwith small business, not reducing it.\n  It is no secret that the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship places a great deal of importance on moving \nlegislation forward in a bipartisan manner--the members of my Committee \nunderstand we represent the interests of all of our nation's small \nbusinesses, the most important and dynamic segment of our economy. And \nnowhere is the bipartisan consensus stronger than in the area of \nFederal procurement and ensuring that our nation's small businesses \nreceive their fair share of procurement opportunities.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has one ultimate purpose, to \nprevent Federal agencies from circumventing small business protections \nwith regard to the practice known as contract bundling. Few issues have \nso strongly galvanized the small businesses contacting community as the \npractice of contract bundling, which occurs when procurement contracts \nare combined to form large contracts, often spread over large \ngeographic areas, and results in minimal or no small business \nparticipation.\n  Many supporters of the practice of contract bundling point to its \ncost savings--they claim it saves the taxpayer money to lump contracts \ntogether. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting this \nclaim, and too many contracts are bundled without the required economic \nresearch designed to determine if a bundled contract will actually \nresult in a cost savings.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  The SBA's Office of Advocacy, an independent body within the SBA, \nestimated that for every increase of 100 bundled contracts, there was a \ndecrease of over 106 individual contracts issued to small firms. For \nevery $100 awarded on a bundled contract, there was a decrease of $33 \nto small business. This cost small businesses an estimated $13 billion \nin 2001. The Office of Advocacy arrived at these conclusions using a \nconservative definition of what constitutes a bundled contract. \nTherefore, the negative impact on small businesses from contract \nbundling is likely more severe.\n  While seemingly an efficient and cost-effective means for Federal \nagencies to conduct business, bundled contracts are anti-competitive. \nAnd they are anti-small business. When a Federal agency bundles \ncontracts, it limits small businesses' ability to bid for the new \nbundled contract, thus limiting competition. Small businesses are \nconsistently touted as more innovative, providing better and cheaper \nservices than their larger counterparts. But when forced to bid for \nmega-contracts, at times across large geographic areas, few, if any, \nsmall businesses can be expected to compete. By driving small business \nfrom the Federal marketplace, contract bundling will actually drive up \nthe costs of goods and services purchased by the Federal government \nbecause competition will be limited and our economy will be deprived of \npossible innovations brought about by small businesses.\n\n  While there are current laws in place intended to require Federal \nagencies to conduct market research before bundling a contract, \nloopholes in the current definition of a bundled contract allow them to \noften skirt these safeguards.\n  Our legislation changes the name ``bundled contract'' to \n``consolidated contract,'' strengthens the definition of a consolidated \ncontract, and closes the loopholes in the existing definition to \nprevent Federal agencies from circumventing statutory safeguards \nintended to ensure that separate contracts are consolidated for \neconomic reasons, not administrative expediency.\n  The new definition relies on a simple premise: if you combine \ncontracts, be it new contracts, existing contracts or a combination \nthereof, you are consolidating them and would need to take the \nnecessary steps to ensure it is justified economically before \nproceeding.\n  Our legislation also alters the current Small Business Act \nrequirements regarding procurement strategies when a contract is \nconsolidated to include a threshold level for triggering the economic \nresearch requirements.\n  Previously, any consolidated contract would trigger the economic \nresearch requirements, something considered onerous by many Federal \nagencies and often cited as the reason for circumventing the law. The \nnew procurement strategies section of the Small Business Act would \nrequire a statement of benefits and a justification for any \nconsolidated contract over $2 million and a more extensive analysis, \ncorresponding to current requirements for any consolidated contract, \nfor consolidations over $5 million.\n  In order to move forward with a consolidated contract over $2 \nmillion, the agency must put forth the benefits expected from the \ncontract, identify alternatives that would involve a lesser degree of \nconsolidation and include a specific determination that the \nconsolidation is necessary and justified. The determination that a \nconsolidation is necessary and justified may be determined simply \nthrough administrative and personnel savings, but there must be actual \nsavings.\n  In order to move forward with a consolidated contract over $5 \nmillion, an agency must, in addition to the above: conduct current \nmarket research to demonstrate that the consolidation will result in \ncosts savings, quality improvements, reduction in acquisition times, or \nbetter terms and conditions; include an assessment as to the specific \nimpediments to small business participation resulting from the \nconsolidation; and specify actions designed to maximize small business \nparticipation as subcontractors and suppliers for the consolidated \ncontract. The determination that a consolidation is necessary and \njustified may not be determined through administrative and personnel \nsavings alone unless those savings will be substantial for these larger \ncontracts.\n  By establishing this dual-threshold system, we have placed the \nemphasis for the economic research on contracts more likely to preclude \nsmall business participation, while not ceding smaller contracts to the \nwhims of a Federal agency. This change, coupled with a clear definition \nof a consolidated contract, should be enough to garner compliance. \nHowever, if Federal agencies continue to consolidate contracts when \nthere is no justification, fail to conduct the required economic \nresearch, or fail to provide procurement opportunities to small \nbusinesses, the Committee would have little choice but to consider \nlegislative changes requiring punitive measures for these Federal \nagencies. This is a step I have been reluctant to take in the past. \nHowever, I am optimistic that such a step will not be necessary and \nthat the fair and reasonable system established under this legislation \nwill be effective.\n  I would once again like to thank my fellow sponsors, Senators \nLandrieu, Stabenow, Cantwell, and Pryor for their continued support on \nthis issue. I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nbill. I ask that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to carry out a study on the feasibility of \ndesignating the Trail of the Ancients as a national historic trail; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to help \nhighlight and protect sites in one of our Nation's most \narchaeologically rich regions, the Four Corners. The Trail of the \nAncients National Historic Trail Act of 2003 would amend the National \nTrails System Act to direct a study of the suitability of designating \nthe Trail of the Ancients as a national historic trail.\n  The Trail of the Ancients National Historic Trail would become a \nmultistate, auto route featuring world-renowned examples of Ancestral \nPuebloan cultures in the Four Corners area. The Ancestral Puebloans, \nalso known as Anasazi, preceded today's Navajo and Ute tribes. The \nTrail of the Ancients connects many of the most significant Ancestral \nPuebloan sites in the Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and \nNew Mexico.\n  The Four Corners region in the Southwestern United States is one of \nthe areas of greatest archaeological interest in the Nation. The Trail \nof the Ancients National Historic Trail would provide improved access \nto and understanding of this region's numerous examples of the \nAncestral Puebloan culture. The history of the Four Corners region is \nnot only unique and important to the Nation, it is unparalleled in how \nwell it is preserved in the remaining archaeological sites. The semi-\narid climate of the Four Corners area has helped preserve some the \narchaeological sites beyond what is typically seen in most other areas \nof the United States. International recognition of a number of the \nsites in the area has contributed to the wealth of information about \nthe peoples who lived in them.\n  The Trail would highlight areas and sites where our Nation's earliest \ninhabitants, the Paleo Americans, traveled and lived as early as 10,000 \nB.C. Within the same region lived the Ancestral Puebloan Indians from \nabout A.D. 1 to 1300. The Trail would also feature sites that chronicle \nthe existence of today's Ute Indian culture from the early 13th \ncentury, as well as today's Navajo people.\n  I point out that the Trail of the Ancients National Historic Trail \nwould include only existing routes and roads, and would not require the \nacquisition of additional property. Currently, much of the existing \nroute is officially designated a Scenic Byway in Utah, Colorado, and \nArizona. The trail also intersects and shares stops with other \nnational- and State-designated byways and highways including the San \nJuan Skyway in Colorado and the Utah Bicentennial Highway.\n  Most of the existing cultural and historical interpretation of the \nnumerous sites along the trail was developed independently. Designation \nof the Trail of the Ancients National Historic Trail would link many of \nthe cultural and recreation areas for the benefit of the traveling \npublic and involved communities. Just as importantly, designation as a \nnational historic trail would provide a unified framework for \nprotecting and interpreting for the public the trail's most important \nsites.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation today. This bill would \nauthorize the study of the Trail of the Ancients for possible inclusion \nin the National Trails System and allow for its precious and \nirreplaceable sites to be best protected, as well as enjoyed by the \npublic.\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 636. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a permanent increase in medicare payments for home health \nservices that are furnished in rural areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Home \nHealth Payment Fairness Act, which would extend the 10 percent add-on \npayment under Medicare for home health care services in rural areas \nthat is currently scheduled to sunset on April 1. This legislation \nwould help to ensure seniors and disabled citizens living in rural \nAmerica continue to receive the home health care benefits and services \nthey depend on and deserve.\n  Health care in this country has gone full circle. Patients are \nspending less time in the hospital. More and more procedures are being \ndone on an outpatient basis and recovery and care for patients with \nchronic diseases and conditions have increasingly been taking place in \nthe home. As a consequence, home health care has become an increasingly \nimportant part of our health care. The kinds of highly skilled and \noften technically complex services our Nation's home health nurses \nprovide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable senior \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay where they want \nto be, in the security, privacy, and comfort of their very own homes.\n  I have visited home health patients throughout my State in northern, \ncentral, and southern Maine. Regardless of where they live, the impact \nof home health care on their lives has been the same. It has made the \ndifference between couples staying together in their own home for their \ngolden years, despite the ill health of one of the spouses, or being \nforced prematurely into a nursing home or into repeated \nhospitalizations.\n  One elderly gentleman told me all he wanted was to live out the \nremaining days of his life with his wife, whom he had been married to \nfor decades, and that home health care allowed them to be together in \nthe home where they had always lived, as he completes his final years.\n  Home health care is also a bargain. It makes a great deal of sense to \ncare for people in their own homes and avoid the extra costs of nursing \nhomes and hospitalization. Our home health care system is fragile. \nExtension of the 10 percent add-on payment for rural home\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nhealth care agencies will help to ensure that patients living in rural \ncommunities continue to have access to vital home health services. \nSurveys have shown the delivery of home health services in rural areas \ncan be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the extra \ntravel time required to cover long distances between patients, higher \ntransportation expenses, and other cost factors.\n  Rural agencies also experience higher costs relative to productivity. \nBecause of the longer travel distances, rural caregivers are unable to \nperform as many visits in a single day as their urban counterparts. \nSaundra Scott-Adams, the Executive Director of Visiting Nurses of \nAroostook in northern Maine, tells me her agency covers 6,600 square \nmiles to serve a population of only 73,000. Her costs are \nunderstandably much higher and her hard-working nurses are not able to \nsee as many patients in a day as their urban counterparts. The long \ndistances they must drive mean they are able to see fewer patients each \nday.\n  Moreover, agencies in rural areas are frequently smaller than their \nbig city counterparts, which means their relative costs are higher due \nto smaller scale operations and an ability to take advantage of \neconomies of scale. Smaller agencies with fewer patients and fewer \nvisits mean that fixed costs, particularly those associated with \nmeeting regulatory requirements, are spread over a smaller number of \npatients and visits, increasing overall per-patient and per-visit \ncosts. If the rural add-on payment is eliminated on April 1, it will \nonly put more pressure on our rural home health agencies that are \nalready operating on a very narrow margin, and it could, in fact, force \nsome of these agencies to close.\n  Some agencies operating in rural areas are the only home health \nproviders for a vast geographic area. If any of these agencies are \nforced to close, the Medicare patients in that region will completely \nlose their access to home health care.\n  Earlier this year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission voted \nunanimously to extend the rural add-on payment for home health services \nfor one year. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation to ensure that all of our seniors, no matter \nwhere they live, whether they live in big cities, in suburbs, or the \nsmallest communities, continue to have access to quality home health \nservices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3809-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 90--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n SENATE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE NONPROLIFERATION PROGRAMS OF THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. BYRD (for himself, and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I thank the \nbudget chairman for his consideration. He is doing a great job. This is \nthe first year he has assumed responsibility as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. In that position, he has expressed a willingness to work \nwith all members of the Budget Committee and work with Members of the \nSenate to get a budget out of the Senate. I commend him for that \neffort.\n  I think it was extremely disappointing not only to me but to the \nAmerican people that last year we did not get a budget passed. That is \nthe first thing that has to happen. If we want to see this process move \nforward in an orderly manner, we need to pass a budget.\n  I rise today to make a few comments relating to the budget resolution \nthat is before us. This resolution, in my view, is one of the most \nimportant, only next to the legislation committing and supporting our \nArmed Forces, which is perhaps the most important the Congress will \nconsider.\n  As my colleagues know, the budget resolution establishes the \nframework by which Congress will appropriate funds over the next year \nand it sets a model for the future. Further, this resolution will \nestablish a series of important mechanisms for the enforcement of \nbudget policy and outline important policy priorities to be ultimately \ndetermined by other Senate committees.\n  I serve on the Senate Budget Committee, and I will take this \nopportunity to comment on the pending resolution, as well as a number \nof important choices facing this body as we proceed with this debate.\n  I will make a few comments on the current climate. I have stated \nnumerous times in recent years that continual increases in \ndiscretionary spending threaten the long-term fiscal stability of the \nGovernment and doom the taxpayer to greater long-term obligations. The \nslim window of historic surpluses we experienced in Washington from \n1998 through 2001 sparked a rapid spending spree, unlike virtually any \nthis Nation has ever experienced.\n  From the year 2000 to 2003, the Federal Government will have spent \nmore than in any other 4-year period in the last 60 years, excluding \nthe war years of World War II. When compared to the previous 4 years, \n1996 to 1999, the Government has increased spending by a startling $782 \nbillion, The 4-year cost per household of the Federal Government \nreaching $73,000. This reckless spending represents irresponsibility in \nthe short term and far worse in the long term.\n\n  Today our Nation stands in the midst of a war on terror and on the \nbrink of a costly engagement with the savage totalitarian Government of \nIraq. These are conflicts that this country did not ask for but \nobligations we must meet. Today's international landscape demands \nnothing less than total commitment to our Armed Forces. I am pleased \nthis budget resolution meets that commitment. I would go one step \nfurther and state clearly the defense of the homeland and the \nprotection of American interests is the paramount responsibility of the \nFederal Government in this Republic.\n  By abandoning fiscal restraint and discretionary spending over the \nlast 4 years, we have not only continued to bleed current and future \ntaxpayers but created enormous fiscal obstacles to the prosecution of \nthis Nation's defense.\n  I will speak briefly on defense and the war on terror. The budget \nresolution reported by the committee provides for $400 billion for \ndefense in fiscal year 2004. That is meeting the President's request \nfor the continued aggressive prosecution of our war against terror \naround the world. The full amount of the President's request for \nHomeland Security is also included, the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, growing from $21.3 billion in 2003 to $27.1 billion in 2004. \nThese dollars will go to the securing of our borders, the training and \nsupply of first responders, bioterrorism preparedness, and increased \ninteragency coordination. I can think of no greater priority in these \ntroubled times.\n  In talking about the growth package and the tax cuts, perhaps the \narea of the budget which will face the greatest scrutiny this week will \nbe the reconciliation instruction for the President's proposed growth \npackage. This resolution provided for $698 billion from 2003 through \n2013 for growth, job creation, and tax relief. I support the \nPresident's approach to this growth proposal: Mixing tax relief \ntargeted to working families, encouraging investment by the small \nbusiness sector--which, I might add, is the backbone of this economy in \nthis country--and eliminating the double taxation of dividends.\n  A number of colleagues made clear they do not believe this package \nwill stimulate the economy and insist the most stimulative effect would \nbe through increased spending. This is not only an argument I fail to \nembrace, it is one I find dangerous in light of the incredible recent \nincreases in spending that have proven ineffective in changing the \neconomy.\n  Today, Federal revenues are down for the second consecutive year. \nThat is an unprecedented decrease. The Nasdaq stands at one-quarter of \nits value just 3 years ago. To those who claim that the Federal \nGovernment can spend its way out of such conditions, stimulating growth \nby absorbing more of America's paycheck, I ask where the evidence is \nthat this, indeed, works.\n  As I stated earlier, Congress has added $782 billion in spending over \nthe last 4 years. In light of the sum of this regrettable spending \nspree, the President proposes a rather humble growth package over the \ncourse of the next 10 years. The amount provided in this resolution \naccommodates the acceleration of several key tax cuts already \nimplemented into law such as the marriage penalty tax and the cut in \nmarginal income tax rates. Further, there is room in this package to \nincrease the child tax credit and increase small business expensing \nlimits. These are very real ways to allow working Americans to keep \nmore of their money, and to do so starting today. I trust they will \nknow best what to do with these savings and can see only beneficial \nstimulus.\n\n  With regard to the dividend proposal, the resolution also \naccommodates the President's desire to cut one of the Tax Code's most \negregious examples of double taxation, that tax placed on corporate \ndividends. It is unfortunate that\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\ndividend taxation is an area where the United States is a world leader, \ntaxing dividends at a rate higher than any nation in the world other \nthan Japan. I would like to be clear on the nature of this tax. It is a \ntax on capital. It makes capital more expensive. It makes doing \nbusiness more expensive. Capital can be used far better by those \ninnovating and investing in the private sector rather than through \nexpanding government largess.\n  The Wall Street Journal outlined the benefits of this proposal in a \nFebruary 26 article. The Wall Street Journal reports that the dividend \nproposal would increase job creation by as many as 500,000 jobs per \nyear over the next 5 years. That is an immediate and wonderful economic \nstimulus. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently testified \nbefore Congress in support of the elimination of the double taxation of \ndividends as ``a benefit to virtually everyone in the economy over the \nlong run.''\n  Some in this body disagree with Mr. Greenspan and will attempt to \nwheel out their tired old incredible rhetoric by labeling this a tax \ncut for the rich. A half million more jobs is not a tax cut for the \nrich. I hope our dialog will be sophisticated enough to recognize this.\n  Let me talk a little bit about our domestic priorities. I am pleased \nto share President Bush's commitment to a number of domestic priorities \nreflected in this budget. As a long-time advocate of a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, I am glad to see an investment of $400 \nbillion over 10 years to strengthen Medicare. This unprecedented \ninvestment includes a prescription drug benefit for our Nation's \nseniors, allowing equity and access to the latest and most beneficial \ndrugs on the market. The $400 billion will also be available for the \nimprovement and modernization of Medicare, catastrophic coverage, and \nassistance to low-income beneficiaries. The President has made clear \nthis is not simply another step in the expansion of the Medicare \nProgram but a call for reform and enhanced efficiency.\n  With the pending retirement of the baby boom generation, it is more \nimportant than ever that Medicare be built on a strong foundation and \noffer the most effective treatments possible. This budget follows in \nthe bold footsteps of the No Child Left Behind Act, continuing the \ncommitment made with that landmark legislation. This budget resolution \noffers the single largest ever financial support for education in \nAmerica, going above and beyond the President's request. Title I grants \nto local education agencies will increase by $1 billion. The \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act will see a $1 billion \nincrease in part (B) grants to States, with additional funds available \nif a reauthorization bill is enacted that authorizes those additional \nfunds.\n  Now to enforcing our budget discipline. Last September, the historic \nBudget Enforcement Act expired. This lapse, along with the inability of \nthe Senate to pass a budget resolution and 11 of 13 appropriations \nbills, meant the loss of significant controls on Federal spending. The \nresolution before the Senate today seeks to correct this failure and \nrestores some budget discipline to the process. The resolution contains \nenforceable, discretionary budget caps for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and \n2005 consistent with the funding levels outlined by President Bush. \nThis resolution also reinstates the 60-vote point of order against \nadvanced appropriations as well as targeting nondefense emergency \nappropriations with a similar point of order. Perhaps the most \nimportant of all, the budget contains an extension of the pay-go point \nof order to limit unbudgeted mandatory spending increases over revenue \ndecreases.\n  Budget discipline has long been an area of keen interest to me, and I \nhave to say I appreciate Chairman Nickles' commitment to enforcement, \nalthough I hope we will continue to work toward establishing greater \ncontrols in spending.\n  Then a word about dynamic scoring: From a process standpoint, I am \nalso very interested in expanding this discussion to include dynamic \nscoring. As my colleagues are aware, the Congressional Budget Office, \nvarious committees, and the administration generally rely on what is \nreferred to as static scoring. That is, that legislation and revenue \ndecreases are scored in terms of costs to the Federal Government, \nwithout factoring in the yield to the Government of the economic \nstimulus generated by that policy change.\n  There are a number of States that have implemented dynamic scoring, \nincluding the State of California; and 40 States incorporate the \nprinciples of dynamic scoring in their budget calculation because they \nunderstand that it truly reflects what happens in the real world. That \nis why I am such an advocate of dynamic scoring, a process which I \nthink reflects what will happen in the real world as a consequence of \nour budget.\n  Earlier, I spoke of the dynamic benefit of the elimination of double \ntaxation of dividends by quoting the Wall Street Journal and Chairman \nGreenspan. Mr. Greenspan, the Journal, the Heritage Foundation, and \nothers have vociferously asserted that this proposal will lead to more \njobs and, thus, the generation of more wage hours and taxes paid. Even \nthe Clinton administration Director of OMB agrees there is some \nstimulus effect. Despite this highly credible choir of proponents, I \ncannot as yet, to date, propose a dynamic scoring for this proposal \nproduced by this Congress because it doesn't reflect what happens in \nthe real world. The proposed growth package is a perfect example of the \nneed for dynamic scoring to be incorporated into this process.\n  Is it so ridiculous to think that we could calculate the impact this \npackage would have on job creation, increases in disposable income and \nsavings, and even a return on Federal revenues due to economic \nactivity?\n  Let me go to the chart to reemphasize my point. I have here a chart \nwhich reflects what will happen to additional job creation with the \nPresident's stimulus package.\n  The blue part of the bars on this chart reflects what would happen to \nour economy if we did not change the law at all, if we stayed just the \nway we are. On top of that, you will see the orange part of the bar, \nwhich reflects additional jobs that would be created with the \nPresident's economic growth package. An important part of that package \nis eliminating the double taxation on dividends.\n  So, after 2004, 2005, as we move on out to 2008, we see that there is \na substantial increase in the number of additional jobs.\n  It is nice to talk about additional jobs. What does it do as far as \nmoney in Americans' pockets, in order to help the economy grow? The \nnext chart shows the additional disposable income. This is the total \namount of disposable income that would be available to Americans as we \ncreate these jobs through the President's job stimulus package, his \neconomic stimulus package.\n  The blue line again reflects what would happen if we did not change \nany of the current law. The orange part of those bars reflects the \nadditional growth that would happen as a result of us passing the \nPresident's stimulus package. I think this is significant additional \ndisposable income. That means Americans will have more money in their \npockets to spend, businesses would have more money in their checkbooks \nin order to buy new equipment and create jobs. It is a job stimulus \npackage that we need today. We don't need it 3 years from now; we need \nit today, and I do hope we can move ahead.\n\n  Using the dynamic scoring model generated by the Heritage Foundation \nCenter for Data Analysis, we can see the President's proposal generates \na significant amount of growth in the economy and, in fact, gets far \nmore bang for the buck than any increase in spending or Government \nhandout. Current baseline projections for total employment forecast an \nunemployment rate of 5.4 percent in 2004. Incorporating the dynamic \nscoring method of measurement, we can see that would lower the rate to \n4.9 percent, or an addition of 997,000 jobs to the economy.\n  In my home State of Colorado, more than 16,000 more jobs would be \ncreated in 2004 alone. I have a piece of paper here with me that \nreflects the amount of job growth we can expect in each State \nindividually. For example, we can go to Alabama, the State of Senator \nSessions. We heard his comments. There is a growth in 2004 of 15,100 \njobs. Over the 5-year period, it is going to be an average growth of \n13,840 jobs per\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\nyear, based on the President's economic growth plan. If we look at the \nPresident's stimulus package, what effect will it have?\n  We can look to Kentucky, for example. The Presiding Officer \nunderstands Kentucky. With the President's growth package we can \nexpect, in 2004, 13,900 new jobs with an average over the years up to \n2008 of 12,720 new jobs each year.\n  I have how this will impact each individual State as we move through \nthe years. It is important that we pass the President's job stimulus \nplan.\n  I have been in Washington long enough to know better than to take job \nforecasts and predictions as gospel, but I also know that any policy \nthat can potentially increase employment by almost a million jobs in 1 \nyear simply must be considered.\n  I believe it is expected we at least try. There are individuals who \nsay we should not do anything on economic growth and stimulus. I think \nthat is the wrong approach. I think the American people expect some \naction to happen out of the Senate.\n  There are those who say maybe we ought to just do increased spending. \nMany of my friends on the other side of the aisle are promoting an \neconomic growth stimulus package that puts emphasis on more spending. \nMy response to that is, if spending is the answer, with all the \nspending that has happened in the last 4 years, why isn't our economy \ngrowing?\n  I think we have one thing we could do, that we should try at least, \nin order to stimulate that economy. I think we need to cut taxes. We \nneed to cut taxes to stimulate the part of the economy that is most \nadversely affected, and that is the business sector of our economy, the \nsmall business sector--the double taxation of dividends. I have had one \naccountant tell me if we eliminate the double taxation on dividends, \nthey are going to be recommending changes in the way that small \nbusiness is organized and how they can do it in a way that will save \nmoney and bring money into the small business sector.\n  I believe we must do more than just complain and criticize but come \nup with a plan of action. I see no plan of action from my colleagues \nopposing this proposal. Americans deserve to hear alternative plans and \nnot just suggestions of negativity without action.\n  I will bring my comments to a conclusion by simply stating I think \nthis is a good budget proposal that is before us. I think it accounts \nfor the President's economic stimulus package. Considering the \ncondition of the Nation today, we need to pass an economic stimulus \npackage. It addresses the immediate needs of defending this country as \nwe are on the brink of moving into conflict. I think it is a reasonable \nbudget. So standing here on the floor of the Senate, I express my \nsupport and hope the Members of the Senate will pass this budget \nbecause we need to have a budget this year.\n\n  Having concluded my remarks, I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/17/senate-section/article/S3813-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
